There must be a reason I survived the first time, right? Am I giving up my second chance?A while ago I attempted suicide by hanging. When I was discovered I had no heartbeat and they had to do CPR and shock me. I woke up a few days later in the ICU with a deep rope imprint on my neck and broken ribs. I was in the hospital for several months. I cannot fucking believe I survived that. If they had found me a minute later it may have been too late.

I still want to die. I want to do it to make sure I would not be stopped. But there is this tiny part of me that says maybe there is a reason I survived, some purpose I haven't yet fulfilled. I don't know...

In a way it makes me want death even more I felt the peace of death. I don't know why they couldn't just let me go.
