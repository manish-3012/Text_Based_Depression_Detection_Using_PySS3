fuck lifewanna give up, nothing makes sense. too much pressure on me, iâ€™m gonna crack. how tf they expect me to do all this school work when i donâ€™t even wanna be alive. they giving us more shit then when we were in school irl and itâ€™s harder now bc weâ€™re not actually learning, just submitting before 11:59. donâ€™t even be submitted shit. itâ€™s my fourth week and iâ€™m already failing some classes. i think i might be trans or something and my dad is being really hard on me. i think he knows bc iâ€™m acting kind of weird bc my body is changing and itâ€™s upsetting me quite a lot. iâ€™m trying to hide it but itâ€™s like everything i do he comments about how itâ€™s wrong for my gender. i havenâ€™t harmed myself in 5 months and i feel like i might fall back into that habit or just kill my self all together. iâ€™m in so much pain right now i canâ€™t even describe. my brain feels like someone threw a bunch of files down on the ground of it and lit it on fire. iâ€™m also getting fat, eating is a bad coping method lol. every time i feel like i finally overcome my pain and get happy something just has to knock me off of the pedestal. i just canâ€™t keep going on any longer, it hurts and iâ€™m starting to feel physically sick because of my brain. if i think too hard i start to wanna throw up and i feel so so tired.
