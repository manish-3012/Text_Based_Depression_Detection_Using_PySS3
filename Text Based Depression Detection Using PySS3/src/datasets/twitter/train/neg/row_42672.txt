I need to talk..?It haunts me. I know death can't solve anything and painful and cost so much. But it's harder to live through the day doing productive thing

Up to recently, I still think, maybe friends and family don't need me. 

I also don't keep contact with my close friends from high school, since there is nothing to say, no more excuses to meet

I achieved nothing. Wasted my time. And hurt people when I tried to make the situation brighter but ended up saying something wrong 

Idk. 

Help?
