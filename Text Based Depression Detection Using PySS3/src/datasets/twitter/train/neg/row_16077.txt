Please help meI have depersonalization, which basically makes me feel surreal and detached from reality, luckily it's not 24/7 but it happens when I go outside as I get anxious as fuck, I just want to go out with friends lead a normal life but this fucking illness won't let me

I don't know what else to say. I need to make it stop
