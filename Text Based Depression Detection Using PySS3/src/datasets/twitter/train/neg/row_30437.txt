I made a post in DP/DRCheck my recent post its what I feel currently. Why does it matter if I die...we are a speck in this universe. We work and slave to society when in reality none of this fucking matters. Boosting egos, Getting money. Literally all of this shit is pointless. There's no reason to be alive. We are sheep we are nothing.
