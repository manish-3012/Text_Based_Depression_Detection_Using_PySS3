I finally, sincerely need them, but it appears ASH is broken now. This was meant for there.Hi internets. I'd like to think you and I have been kind to one another in this area over the last decade and some; thanks for your part in that. Today is different though - I am on my way one way or another and am desperate to minimize the collateral damage, and to feel safe on my way out. 

Right now I live in a city apartment - the only exits I've found are hanging and having to travel. Hanging sketches me out because I'd have to do it off my balcony where more people would see. I can travel back to my homestate where I can easily purchase suitable means, and in fact already have as much in storage someplace. But lately I can't tie my shoes or clean the catbox so getting my ass onto a plane, train, or automobile has been a stretch.

I had hoped you might help me refine my plans, but the rules have changed. I certainly won't be reading the PMs on this account as too-much-crazy is already one of my problems. So since this needed to happen for some reason and to make it not totally pointless: in the likely event of plan B for balcony tomorrow, I apologize with all my heart to those who see something hurtful to them, and I hope it helps that it was just a moment of peace in a different story, and all I have for them is love.

Bye.
