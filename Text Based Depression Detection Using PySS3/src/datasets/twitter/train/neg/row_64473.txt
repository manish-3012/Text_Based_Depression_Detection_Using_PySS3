I feel lonely, thoughts of suicide looming getting stronger every dayI moved to take care of my mother after college. She could barely pick things up and get out of bed. I was able to get work in IT from home traveling only a couple a times a year. It's been 5 years. I am 27 and depressed. I haven't learn to drive, I don't have family or friends to teach me. I don't get paid very much and not able to save a lot because of a series of emergencies. I use to be active and I gained weight now. My face &amp; teeth messed up being born prematurely with a cleft pallet.

I feel lonely every night. Lost interest in movies and games. I just want someone to hang out with me. My brother moved away after a big fight with my mother, I use to love playing video games, walking downtown, and watching movies. 

Thinking about putting a craigslist ad. Who wants to hang out with a socially awkward ugly broke guy who can't drive? Is there any service like this that is cheap? 

Thinking about suicide more often. It's getting hard to fight the pain of loneliness, I am not very strong anymore. Thinking about how I would do it. Hang myself with an extension cord? Drown myself in bath tub? Throw myself off 3 story apartment building? Guzzle down a thing of bleach?
