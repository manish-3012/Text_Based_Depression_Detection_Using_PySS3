So closeI'm ready to end it. I don't want to be here anymore. I just love my fiance so much that I can't stand the thought of hurting him. 

I just can't believe I'm a bad person for going to the hospital for a "severe kidney infection" as it ended up being. My dad says it's nothing. I wish it were genuinely going to take me out, but I guess I can. Earlier I came so close, I'm hurting so bad but my pain is nothing. I deserve to make it real, I burden everyone
