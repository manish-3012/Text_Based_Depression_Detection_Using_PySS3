No more answersGuys, being strong is great and it can conquer even the most complex adiversities. But being strong is like flexing a muscle, you can only flex it for so long and no matter how long you keep it flexed, eventually that muscle gives out. I've been strong for years. Hopeful for years. I've believed in God and I've been an atheist. I even prayed to the universe and have also considered praying to the devil to escape my prison. 
I am someone who's alone. I am someone who may never have the chance to co-exist with someone and share an intimate connection that only exist exclusively between two individuals. I have been in love, but have never loved and the reason is because some years back, I had an injury that effects the reproductive parts of myself. It's challenging to obtain erections and there isn't a cure for this injury. This directly effects my confidence and ability to make love. I am getting close with a girl who likes me and I have always liked her, but we can't even date and she'll never know why. She just thinks I'm playing her, but that couldn't be further from the truth. I could tell her my situation, but what girl wants to hear that? I wouldn't put her in such an awkward atmosphere. And of course, as time progresses, I have to sit there and witness, first hand, her interest fade as I continue to not make any moves even tho I want to so, so bad. It kills me. I'd rather be stabbed than to feel that pain.  I hope every single day that I can overcome the chains that stop me from pursuing happiness. I can't handle being alone every day, every night, every season, every year. Not to brag, but I'm so funny. I'm in shape, in my 20's, and have a full time job and a car..but for what?? For. What. I feel like a waste.
