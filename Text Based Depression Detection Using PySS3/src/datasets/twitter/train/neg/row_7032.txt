Just... tired. Running out of reasons to keep going.I don't really know where to begin and I've attempted to post here before but I never end up submitting anything. Once I start typing it comes out all wrong and ends up being just a mountain of text and I never feel like I've actually said anything. So, I'll try to keep it short and concise. 

Basically, I've been sad for a while, but I was drinking heavily and that made things better because at least I didn't have to feel. I had this amazing magical substance that gave me control over my emotions. Then my mom died and then within three months I got sober. I've had a couple "baby" relapses, but they weren't shit. I didn't feel better. It wasn't like before. Drinking didn't make me feel good. Nothing makes me feel good. Instead, I just get angry. I'm angry and I lash out at those closest to me.

But lately I've begun to feel this sense of overwhelming frustration. Towards everything. My friend's don't understand. I try to explain but then I just get told how I'm being ridiculous or irrational or how I "need to calm down." I don't enjoy anything anymore. I don't go out anymore. Being around my friends makes me angry. I feel like I can't explain my feelings in a way that will make them understand. So why bother? I treat my friends badly because I want them to feel as miserable as I do. Because then they would understand. I feel tired and defeated; a slave to my emotions. I'm getting locked into a state of constant bitterness. 

I just really need to know that someone understands.
