I'm already suicidal, but does it make sense to feel more suicidal if my income is in jeopardy?I'm disabled and get disability benefits. I don't mention this often online because it usually ends up starting an argument, or I get people calling me names. My disability is up for review, and while I'm positive they will still see that I'm disabled, I'm afraid that maybe the reviewer won't like me for some reason and say that there's nothing wrong with me. I know what you're going to say, no one would risk their reputation by lying, but you never know. If I am denied, then all of the incoming bills and being evicted from my home won't do much for my suicidal ideation. It'll just make me feel more buried. Why shouldn't I take the easy way out?
