Mental illness job seekers blogI'm worried this might violate the subreddit content, if so I apologize.

I  was wondering if anyone would appreciate a blog that help job seekers  with mental illness find work opportunities that accommodate their particular difficulties.

I have an opportunity to write creatively as part of my current role and wanted  to do something close to my heart and meaningful to the community.

I understand that many members of those communities I'm seeking advice  from do not regard their conditions as an illness which I respect. Apologies for any offense.
