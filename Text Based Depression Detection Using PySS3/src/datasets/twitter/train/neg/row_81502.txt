I just don't know anymore.I've been living with a constant sinking feeling inside for quite some time now, it's approaching two years. There have been quite a number of ups and downs in my life over this time. But I dunno. Every time a silver lining comes, an even bigger cloud comes over my life, raining a lot of shit down on me.

I've got people I care about, and people who care about me, yet I feel more isolated than ever. I've got a beautiful SO, but even with her, I still feel so alone, so unwanted, regardless of all those around me. I just don't connect mentally, you know?

Even with family, it sucks. My mother got diagnosed with cancer and she's now fighting it with chemotherapy. It should have brought my family together, but home doesn't feel the same anymore. There's a different feeling in the air. Everybody seems like they are sort of isolating themselves, including myself. It doesn't feel like home anymore. I'm alone here too.

It feels like I've got nowhere and nobody. I don't want to kill myself, but I think about it at least 15 times a day. I always plan out how I'm going to do it. I play around with my knife in bed at night, thinking I could just end it all here right now if I wanted to. But I'm not sure if I can bring myself to it. I know that people care about me, at least I think they do, but my mind tells me they don't. My mind is still alone... I want to go through with it, but I don't want to at the same time, you know?

I can't think straight anymore. I think something is wrong up there in my head, and I am scared.
