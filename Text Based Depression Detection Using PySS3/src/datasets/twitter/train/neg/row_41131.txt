Keep thinking about itI keep thinking about suicide. My life is empty and will be forever. Bad things have happened to me and worse things have latched on to me. I don't know what happens when you die, but it can't be worse. I need a reset button for life, which maybe we all need. Unfortunately it doesn't exist and certain institutions don't want people to reset their lives. They are incapable of forgiveness because they refuse to forget. Thanks for your time.
