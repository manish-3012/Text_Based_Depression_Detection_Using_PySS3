crashing downEverything in my life seems to be breaking apart. Me and my friend were planning on getting married but our parents found out before we could announce it to anyone and now her parents hate me and I'm not allowed to talk to her or visit her. I stayed in contact with her brother and recently started talking to her in secret. I even snuck over to her house the other night but nothing happened as her parents woke up and asked for her help with different things so I had to leave without being caught. Now she is being really distant and is afraid of us meeting up again. She says it's too risky. All my life it's just been one screw up after another and now she is asking me to not do anything if she marries someone else. Even though I promised her I wouldn't I don't know if that's a promise that I can keep. She wants to marry me but she wants the approval of her parents as well. Just another person in my life that is pushing me away. I can see the signs though. Its not the first time I've been dumped or cheated on. My mom took away my gun a couple of months ago but I don't need it. I found the perfect place where I can make it look like I just lost control of the car from driving too fast. simple case of not wearing a seatbelt but at night then there are never any cars there so no one else will get hurt. It will look like an accident and no one will be any wiser. But don't worry, I'm going to wait until she gets married and goes on a honeymoon or out of town for a time to where she wont be around for my funeral. I don't want her to be there.
