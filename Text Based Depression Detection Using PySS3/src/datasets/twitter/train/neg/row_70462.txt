Just ReadI dont want anyone to tell me that life has some sort of meaning, or that it will all get better soon. I just want oyu ti read this.

My entire Life i have been lonely. I only spend time in front of my computer playing videogames alone because i have noone to play with. Everytime i tried getting friends it all ended wih them hating me. I am a horrible human being that deserves death. I spend most of my time thinking about past decisions. I think that my free time is what fucks me up the most. Im only thinking about how stupid I am. I have fucked everything up. Im not very smart, and to be honest I would highly doubt that i am even slightly intelligent. Im Schizophrenic and suffer from severe depression. I have been in countless therapy sessions and i need to take a lot of medication. Nothing helped. To be honest, I think that it all has gone worse over time. Im often thinking about how im going to kill myself. To me the thought of killing myself isnt even a bad thought anymore. Its more off a normal thing to think about. I think its justified for me to kill myself. I am not afraid off death, the only thing that keeps me from doing it is a girl ive met. She is the most wonderful person on earth. But the thing is, i know that im going to fuck this up too. So what am I even hoping for? I cry a lot. Im not a manly person. Infact I cry so often I sometimes cant sleep because of it. I dont want to be alone anymore... I need somebody. Someone real. Not some random guy on the internet. But i dont deserve friends. Im a piece of shit. Im a liar and a traitor, am a Person you cant trust and I have done things that are unforgiveable. 

To anyone taking their time to read this poorly written post, I hope you have a better life than me.
