I canâ€™t imagine my future anymoreIâ€™m suicidal. I donâ€™t think I could ever go through with it as much as I want to but now Iâ€™ve moved my options suddenly become scarily available. Thereâ€™s a bridge about 10 minutes from where I live now and I canâ€™t get the idea of jumping off out of my mind. What doesnâ€™t help is as the title says I can no longer imagine a future. I canâ€™t even see myself being here at Christmas, my cousin is due to have a baby in November and I canâ€™t imagine meeting it. I canâ€™t really see myself being here at Halloween. Iâ€™m getting more and more hopeless as each day passes, the reasons to stay are rapidly disappearing and I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. I canâ€™t do this for much longer. Iâ€™m too broken to live but too scared to die.
