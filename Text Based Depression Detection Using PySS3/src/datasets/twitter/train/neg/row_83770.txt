Post Graduation DepressionI've been empty since graduation. I've never been the happiest person, but I've really lost all hopes. I have no ambition or motivation left. My only thoughts are of sadness and a deep longing to no longer continue living the life I'm stuck living.. I have friends, yet I feel so alone.. I can't afford to leave this town or go to school, and even if I could, I don't know where I would go, or how I would somehow manage to push myself to do my schoolwork.

Nobody is interested in me romantically, and the only person I've ever cared about deeply is no longer in my life. We had plans to get married..to share the rest of our lives with each other.. It hurts to be this afraid and alone with nobody to share my feelings with..nobody to even talk to. I can't talk to my family about these types of issues, and they don't care to take notice..even though I'm sure it's obvious at this point. I graduated last July, and I've been miserable since.

I want to leave my life behind and run away..but I'm stuck. Stuck here..with my parents and people who don't care to notice how I'm feeling or doing. I need out of this town..away from this place..from everything..

I just really don't know what to do anymore, I don't want to give up but that's honestly the only option I can see happening at this point..I've got nobody and no reason to continue living a life without purpose. I don't want to end up on medicine that makes me feel like a zombie..because I don't feel that loosing the little emotion I have left will do anything to help me, but instead just make me feel worse.

I feel the pressure to go to school but I can't justify the cost..or motivate myself to do the work and go to the classes. I don't want to be a slave to money until I die..what sort of life can that be..

I just don't know.

Even these words feel useless at this point..like I'm talking to nobody in particular..but rather convincing myself I'd be better off dead.
