Let me give you the list of bullshit Iâ€™ve been through in the last 7 years up until now.â€¢ Watching my dad and brother struggle with drug addiction.
â€¢ Being kicked out of the house 3 times and having to live in my car for two weeks one of those times.
â€¢ Watching my dad nearly die from an aneurism. 
â€¢ Jumping from minimum wage job to minimum wage job because i have no drive.
â€¢ Dealing with my brother getting killed. 
â€¢ Car breaking down and having to rely on daddy
â€¢ Currently $8k in debt for no reason.
â€¢ Cant deal with my behavior anymore
â€¢ Starting to hate myself more and more each day.

I donâ€™t want to die. Trust me. But iâ€™m at the point where I have to question when this silly game will end. Am i just supposed to deal with the suffering and misery for the next 60 years?
