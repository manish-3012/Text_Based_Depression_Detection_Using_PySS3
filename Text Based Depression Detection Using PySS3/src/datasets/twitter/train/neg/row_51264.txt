A good song for teens in trouble. An oldie, but worth the listen. The song understands a lot. I think she really cared when she wrote this song.[*Trouble Child*, by Joni Mitchell.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=2qu6SdazWAM) If you are feeling bad it might reach your heart. I hope it makes you feel a little better.
