My friends know i am suicidal.They all know now that i am suicidal. They know my story. Half of it. But i don't know. No matter how much i want to be with them i always feel that they didn't want to be with me. As if like i am alone even if i'm with them. Is it normal? Or i'm just overreacting things. Like always. I've been eager to kill myself but i don't have the strength to do it.
