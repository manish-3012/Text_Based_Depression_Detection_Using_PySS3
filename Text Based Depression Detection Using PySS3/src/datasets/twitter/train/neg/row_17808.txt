Maybe the most fitting way to go.I'm so lonely.
My boyfriend finds me repulsive sexually. I think he is asexual.
I have a very strong sex drive, so the only person who has touched me for years is me. I've begged, pleaded,read books, compromise, and bargaining I have tried everything. I'm celibate now without a choice. 
I had a lot of demons safely hidden away in a box
lately they've joined me again. The only option I have left is chemical castration...I get to kill my sex drive at 30 'cuz it's too much of a burden to have.

I've been thinking I should try getting into autoerotic asphyxiation. It's dangerous and can kill you, but is also supposed to be a sexual thrill. What a fitting end that would be too! Go out with a bang....and let the dopamine rush help cushion the fear? 
Everyone owns a belt and a closet.
