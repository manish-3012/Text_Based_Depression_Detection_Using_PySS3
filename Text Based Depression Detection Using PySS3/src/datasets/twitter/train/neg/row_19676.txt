Too weakIve battled depression since i was 13. I am now 26 and have badly lost my battle with depression. I have no career, no degree, no friends, no passions. Everyone i knew growing up have careers and families. I am a disgrace to parents, i feel me being alive and a failure at 30 would be more sad than me being dead at 26. Life is too hard, just getting out of bed to shower and brush my teeth is a difficult task. The past 8 years are a blur, probably because i spent most of my time doing nothing
