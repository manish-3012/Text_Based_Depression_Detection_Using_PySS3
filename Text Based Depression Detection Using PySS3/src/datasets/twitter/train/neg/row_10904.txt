I want to dieSick of being told to see a therapist. Therapy doesnâ€™t work. Sick of being told to try antidepressants. Those donâ€™t work either.

Finding new hobbies is not fulfilling. Friends do not make me happy, I just get annoyed with people. Iâ€™m sick of empty and generic advice- go try yoga or go to meetups.com and play board games with people! Go volunteer and drink some herbal tea!! Yeah, Iâ€™d rather stay in my bed and cry.

Whatâ€™s the best method of hanging yourself? will a belt or a scarf work better?
