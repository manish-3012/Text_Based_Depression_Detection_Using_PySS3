need some hope- i have been stuck in this mindset for a whileI've been feeling suicidal for several weeks now after having brief success with dbt therapy and then backing out because i was scared of the feeling of being in control of my life. i feel worse than before i had success with dbt and despite being in intensive therapy i havent felt a change. has anyones mindset shifted toward recovery and life when they were against it before? i'm in school and i just got a new job so im "functioning" to a degree but i feel awful and the suicidal thoughts are daily. im also trying meds and acupuncture haha to see if it makes any impact. again, i mostly feel like im playing the waiting game for a spontaneous shift in mindset. is this realistic? has it happened to anyone else?
