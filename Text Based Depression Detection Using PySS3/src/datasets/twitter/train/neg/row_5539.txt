Stupid and ConfusedEvery moment of my life I just feel confused now. I feel too stupid to understand reality even though I try so hard. I donâ€™t really know how to explain it. You ever get that feeling like you forgot to do something but donâ€™t know what it is? I constantly feel like that but amplified and mixed with confusion and dread. Iâ€™m so sick of existence, I just want to do something, feel something crazy. I donâ€™t know, I wanna go insane, or attempt suicide or something. Iâ€™m always so lost, i donâ€™t know who I am or what I am anymore. I wish I could explain myself better.
