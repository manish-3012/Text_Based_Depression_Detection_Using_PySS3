What am I suppose to do anyways.Fuck if I know. Iâ€™m sick of this. Iâ€™m in pain everyday because of progressive damages from lupus. I canâ€™t eat without being ill. I donâ€™t have much support. Iâ€™m stuck in a situation I wish I never got myself in. I have to work 40 hours and go to school full time in hopes that I can just work 40 hours and make it. I work through all of my trials of sickness, but my body aches so much at the end of the day; is it worth it? Itâ€™s dehumanized me. I have no energy, I have rashes, my blood pools to my legs and causes me to look purple. I have a hard time gaining weight, I stand 5â€™8 and 116-118 pounds. This past year I got diagnosed with neuropathy, it causes me to faint, no divest my food properly, and messes with my sleep. My neurologist told me I canâ€™t drive anymore. Iâ€™m only 21. Iâ€™ve been so scared of death prior to this, but this has to be worse. Iâ€™m on kidney disease watch because of protein in my urine and abnormal antibody screenings. 
If I said I didnâ€™t have anyone that would be a true statement. People get so mad when I talk about myself. I just try to talk about the positive, but I need help. Help is too negative. Help means dragging there selves into my emotions. If you could avoid that I know you would. 
Itâ€™s all just taking a toll on me. I wish I had someone. Crying out just makes others let me know that I am a fool...
