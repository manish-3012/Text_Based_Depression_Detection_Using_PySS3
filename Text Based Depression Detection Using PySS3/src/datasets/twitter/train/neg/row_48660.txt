How I wish I could donate my life to someone in needI'm not suicidal because of my life. I'm suicidal because of life in general.

I don't see myself getting a job. I don't even see myself existing in a couple of years. I have no desires, no dreams nor passion for any activity/skill.

I have no health problems. I have a loving family. I've been a great student. All this privilege and I still want to die. 

I'm a selfish human. If only I could rest in peace knowing that my life was given to someone in need.

I'm so sorry for being a disappointment
