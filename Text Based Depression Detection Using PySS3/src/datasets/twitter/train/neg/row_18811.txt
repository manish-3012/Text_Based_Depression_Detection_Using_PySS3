What are these emotions? Can someone please explain.Where do I start? 
PLEASE DO NOT SEE THIS AS A HUMBLE BRAG. 

I have always been a very quiet person with very little desire to express my feelings or share them. Iâ€™m hard working and love my job. 
I have a beautiful wife that I love and a dog. Got a house in the fancy neighborhood of the city. I pretty much got everything Iâ€™ve wanted it. 
You see the problem is Iâ€™m only 22 years (almost 23) old and for some reason Iâ€™ve got this desire to simply not exist. I believe Iâ€™ve always had this â€œdepressionâ€ since I was little but never wanted to deal with it since I like to shove my feelings down. I know I have family that has a dealt with depression all their lives but they all had fairly harsh and painful pasts. Last month we got the news that a relative of mine committed suicide. Although I felt bad for his family I was rather understanding and almost glad for him that he was able to find relief. I feel like I have no reason to feel this way (depressed/suicidal). Iâ€™ve accomplished a lot at a very young age but it honestly doesnâ€™t mean much to me. 

Although I have these feelings Iâ€™m not ready to leave simply cause Iâ€™m not 100% sure why I feel this way. 

Anyone able to explain? This is as close as Iâ€™ve gotten to â€œtalking about itâ€
