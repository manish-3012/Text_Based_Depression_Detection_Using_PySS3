Having bad reaction to Prozac. Extreme flashbacks from PTSD.Some of you helped me a few nights ago, and I'm grateful. I'm still having difficulties. Basically, I'm a huge idiot, and I went to a bunch of different brainwashing religious cults for research as a writer. I got PTSD from it. Now I'm on Prozac to treat it and having a really bad reaction. I saw the new movie The Master tonight, which was a really dumb idea, because it's all about cults and weird sexual stuff, and now I'm totally triggered from my own bad experiences and flipping out.
