Had to delete my last post because it was poorly worded: I WAS NOT, SAY AGAIN, /NOT/ TRYING TO ADVERTISE MYSELF AS A HELPER. I WANTED TO TALK TO SOMEONE IN PRIVATE BECAUSE /I/ WANT TO END IT ALL, NOT TALK SOMEONE ELSE OUT OF DOING SO.Apparently, in my last post, the title was worded poorly and made it sound like I was trying to advertise myself as some sort of helper. At least, that's what I'm assuming happened, since my stupid fucking post got downvoted. The body of the post gave more clarity as to what I was actually looking for, but it still led someone to downvote me.

To the person who messaged me seeking help, I will not reveal your name, but I'm sorry I confused you. I can barely help myself. I truly hope you find the help you're looking for.

To everyone else - I'm sorry. I'm just gonna go.
