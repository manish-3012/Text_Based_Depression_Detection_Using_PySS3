HeyIâ€™m just really concerned about my mental state. I wonâ€™t annoy anyone with stories of the circumstances, but essentially my suicidal thoughts and urges have been getting really intense and have been occurring more frequently. 
I recognize that Iâ€™m going through a rough patch with life in general, but I also recognize the things Iâ€™m going through could be worse. I could be starving or sleeping in the streets or ect
but even knowing that doesnâ€™t stop these shitty thoughts or make me feel any less worthless or like i have meaning and it doesnâ€™t change that I donâ€™t want to be alive. It makes me feel so ungrateful and a bad person for feeling like this, I want to feel happy but I canâ€™t fix my mind. I want to believe things will magically change and be better, but I donâ€™t think they will. 
 Iâ€™ve been through really bad situations in life prior and handled them much better mentally than this. I just think thereâ€™s something genuinely wrong with how my brain is operating, and itâ€™s just increasingly getting worse. But even seeing that from a logical standpoint still doesnâ€™t change that i want to die. I donâ€™t think itâ€™s something that can get better, because its not entirely correlated with environments being triggered around me. Itâ€™s mostly my brain and whatever decline its putting me through. which I canâ€™t fix. so it wont be better and i wont feel okay unless it stops and suddenly fixes itself, which doesnt seem probable. so i dont even know why im dealing with this
