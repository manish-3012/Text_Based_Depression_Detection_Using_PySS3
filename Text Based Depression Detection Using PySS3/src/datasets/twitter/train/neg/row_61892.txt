It's 3 a.mIt's 3 a.m. there. I just want to end it so fucking much. But I'm so scared of what comes next. i want it all to end but what awaits for me on the other side? Rebirth? Endless darkness? People try to learn it for centuries. No one knows for sure. There are so many people who died by others hands. Who suffered during wars. Who were captives. They all went on their path. And there's me. In the room. Fuck it.

I can't wait longer. I hate it so fucking much. I return to crippling anxiety. I hate myself so much. Today I've done like 20 cuts. Overate what my abusive mother brought home. Now she's somewhere with friend. I don't care. She's insane. She hits me since childhood. She deliberately insults me everyday. She knows it hurts. She uses all my weak spots she admitted. I fail school. I have no friends. I can't sleep. My brother killed himself 3 months ago. Here I am. A piece of shit without character. I just want to end it all this night because I know how many years of suffering await for me. My brother struggled for 12 more years than me. Died alone, abused, and without food. But mother (narcissistic) is saint. Fuck her, can't fight anymore. I don't want to. I will never move out. I'll be fat, ugly, insane, abused. I lost my last chance with the break up with my narcissistic girlfriend. She used me to. Father who was abused by mother too I guess, abused me sexually indirectly too. My grandmother severely depressed and needs something from me with guilt-tripping. I hate this fucking life. I've never lived a day. I'm in a cage, a prison. I do what my mother approves. I'm her property. The only thing I can do is to kill myself. I hope I can find courage though I know I wont because I'm fucking pathetic creature without any guts. Fucking piece of trash
