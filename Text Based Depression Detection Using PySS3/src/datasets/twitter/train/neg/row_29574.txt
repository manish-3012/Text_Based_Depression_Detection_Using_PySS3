How do i believe in myself? trust myself? respect myself?I have been here for a while,

Treaded these dreaded lands,

for several a mile,

Here i address with empty hands.][



I may have form in reality,

but from my mind i am formless,

No aim no talent no specialty,][


What i do believe: A deal with the god and the devil,

Both have forsaken and left me at my own peril,

A twisted experiment to see, 

Whether the correct god of my liking i can be.][


Daily my confidence is bombarded,

My self image shredded,

My depression compounded,

My internal existence ceded.][


People stand silently,

ignoring the debacle,

a failure that is me.][


I try again and again,

Living up to what people tell about me,

but every time i encounter vain,

I lose vision, because the future i can't foresee.][


How can i tell,

if the time i put into a project,

into a skill, a thought, a hope,

would come out well?][

How can i trust myself and my conscience?

For i have been subject of my own betrayal:

procrastination, doubt, my ideas made of nonsense.][

Everybody's Fake praises, Fake wishes, Fake hope,

Enough,

Just give me a pair of sharp scissors, or a sturdy rope.][
