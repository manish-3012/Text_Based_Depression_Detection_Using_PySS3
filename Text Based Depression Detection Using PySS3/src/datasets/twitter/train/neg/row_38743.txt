I need to get a few things out..I'm currently in a shitty place in life. I'm not very good at talking about myself so I'm going to just type out things as they come to mind.

I'm a sophomore in college and everything seems like it's going wrong. My best friend who happens to be a girl has done nothing my bitch at me and rip on me the last few weeks, not only that but I also seem to be failing miserably with all of my social encounters at the moment. Everything seems to go shitty for me. In person I try to act as up beat as I can. On the inside I hate my self more than anything.

My home life is shitty as well, it seems like no matter what I do I get ragged on for it. My families opinion is that if I disagree with them on something I'm only doing it to be hostile. My mom rags on me for everything I say. Not only that, she'll also bring up random things that i've said or done in the past out of nowhere and attack me for them.

I hate myself so much right now. I just need someone to talk to, this is the most depressed I have been in a long time. I am crying like crazy right now. I'm sorry this isn't written very well but I needed to get a few things out.. Feel free to ask me any question or offer any advise.

EDIT, to make matters worse I have no one to turn to right now. My mom will just say I'm doing it for the attention. I'm getting sick of stuff like this. 
even right now i can hear my mom saying "i'm not going to pretend to whisper to coddle him". I hate my life so much right now
