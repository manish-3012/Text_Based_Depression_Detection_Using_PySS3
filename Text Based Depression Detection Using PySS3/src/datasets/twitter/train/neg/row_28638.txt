One of these days I'm finally doing itI cannot believe I'm this weak. All it takes are a few bad days and I'm back to the abyss again. Staring at it, slowly being swayed by its gentle and calming voice.

I've been in this limbo for far too long, it's been 4 years since I started developing suicidal thoughts. I can't seem to shake it off.

I have markers for suicidal thoughts: Smoking, excessive drinking, binge gaming, and procrastination. I have all the resources in the world to live my life as an entrepreneur, but why can't I just be productive for one day?

People will miss me when I'm gone, I at least have some legacy to leave, I have friends that love me. I am just so disappointed with myself that mistake after mistake after mistake keeps piling up. I'm such a fucking failure in life. I'm killing myself because I am just so through with this life.

This is somewhat meditative, writing my thoughts. I do have some bright spots: At least I recognize that I have people in my life that love me, I have work (God knows what people are going through right now), I am still breathing, and many more. 

Why are the dark spots on my life so consuming? I hate it.
