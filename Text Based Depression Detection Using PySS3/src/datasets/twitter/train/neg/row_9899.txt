Desperate ex gamblerCrosspost with r/offmychest

I used to play the online poker. Wasn't very good at it but kept getting loans to feed my addiction. In September it will be a year since my last hand. But I still have to repay my debt and I just became unemployed. Have no one to ask for help and are starting to get suicidal thoughts quite often.
