I post here so much that I think I'm just mentally suicidalI ust to be at an all time time high I had an amazing girl friend and dumped her cause she locked up on me and I blame myself I can't stop thinking about her I still love her so much i want her back and now I'm failing at both school and grade school I just keep fighting with my parents family I have to hold back my tears when i see her at school she accidentally nudged me with her foot and I nearly burst out with tears I look like a void of depression despair and sadness and I feel I'm in a hole and when I climb to get out the path breaks and I'm slowly failing I put up a front and everybody doesn't know me properly I just can't help myself now I'm even worse my dad can't come home and I know I'll get kicked out of the house before he comes back I deserve it I deserve to be in this pit for breaking my loves heart for destroying my family and another person's future as a Electrician I just want to hug someone and cry my eyes out but I can't nobody wants that I'm better off dead and cold leave this world with my family being at peace and my dyslexic,memory loss,depressed,anxious,autistic pathetic waste of a human being waste of a life I just hate my life my favourite days are the rainy days 
I tried to talk to someone and I just couldn't as I was to scared and I just swore at e
My friend and I'm gonna die I can't stand another day of life.
I'm always sad and I can't hang on anymore everyone says move on man but I can't ok I actually really love her and I just want to leave my friends alone I doubt they care if I was gone and I doubt my family would care I can't hang on to life no more and I don't want everybody to miss me anymore.
