I can't cope with the constant self hating bitter voice in my head and it's getting close to pushing me over the edge.Im a 23 university dropout and I can't take the pressure of living like im total failure. 

Its become a routine where I'm constantly inflicting self harm on a regular basis. Slamming my fists into legs, sticking sharp objects into myself and biting my lower lips till it bleeds just get my thoughts to go away. 

I have no one I can talk to about this. The only person who gave a shit about me is dying of bowel cancer and when she goes I'll breakdown. 

I've become a bitter jealous shell of a person and I deserve to die for being a waste of skin. I can't even watch happy films without breaking down into mess of envious disgusting mess.

I want to die so much.
