I feel trappedFor the past decade I've felt nothing but self-hatred, anger, sadness, and loneliness. At this point I feel like the only thing that will ever make me happy is suicide. That's not the issue though. The issue is that I know if I killed myself, it would devastate my family and friends. So for ten years I've painted a smile on my face, and I've acted like everything is okay, so that my loved ones don't have to worry about me and can be happy. After ten years of doing this, I just feel like I'm living on everyone else's behalf, and I'm so tired. I don't want sadden my family and friends by killing myself, but I'm also sick of living just for the sake of keeping them happy. I just feel like it's not fair. People always talk about taking care of your own well being, but what am I supposed to do when the one thing that will make me happy is taking my own life? Why do I have to keep suffering just so everyone else can be happy? I'm afraid that if I stay alive long enough, I'm going to start resenting my loved ones just for being happy, and I don't want to ever get to that point.
