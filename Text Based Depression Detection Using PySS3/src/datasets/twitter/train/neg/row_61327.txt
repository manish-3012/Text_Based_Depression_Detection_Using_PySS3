I want to kill myself tonight but I am not going to. Would anyone like to be friends instead?does anyone here want to start an anonymous support group? Iâ€™m a little nervous about having a group of suicidal people being friends but I think if we set guidelines, things could really work out and we could find a great group of people. I feel alone pretty often and donâ€™t have many people to talk to. a groupchat might be a nice way for some of us to have a consistent group of people to get love and support for. Let me know if anyone is interested. I personally would love to have people of all ages included with the exception of minors.
