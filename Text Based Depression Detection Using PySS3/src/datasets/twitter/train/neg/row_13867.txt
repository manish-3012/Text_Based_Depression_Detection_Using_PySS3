I don't know how to keep fightingI'm scared at how suicidal I am 

Honestly, I'd go to the hospital but I don't have anyone to watch my dog.

I guess that's part of the problem.

I don't know anyone. I don't have any friends. I moved out of state for a girl and she dumped me a few months later.

It's been 6 months and so many horrible things have happened since she broke up with me. But I'm scared and I'm broken. And I don't have anyone. 

I broke away from an abusive family, and I haven't talked to them in years. I have A couple friends from my old state who will shot the breeze, but don't want anything deep. 

I don't know how to make friends. I'm so broken right now.

And the worst is, I lost my job and my insurance and I can't find anything. I'm so tired and broke and I don't want to be homeless.

My dog needs his shots, and I can barely afford food for him. He's such a good boy. I don't deserve him. 

And now the crappy part-time job I had is gone.  I'm so depressed I can barely work. 

There is no safety net. There is help. 

I'm so broke. I live in a bug-infested hole, and I still can't afford it. 

I'm tired. And I'm tired of fighting. And I'm so alone. 

I know I need help. I've been fighting for months to get therapy, but this county just doesn't offer anything. They have a bare-bones medical clinic, and that's it. 

I can't keep fighting and no one cares. No one cares that I'm barely holding on.
