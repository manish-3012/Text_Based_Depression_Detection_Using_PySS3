Iâ€™m doneI need someone to tell me for a fact that I will marry someone in the next eighteen months, so I have even a smidgen of hope that Iâ€™ll have something to live for and my dream will finally come to pass. 

Iâ€™ll have a reason to actually live. I have no reason to live right now. None at all. 

If it turns out that the person has lied about me marrying in eighteen months, Iâ€™ll off myself then.
