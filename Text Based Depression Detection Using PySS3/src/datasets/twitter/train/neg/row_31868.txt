My senses are failing.I'll keep it short considering the circumstances. I used to live in the U.S. where I had all my friends, at about 1 year before I moved to mexico my friends were already abandoning me, the reason is irrelevant. My whole life I'vÃª always vÃªem different, I'vÃª always had to go to those that were Also differerent, and Even still-life I didn't feel at home. But now that i'm in mexico... The people are different... People I'd never be able to relate to, and apart from that my older friends have already forgotten me. I'm alone, I always have been. The only thing that kept me going was music... It brought me somewhere else, I especially love classical music and second comes metal... But my hearing is failing. But if i couldnt hear beauty i could always make it with my classical guitar and musical knowledge But my wrists and fingers are crippling... It's all being taken away, and i feel i Van mor lastro as well. What's left?
