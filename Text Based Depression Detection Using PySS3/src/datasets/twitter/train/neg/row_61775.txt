It scares me how much I think about suicidePosting here because I donâ€™t want to alarm anyone close to me. I talk with my therapist about it so people are aware. 

Idk I feel like suicidal thoughts rewire your brain. As a kid I never thought about suicide. In fact, my mom was so miserable to deal with I contemplated suicide for the first time then. But I was so disgusted with my environment that I ran away because i knew suicide wasnâ€™t me. Now Iâ€™m 29 and Iâ€™ve had suicidal thoughts for the past 4 years. 

In the past year itâ€™s almost every other day. No exaggeration. And it scares me how in my worst moments it becomes an answer. Iâ€™ve planned it and imagined it so many times. It is incredibly unhealthy and Iâ€™m deeply saddened that this is my life now. I was diagnosed with depression, bipolar, adhd and anxiety last year. Iâ€™m really sad because I think my choices in life or just my environment never allowed me to really get a grip enough to feel like I belong. And whatever small challenges I faced built up over time to a full blown mental illness. 

Iâ€™m very worried for the next few years as i start to want a husband. With all my mental stuff and anxiety causing me not to really connect with my friends..Iâ€™m not confident I can fall in love and connect with a healthy individual. I try to plan for the next five years or so... But these thoughts are so scary to share - Iâ€™ve never told anyone this.... But Iâ€™m really not sure that Iâ€™m going to make it. 

And living with the sorrow that you donâ€™t think youâ€™ll survive the next few years because youâ€™re more confident in the fact that youâ€™ll kill yourself versus find peace. Itâ€™s just incredibly sad.
