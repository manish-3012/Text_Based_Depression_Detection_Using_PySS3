Just Another OneHey guys. I dont know what's going on anymore frankly. I've gotten to a point where I just straight up dont care. The only reason I havent fully committed is two parts. I dont think I'm actually strong enough to actually follow through and two a friend of mine says it would make them sad. I want to stop hurting people. Everytime I go to the hospital for whatever it seems I lose more and more. A friend of mine recently told me that taking me to the hospital for a concussion was too much for them and that the only reason they talked to me for mo this was because one of their partners is my best friend. The same best friend who said they'd be sad if I died. I hurt someone else by getting a damned concussion. I dont even know if I'm actually depressed or just faking it so well I convinced myself I'm depressed. This is just the most recent stuff too. My parents tell at me whenever I get medical care because it costs them money. They make a point every time to tell me how much I cost them. Theres just a lot going on and I just want to suffer. I want to make sure I feel the same amount of pain I've caused.
