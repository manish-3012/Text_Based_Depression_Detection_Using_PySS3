Being alive is too hardI find it so hard to keep pushing through these periods of darkness in my life. There are so many, and the light just doesn't feel worth it. 
The pain is excruciating, too the point I just don't want to be alive. I have a family who loves me, a career I just started perusing, and 'supposedly' many friends who care, but I none of it feels worth it, and I feel no connection to any of it. I just want the pain to stop.
