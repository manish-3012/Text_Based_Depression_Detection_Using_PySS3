It keeps getting worse...I attempted again two days ago but failed. Maybe it's due to my half hearted attempts....I'm too tired to even kill myself properly.   


The feeling of wanting to die is still here and it's growing. Yesterday, I managed to procure a bottle of rat poison but chickened out and self harmed instead. I'm scared I won't survive the week.
