I love in my headI can't take it anymore, every bad thing that happens to me I don't tell anyone, and I'm in a hell of my own making, because now I have no friends, and everytime something bad happens, I have to suffer in silence because I have to put on my smile and pretend like nothing is wrong, and I'm on the verge of killing myself, because nobody can ever see that I'm slowly tearing myself apart from the inside out, and I used to think I'd never kill myself because it would destroy my family, but now the only thing keeping me from doing it is my will...and I fear that it's withering away too...I just want someone to help me, through thick and thin because right now I have nothing...nobody to see my life leaving my body even before I die...I hope this isn't my first and last post...
