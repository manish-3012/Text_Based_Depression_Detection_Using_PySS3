A rant, of no interest to anyone but myself.Today's my birthday, yay. I'm so happy I made to 18. Now I can legally take advantage of Voluntary Euthanasia.

Realistically, I'm not going to kill myself soon. Do I want to? More than anything. Days pass by slow but every year seems like it's faster than the last. Today has been particularly rough. I'm unemployed and can't drive so I'm limited, but I was hoping my parents would take one day off hating my guts. I asked them if I could have a few dollars, 8.95 to be exact. "Don't ask me those sorts of things." Don't ask you what? For a few dollars so I can cover tax? Every birthday gets worse and worse. This time around I had to share it with my great uncle on his birthday (a day earlier) so of course we went to dinner to the place of his choice. When mine rolled around all I got was denial and more stomach destroying anxiety.

I want to die. I don't get how people can be happy. I'm not the gender I want to be. I'm ugly. I'm gaining weight. I have no motivation. The only thing I want in life is to not have one.
