I need help, but I no longer know where to goHey guys,

Throwaway obviously, regular Redditor though. I don't know whether I should be posting this here but I need some advice.

I am a 23 y.o. male with a history of depression and self harm. Been on Citalopram, Fluoxitine and most recently Sertraline, none of these have worked for me. I regularly have thoughts of killing myself as the world as a whole would be no different without me and those closest to me would definitely be better off.

I have never come close to killing myself, but I am scared that eventually I will come to a point where I cannot take it anymore and take that plunge. Nothing I try seems to help this problem, Counselling and medication seem to do nothing.

I don't know where to go anymore, plese help
