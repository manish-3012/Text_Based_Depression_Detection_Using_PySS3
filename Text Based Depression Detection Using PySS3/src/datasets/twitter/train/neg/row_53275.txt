Suicide as revenge and freedomI think it's fucking stupid that people think suicide is plan "wrong"--who decided that in the first place? I get the sentiment and if someone super close to me committed suicide, I would be heartbroken but honestly? I see it as a freedom we're given. I've recently agreed to my dads agreement and all his strict rules in living at home, and in the email I sent back, I started with, "Father". Wanna know what he sent back? He sent back this, "Father?!?! Ok I get it lol. No deals, goodbye". As soon as I turned 18, I wasn't his kid anymore. So once again, I'm getting the strong urge to kill myself and blame it all on him, make him feel guilty, terrible, for the rest of his life. I feel like I have nowhere to go. I want revenge and freedom, and I know those two don't mix well but I want it so bad. I want him to hurt so much because of how much he has hurt me all my life: physically, mentally, and emotionally.
