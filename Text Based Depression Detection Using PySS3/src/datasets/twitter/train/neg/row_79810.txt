im so brokenim a girl in high school. that should really start things off well. i used to be so happy

things got really bad when my brother started getting suicidal thoughts. now looking back, i think he used it to get out of trouble. i ended up doing his chores and taking a lot of blame for him because i thought he needed it. 

now he hears me screaming and crying and he NEVER ONCE simply asked if i was ok. never. neither my sister. my parents bought my brother a therapist. iâ€™ve asked FOUR FUCKING TIMES FOR ONE and my mom always said. yes iâ€™ll look into it. HOW HARD CAN IT FUCKING BE???? ITS BEEN 5 MONTHS MOM. youâ€™ll regret it when iâ€™m not alive next week. 

the first time i opened up ab how i was feeling, my sister told my mom i was lying for attention, so my mom scheduled a fake appointment to the neurologist to have me confess. i never did because it was true. 

i went to my pediatrician and she gave me adderall for weight loss and minor depression. now, i have a fucking eating disorder and major depression. if i miss a dose iâ€™ll sleep for 18 hours straight and become suicidal to the point i have to go to bed AGAIN so i wonâ€™t KILL MYSLEF

on top of that, my two best friends have been also dealing with depression, both in and out of hospitals. once they were both gone at the same time, which i think made everything worse for me. 

i have a hard time talking ab how i feel because for my entire life iâ€™ve been told iâ€™m overdramatic. 

im most upset ab my parents. they know iâ€™m like this. iâ€™ve called them to my room crying because of a gushing nose bleed that went all over my bed from crying too much. still no fucking help

so iâ€™m done. iâ€™m done fucking living. iâ€™m done breathing. o hate feeling sad all the time feeling hopeless. when iâ€™m on adderall iâ€™m a whole different person which makes me feel even worse. iâ€™m done
