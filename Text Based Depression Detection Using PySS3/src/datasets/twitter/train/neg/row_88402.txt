I don't even know what I'm doing anymoreJust over a year ago I was in a really bad place, tried to kill myself twice and was very depressed and angry, but I got better. I told myself everyday I would never let myself get like that again, or return to such a low point in my life. But here we are again. The anger is building up and all I can think is that I want to die.

Its been around 3 or 4 months and my life has just plummeted. Today I almost committed suicide again and I just can't stop thinking about it. I wake up everyday but don't bother getting up for hours because I just know I'll fuck up so bad as I always do. Why even fucking bother. 

I don't want to hear any bullshit about how it will get better, because it did for me before but it didn't last and it never will, or that I need to talk to someone about this, I just needed to get this out somewhere.
