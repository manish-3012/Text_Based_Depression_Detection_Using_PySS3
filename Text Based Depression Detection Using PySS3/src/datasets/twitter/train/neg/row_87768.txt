2019 is the swansong for meLooks like its meant to be im getting old and i still dont have a job how am i meant to live a life and afford at least a couple of luxuries that people take for granted (like their own space), when i have no skills employers want? Its over ive had my chances im never going to get anymore im never going to be able to live my purpose all i wanted was a quiet life where could live comfortably and just be content maybe borderline happy without having to worry about cost and maintaining a few friendships all my friends have become tired of me, given up or in the process of either one or the other. I should be keeping my head down and trying to fight one last time but my brain just wants to be at peace. The more the days pass the more this becomes louder. Maybe its time to concede say ive tried enough.. Maybe this is reverse psycology who knows what i do know is im desperate to survive but not one person is giving me a chance so surely ive got no choice i dont want to live the rest of my life being unemployed this wasnt how my life was meant to go. But hey someyimes its all down to the luck of the spawn coupled with luck from directors of companies whether they see enough in you to throw you a bone especially if youve got no atandard of higher education. Im seen as too much of a risk to employers so what am i meant to do? Im fucked
