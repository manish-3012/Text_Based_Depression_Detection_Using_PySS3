What is wrong with me?Im so jealous of missing girls. Iâ€™ve been seeing and retweeting so many missing and murdered people and even though I hope for THEIR safety and families, I want it to happen to me. I want someone to kidnap and kill me or SOMETHING. I want my family to be able to find the body and put it to rest but I wanna be dead. I just wanna be shot in the face or something. I keep hearing about kidnappers and Iâ€™m mad that no one has got me yet.

I have ran away from home like twice after heated arguments and got into cars of random dudes in hopes they take me somewhere and kill me but they were just dudes looking for fucks and I was highly disappointed. Also I left home once to go to a spot where I planned to hang myself and a guy picked me up and bought me a lighter then went somewhere kinda public but dark. He wanted to fuck and I hoped heâ€™d shoot me or something after refusing but he obviously didnâ€™t.

I hate being alive so bad.
