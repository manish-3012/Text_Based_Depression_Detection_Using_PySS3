Lost faith in humanity, losing faith in myselfEver since going through puberty I've hated this world and the way women are treated and perceived. Throughout my life, despite telling me that I'm "extremely smart" family and friends have made me feel more like a decorative piece than a sentient human being. I've been miserable at home since I was around 10, but fantasies of being a successful and powerful woman someday have gotten me through the day for the past decade. However, I feel like I've hit a dead end with my life. My main goal until recently was find a reason to live until I made it to college. Once I finally reached college I couldn't believe how happy I was. My grades were great, I found amazing friends, and met a nice guy. Every day I was happy, but I couldn't shake the feeling that something was wrong; I didn't deserve to be this happy. This happiness was reserved for people in books and TV. Sure enough, I was right.
