I just took a bunch of pillsIt's only 30mg valium and a number of ambien, don't know exactly how much, and some mirtazapine. There's way more in the bedside table. 

I don't know if I will go through with this, but if I do, and anyone I know finds this post, please don't be angry with me. Please don't be sad. I'm no longer suffering. It's hard to live like this, it is. It's been a decade. It's never going to stop.
