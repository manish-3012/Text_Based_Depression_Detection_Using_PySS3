I donâ€™t want to die, but living as me is absolutely agonizing.Iâ€™m really slipping lately. Iâ€™m 19, and for almost 10 years Iâ€™ve had this super deep self hatred. Itâ€™s not even like I want to be dead, but I hate myself so much that I just canâ€™t bear the thought of living. I manage ok when Iâ€™m around people I live and trust, but when itâ€™s just me and my head, it gets really dark and scary. Iâ€™m almost 6 months clean from pills and I want to go back. I donâ€™t like living with myself. 

Every time I see an old picture of myself as a young kid I just wish someone held a pillow over my face until I stopped fighting. I canâ€™t open up to anyone in my life. I donâ€™t want to burden anyone. I just donâ€™t want to be alive if it means I have to be me. I donâ€™t want to do that to my mom though. Right now thatâ€™s the biggest thing keeping me here. But itâ€™s not gonna hold for long. I know Iâ€™m not gonna be around for much longer. I know Iâ€™m whatâ€™s gonna be my death. I actually was researching suicide by hanging today. 

I donâ€™t get it. I donâ€™t know how to put my thoughts into words but here I am. I pretty much have no motivation for anything anymore. My head hurts and I just canâ€™t bear it anymore. Half my life Iâ€™ve been living with this awful demon and itâ€™s never going to go away. Iâ€™ve always known itâ€™ll just progress like a cancer until one day I finally do it.
