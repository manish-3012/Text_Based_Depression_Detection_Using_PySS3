I just cut myself tonightIt's a start. I don't know why i'm still alive. i am so fucking jealous of my younger brother, he is living his life hanging out with friends in college (we live in the same apartment) while i'm in my room crying every night for not having any friends (also in college). last week it took all my courage to tell/ask him to take me with him when he hangs out with his friends, he said yes. well, earlier tonight, his friends came in our apartment, while i was in my room, i heard his friends ask where his brother is, and my younger brother replied with "he's in his room, he's busy." I wasn't even busy tonight. That automatically hurt me. I'm like the loser in school no one wants to hang out with. my younger brother and our older sister always bullies me for having no friends. they always make fun of me. i don't want to fucking live anymore. I'm still crying from the thought of my younger brother never respecting me and not wanting to introduce me to his friends. I'm 25 ffs. I should be a fucking man. being an introvert sucks. having social anxiety sucks. fuck my life
