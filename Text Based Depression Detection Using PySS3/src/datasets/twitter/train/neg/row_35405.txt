Goodnight and goodbyeCheck previous post for why. 

A â€œfriendâ€ sent police over, I asked them about the injuries and property damage in NHS by their non NHS non police security staff.

Told first hand by copper â€œunlikelyâ€ well ever find or help, so thereâ€™s a reason their names and badges are kept so secure. 

Not the world I want

When cops show up with Blue Lives Matter Patches sure, just means theyâ€™re a racist cunt. When they look into helping, realise it was whoever the heck guards NHS right now and just back away, well thatâ€™s not a good sign. 

Laters peeps Iâ€™m in more pain than earlier and I tried escalating in the way I was asked to, which resulted in more pain and having head smashed on ground so fuck cops. ACAB end of
