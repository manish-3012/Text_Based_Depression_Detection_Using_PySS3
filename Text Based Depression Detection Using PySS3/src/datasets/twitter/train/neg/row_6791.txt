SuperfluousI feel useless a lot lately. It feels like I've lost any sense of purpose in my life. I was pulled out of college because I can't afford tuition roght now. I am disabled and live too far away from the city with my family. I can't drive, so I can't get a job. No one online will hire me because I only have skills in early childhood education- something I can't really do online. I do some services that give me money for doing surveys, but I can only contribute like $10 to our budget weekly. I just feel like a burden. My family often does the chores and refuse my help. I help where I can, cleaning and doing dishes, cooking, but nothing I can do is something they can't do better.  All my friends live very far away from me and don't keep in touch. I feel like my entire life is superfluous. Nobody needs me, nobody is benefited by my existence. There's nothing I can offer to anyone. These thoughts haunt me every day. All I do is sit around my house, wasting electricity, entertaining myself online as I try to drown out the thoughts that I should just end it all. I think the only reason I'm still here is because I still have some hope that it might get better, but it's hard. It's really hard, and sometimes that hope seems like a wet match stick in a cave.
