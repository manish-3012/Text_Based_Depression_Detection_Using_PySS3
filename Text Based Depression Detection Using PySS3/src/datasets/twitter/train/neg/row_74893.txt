How to recover sanity?Well, I've been lately struggling with just random sanity/cordure loss and its driving me crazy.


I used to have DID or Dissociative Identity Disorder, I treated it myself and I got integrated. (for anyone who doesn't know, imagine, this disorder fragmentates someone's head into different people and they all can control someone's body without them even being aware)


Since I got integrated, my other 2 parts fused with me and I was complete again, this happened like, half a year ago, but lately just random sanity loss has been breaking my mind and I feel sad, I can't move from bed and have reduced the amount of food I eat due to loss of appetite. 


I know if I break into pieces again, some parts might complot to possibly kill me and well, I actually don't know if being alive can be something good anymore. My grades are going down and I don't care about much, like I used to do. 


Has any of you got a way to restore sanity or something like that? I know talking with a psychologist could help by a lot but I've told my mother twice already and she doesn't care enough, she might even think it's due to my age, (17 btw), I struggled with DID for 7 years and it apparently got fixed but it seems like it's coming back, possibly because of not proper traitment as I tried to deal with it, entirely by myself. 


Right now, I'm on bed, I should study for exams coming this week but it's too hard to just even think of doing something other than remain in bed listening to music.
