I just want to be doneI don't even know if I just don't feel anything anymore or if it just constant sadness. I couldn't stand school anymore so I dropped out and just work everyday at a minimum wage job just suffering through because it's better than nothing. Music is my only passion Its the only thing I think that honestly keeps me going. My band is even starting to have chances to grow and be popular but I feel like I don't even care. Most days I don't do anything anymore other than just lay in bed doing nothing other than having music playing because I can't stand the silence. I'm losing touch with the only friends I have. About 2 months ago my girlfriend and I of about a year and half broke up and it was all my fault because I was an idiot and cheated on her and lost what was an amazing relationship. This morning I drunk texted her about how I miss her and all that bullshit and she told me she has moved on and all that. Within the last month I met this girl who is literally exactly what I have been looking for in my life forever and I'm pretty sure she doesn't even give a fuck about me. I've tried to make moves towards her but just have gotten nothing out of it. I can't stop thinking of her and when I go to hang out with her it's the only time I feel happy. I guess that's my main problem. I just never feel anything. And if I do its part of 2 extremes. I fucking hate it. There is no reason. I have an okay life, I'm successful, I have dedication to things but it's like it doesn't matter. There is just this overwhelming feeling of never being good enough and just being worthless and useless and I wish it would stop. I've tried to kill myself before. I recently had a relapse with self harm and It just makes me hate myself more. I really just want to be fucking done and kill myself. It's not like anyone is going to miss me anyways.
