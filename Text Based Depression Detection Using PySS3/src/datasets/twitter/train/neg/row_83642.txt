Iâ€™m here to talkHi, Iâ€™m Luca, Iâ€™ve been dealing with depression since i was 8 years old, Iâ€™m still dealing with it, at the age of 18, almost 19, thanks to one of the best person Iâ€™ve ever met, I discovered what is my purpose in life, helping people, i love to help, i love to prioritise others over me, thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m here, to talk, if you need someone to talk to, Iâ€™ll be here giving the best support i can possibly offer. Iâ€™d like to thank everyone who decides to talk to me about any problem bothering them.
