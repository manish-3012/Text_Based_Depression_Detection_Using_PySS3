i don't know what to do anymore20(F) I got out of a bad relationship two months ago, she cheated on me and we were together for almost 3 years. Yet, I still feel sad about it... and when I feel sad about it, I always think about how dumb it is for me to still care. She's already in another relationship (with the girl she cheated on me with) and moving on, yet I'm still sad. I blame myself for her cheating, like I should have done something to stop it.
I feel like a burden to everything and everyone around me. I have friends but no one to talk to about this because I feel like my friends are tired of hearing about it, tired of worrying that I might hurt myself. I don't want them to feel responsible for my life. But I just can't do it anymore. 

I'm going back to my university in a couple months, a place where I have no friends and I am constantly anxious and depressed. I'm dreading it. And every day in between I find myself trying to fill up the time with things to do to temporarily distract and numb myself. 

I used to really enjoy creative writing and I've been wanting to get back into it. I even came up with a short story I want to write but every time I think about actually writing it, I feel daunted and I think that even if I did write it, what would come of it? Nothing. It would sit on my computer, just like I do, being worthless.

So, I don't know what to do anymore.
