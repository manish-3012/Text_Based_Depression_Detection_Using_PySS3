There is no pointThere is no point in life anymore. I can't get a job. I'm 20 and I live with my parents. My boyfriend constantly tries to help me, telling me I "need to get a job". I KNOW I NEED TO IT'S FUCKING HARD.

I'm a worthless human being. For the past few days I've been tired of being alive. I just want to get over with life already. I'm exhausted. Since last night there is a pressure on my chest, it's hard to breathe. I get sudden waves of bursting into tears. And I'm too much of a coward to off myself. I just can't do it. But I don't want to live.

I finally confessed to my bf that I'm tired of being alive. And he told me he doesn't want me to be like this. He doesn't want his gf being like this. He said that "I have problems as well, do you see me ending my life?" and that I'm crying too much over everything and that thinking about ending your life is stupid. 

I have no support. And no one takes me seriously when I say I'm fucking depressed and want to die. I will never amount to nothing. I will end up like my parents - working from paycheck to paycheck, trying to make ends meet. My dreams are stupid. My boyfriend probably hates me and will leave me and find someone prettier and happier. There is no point.
