I don't want to live anymore. I'm tired...Sorry for my bad English. I've had depression for 4 years. I really can't say it to my parents so any hope for my medical treatments is a dream. I told my sister but I realized it was one of the worst mistake ever. From childhood I was hurt by my family and friends. But I couldn't hate them so instead I started to hate myself. Now I am in an endless circle of depression, self-hate, anxiety and panic attacks. I have a lot of friends but they are not someone I can rely on. I was hurt and betrayed by my loved ones so many time I don't trust anyone anymore. I wanted to say so much but in the end I couldn't. But things took such a bad turn yesterday that I desperately need help. So I decided to ask for help on internet. Someone please help me. It feels like I've become my worst enemy. It would have been better if I was never born.
