Iâ€™m tired of hoping for nothing.Everything gets better but everything gets worse. But one thing is constant. I donâ€™t matter, at least in an eternal sense. I donâ€™t have children and I donâ€™t want any. My parents have five other far more successful and better daughters, if not them, they have two dogs they love unconditionally. My grandparents who I used to live for basically hate me. My friends all pretend to be nice but gossip when Iâ€™m not looking and they think I donâ€™t know. I donâ€™t believe in people nor animals. The world is selfish and even if you are good or kind youâ€™re just going eventually get screwed one way or another. Iâ€™m tired of playing. Iâ€™m tired of meaningless sex and food and games and work. Iâ€™m sick of people saying they love me when they donâ€™t. They just want to use me some way or another. Youâ€™re just a price tag and bag of bones at the end of the day. Whatâ€™s the best way to overdose. I have plenty of benzodiazepines and alcohol and I know Iâ€™ll fall asleep and have respiratory failure. I was a pre medical student. But I have no real trials, the last time I tried this I was just terribly ill for a few days. How do I make sure I get the job done, so even if they try to pump my stomach, I flatline. I want brain death. The last thing I want to be is a useless vegetable. Also how can I poison myself effectively and still be able to donate my organs? Thanks whoever bothers to read this crap
