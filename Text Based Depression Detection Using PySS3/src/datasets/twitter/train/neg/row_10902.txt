I have nowhere to turnI thought about making a throwaway but I don't care. I'm so tired. everything around me feels like it's falling apart and I don't know how to hold it together anymore. I've cried myself to sleep a week straight and the feeling like I'm drowning just keeps getting worse. 

I have no friends I can talk to. I have a boyfriend but we're already looking for a couple's counselor as it is and even if we weren't I know it's not right to treat him like a therapist. he's already tired enough of me right now anyway bc I've been bothering him about my comfort when I'm already the reason we're going to counseling in the first place. I don't want to push him further away. 

I just feel like I'm being so childish and pathetic and I don't know what to do to make it stop. I'm sitting in the bathroom trying to both cry quietly and post this bc I feel like I'm right on the edge. I caught myself getting emotional today trying to figure out how I even would kill myself and I nearly cried again when I couldn't think of a feasible way that doesn't involve being someone else's problem. 

please help me. I'm scared and I've never ever been this bad in my life
