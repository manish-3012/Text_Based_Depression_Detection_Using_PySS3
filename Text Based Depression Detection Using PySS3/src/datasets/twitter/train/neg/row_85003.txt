I guess I've been considering it for a little bit now.I'm 18 years old. I have to be honest, this might be one of the more odd threads you'll see here. I'm not depressed, or stressed, or overwhelmed by anything. I'm just bored.

I've felt this way for about three years. Nothing I do is in the least bit stimulating. I have friends. I'm relatively normal. I go out and I hang out with my friends, watch movies, go to school and do my classes. When I get home, though, I just don't really do anything. I don't do any homework, and because of it I'm practically kicked out of school. Everything I do outside of my house is fake. I pretend to laugh, to be interested in things others have to say, but I'm not.

To be completely honest, I haven't felt any physical or social attraction to anybody in these last three years. I haven't even been sexually aroused in at least six months.

As I said, I'm not depressed. I'm just bored. Nothing I do holds any sort of stimulation. Nothing that should affect me, such as getting nearly kicked out of school, and failing classes, does. I'm entirely indifferent to all of it. Days feel like they are 40-50 hours long. They just stretch out and never end. When I'm not at school, or out in public, I sit at home and play video games, but even they aren't stimulating. They're just a timekiller between school and bed.

I've only been seriously entertaining the idea of suicide for a few weeks. Before that, it was just an idea in the back of my head. The only reason, too, is that I just don't feel like putting in the effort anymore.

Any input would be appreciated.
