The Seed of Suicide is Starting to Grow.I'm not diagnosed with depression or any other sort of problem. At some times I wish I was, at least that would give me an excuse. I'm most likely not going to go through with it, I still have my logic with me. Logically, I know this will pass and I'll hurt others if I do kill myself, but in the back of my mind? I want to do it so badly. I'm only 17, which is another reason to keep going, "I have so much to live for" the common excuse used to prevent a suicide in a teen. 

I'm done. I don't think my brain can take it anymore, thoughts keep flowing in and slowly diminish the logic that still stands. I've slowly lost my friends, most likely my fault, I've never had a girlfriend (which doesn't matter too much, it's mostly the stigma that stands in society.) and I do the exact same thing every single day. I wake up, shower, sit in my bed and am on the computer until I go back to bed. Of course I could easily do something else, but I have no motivation to do it, I know I need a change of scenery, but can't bring myself to get up and do it. While I'm trying to sleep these thoughts flow through, this prevents me from sleeping. 

I don't know what to do, and I'm not sure why I'm even submitting this. I just need advice before my brain says "I've had enough." I could easily do it, my brother has a gun, loaded. Just take off the safety, and boom. Gone. No more worries about the future, no more school, no more being alone, no feelings, no emotions, nothing. My family would be upset, but they'd eventually live with it. I can't tell my parents or family, they'd think I'm insane and would make us grow apart even more. Wish I had friends to tell, but no, I have to get on Reddit to tell COMPLETE strangers about my problems. My problems seem so insignificant compared to others, why am I complaining? I have it easy, and yet I just want to sleep and never wake up.
