letting it outi really want to die. painlessly but i know thatâ€™s hard to do. i live in a place where suicide is not really a common thing, itâ€™s quite taboo and my parents would never understand. my sister suffers with depression and once confided in my mother that she wanted to drive into a wall. obviously not my mothers fault because she hasnâ€™t been brought up the way to understand, but my mother brushed it off and said â€œyou just need to exercise and eat betterâ€ . for me, thatâ€™s just not the solution to my sadness. it comes in bursts some days i barely think about my sadness but just when i think iâ€™m getting to be okay again it will take over me and possess my whole body. ultimately iâ€™m too much of a coward to do the deed. iâ€™m scared of pain even though it wonâ€™t matter in the end. but iâ€™m scared of the aftermath, even though my parents are sheltered and uncultured i donâ€™t think that they would blame themselves they know i only have two close friends and they are literally all i have no one in my school likes us people spit and laugh at us. i donâ€™t get out much and i donâ€™t have the quality of life. iâ€™m scared of the aftermath because i know my parents are gonna hurt when iâ€™m gone i know my sisters are gonna cry themselves to sleep most nights i know that my dog will be waiting for me to come home. i know iâ€™m being selfish but i physically canâ€™t cope with being here. after iâ€™m gone my father will have the dog my two sisters have eachother and their boyfriends and my mother had her boyfriend. it hurts me to wake up everyday iâ€™m scared to go out in public because i know people genuinely hate me. i canâ€™t picture myself in the future i canâ€™t picture it at all. im 78% convinced that i want to take my life but iâ€™m worries iâ€™m aware that suicide just passes on the pain but iâ€™ve got so much pain on my shoulders itâ€™s draining me so much. iâ€™m going to write suicide letters tomorrow. i donâ€™t want anyone to blame themselves because itâ€™s me whoâ€™s the problem my family doesnâ€™t have to live with me everyday but i do. every morning i have to wake up and be with myself 24/7. i have to look in the mirror and realise that i am who i am and iâ€™m ultimately all i have. i fucking hate myself. i really want to die. thanks for letting me get a small load off i just need to breathe and plan this out. i have one more day in school and then i can just hibernate and figure out my end. i just donâ€™t want to hurt my family but i know that i will itâ€™s inevitable just like my suicide. thanks for reading sorry it was a bit long :)
