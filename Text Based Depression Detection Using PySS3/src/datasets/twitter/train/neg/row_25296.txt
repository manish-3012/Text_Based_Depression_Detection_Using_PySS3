For me, suicidal ideation is an escape. But if I can't find purpose in life, it may become a reality.I'm constantly hopeless and worried about the future. I don't really have anything that makes me happy or excited anymore, and struggle to find the motivation to do hardly anything. Not even the game I've dumped almost 20k hours into (largely as an escape from these feelings). I've literally just sat in my chair staring down for a while before. I've at least surprised myself to have lived this long, but I'm not really in any sort of better position. I'm miserable with my current dead end entry level job, which messes with my sleep schedule. I've only had any sort of contact with one person since my last long term (\~3y) relationship ended just over 5 years ago now. There's not really anything I like about myself. I can't rely on killing myself by downing the large\*(I think like 2-3x lethal dose per volume/concentration) container of isopropyl alcohol that I've had for that purpose for a while because I tried it and it was difficult for only a few drops. Trust me, though: I've done my fair share of research into methods. I don't know what to do in/with my life.
