Don't Know What To DoI honestly don't know what the point is anymore. I've lost the trust of the people around me, and my family looks at me like I'm a monster. I've been depressed for four years now, and it feels like nothing is ever going to change. I know there's the possibility of things getting better, but in all honestly, I don't see the point of sticking around to see it. I just have no one else to turn to and really don't know what to do anymore.
