Medical studentCan't deal with the absurdity of it all. So envious of the people who don't contemplate their existence. Fortunate enough to not really have to try, and I am at the top of my class. Scored 99th percentile on our national boards. This means I probably could do any specialty in medicine and train at some of the best institutions in the world and go on to make significant wealth. The cruel thing is I just don't care. I want to but I can't. It means nothing. Wish I could just transfer everything over to a student that wants to continue with this life. Guess I'll trod on for now..
