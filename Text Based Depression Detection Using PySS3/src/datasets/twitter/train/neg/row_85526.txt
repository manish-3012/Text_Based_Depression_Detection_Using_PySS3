Drinking alone in my closetDrinking alone in my closet on what Iâ€™m pretty sure will be one of my last days. Iâ€™m still a little afraid of whatâ€™s on the other side if Iâ€™m honest, but I donâ€™t feel thereâ€™s much for me here anymore. 

Sometimes I think about changing my name and moving without telling anyone, but I bring myself with me wherever I go.
