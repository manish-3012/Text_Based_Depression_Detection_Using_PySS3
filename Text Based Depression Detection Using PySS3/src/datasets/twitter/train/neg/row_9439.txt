Are you scared of dying?I'm pretty much done with life. A part of me wants to live still. I think thats why I haven't done it yet. I'd miss my family alot. I know my mom would cry and i dont wanna do that to her.. I  just wish I could go to sleep and just not wake up again. It'll be that quick and easy. However that clearly isn't happening. I'm not scared of dying exactly I would say I'm scared of the physical pain/the unknown after death... Judgement day when I meet God/Jesus and I fear going to hell. I wouldn't say im a bad person. I just made serious mistakes but that voice to kill myself is SCREAMING so loud. I wanna end it but im scared to... Does anyone else feel that way?

I also think if i drank enough i could put a gun to my head with ease and call it a day
