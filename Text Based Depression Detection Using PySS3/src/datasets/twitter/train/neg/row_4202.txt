I tried to end it in September, failed, now my life is even worse than before and Iâ€™m ruining relationships trying to confide in the people I know.Obligatory, Iâ€™m on mobile, so sorry for formatting. I hope itâ€™s okay to just vent a little here. I tried to end myself in September and failed, landing myself in a psych ward for ten days. I deal with bipolar 1 symptoms, and I was off my meds for a month and that happened. I did everything to plan, including quit my job and even finding a new, better home for my 8 y/o dog. So I lived. And itâ€™s been almost three months and I havenâ€™t even bothered trying to find another job, and Iâ€™m about to get kicked out of my place. 

Mostly, I just want to vent about how not having a job and some time to reflect, Iâ€™ve accepted key things here. I have never had any passions, goals, dreams, or even one stupid hobby. I never went to school because my parents refused to co-sign loans, and all my relationships with friends have amounted to nothing. I have been working with no educational background, accepting dead end after dead end jobs that I absolutely HATE. I get burned out so fast and over worked, and Iâ€™ve NEVER been able to make enough money to live on my own despite working three jobs at one time. Iâ€™m so tired. My bf is going back to school, and trying to make something of himself, and all I feel is jealousy and fear of losing him to someone better. 

I genuinely donâ€™t believe that this is just depression anymore. I am seriously a pathetic loser, who desperately tried and even stupidly believed at one point Iâ€™d be something, but itâ€™s over for me. Iâ€™m 27. I am almost 30. I am a waste. I have nothing to show for my not good enough efforts, and everyone I know to talk to is frustrated with me. My bf says â€œyou have a mental block and you need to change your mindsetâ€ but I canâ€™t pick myself back up anymore I simply do not have the energy. I feel so alone while Iâ€™m desperately crying out for help and no one is listening. 

Iâ€™m on meds. Iâ€™m going to therapy weekly but it does nothing. My own therapist doesnâ€™t even know what to say to me she just looks at me like Iâ€™m a sad fucking puppy. Iâ€™m stupidly crying while typing this out, Iâ€™m literally the biggest failure I canâ€™t even kill myself right. Thanks to anyone who read, I appreciate it.
