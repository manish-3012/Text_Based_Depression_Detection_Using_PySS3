Why is everyone competing against each other. Every. Day.I canâ€™t stand it. Everything is a competition. Everything is slavery to others so others can be slaves to you so we can all have shit that we go home and cry about having because it doesnâ€™t make us happy. What is wrong with society. I canâ€™t fucking stand it. I canâ€™t. Itâ€™s all madness. None of it makes sense. Weâ€™re all slaves to sex and society. Slaves. You canâ€™t not be part of society. You canâ€™t be alone without going mad. You canâ€™t see at night or stay warm because the sun goes away so you have to find a cave. Hopefully a bear that might eat you alive wonâ€™t be in there. And then youâ€™re gone. You, just, idk, you donâ€™t dream because your brain isnâ€™t on. Youâ€™re gone. You arenâ€™t you. Youâ€™re dirt. Youâ€™re just slowly becoming it. And then in the future, lava erupts. Nothing we have prevents it. Not even close to space travel. Itâ€™s like, weâ€™re ants at a picnic. And someone spilled fresh coffee
