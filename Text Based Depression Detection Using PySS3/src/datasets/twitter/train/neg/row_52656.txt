Well today's the day I go.Pretty crazy... this has been such a long journey... from May up until now, but I can't take it anymore to be honest. These thoughts and feelings have gone on long enough. The mask is broken. I can't stick around much longer. I hope my method works... if not perhaps I'll be back on here. But if it does I really hope everyone will mend in time.
