"I'm tired of you crying"I'm delusional to think I could cry to my hearts content in someone's presence. I'm not good at anything except crying. I cry too much. There's not a single person who will ever love me or accept me. I can't accept myself. There's no point in trying to be genuine about my feelings because I know they're bad. Back to square 1. Have to realize no one will ever like me and that's that.
