Did I Ever Really Have the Will to Live?The last few years have been incredibly trying.  Diagnosed with Bipolar and coming to terms with that diagnosis and what it means to be me has completely undone me. Even though I am recently married - I have been completely emotionless for years now. Not sure who I am anymore because of the medication changes and addictions to substances. I will be sober from drinking and benzo addiction for 2 years come this summer, though I replace a substance with anything else that lets me escape.

Perpetually in a financial burden and never have money even though I make 6 figures. I am never able to leave my house because of this financial strain which is a constant reminder every day.

I am an embarrassment to myself and those around me.  Not sure why I continue if I continuously lose sight of myself and my mental state.
