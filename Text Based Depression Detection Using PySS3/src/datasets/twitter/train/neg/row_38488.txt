What happens at the hospital?Iâ€™m drunk so bare with me
I need to go to the hospital before I do something â€œstupidâ€ I hat is there to expect? I went to the hospital but I was for people who have drug issues not suicide. What would happen to my kids. Should I wait until a very important appt for my autistic kid to check in itâ€™s on Friday at 10 and I have 10 days for the appt she was approved for something on Monday. I donâ€™t have anyone who will deal with my kids so Iâ€™d rather wait until their dad is off on Sunday but I might maybe need to go simmer than that
