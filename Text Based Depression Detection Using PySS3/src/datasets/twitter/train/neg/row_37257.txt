I might have hopeI started school on Tuesday and I've already had 2 panic attacks in the night, almost had a panic attack in 1st period this morning, and physically cannot speak in some classes due to the large class sizes giving me severe anxiety. I have been seriously considering killing myself since the beginning of August. (Check my comment history if you want to read about my previous suicide attempts) I go to see my therapist on Tuesday of next week at noon and I plan on telling her about my suicidal thoughts, but the idea of going back to the psych ward makes me want to kill myself before my appointment even comes. The thought of missing homework from school while I'm gone freaks me the fuck out and I wish there was another option, but right now I just want to break into the locked pill box and swallow the whole bottle of tylenol my parents just bought for my older brother. 

Tylenol didn't work last time due to me going to get help before they fully kicked in, but next time I'm going to somehow restrain myself so I won't go for help. I don't want to be anxious anymore. I want to be normal.
