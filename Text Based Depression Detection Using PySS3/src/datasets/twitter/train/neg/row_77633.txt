My therapist told me today she thinks I keep myself depressedAnd she's right. I've never known who I'm supposed to be and still don't so I've slowly just sank into this existence and have close to no motivation to change. Plus since I still don't know who I'm supposed to be idk what I'm supposed to change into. I already pretty much knew this but still her saying that just makes me want to give up and die more. She pretty much said I have to be motivated to be motivated. I'm just getting to the point that I wish my family didn't care so I could just give up. I know I won't get better unless I have some motivation for life in general and life still just feels pointless and sad and I don't really have any motivation to achieve anything really important anymore in life so I just feel like doing a lot of drugs until I have nothing left, then just die.
I was thinking maybe if things get too bad I could just make it look like an accident then maybe it would be easier for family to get through it
My therapist basically said it'd be selfish to just give up or whatever and it probably is but I just don't know how long I can last like this especially if I have to be sober
