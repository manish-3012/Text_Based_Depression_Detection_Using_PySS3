Itâ€™s happened again and the pain is devastatingI lost my job a week after my dog died this past July and I did everything in my power to keep from sinking into depression.  I got a new puppy, and threw myself into the job search, optimistic that my luck was turning and Iâ€™d land a job and my life would turn around for the better.  Months later, no job, just constant rejection that Iâ€™ve experienced the last several years when Iâ€™ve been unemployed.  This time though I canâ€™t support myself, just getting unemployment benefits, no severance and I canâ€™t cover basic bills.  I have no relatives to stay with and I have nowhere to go.  I hate my life and canâ€™t get out of the discriminating field Iâ€™m in.  Iâ€™d rather die than go homeless.  I didnâ€™t work this hard in college to be constantly unemployed.  I truly have no idea what to do.
