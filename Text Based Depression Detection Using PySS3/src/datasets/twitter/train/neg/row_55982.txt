Tired of this wishy washy shit...Iâ€™m so tired of people telling me that there is gonna be a light at the end of the tunnel, that it will all get magically better, that I have a purpose... Itâ€™s all fake, itâ€™s all just an excuse to mask realityâ€™s crap, Iâ€™m done believing all this nonsense that people feed me, they say that they need me in this world, but for what? So they can feel good about themselves? Go fuck yourselves, you think Iâ€™m falling for that crap? Iâ€™ve been listening to that shit for over 2 years now, but Iâ€™m done... This anxiety is eating me up every hour of my life, I canâ€™t sleep, I canâ€™t eat, I canâ€™t even exercise anymore, which I was passionate about...

Tomorrow is the day I will disappear from the face of this Earth, and I am quite excited for an eternal rest... I wrote this down because why not? I have a few more hours left anyways, might as well do a lilâ€™ writing
