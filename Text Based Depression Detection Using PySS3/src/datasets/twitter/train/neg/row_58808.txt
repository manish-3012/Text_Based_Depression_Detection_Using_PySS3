I wrote my suicide noteI've been struggling with depression for years. I had my ups and downs. But these past months were a fucking hell. The suffering didn't go away, it only got worse.
I had some suicidal thoughts at first. After that it was the cutting and the self destructive behaviour.
The only moment of relief I had was when I've severed a vein.
It felt good. Really good. But obviously I wasn't successful.
Now, I've just finished to write my suicide note because I'm ready and tired of this nightmarish life. I only hope to succeed this time.

See you in another life guys.
