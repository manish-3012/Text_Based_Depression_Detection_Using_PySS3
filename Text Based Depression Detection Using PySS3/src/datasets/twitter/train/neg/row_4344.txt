Suicide is empoweringSuicide is like telling life, god and the powers that be Iâ€™m not going to take this anymore.  Itâ€™s like separating yourself from an abusive relationship.  Thatâ€™s why god doesnâ€™t like it.  He likes to keep us trapped in our lives so he can keep tormenting us, and doesnâ€™t like it when an individual has the courage to say enough.
