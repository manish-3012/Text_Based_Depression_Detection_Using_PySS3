Getting tired of this.Getting really tired of this.(life) 


I've been struggling with anxiety/depression/OCD/whatever for pretty much my whole life. I've always been able to control and manage it, until recently. Now I'm struggling with everything at once, so I rapidly go from numb, to suicidal, to anxious, to feeling absolutely nothing and ghosting around life. That makes it very hard to even describe my symptoms to my therapist or psychiatrist, let alone find a solution. 


I've talked to my parents about this, and they just say the old "one day at a time" or "Do this. Get out more, etc." The problem is that I have anhedonia, meaning that I feel little or no pleasure in things. My mom wants me to do a craft with her, and she gets mad when I don't want to go out, even though she's lived with depression and should understand more. Going out or doing certain things like that can increase my anxiety, but I guess I'm just "lazy..." Maybe I have a different form of depression then she had, but it's really frustrating feeling bad about yourself and then  hearing "You don't like being bored, but you don't like anything. What do you want to do with yourself..." I just can't ever feel good doing anything or nothing. I said that this wouldn't change until I get a medication that works for me, but they still don't understand...


If this never changes, then why bother with life? I'm getting sick of every day being the same general random negative feelings.
By the way, I'm in high school if you wonder what my age is.

Just needed to say this to someone.
