don't really see the pointi'm a 20 year old that was born into poverty. me, my mom, and my brother all live off of my mom's disability checks from the govt. and SNAP benefits. i feel like i'm too poor to do anything and as if i'm going to be trapped in poverty forever. i don't have the drive to get an education i couldn't afford anyway so what's the point of even being alive? everyday i wake up and do the same shit every single day. been on wellbutrin for almost two months now and haven't noticed a difference in my mood. poverty feels like being trapped inside an infinitely deep well. i'm too embarrassed of my financial situation to make friends or be in a relationship. right now i'm too bitchmade to off myself but i feel like soon i'll finally have enough of this shit. i'm so tired of life
