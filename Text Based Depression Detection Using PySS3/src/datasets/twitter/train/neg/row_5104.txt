Help on either end of thisI checked my wife into a behavioural health ward at a local hospital after she begged me to drive her to her old home in california so she could kill herself there. She wanted me to hold her while she shot herself because she didn't want to die alone and scared and told me that by refusing i was actively making her life worse. I got her to agree to get treatment but the treatment facility i wasn't as nice as they had said it would be. They've taken everything away from her and will only allow her an hour of visitng time a day, no personal belongings, no sensodyne toothpaste which she needs because her teeth are so sensitive that other types hurt her. They only allow the news on in the day room and aren't cooperating on allowing her to have her phone. Her dad is in hospice for als and has maintained use of one hand but can no longer talk, he texts her frequently but cant do that if they wont let her have her phone. He's not got long left..Im not managing my own depression and ptsd well without her and she whispered "help me" into the phone before she hung up on our last call. Im freaked out and actively feel guilty and like i want to self harm.
