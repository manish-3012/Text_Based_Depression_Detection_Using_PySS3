A chance to be honest.I first got sincere suicidal thoughts earlier this year. For a couple of years I casually thought 'I'd do it if my parents weren't alive' but it never manifest itself really. This year though, emotions have been overpowering. I'm easily pushed to tears and I sometimes feel this distinct physical sensation. It's like someone is putting pressure all over my body, but particularly my brain. My stomach feels lighter and I feel weak too when this happens. I don't know what to make of that, or if it's a common thing. I've taken it as an indicator of suicidal thought, compared to usual sadness. I feel a little pressure on the mind now. I sometimes cut myself, though I have dull, small knives and a dislike of pain, so it's never remotely serious, just gives light relief.

I didn't do it earlier in the year because I lacked a good enough method. There are sites online which objectively outline them, and few of them appealed. I desired very high fatality and something inconspicuous. The closest thing I found would be to travel to some infamous cliffs and jump off - not guaranteed to work because of patrols, and also would involve a day of travelling, too much for someone lacking energy and I'm quite uncomfortable with travel too. However, I believe I have a method now: water intoxication, caused by the quick consumption of a large amount of water. I don't even need to leave my room, takes a comparatively short time, and it'll be a while before discovery. Perfect.

Why do I feel this way? At first, it was just too overwhelming to think about. I think I recognise now the key problems: loneliness and pointlessness. I posted a couple of months ago here, asking people to tell me why to live and frankly no answer really got me. Something about making meaning makes zero sense in this mind. I have no real talent (I study an essentially useless degree I'm losing interest in), no plan, no conception of the future, nothing to aspire to. This negates any reason to do things, and so I'm having serious problems with productivity or anything constructive. This will eventually create a worse future than I have now. I can deal with this slightly - â€œIf you don't know where you are going, any road will get you there" makes sense but is very unsatisfactory because the roads are all awful.

Loneliness is probably the bigger problem. Some of my earliest memories are of me as a little boy standing at the edge of the playground, watching others play, talk and be happy. It didn't make sense why people avoided me. Fortunately I was assimilated into big groups in primary and secondary schooling, though I never felt much connection to them. In college I was basically alone, a vague acquaintance from school I only saw on transport and that's it. (I started to entertain death around this time as I mentioned before). Currently at university, I do have one good friend, but who I feel I burden far too much - I provide nothing to her and spend most of the time being awkward at best,  and at worst making vague threats of suicide. She's actually lost people to it, and yet I feel nothing from that. I consider if I have a problem with empathy, long suspected I'm somewhere on the autistic spectrum. As I said, I haven't done it because I didn't have a sound method. Pain from the few family and friends I care for didn't factor in, nor did the potential life I could miss.

Another dimension to this loneliness is that I've never been in a relationship. This really gets to me. If I could find someone to just hug for hours I think I would be happier. I want to care for and be cared by someone who understands. I want to break out of nothingness and have someone willing to guide me through experiencing the world. The great tragedy is that it will never happen. Too pessimistic? I have no social skills, I'm pretty uninteresting, unattractive, from a poor background with no connections and I'm obviously very unstable, probably mentally ill. Horrible irony, I would be suspicious of anyone who I actually appealed to! But, even more problematic, I really doubt my sexuality now. This is difficult but I'll try. Whenever I think about it, I usually end up crying, frustrated, headaches.  So of course, I figure maybe I'm on the right lines. Without going into unneeded detail, I learned about same-sex relations alongside straight ones simultaneously, and so didn't have any problem conceiving of both until I was put into that environment hostile to anyone different. I repressed it for many years. There's a further terrible issue which, despite my choice of title, I do not wish to elaborate on - but maybe you can extrapolate what I might mean there. And also, I seriously doubt 90% of people I know would be remotely accepting if it turns out Iâ€™m different. But, in spite of this, I'm not convinced either way. Do I even have sexuality? Blanket terms don't work - I think I would have no objections to any genders people identify with I think, so as the person was great and accepting? Having never been close to a relationship, it's just baseless guesswork. Or, maybe this is all just the result of the experimental clichÃ©s of university, or having a close bisexual friend who I idolise and mimic too much as is. At any rate, it's immensely frustrating and I want freedom.

I realise this is long and rambling. I tried to submit something yesterday but it was even less coherent and madman-ish than this. This was principally an exercise to help me express myself, given that I have no opportunity to do so in the daily life. However, there are some things I wish to know, and I posted here because I figured you would be the best at answering:

* How valid is water intoxication? It seems too good to be true to me and strangely accessible if it really works.
* Is there any documented physical sensation that accompanies suicidal thoughts?
* Has anyone else faced purposelessness and/or loneliness, how did they improve, can you be happy with them?
* Why don't I empathise with the potential pain of those few around me?
* Can you know your sexuality before experience of it? If so, why don't I?
* How do you meet people? I hate clubs/bars/pubs and tried some university societies but people genuinely seem to hate me on sight, or after I say a few words. This ruins any chance I have at improvement in making friends, let alone partners.
* I asked in a thread before, see if the answers remain the same: why do you personally choose life? 

In the event that someone out there has actually read all that, thank you for your time. I have to hide myself on a daily basis so it's been refreshing to do this. Also it was a bit embarrassing though - it might take me a while to respond to messages, if I choose to do so at all. But I will read everything, as you've done. Thank you.
