Seriously considering suicide again,Throughout my life, I've had a desire to help people, and change the world. I've lived that life for as long as I can remember. I genuinely want to see the best for the other. The world. Each and every person. All I've run into is push back, every company I've worked with and friend that I've had try to help me. I'm homeless living in my car and I cannot catch a break. My family is ripped to shreds and I'm the last one standing. I've pushed so hard to do real hard work and I only get abuse and made fun of. I can't seem to find anyone who can deal with how unstable I am, I've been through shit like anyone else but I'm trying. I just got kicked out for being too much of a victim. Hah. Yet that's all I've been my entire life so maybe I have a problem with it sure, just like I have trust issues from my ex gfs cheating on me and lying to me. Is it really my fault I have trouble coping with others inability to be genuine? I can't take this anymore, I'm at my breaking point, I have been but it's finally breaking and I cannot stop it .
I don't think death will be all that bad, it would mean I wouldn't have to worry about all the shit I have no control over. There's nothing icando while being alive, so far all I've done is fuckup , relationships, jobs, friendships, everything. I fuck up everything I touch. I think it's time to fuck myself up.
