In breaking all over again.I'm hurting to people closest to me. Each of them say the same thing,  how they feel like they're walking on eggshells around me,changing how they act to make me feel better. I'm a fucking burden. 

I'm failing in my education, stagnating in my passions, hurting my lived ones. I don't really see a reason to keep going. 

Emotionally I feel soo cold and empty.
