Im 16 and i want to kill myselfMy parents believe that I'm a burden and refuse to get me help. I attempted suicide when I was 13. My parents sent me to an outpatient care facility, and I stayed there for a month. The therapist there believed my mom over me. My mom convinced my therapist that I was faking it and that my phone was the problem.

I live a sedentary lifestyle. Iâ€™m homeschooled, and I have no friends besides the 26 year old man who sexually groomed me when I was 15. Crazy.

I have the prerogative to change my mind and become proactive, but right now, I feel so lost and unworthy.

Ive been cutting my thighs for awhile now and i think the right plant of action is to slit my throat or cut open my legs.
