I can't balance this, please help.This post is not for me, I am not suicidal. I am simply scared and worried. One of my friends committed suicide a few hours back. He left a note saying that the people he knew are why there is no hope for humanity. Now, this would normally be bad enough. But add this: one of my friends (guy) feels guilty and is talking to me about killing himself. His girlfriend is frantically texting me trying to find out what is wrong, and I don't know what to say. I cannot afford to say the wrong thing because she used to cut and the wrong trigger could ruin my life. Another one of my friends is threatening with suicide because his grandmother just died of leukemia, and this. That covers all the friends that I have, can I get advice on what to say to them?
