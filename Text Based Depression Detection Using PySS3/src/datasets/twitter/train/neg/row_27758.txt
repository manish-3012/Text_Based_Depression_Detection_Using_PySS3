I don't know if I'll make it to 30. I've wanted to die since I was 13.I'm 28 now. When I was 13 I tried to hang myself, but my dad stopped me. They got me a therapist and it made me feel better for a short time. I realized I'm still a loser after talking to them. Their words change nothing.

It doesn't help knowing my life was stolen from me because of my looks. I grew up around two very attractive people. My bro didn't need to say anything and girls would walk right up to him. My mother would get stopped often and complemented on how beautiful she is. Me? I've had people say they thought I had down syndrome.

I was never picked for teams or groups. When I finally had 'friends' I was the butt of everyone's joke. Being ugly spills over into all aspects of life. What point is there  to be a wage slave and come home to nothing? What point is their to finish college? What do I have to look forward to? I'm almost finished and my grades have tanked. My 3.6 is now a 2.1 and I don't even give a shit. I've tried that better yourself bullshit and think positive. It only made my situation worse.

People mocked me for even trying. I cold approached women after hitting the gym for a year and was mocked and rejected. I had friends who never hit the gym, fat, negative as fuck and they get a mate. It's bullshit!! I do own a love doll. We've been together for 2 years, but it's just putting a small bandage over a decapitated leg. I just wanted to vent. No one can help me. I'm trapped in this genetic prision.
