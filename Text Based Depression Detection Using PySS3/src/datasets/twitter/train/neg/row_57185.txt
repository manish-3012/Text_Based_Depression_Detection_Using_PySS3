Can't cope with lossSomeone very close to me disowned me 4 years ago. We talked again recently, were friendly for a few weeks, before he disowned me again. I don't want to go into why or who the person is. It hurts so much.
I attempted suicide the last time this happened. Rented a motel room and burned charcoal, passed out, but the motel had a carbon monoxide detector and I was rescued. It had been 4 years, while the pain from the loss never healed, I learned to cope with it, and when we started talking again I thought the pain was finally over. Now its back in full force.

I find myself contemplating suicide again. The fact that this person would do this to me twice tells me he shouldn't be in my life, but I care about him like family. I don't have any friends and just feel so lonely. I have a bad anxiety disorder, so making friends has been a challenge my whole life. I just graduated college and am about to start a new job and need to stop being such a wreck.
