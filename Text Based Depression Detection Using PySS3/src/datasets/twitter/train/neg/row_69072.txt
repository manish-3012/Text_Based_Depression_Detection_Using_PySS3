Should I tell my husband that his brother is suicidal?I'm 20, my husband is 22, and his brother is 25. His brother left his home state with his 3 yr old child to our home after he split with his wife. He's always been suicidal and threatens to kill himself. Well it happened at my house now. He left to work walking &lt;his job is 50 miles away&gt; and it's cold outside. He messaged me saying he was suicidal and that hes a burden. He also said he isnt coming back until tomorrow. His wife that he supposedly separated  from messaged me saying hes been threatening to kill himself and talking crazy. I find it crazy because we've done so much for him. We've paid for everything for 4 months when he was living here and paid for his sons diapers and wipes when we need to do the same for my daughter. I make home made meals for him and I washed his dishes. I even drove him to work at 5 am and picked him up afterwards and not pay for gas. We've done so much for him and I feel dumb. Idk if hes acting this way because I told him he needs to get a car by jan 3 and to start washing his own dishes. Btw hes been here for 10 months. Idk now if I should tell my husband because I told my brother in law that i wouldnt tell my husband.... sounds obvious what I should do but I need advice to know I'm going to do the right thing or if I'm going to break his trust.
