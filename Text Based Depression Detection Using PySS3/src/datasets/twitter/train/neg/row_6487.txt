Cat ProblemI've been trying to hang on and not end my life, out of concern for my cat. He's been a great comfort, but it's not enough. I feel really guilty for leaving him, but I can't go on. 

I'm entirely alone otherwise. I probably won't be found for at least 2 weeks. Do you think he'll live? I'll leave some dry food out, and the door open. 

I can't tip-off anyone to what I'm going to do, and I can't take him anywhere because of my crippling agoraphobia. It's the only thing worrying me. I'm so done.
