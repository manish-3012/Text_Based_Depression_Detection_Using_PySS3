I'm so tiredI was molested when I was around 6 by my cousin ( and again when I was 13 by a different person). I'm 14 now. I feel so messed up. My father spoke to my mother about getting me therapy, and she said she would. She still hasn't done anything yet. I don't think she believes it happened. I have flashbacks and sometimes nightmares of it and it's terrifying and I feel so disgusting and dirty.  I don't want to be like this. I just want to live a normal life. I just want to be normal. Suicide is the only way I can get rid of the flashbacks and nightmares. I can't do it though. I'm too much of a coward.
