I Just Need Some Kind WordsHello. I am using a throw away account on this post because I am a coward and I have nowhere else to go. I want to kill myself. So bad. Itâ€™s awful and I know that itâ€™s going to hurt a lot of people if I do which is why Iâ€™m not planning anything right now. Now, I know that makes me lower priority than some of the other people here but I hope at least someone can give me some kind words. 

I am 16 and in high school. I feel so alone and scared and so fucking depressed. I have struggled with depression for many years now and I thought I had finally recovered from self harm. I cut myself pretty deep a couple times on two occasions in the past 24 hours and I can feel myself getting worse. Iâ€™ve attempted before and I can feel myself getting to that point again. None of my friends care and I really donâ€™t want to burden my girlfriend with this. Reddit, I feel so alone and so scared and I just want this to stop. I know youâ€™ve probably read the same thing a million times and I know that I am no different from anyone. I have nowhere to turn to and I just donâ€™t want to be me anymore. I just want all of this to be over. My hips, where I cut, hurt so bad and I know I deserve it. 

I just want to feel less alone. I just need to know that someone out there cares. I know I donâ€™t deserve any of your time or energy and Iâ€™m probably an asshole for even asking for it but Iâ€™m so convinced at this point that I am nothing and I mean nothing to the world that this is the last place I can think to go. Iâ€™m sorry. I hope whoever is reading this has a good day, though. I hope you have a better day than I am.
