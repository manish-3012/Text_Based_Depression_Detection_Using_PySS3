I would seriously kill myself if I didn't have anyone holding me back.Every single day of my life, all I think about is how and when will I kill myself. I'm tired of living, and I'm sick of everything. But there are people who care about me. And I think I should feel grateful about that, but I can't, since I'm being held back from hurting myself because of them.

It pains me to imagine how my siblings and my boyfriend would deal with my death. I don't want to hurt anyone by ending my life, but living is getting even more and more unbearable now. 

I just want to die and have everyone forget me.
