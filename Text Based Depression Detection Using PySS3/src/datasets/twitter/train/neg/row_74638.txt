Not really sure what to do or where to goHey everyone, I may not be as rock bottom as a lot of other but I still am not sure where to go, so I apologize for taking your time. 

So I moved 3 years ago and finished my last year of high school in the new place. The whole time I hated it and made a plan to get back home. 

6 months ago I was diagnosed with a  disease making me go blind. I went through some surgeries to help but ended up still becoming blind in my left eye. I'm not sure how relevant that is but I suppose I'm venting. 

Anyway I made it back home 4 weeks ago when I started college. It's been going okay I guess but I noticed I still feel hopeless like I did before I moved. Before I moved I kept telling myself it would be better once I got home, but it hasn't and that scares me. 

Now I'm away from my brother and parents and i have no idea what to do or who to talk to about any of this.
