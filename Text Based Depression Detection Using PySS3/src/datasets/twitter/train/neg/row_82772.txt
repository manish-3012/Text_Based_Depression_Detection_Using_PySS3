i would just like some help...To put things in context, Iâ€™ve had a chronic illness for 11 years. I donâ€™t let my illness hinder me (people have much worse and still manage to survive) but just because of how my illness makes me look (which honestly is just  underage) itâ€™s really messed up important aspects of my life like job opportunities, relationships (all types not just intimate) including the one with family and my mental health immensely. Iâ€™ve been suicidal on and off from 11 y/o and it doesnâ€™t help that my family are those people who donâ€™t believe in those things. And yea I have friends but I have so much built up baggage that I find it hard to believe that they actually arenâ€™t tired of me. I try v hard not to be offensive or rude (because I know Iâ€™m already easily disliked due to my boomer mindset, childish looks and social awkwardness) but I still feel (too often) that everyone hates me (even if theyâ€™re strangers) no matter what, and that Iâ€™m just here to be used. But I donâ€™t have anything to offer anymore and I seriously just want to give up. I feel like my absence would bring so much good but I also think itâ€™s kinda unfair that the only happiness I can have is through death. Still, Iâ€™m seriously open and desperate for the help tbh Iâ€™m tired of suffering.

TL;DR: sad underage looking female is treated lesser because of reasons she canâ€™t control and is wondering if thereâ€™s any reason she shouldnâ€™t just end it all
