ive written a note to my friends and everythingi dont know. i just feel like im wrong a lot. my abusive (mentally, emotionally and physically) parents told me that a lot. that my existence was wromg and that im the devil incarnate. i was quite literally a mistake. i finally got help for it a short while ago. but ive put my relationship with my brothers at a complete standstill. they hate me. our parents never hurt them. and now i find it so hard to find anyone who does like me. i had 3 online friends. 1 said i was too obsessive. so we havent talked properly in about 2 weeks i think. the other two are nice, but they arent here, which isnt meaning im not grateful for them. im just so empty and alone. im 18. i should be with friends having parties and drinking and having fun. instead im trying to pick up the pieces of a broken home. i cant even properly provide enough for my brothers. i can just about afford food. ive been denied a loan twice. ive been turned down from too many jobs. i cant drive to get to any place. ive turned to doing the most demeaning stuff just to give my brothers 2 meals a day.  if i give up, my brothers get a better childhood. they dont have to remember me and hopefully can live normal lives. i want to give up
