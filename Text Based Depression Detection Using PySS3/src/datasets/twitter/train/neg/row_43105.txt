Is poverty no reason to kill yourself?Poverty sucks, especially when you know its impossible to get out of poverty. But i know i will be poor in the future. The reason is simple, disability. If i am completely unable t owork then i will be very poor in the future. But even unskilled work doesn't make you wealthy. And thats the main problem here. I Can't get a better education because it's too hard for me. My future looks very bleak without an education right? Or i am wrong?
