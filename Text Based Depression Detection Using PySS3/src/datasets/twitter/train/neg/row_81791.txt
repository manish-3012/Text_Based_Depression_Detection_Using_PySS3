I don't feel like I should be aliveIt's always one thing after the next. I'm turning twenty in two months. Ever since I was a kid I was torn down by everyone and everything. There's nothing left. I have a great boyfriend, I guess that's something. He's everything though, and today, dear Jesus, I forgot to turn off the oven and came back home from work with him to a smoke filled house. He's pissed at me and won't hug me or tell me he loves me or anything. The cold shoulder hurts. When it's from your favourite person it hurts more. I don't want to be alive. I don't want to keep going. I know that when he walks down these stairs he's going to say , " this isn't working" we were already rocky. This is definitely what is going to push him over the edge and I can't deal with anymore heartbreak. I've been hurt far too many times and it won't stop. It's always one thing after another. I can't do this. What if I do something stupid and he comes downstairs and says he loves me, and I'm not here anymore. Then what. I don't want him feeling guilty. And him possibly leaving isn't the reason I don't want to live. I'm just sick of being such a fuckup that everyone around me gets hurt, annoyed, or just angry. I'm sick of making others miserable because of me. I can't do it. It's always one thing after the next.
