Worst LuckI have terrible luck with finding people on here to talk/rant to. I have posted on here a couple times before and have been talking to some people, but most just stop replying. 

Last time I posted was a month ago. Long story short, I have been suicidal since I was in 5th grade. I have tried killing myself multiple times. I hate everything about that part of my life. I have to hide the way I feel every day to fit in with everyone else. I play video games to forget about the thoughts I have.

I think about killing myself 24/7. I have dreams about it, I think about while in my classes, I think about it everywhere. If I am in a tall building I think of jumping, if I am driving I think of just running into anything and everything. I have slit my wrists and I tried to hang myself.

I have being to multiple counselors, I have seen psychiatrists, I have been on 4 different kinds of medicine. 

I am ready to give up. Almost 10 years of thinking of killing myself. I really don't want this to go on.
