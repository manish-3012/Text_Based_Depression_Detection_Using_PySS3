I really really really need help guys.Iâ€™m not suicidal but my best friend is. Sheâ€™s tied noose to her bed frame, told me how she canâ€™t take it anymore, how she just wants to kill herself and I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. Iâ€™ve tried talking to her but she wonâ€™t talk to me she keeps brushing it off saying itâ€™s just a joke but I know itâ€™s not a joke. I really really want to get in her shoes and know what sheâ€™s feeling because I want to help her so freaking bad but it seems she doesnâ€™t want help. Can anyone explain to me what it feels like to be suicidal, I know that makes me sound stupid and I hope no one gets offended by that but I really want her to get help. How can I get her help if she wonâ€™t talk about it? I feel like i need to tell someone but itâ€™s hard because I donâ€™t know who to tell. Sheâ€™s beyond the help of our school counselor and my parents will want to help but I canâ€™t muster up the courage to tell them because I feel like they wonâ€™t believe me. I know I need to tell someone and I feel like if I wait too long and she does kill herself then itâ€™s going to be my fault and I could not live with myself knowing ya it could have prevented it. Please help me!!!
