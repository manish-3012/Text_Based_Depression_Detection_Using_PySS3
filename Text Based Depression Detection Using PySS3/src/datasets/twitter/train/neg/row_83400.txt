Suicide is just calling my name...Iâ€™m 18, I cut off all friends, but I have close to no friends to begin with and I cut off all my social medias (no one can track down my name on the internet). Depression has caused this, and nothing is giving me joy like it used to. I donâ€™t even enjoy waking up, I just want to sleep for a very long time. Even if I change my lifestyle like going to school, socializing a little, eating healthy food, and exercising, depression still comes to haunt me at the end of the day. Itâ€™s been like that since 12. At this point, it seems like I will have some form of depression in the future. I know itâ€™s wrong to think this way but Iâ€™ve read peopleâ€™s posts of how they had depression since their young teens and still have it as an adult, some up to their 30s and 40s. It makes sense why I would have it at that age. I canâ€™t fucking live like that. This has been the worst year of my life, I canâ€™t even finish high school without fucking up my grades due to intense depressive episodes.
