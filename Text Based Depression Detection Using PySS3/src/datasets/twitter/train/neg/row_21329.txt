My roommate is suicidal. Don't know how to help himI've been suicidal in the past. Recently to but not in the curgent moment. Yesterday and this past week he's told me that he's been suicidal for a while know and he attempted suicide last year. Whenever I mention that I'm hear for him and all of our grinds care for him it seems to just go over his head. He file a concerned persons report on himself last semester but it doesn't seem like it helped much and I'm not sure what else to do at this point.
