No one in my life understands how hard it is for me to keep living everydayEveryday I try so hard just to stay alive. Just to keep going. To make it to the next day. But I don't know if it is worth it at all. I don't know how much longer I can go on failing at everything in my life. I don't know how I've made it this long. 

I don't want to hurt the people I love. My friends. My family. But I'm hurting so much all the time. I feel like I'm constantly drowning in my own emotions. 

My friends think I'm fine, my family does too. Whenever I try to tell them how I feel, they all just tell me it will get better. This too shall pass...but it hasn't. I've felt this way since I was a child. I've felt out of place and like I don't belong. 

I don't even remember what it is like to actually be happy anymore. Hell, I don't know if I ever have been truly happy. 

Everyone always calls suicide the easy way out, and maybe it is. But idk if I can do it, but it looks like the better option everyday. 

I just am so tired of drifting through life. I'm so tired of failing at everything I do. I'm tired of pretending to be fine. I'm just tired. 

But at the end of the day the only thing that keeps me living is knowing that I can't hurt my family or friends like this.
