How to speak with persons.i am very drunk and just want to talk to a human being. I spoke with the mirror, but after 40 minutes i felt like a loser piece of shit. How do I find people to talk to? I want to speak to someone, can you tell me a chat I can call? I want to be honest without being tracked. I am not going to kill self right now, but I am need to talk about my thoughts. I don't want to regret this in the morning. How do I do this? I don't have friends. I cannot call anyone in real life. :( I am sorry for shit post. :( I just feel so lonely. I don't know what to do anymore. I will delete this in the morning, I am sure...but I cannot go through this drunkenness without another person. :( I just slammed my head into the chair, hahahaha.
