my notes on hopewe all have things that make us hopeful. people. places. memories. 

but hope is poison.

it's like bad glue.

you use it to fix all of the broken pieces of yourself, to put yourself back together. you think you're able to carry on without falling apart because of it, but it never works and you always end up exactly where you began, in pieces.

and sometimes, you give your hope away to someone, who takes it away for themselves. 

hope is like a broken instinct we have to carry on. that there's always going to be something good around the corner, if you just wait. that when you hit rock bottom, the only way is up. that we all have people who truly care about us.

none of this is true. this is idealisation. maybe it helps you, because something good was around the corner. maybe your life went uphill, maybe someone showed how much they truly cared about you.

but for most of us, it is just a broken instinct. and eventually, though this might not make a whole lot of sense to someone who hasn't experienced it,

you lose hope in the idea of hope itself, because it's never done anything for you apart from dragging you down further.
