I'm tired of being told I'm autistic. I'm tired of being told I have a disability. I'm a brainy and introverted kid, and I fucking hate this label.Sorry, this is going to be one long ramble, but it's still gotta happen.  And sorry if you find this hurtful, I didn't mean it but this is just *very* personal to me, and I may definitely say some things that aren't the nicest.

When I was a kid, I was diagnosed as gifted. I loved it. When I turned 13, I ended up in the youth psych ward because I couldn't make it in regular high school. I was diagnosed as autistic. Big difference. Now I'm told various things by the system like ''I've got extremely mild autism, I've got Asperger's, I'm high-functioning.'' I'm being taught life skills and how to be normal. Just jargon that I can't get a clue on. But I'm trying to live an intellectual life, and think of myself as gifted, because deep down I strongly feel that way. Doing that is, I'm pretty sure, the only reason I'm sane, and maybe the only reason why I'm not in a dark place right now. 

I know I'm an intellectual because I spend hours learning a bunch of different things, creating ideas, blogging, writing, talking, learning programming, reading, thinking, exercising my mind. That's all I care about, and I feel like I'm nothing but starved without it. 

And when I'm 'taught' small talk, and told I have a disability, and told I have autism and yada yada, it feeds my deep social awkwardness and negative traits and insecurities I guess, which I feel like need a supportive environment to overcome, which obviously I'm not getting by anyone, except my parents. Welcome to the real world. 

Anyway, I feel like I'm fighting and rebelling against a system that's really foolishly trying to help me. I get it that I'm behind in some ways, and I get it that I'm struggling with that, like my motor skills and that I can't pronounce some things. 

But telling me I'm autistic and disabled denies how I truly feel about myself, almost like this [article](http://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CB4QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.salon.com%2F2013%2F09%2F21%2Fthats_not_autism_its_simply_a_brainy_introverted_boy%2F&amp;ei=I18wVZjMBIKxogSwsoHgAg&amp;usg=AFQjCNGXSb_AEyE0u0Oy8h3gK7ceAqEszw&amp;sig2=q4OTFE-ZgdYlupuXkrnHug) I read here, and denying me my gifts. I'm fucking tired of having a persona that I can't fight, and I feel like calling me that is an insult to some autistic people who do need help. I don't operate by psychiatric jargon, and everyone else I know does. 

Don't tell me to see my psychiatrist, because he's the guy who is the guy at the root of my pain and fear (ironic, I know), and I don't like him at all. I have biases against psychiatrists, with good reason. He's damaged me in innumerable ways.

I get fucking autism government money for crying out loud, and I hate it. I'm a disgrace. I can't fight it. My dream of being accepted for my gifts and visions and talents are broken. I'm paranoid, depressed over this whole complexity I guess. 

So, as the teenage kid I am, I'm on the brink of losing my mind of this issue. It's really scary. I'm gonna admit I'm getting alienated over talking to the people who I thought were supposed to guide me and care about me, and more than anything I'm trying to avoid the system and can't even look into myself, like the dark parts because of it. And maybe their relationship with me is just shit after all. 

All I wanted was to have my gifts, visions, and sensitivities, to be embraced and identified, but it's broken. I'm labelled how I never wanted to be. That, to me, is how you reject my authenticity as a person.
