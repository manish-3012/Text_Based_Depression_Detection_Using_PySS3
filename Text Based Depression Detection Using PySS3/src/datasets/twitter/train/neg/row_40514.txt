My doctor has boosted my anti-depressants from 100mg to 150mg and I have to go to the mental health centre at my local hospital today! This does not make me feel better.This makes me feel worse. I only started the 100mg a month ago and now my doctor has put me on 150mg! I told him everything about the fact that I've been crying every night and I have planned suicide. He recommended that I go back to the mental health centre and that way, my therapy wait time would be boosted. 

I'm just not in the mood for this, i don't want to sit in a hospital for hours just to say to someone that I'm depressed and suicidal and they won't care. I've already did it once and i just can't do it again. I was nervous and scared last time.

All of this just shows me that I'm just messed up and I can't be fixed! I hate my life!
