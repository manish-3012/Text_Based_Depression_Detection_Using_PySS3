Stopped meds, became an expat. What could go wrong?It all started about two and a half years ago. Life was doing great, everything was mostly good... then I started experiencing some hip pain. I had to stop going to the gym, stop hanging out as much, modify my lifestyle to be more sedentary and even tough I did not notice at first, it was slowly taking me down every day, just a little bit at a time. 

Fast forward about a year after that, I had no motivations. This was of course reflected in my job and my low productivity happened to cause somebody else in my team, with less experience, to be promoted to team lead. According to the doc, I had dysthymia... this event turned it into a full-blown depression. For the first time in my life, I would not even get out of bed on a work day. Even tough I was in bad shape, I knew I needed the professional kind of help, so I sought it. 

I quit my job, and I was about 4 months on antidepressants. Just as I started feeling better I took the stupid shitty decision of looking for a job abroad. I happened to find one in a country halfway around the world, where I don't speak the local language, where the disconnect between my culture and theirs is rather large, far from everything that I know or care about. 

I have nothing to look forward to. Alcohol helps numb the pain, but it does not make it go away. 

Lately, suicidal thoughts have been pervasive. They are there each day. A life that cannot be enjoyed is not a life worth living. We are too many already, right?. One less will not be missed. What if I take all those pills at the same time?. Just one step in the underground station is all it takes.

Is there any reason to go on?
