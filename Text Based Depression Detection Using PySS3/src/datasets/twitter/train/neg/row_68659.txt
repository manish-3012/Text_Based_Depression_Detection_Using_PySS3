Iâ€™m Killing MyselfIâ€™m done with life. Iâ€™m done with flashbacks from my horrible past and a shitty life thatâ€™s not getting better. And it wonâ€™t. So donâ€™t tell me it will. You donâ€™t know my circumstances. I hate having to delete my posts because Iâ€™m embarrassed that it gets no attention compared to other stupid shit people say. Iâ€™m sick of it. I have no family. Friends. Iâ€™m forced to live a lifestyle that makes me feel disgusting. And out of all of this mess all I wanted was to feel loved. Seeking validation from men on the internet because Iâ€™m too pathetic in real life. Iâ€™m not even good enough for the creeps. Nobody loves me. And I want this pain to be over.
