Tried to OverDoseLast night I tried to overdose by taking 50 100mg of anti depressant and 30 1mg anti anxiety medication. However, when I woke up, all I noticed was vomit. So is it safe to assume my attempt failed and there shouldn't be any side effects. I had another anti depressant as well, but I did not take them (150mg). The reason i don't know.
