I want to kill myself for not having a tumorTo the point - I've spent the last few months being tested to make sure that my enlarged pituitary gland was secreting hormones that would explain my deep depression, anxiety, weight gain, ect. I was prepared for surgery for next week when all of a sudden my doctor says that the tumor is actually causing nothing and is more like a cyst. So all my laziness, my perpetual tiredness no one can explain is all my fault. I was so hopeful about this surgery that I stopped taking my depression medication. Turns out, that was a mistake. I skipped work today and the thought of going makes me cry even harder. I don't want to wake up. I'm playing with sharp objects against my wrist. I don't know what to do.
