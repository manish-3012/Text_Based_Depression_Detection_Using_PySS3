How to enjoy anything again?So I have severe depression and anxiety and, as some of us are aware, depression literally prevents us from finding enjoyment in life. I've spent the past 18 years playing the "let's try this anti-depressant" game and out of those 18 years there was only one medicine whose effect only last for two years that made me feel "normal" in that I was able to wake up and be capable of being in a happy mood. All the other time I've just been in Limbo Land or the Valley of Desired Death.

My issue, or question really, is how does one find enjoyment when nothing brings enjoyment? I mean literally nothing brings me any sense of enjoyment. Everything that at one time made me even the slightest bit happy is gone. I do things nowadays not because I'm enjoying it but simply out of routine or the false hope that I'll actually enjoy it again.

Granted, my depression is at its worst and the various new meds I've tried have only made things worse in one area or another. I already have plans to kill myself that I've slowly been prepping for but I would like it if I didn't feel that that was the best option to me. My doctor, my family, and my life in general isn't helping any of this and quite literally none of it will even be possible to change for reasons that are a bit out of my control and that is its own story as to why.

So, long story short, how does one find enjoyment when all enjoyment is dead? Should I just force myself to do things that should be good for me for the possible and slim chance it might improve things? You know like eating healthy, exercising routinely, attempting to be social - all things I stopped even considering much less even doing what with the current prep work and future plans I've put my thought into.

Depression is the destroyer of hope. Any hope "might" help as I've none left at all and this is a first for me and it's not going away even after all these months.
