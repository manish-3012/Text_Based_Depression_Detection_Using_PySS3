Just Got Fired. Lost faith in myselfI just got fired and could use help. I don't know who to turn to but it was from an outsourcing IT company. The client wanted me removed. I worked pretty hard but the results did not show. I have little faith in myself now and could use help. I already lost hope in myself.

I read a quote "Suicide does not end the pain, it gives it to someone else" I do not want this to happen. I do want the pain to end.
