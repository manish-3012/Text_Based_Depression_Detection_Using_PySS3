Iâ€™ve started crying in classI havenâ€™t seen my real friends in a long time. I donâ€™t think they are my friends anymore. I donâ€™t know if I want friends anymore. One of my teachers noticed me crying in class, but thankfully didnâ€™t call attention to it. Sheâ€™s trying to help me, but she reminds me of my stepmother who abused me and it makes me more anxious. Iâ€™m afraid of driving because it would be so easy to end it. When people smile around me it makes me want to puke. Two people were laughing about something in front of me in line for lunch. I imagined beating them to death, and it scared me. Iâ€™ve been seeing a therapist for a couple months now, but itâ€™s now my only time I can be myself. I need advice
