My tumor saved my familyBeen diagnosed with a bone tumor on my L1 vertebrae, luckily benign one but extremely painful and rare (osteoma osteoid) which took up to 3 years to get a proper diagnosis after years of morphine and NSAID. The surgery involved risks of vertebrae rupture and legs paralysis. At that time my mother suffered heavy drinking issues and dad suffered from chronic pain and stress due to that situation. The day of the surgery they both were so scared that they called the hospital 5 times to have news from me. The first thing i did when i woke up from the anaesthesia was to cry and saying "mom is drinking heavily and soon she'll be gone i wanna kill myself", and dreamed about this while I was getting the surgery. I called her when i was still very high and uninhibited from the anaesthesia and told her everything on my heart. When I came back home, both of them were super caring and was getting on well together. Since then she has quit drinking and dad is no longer closed on himself. I wasn't expecting that result, but the OR team did not only operate my spine, but also my hurt parents. I'll be forever thankful for that 3 years of extreme pain and to the whole team who did operate me if it was to finally be in peace again. 

I was hopeless after 12 years of living hell between her alcoholism and school bullying, now things do seem hopeful and I'm looking forward a better future. Keep on going step by step, you'll probably see the light like I did, at least you'll get more chance than if you were laid in a coffin. Wish you the best.
