My friend is suicidalMy friend keeps leaving our discord saying we all secretly hate him and aren't real friends. A new person joined yesterday and called him cringe and I think that pushed him over the edge and he changed his name to 'im gonna kill myself' on Twitter. We managed to get a message back from a DM and he said it's not a joke. I want to call the police and help him but I hear that can also make things worse. It's hard to get in touch with him and I just don't know what to do
