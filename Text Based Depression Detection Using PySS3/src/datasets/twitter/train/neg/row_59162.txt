I'm ruined, and for the first time in a long time, I cannot manage to cope.My husband has put me through the ringer.  I've recently discovered a lot of lies and deception and manipulation.  There's also been a one-sided emotional affair happening with someone very close to me. 

I feel like I'm in a hole that I just can't pull myself out of.  When I finally talk myself into the strength it takes just to get out of bed, I think about all of the other practical bullshit that I have to take care of in order to get back on my feet, and I lose my steam. 

I'm in this dark place and I'm having a really hard time finding a reason to keep on living.  I'm afraid to be alone.
