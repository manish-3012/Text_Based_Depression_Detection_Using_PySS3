Almost pulled the trigger 2 days agoAlmost pulled the trigger 2 days ago.

I made a huge mistake and lost a chunk of money (enough to make me homeless) gambling til about 7am in Vegas. 

When I got to the car I contemplated just ending it where I was parked. I ended up driving to a secluded park going between should I pull it or not. 

1. I was scared I would feel everything 
2. I have a family and I just didnâ€™t want them to find me like that 

I ended up driving myself home because I knew itâ€™d be so selfish of me to leave the ones I love over my own mistake. 

All I know is that I can bounce back from this. I have to look at the brighter picture and battle through this hardship. 

Iâ€™ve never been so determined to turn my life around because Iâ€™ve realized that there are more people that depend on me than I know. 

Excuse my rant, I just wanted to put this out there because I know somebody out there is feeling the same.

Just like many of you I am at the lowest of my lows. But Iâ€™ve made it this far whatâ€™s the point of giving up?
