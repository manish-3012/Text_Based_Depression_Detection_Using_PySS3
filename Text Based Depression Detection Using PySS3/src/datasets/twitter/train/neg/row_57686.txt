A titleI've been having thoughts about committing suicide but never go through with it which is good but I always think that my brother fucked up my breathing and made my asthma worse by smoking weed I'll never forgive him for that I was fine and using it maybe once every few month than he started smoking weed and it fucked my breathing up so much I wanted to kill myself and I have to use my inhaler like every fucking day now and I don't really know how I can really get to the point to where I was using my inhaler every few months
