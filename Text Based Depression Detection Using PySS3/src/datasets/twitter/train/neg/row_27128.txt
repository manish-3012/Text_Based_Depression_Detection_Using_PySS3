Why I am so depressed it hurts when I want to go but I have no way and has to work and can only take one day off and she can not drive far because of her engine light but I live in Georgia but one is another part of Georgia and I live 2 or 4 hours away and it sucks I have no way when I reallyI really want to do this for me and my life to get me off a fresh start in my life but the same with moving out of state i will have no way and nobody in another state i will be all alone in a state and my mom can not leave her job to help me. I want to do job corps but I donâ€™t have a way to get to it even though i signed up and is it some in Georgia? I really need this to get me on track but i also want to move out of Georgia when i get everything and this done with and over but i have no way to get there so if my mom can not take me or find me a way there then nobody will take me but nobody talks to me so it feels like i have nobody anymore more like i get rejected and ignored when i like people to be here for me so i guess i can never do nothing but i really want this to be a start but this is something i want to succeed.
