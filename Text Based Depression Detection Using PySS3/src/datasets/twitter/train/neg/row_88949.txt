Please donâ€™t do itIâ€™m posting this because I recently lost someone. They killed themselves. It was my ex and I was the last one to talk to her. She didnâ€™t say anything about thinking about doing it and now Iâ€™m just here. It hurts because I still love her, I wanted her to succeed in this world, but now that wonâ€™t happen. 

So please stop and think about all the people in your life, and realize that even if you donâ€™t think anyone will care, someone will.
