So tiredI unexpectedly had to take work leave a month ago and yesterday I realized no one from work has messaged me to see where I went. I've worked at this place for 3 years. At this point I'm just exhausted. I'm so tired from 30 years of a roller coaster life of being content and unbothered by how lonely I am, and then something like this hits me and I'm at rock bottom again. No one deserves to go through this, year after year after year after year. I can't do 50 more years of this. I can't.
