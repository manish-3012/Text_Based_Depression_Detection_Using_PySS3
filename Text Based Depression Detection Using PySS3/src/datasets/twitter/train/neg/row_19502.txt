Truly lost and aloneSlowly losing everyone in my life, I've been hemorrhaging friends and family for the past 6 years I'd say.

The only person in my family that still has any emotion for me is my aunty who I rarely even see anymore. I have next to no friends that I see anymore and even when I do I can tell they're itching to leave.

Recently my sister stopped speaking to me all together and wouldn't even look at me when I passed her in the street the other month. Heard my mom talking about my uncle who just died of cancer, heard her say how all the good ones die and how she wished it could have been me instead.

I didn't even get upset about it, because I agreed.

Never felt so afraid and alone in a long time, I'm so pathetic and realize how pathetic I sound. I just hope I can muster up the courage one day and end it.
