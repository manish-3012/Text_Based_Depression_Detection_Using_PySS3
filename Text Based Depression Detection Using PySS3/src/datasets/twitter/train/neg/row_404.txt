I just wanted to say itI think my problem is that I've always felt like an outsider. I used to think that if only someone would love me or be there for me then I'd finally be happy but that's not true..even though that hasn't really happened, I realized that I don't have anything to offer anyone that would make someone want to be with me.iThere is nothing about me that makes people fall in love with me.ive always been a placeholder, someone to be with and waste time with until someone better came along. I always hear that " until you love yourself no one will ever love you!!"
How the fuck can I love myself if nobody NOBODY has ever loved me? I wasnt even good enough for my family as a kid. I am a collosal disappointment.I'm almost 40 years old and I'm alone. Never married ,could not have kids. 
I missed out on all of the things that make you feel like a person
. I can't see that there is any reason to not kill myself at some point in the future and when I have enough or if something happens to me and I can't work anymore that's what I'm going to do.
I just wanted to say what I was feeling into the void. I don't want any advice
