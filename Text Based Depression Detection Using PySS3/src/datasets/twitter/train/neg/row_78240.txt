Another post that wont help me. I just want to share my thoughts I guessI've fucked up too much and I don't want to go on. I hate myself and I don't know why, I can't live without drugs, my parents have lost faith in me, I lost all my friends, and actually the funny thing is that as I typed that I realized that these things aren't what make me want to kill myself. I've wanted to kill myself since I was 15, when I had good friends and no drug experience and was getting good grades and my parents loved me. So I guess I'm just a shitty person huh. I just hate myself and that makes me self destructive? Or can it really be so simple that there's no reason at all and I can't find enough meaning to live? I don't know, these things are all I think about now. Wake up, go to work, come home go to bed, and all the when I'm thinking of why I feel such a longing to stop existing
