Want a friend?I need friends, I feel bad, we can talk about stuff and not being toxic. What about best friends? You might be far but I don't really care. I just need someone to talk to and care, I'll try my best.

I wanna die, I wanna cut, but I don't want to, I don't want to fall in this shit again, please, please. I will check this reddit in the morning when I unhopefully wake up.

And somehow sometimes I convince myself that I'm faking it.
