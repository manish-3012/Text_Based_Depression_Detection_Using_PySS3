I'm finding it harder.I've always been able to suck it up and fake my happiness. But, lately it's been getting harder and harder to apply my fake happiness. I feel my smile deflating and my laugh is sounding more and more fake. I was fine yesterday, but today I can't help it. I don't look like my normal self and I don't feel okay. I just want to be home, alone and in bed to sleep. That's all I want. Is to sleep. Forever.
