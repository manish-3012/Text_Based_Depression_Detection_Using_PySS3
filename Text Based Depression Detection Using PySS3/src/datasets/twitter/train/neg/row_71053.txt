Been depressed since i was 12, been suicidal since i was 14. I am scared this will be my life forever, I don't see any exit. I understand suicidal thoughts are temporary, but they are too chronic for me to deal with them any longer. I don't know what to do with myself.I am suicidal again and i am just so tired. I lost all my friends, the person i am in love with doesn't talk to me and doesn't want to have anything to do with me anymore, i don't have a future, i can't find a job to help me escape my abusive home. I am tired. All of this needs to stop. Everything is just so wrong and none of this is worth it. I guess this looks like a vent, but if you have any kind of advice or tip i'm willing to listen.
