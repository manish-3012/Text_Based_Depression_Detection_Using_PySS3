Life is full of failures. Some days I wish it would end!I have had so much hurt and pain in my life. I have some periods of happiness and joy. And have had a mostly great period of happiness and joy during the last 8 months. Believe it or not. Met an amazingly kind, wonderful, beautiful woman. We clicked on every level. We hung out most days during this whole corona bs. I remained sober which was something I had not done before her. Things were great. A few months ago she broke it off for religous reasons. Even though the relationship was perfect she had some qualms she couldn't get over. We got back together and had a great several months. Now as of yesterday same breakup reasons. Reasons I would rather not go in to. She is not willing to consider going back to me this time. Went from being my gf and best friend to nothing. Happy to not. I have dove off the deep end the past day with booze and my old prescribed benzos. I feel like an utter piece of trash, filth, waste of space. I am tired of being hurt. So tired. So so tired.

I have a hard time thinking of hurting the ones I love, but part of me just wants to end my suffering and put one od my colt 45s in my mouth and blow the back of my head off... 

Why does life have to always hurt and suck and kick you in the nuts when things are finally going good?
