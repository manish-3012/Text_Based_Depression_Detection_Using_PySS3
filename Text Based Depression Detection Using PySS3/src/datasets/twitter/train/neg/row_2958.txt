My past 10 monthsDuring my first year in college the turmoil inside my head has only grown darker. While the work and extracurricular activities may served as distractions during term-time, the reality is that this affliction has continued to brew and fester, threatening to encroach my very being at any moment.  It is becoming ever so clear that I am hauntingly empty, especially now that we are on summer vacation where I have nothing but time to reflect on my existence. 

Yes, I will (hopefully) have a degree which will increase my likelihood of earning a higher income. But so what? Money cannot fill the gaping abyss which inhabits me - no, which IS me. I find my mind is plagued with questions which I have no solutions to everyday. Some people find fulfilment in relationships and personal improvement. However it is something I cannot envision myself having - let's say 10 years onward. I know will continue to keep myself occupied with games and false fulfilment online, just like I've always done. 

I fully acknowledge that putting yourself out there, meeting new people, and partaking in social activities takes guts. And from time to time I will do just that, put on a performance, or a mediocre imitation. In a way, every single one of us are impostors, imitations from the influences in our lives, some learn to eventually live it naturally, as we all can in fact. But for a mediocre actor like myself, the performance has its limits. 

The reality is I am lucky and privileged and yet I unconsciously betray these opportunities handed to me, ungratefully and undeserving. Currently suicidal thoughts are infrequent and even when they resurface they are simply just thoughts. However, to contemplate the idea of not having to exist or live is a recurrent landmark in my jungle of thoughts. 

The truth is, I will carry on wearing my best facade and when even that cracks I will continue to hide behind it.
