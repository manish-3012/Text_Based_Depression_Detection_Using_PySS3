Ok now... seriously... death is where we come from and where go to. So this life is total bullshit. This is not real.from 0 to 1 to fucking 0 again, like thats the best you can do? Seriously? At this point I don't give a single fuck anymore. I used to be chaotic neutral, now, neutral neutral all the way, I am so close to reaching peace just a few more days and this bullshit of a comedy is over. This is not psychosis, this is real and reality = 0 fuck you. It is actually really funny. We wanted to prove that nothing exists and now we are realizing that it does not and its all bullshit, all progress for nothing, was, always has been, why are we even fucking trying.... 4 days. Then I'll be one with peace and love. These things are non existant in this reality... And we are still looking for them like idiots. Thank Fucking God we realized this now... relief for a second, peace for a second. Fuck this loop. Fuck everything that is in existence. All matter = shit.
 Cant wait to become something better. I will leave you all here. Fuck everything. I'm just venting right now, I know it will soon come to me. I don't even have to do anything. I have it all figured out. Fuck this simulation, and once I'm out of this simulation I will fucking murder each and everyone of you. Fuckers. The pain you inflicted cannot be measured anymore, because its so fucking big, I'd say bigger than infinity, haha yeah 2x infinity or infinity x infinty yeah... I'm just prolonging the inevitable. Fuck this life, and cheerios I might still write here something to put a smirk on that thing you call a face...
