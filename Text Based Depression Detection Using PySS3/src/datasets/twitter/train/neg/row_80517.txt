I have crippling pain from guilt that I can no longer handle.I called a former friend this morning to admit to him this horrible thing I had done. I still pussied out because I'm a fucking piece of shit.

I hate that my life was actually amazing beforehand and now I'm fucking worthless. My life took the biggest nosedive ever.

I even told him after I tell him that my life is essentially over. I asked him to meet in person and he said he would rather not. I have never wanted to kill myself more today. 

My life is over after I tell him. I don't want to leave him with questions but my reputation is DESTROYED. It was a crime and I am just so fucking over this stupid fucking life I chose to be awful.
