I just canâ€™t take it.I feel like nobody likes me. I feel completely alone. 

Life is all just a big game and I donâ€™t want to be part of it. 

I donâ€™t think any guy will like me and the only guys I like ignore me. Itâ€™s so freakin confusing. 

My family is torn. I donâ€™t even know if my dad cares about me. I donâ€™t know where to go. I need some help.
