Just back from jail.I've never been suicidal. Not really, until now. I've acted out and claimed it many times and never meant it.

I have good friends and people who fought like hell for me today to get back to some level of normality after my first ever night in jail. This hit me like a fucking truck.

I was arrested for DWI, but when I was given a breathalyzer I blew only .055 BAC. .25 under the legal limit.

I don't want to say anything more and I don't want to hear any legal advice (I'm getting some, both from cops and from various varieties of legal eagles.)

I was getting my life together in a way I hadn't for a long damn time until today and maybe I'm not suicidal but I just don't want to go on any other way. This isn't just a low point or the lowest point, it's the lowest point by far knocking me down from a time when I'm walking around feeling like more of a golden god than I ever have.

Part of me just wishes I could hurt some other way than this.

Okay, [submit].
