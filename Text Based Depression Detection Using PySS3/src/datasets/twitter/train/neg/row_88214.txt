Life feels pointlessJust lost both of my parents recently, both were fairly sudden and unexpected.   


Really having a difficult time making sense out of life. What is the point to doing anything? Why even exist? Existence truly is pain with but brief glimpses of Okay-ness.  


In the end nothing really matters, nothing you did here matters, nothing you've accomplished matters to anyone but you.   


Feel better to vent. But honestly at this point I am just looking for a way out that won't be trouble for anyone else.
