Parents are trying their hardest but still fuck up, brother is cocky but I love him, rest of my family is just assholes. These are the only people I know.No friends. Fucked up family. Doesn't go to a structured school. Is not a member of any clubs or teams. Hates socializing of any type because it always leads to their own humiliation. Stays up way too late. Procrastinates. Cuts. Pukes after some meals. Embarrassed of eating. Fat. Cries herself to sleep. Gay. Wants to be pitied. There are so many things wrong with me I should just fucking end it. I know I don't have the guts, though, and that's even worse. I'm worthless and should've never been born. Why am I even alive? Why do I try? Why don't I just kill myself already? It would make everyone's life easier.
