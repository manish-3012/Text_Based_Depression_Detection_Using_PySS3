I Need Help.Sorry for the throwaway but I don't someone IRL to find out.

I have felt depressed almost all of my life, I'm currently 14 years old and don't know what to do. I've already attempted suicide a few times and I hate myself for it. I feel as though nobody cares about me at all, and I just want to end it all...please help. Thankyou.
