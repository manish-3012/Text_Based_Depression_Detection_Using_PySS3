This is too much.I am 16 years old. I found out my mom and my step-dad are being sued for not paying the rent. The problem is, Iâ€™m an undocumented immigrant and my mom is losing it saying weâ€™ll get deported back to my old country. We have been living our life in fear, and watching my mom freak out just breaks me. My life already sucks as is, failing school and losing a ton of friends due to moving previously. Iâ€™ve had these thoughts for a while now but it has crossed the line. Iâ€™m thinking of doing it sooner this month. I donâ€™t want to die, but I feel like this life is just too hard for me to handle and itâ€™s the only way. I canâ€™t take it.
