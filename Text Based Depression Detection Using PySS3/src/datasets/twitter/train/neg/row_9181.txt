Was starting to feel better, but after a bad breakup I feel worse than everI was in my first relationship for 6 months. It was the best time of my life and the only time Iâ€™ve ever felt genuinely loved. The relationship was quite intense, it moved quickly, she came out as trans (mtf), and I was depressed. 

Four weeks ago I had a breakdown and broke up with her. I didnâ€™t want to, and she agreed to get back together. That lasted for a week before she said she needed to take a break to find herself. And then last week she told me that my depression killed her love for me a few months ago. That means that she lied about loving me for months. And to make things worse I just started on my path to getting better. I just started therapy, exercising, eating well, and going out with friends. But she said that she didnâ€™t love me and didnâ€™t want to try again. How could she lie to me for months like that?

She broke up with me during school holidays and I was fine. I blocked her on everything and didnâ€™t have to see her. But today was our first day back. And I had to watch her be happy with her friends and not even glance at me. And I had to hear her voice and it ruined me. I had felt suicidal at times during the relationship but with therapy I had stopped feeling that way. But now I just feel like doing it again. The person I care about the most in the world doesnâ€™t even think about me. I spend my time wanting her to ask if we can try again but she doesnâ€™t even look at me. 

My family situation isnâ€™t good, and I have no close friends. And now that sheâ€™s gone thereâ€™s no one left to care. Sheâ€™s never coming back. And I donâ€™t get to see my therapist for another 7 weeks because there were no appointments available. Iâ€™m considering just taking all the pills downstairs. I donâ€™t really have much of a future, I get average grades, look average, am infertile, have neglectful parents, and more.

Everything hurts so much. She was such a beautiful and unique person and she doesnâ€™t Love Me anymore and never will. And I have to watch her be happy without me for every single day of the year. And then I have to go home to my neglectful father and schizophrenic mother. And then I get updates on my dying grandma. I hate the life I have. 

If you read this then thank you. I donâ€™t know what to do right now. Iâ€™m hurting a lot.
