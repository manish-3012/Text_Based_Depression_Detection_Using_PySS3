i wanna die and the usual arguments wonâ€™t work bc itâ€™s not gonna get better (literally)i have did (dissociative personality disorder) so my life genuinely isnâ€™t mine. i have different people im sharing this body with and this life with. iâ€™m probably never gonna be able to have a partner and kids or a normal job. i have no control over whatâ€™s happening and the system hates me. i want it all to go away i want autonomy but itâ€™s not going to happen and with my bpd on top of that i canâ€™t have a relationship because even if i find someone brave enough to date me iâ€™ll fuck them over with my bpd

if i canâ€™t have my own life whatâ€™s even the fucking point of living. i wonâ€™t have a life or succeed bc of this shit. and it canâ€™t get better the alters canâ€™t go away
