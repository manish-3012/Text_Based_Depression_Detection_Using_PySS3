Fuck your titles. I dont fucking care about titles.I just don't see a reason to live anymore. I am a terrible father and an even worse friend. I know there are people out there who will care if I die but there are only one or two of them that even care enough about me to even talk to me more tha. Once or twice a year. Yeah yeah I'm going to be another statistic... veteran with PTSD kills himself. Fu k it who cares. I'm tired of the pain. Im tired of being a leech on society. There is nothing I can contribute to the human race to make it any better. I used to have one of the greatest minds in the world. I was 8n the top 3% of intellects in the entire world and since the explosion in Iraq, I can't even remember if I'm wearing clean fucking underwear. I'm in constant fucking pain and I just want it all to end. I honestly believe that my son would be better in the foster care system so that means my ex wife has to go too. Luckily for her I'm too drunk to actually get near her at the moment. But she is just another heroin junky. I seriously doubt the state would let him live with her anyway. Why the fuck should I care though? I'm going to be dead. I can't fucking control shit. I have no say over anything anymore. I'm tired of the hotlines just wanting to keep you alive long enough to feel good about what they are doing. I went to the va the other day and told them I wanted to kill myself. They said I shouldn't joke like that. I went 3 days later and told them again and they made me an appointment in July. Well doesn't that just give me some immediate fucking help. Hey we know you are fucked so come see us In 3 fucking months. Well thanks a lot you fucking fucktards. I'd say sorry about the language but at this point in time, I just dont care. I just wanted something out there before I kill myself. Thank you for reading my last words. I just want you to know I really do appreciate you taking the time to read this and hopefully you can find more hope in life than I could.
