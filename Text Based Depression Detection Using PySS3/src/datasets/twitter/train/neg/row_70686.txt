No one would care that I was goneThis was my first week back after being quarantined for 2 weeks. I came back and no one even knew I was gone. So much else is going on too that I donâ€™t want to talk about. The only thing thatâ€™s keeping me alive is my dream of being a movie director when I grow up. But I know I wonâ€™t be successful so whatâ€™s the point? Does anyone know how long it takes for bleach to kill you?
