I cant do this anymoreIm on meds, with people around me and in stable financial situation. But I wont to go. I don't want to hear that everything is going to be okay cause its not. I thought It would but it wont. I just want to hear if my family will be fine when im gone and I don't want my sister to find my dead body in The morning. Pls are they gonna recover after this?
