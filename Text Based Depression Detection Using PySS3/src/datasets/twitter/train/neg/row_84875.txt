Saying goodbye2 days ago my 23 year old nephew hanged himself, his parents and siblings are devastated. He was a troubled young man but we all loved him and are wondering if we could have done something different. Not sure why I'm even writing this other than to say that even though you may feel all alone in this world there's someone that loves you. Life can be a real struggle at times but we have to fight till the bitter end.
