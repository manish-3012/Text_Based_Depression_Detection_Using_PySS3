26/f. Done with it all.I'm a 26 y/o female and have had a rough couple of years and don't know how much longer I can go on. I have no friends, family, or significant other and am alone all the time except for when I work. All I really do is go to work, and go home to listen to music alone. I have interests but they are rather stupid (mainly just fashion). As for dating it is very hard for women nowadays I think, and especially since I'm quiet it's even more difficult. I just want to stop waking up.
