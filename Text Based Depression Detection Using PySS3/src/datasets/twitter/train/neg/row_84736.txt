Please help im in a situationI dont know where to start.. I guess first is I've attempted in the past and been hospitalized a few times. I attend psychotherapy once a week, I just need help tonight im feeling weak and know that if I reach out to a doctor or hotline ill probably be back there.. as someone with experience I just dont see how that helps me. I feel so alone my friends cant relate. Also I have a few things that dont help in my view the most important of those being I have multiple sclerosis
