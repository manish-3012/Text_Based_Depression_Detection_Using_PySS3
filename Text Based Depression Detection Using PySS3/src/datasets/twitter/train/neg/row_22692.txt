I don't know what to say anymore... I'm deeply depressed and I can't suicide myself.I don't know. Is there anybody out there that is actually kind and wants to help another one? All I hear about is stories, but in my life, I coudn't find anyone to help. Not even someone that loves me can help me, because, no one is kind enough to see that my mistakes are basically pure bipolar crisis. ''I'm bipolar'' ''ok, I got it''
Next month: ''Get the hell out of here, you don't deserve my friendship because you are a liar and a shitty person''

WHY?? BECAUSE I CAN'T CONTROL MY RAGE SOMETIMES? BECAUSE I CAN'T CONTROL SAYING THINGS THAT EVERYONE IS DYING TO SAY AND DON'T BECAUSE SOCIETY DOESN'T WANT TO?
