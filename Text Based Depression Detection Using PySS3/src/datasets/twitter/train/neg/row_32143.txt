Can't see any paths forwardI know my reason is clouded. I know this is temporary. But how temporary when I just end up back here again, incapable of working properly, taking care of myself and .... anything ?? Probably chatting with someone would be good. The hotlines are like talking to cardboard cut outs. I understand why. I usually just feel irritated after calling the hotlines. I cannot see myself ever getting past this point. All I want to do is spend Halloween with my daughter and I don't think I'll be able to because my emotions are too big.
