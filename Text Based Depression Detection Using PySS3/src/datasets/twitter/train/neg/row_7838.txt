College isn't going to happen, and I've made my decisionI fucked it up bad. It's my fault I'm not going to college. Now I get to stay at home and go back to community college while all of my spare money goes to bills my mom can't pay and food. I get to stay miles from civilization and any people I might want to spend time with. Not that I can make friends anyway, since I'm so socially broken I can't form intelligent conversation s or fuck even sentences around other people. It was the last thing I had to look forward to. It was all I had left in the entire world to give me hope that maybe things will start looking up soon. 

And now its not happening. Because of me. Im going to be trapped here and its going to be the same way it always has been. 

Well you know what? I'm not fucking going to take it. I'm not going to live like this anymore. I don't know when, but I've decided. I'm committing suicide as soon as the time suits it.
