What parts of this is ok to tell my therapist?I'm 26F in USA. 

I can't get 302d because I would lose the job that I love. Losing that might just actually cause it honestly! And I can't sign myself in right now because I was just out of work since late March due to catching a severe (though not critical) case of COVID, and took like 2 months to recover enough for my active job. I was supposed to go back yesterday.

I know exactly how I will do it, I don't know when though. I have PTSD and MDD and I often act on impulse caused by emotions. I'm okay with telling people and [TRYING] to get help until the time comes but if I have a particularly bad "episode" and I haven't been able to convince myself yet that life is worth it, then I don't have a problem doing it. I won't ask for help in the moment. But right now, I don't consider myself high risk. Would that be correct? What can I tell my therapist without being involuntarily committed? I am right now very depressed and alone, but honestly being numb is making me okay for the moment. I have been skating by like this for the past few months, and barely remember this year cause I was so doped up on psych meds. But, at the same time, I don't want to live a life of being numb because who the f*** wants to do that? I'm already on a high dose of medication which makes me sweat like a gross slob. Comes in 3 months of doses, which will come in handy later. 

Sorry for complaining guys, i know probably everybody on this world is depressed and alone right now especially due to the pandemic. I don't think I have the right to ask for help.
