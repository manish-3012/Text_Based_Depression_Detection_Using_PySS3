So I donâ€™t know what to do anymore...I feel more lonely and depressed and it makes me so sad. I donâ€™t like my family, I rarely talk to them. I am 13 years old and I am female. Iâ€™ve been sleeping to 10am-6pm because I donâ€™t want to deal with them. I might end up failing school, I am homeschooled which makes it wrose I also do not like public school. I get so stressed and have anxiety over school. I have mental breakdowns a lot. What do I do now?
