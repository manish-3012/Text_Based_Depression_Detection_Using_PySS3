Am I alowed to vent here? Pls remove if not.My entire life Iâ€™ve been told that my choices are mistakes, been told that Iâ€™m not good enough to do this or that and the other thing. Been called selfish, horrible, mean. 
And my whole life Iâ€™ve been trying to not be all these things that people have been telling me. I give to everyone, never taking for myself. Iâ€™m terrified of making any choice a this point because maybe Iâ€™m making a big mistake. Ive been trying forever to be a better person, I always help someone when they need me or even if I just see someone struggling. I give everything to everyone else, and never to myself. And I just keep getting told these things. 
At this point I donâ€™t have anything left. Iâ€™ve been struggling with attempts at my life since I was 15 years old and Iâ€™m 23 now. Itâ€™s never gotten better and I just keep getting beaten down farther and farther no matter what I try to do. I canâ€™t keep going on like this and no matter how much I scream for help everyone just tells me to â€œget over itâ€ or â€œitâ€™ll get betterâ€ but it never does and I just canâ€™t take it anymore. 
I just want help...
