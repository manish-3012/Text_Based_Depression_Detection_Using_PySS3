Even though they know Iâ€™m still ashamed and canâ€™t tell them moreSo Iâ€™m 12 and male and have severe depression and anxiety, and Iâ€™m suicidal. Both my Mom and Dad have depression yet I still find it hard to talk to them. They know I have it and I got to a therapist weekly but I donâ€™t know how to tell Iâ€™ve gone past hurting myself and am now considering suicide. When Iâ€™m feeling good I wonâ€™t but when Im not it always comes to that. I miss school my anxiety gets so bad and only my best friend knows I have it so all my other friends ask me why I miss school and I find it socially awkward and it makes my anxiety worse. Iâ€™m here to ask how to tell my parents Iâ€™m getting worse and if itâ€™s a good idea to tell my friends.
