iâ€™m transgender and want to die everyday, anyone help?I donâ€™t pass as female yet. Iâ€™m on hormones therapy which should make me look female in about a year at best. Thats all coming along fine, i know i should have better mental health within the year

But none of this changes the fact that right now i feel suicidal everyday. I have dysphoria so bad all the time. It hurts me to look in the mirror

Whenever i see myselfðŸ˜žor im reminded of my appearance as a â€˜maleâ€™ i want to just kill myself. Iâ€™m worried i wont make it to the point when my body looks how it needs to 

what can. i do? ðŸ¤’
