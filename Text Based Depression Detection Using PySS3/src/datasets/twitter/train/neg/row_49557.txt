Itâ€™s funny because once I die my mom and relatives will act like they didnâ€™t see the site, and I didnâ€™t ask for help.Iâ€™ve asked my mom for help countless times. Never got it. She get drunk every night. Iâ€™m alone. Iâ€™ll be dead soon and then maybe that bitch will realize how important it is to be a good parent.
