FuckLife is so god damn fucked up I really fucking hate it every thing I do is wrong and everything I think or want is wrong and Iâ€™m annoying Iâ€™m just that person who talks a little bit to much. every one person that Iâ€™ve talked to just fucking hates me no matter what I do no matter The intention of what I did just the fact that I did it even if I just want to help I just get yelled at by people and get pushed aside sometimes I just want to think just a little bit or have a friend who talks to me not just jokes with me or someone who cares about me bc Iâ€™m at my limits Iâ€™ve been pushed aside ever since kindergarten a lot of people hate me and I donâ€™t even know why. I just hate being alone I really fucking hate it so much.
