Want to rip myself upUsed to just punch and cut and bite and scratch, but now I cut a bit too. Not bad, just to pull uo skin, to hurt, sometimes I draw a little blood. Usually I aggravate it when it's healing to try and make the scars stay. Wish there was an easy way to hide them though besides wearing long sleeves in summer in summer and spring. 

They locked the medicine away so the only other way is to jump in front of a train or something, but it's late so they'd know what's up. I don't always think I'm here. I want to scream and break something but I can't. I'm trapped I think. I sometimes forget what's reao and allni want to do is die. Indont want help. I want to be put in a little hole and left there. I remember wanting that since I was like 6, which is funny.
