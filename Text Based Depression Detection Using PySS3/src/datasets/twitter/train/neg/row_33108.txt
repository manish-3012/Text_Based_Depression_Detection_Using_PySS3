Just felt like writingI don't know if anyone is ever gonna read this but just typing it out helps a bit.

I'm a 20 year old guy in my second year of university in Italy. I was always a bit depressed and suffered social anxiety my entire life but this period has been the worst. I've known my roommate for 2 years now and he's become one of my best friends. He met a girl about 6 months ago and we also became close friends. She quickly became one of the most important people of my life and I started falling in love with her. I felt as if I could talk to her for hours and that I was genuinely happy around her. 2 months ago she told me she felt the same way with me and things escalated from there. I kept seeing her more often, I just felt normal around her. Two weeks ago we were both drunk at a party and made out. I know I am a horrible person, I can't stop telling myself that every day. 

I told my roommate some days ago and while he said he understood he said he needed time to process everything. He dumped the girl and now won't even talk to me. I feel like shit. I miss my friend and not seeing the girl I love is killing me inside. I just want to go hug her but I can't. I already tried killing myself some days ago with 12 Perc's and alcohol but somehow survived.
I can't concentrate on anything and am probably going to fail all my exams next week and waste more time of my life.
I can't stop cutting myself to shift my mind from all this emotional pain and I just get high everyday with whatever i can find (alcohol, benzos, amphetamine, oxy) and walk around the city all night hating myself hoping a car hits me or something. 
Thanks to anyone who took the time to read this.
