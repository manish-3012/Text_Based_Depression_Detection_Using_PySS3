Advice/help wantedHey. I've been waking up wanting to be dead, one of the most important things to me has always been my friends and now im constantly paranoid that they'll be annoyed at me.

I feel like I'm wasting there time. I feel like they'd probably prefer to be around someone else and that my presence is annoying. 

The longer I keep going the less I seem to have to live for. 

Idk how to keep on, I want to but it's just so hard and I'm begining to lose hope in the whole process
