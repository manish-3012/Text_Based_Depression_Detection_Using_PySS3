Advice?I havenâ€™t been doing well lately. I feel at my all time low. That someone could point a gun at my head and I wouldnâ€™t care. I want to hurt myself and others and that scares me. I donâ€™t want my parents to know because Iâ€™m scared of them as well. I have a school therapist I could talk to but Iâ€™m also scared of that because they might tell my parents. Iâ€™m terrified right now and just want a little bit of advice on what I should do. Please.
