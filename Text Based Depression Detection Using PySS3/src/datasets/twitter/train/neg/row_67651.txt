Near the endI know im nearing the end. I can handle anything right now and i know its only a matter of time before i go. I know what im gonna do and where im gonna do it. Im gonna make everyone hate me first. that way they wont care when i go. I dont want anyone living with the guilt that my friends have left me with. the what if i would have tried more. If i make everyone hate me then i can slip away in peace. My time is almost up.
