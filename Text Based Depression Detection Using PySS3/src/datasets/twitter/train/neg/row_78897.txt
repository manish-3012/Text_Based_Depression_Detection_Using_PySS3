I honestly don't know what to do.Just in the last hour my roommates unanimously agreed that I have to go. I don't have any family to fall back on and I just emptied my bank account trying to make sure myself and all my roommates were covered on bills. I don't have the money to support myself without a roommate or even buy food to subsist off of. I am so lost. I don't have a vehicle to transport any of my stuff in or get to work with if I can't find a place to go nearby.
