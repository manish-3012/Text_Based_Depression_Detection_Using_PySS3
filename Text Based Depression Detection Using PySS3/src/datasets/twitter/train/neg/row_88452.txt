She toyed with my heart. I'm out of alcohol and want to die.She was the first girl to show interest and flirt with me in my entire life. She's pretty, funny, and interesting to talk to. She would hug me and make dirty jokes. She made me confident for once in my life. I was happy.

Today, I found out she was just doing it for fun. It destroyed me. I can't stop crying.

Why does nobody like me? Even in our group of friends, I'm an outsider. They never want to hang out and nobody wants to exchange numbers. I'm just so lonely I want to die.

And before you say that I'm not being assertive enough or I need to make the first move, you're wrong. The first and last time I tried that, it went traumatically bad. The girl named everything wrong with me in front of our friends, they laughed, and then stopped hanging out with me.

My life is a joke to these people. Even my own sister wishes I was dead. I just want to kill myself now.
