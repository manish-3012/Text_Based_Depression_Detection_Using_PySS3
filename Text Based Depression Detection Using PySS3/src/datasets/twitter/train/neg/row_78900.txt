Give me a reason not to do itI have pretty much failed out of high school, have no real friends, I hate my parents, have no job... I pretty much have nothing to live for, and my life means nothing. Every night when I go to sleep I tell myself that tomorrow is going to be a different day, but it always turns out the same or worse. I haven't done so many things in my childhood that I never can do again (I can, but doing so would be \*awkward\*)...

some background information; I have Aspergers Syndrome (well, that's what they claim, I can identify myself more with schizoid personality disorder, and if it were true, having the 'scientists mental disorder' combined with an IQ of 85 is probably the worst thing that can happen to you), I'm 16, male, hated my life since I was 12, live with my parents, I lack initiative (last time I felt truly suicidal was 9 months ago; 'friends' brushed it off as attention whoring, but for some reason I chickened out. i don't have any fear of death really)

so please, give me any reason to not do it? I was personally planning on doing it when my parents are asleep so they at least won't notice anything...
