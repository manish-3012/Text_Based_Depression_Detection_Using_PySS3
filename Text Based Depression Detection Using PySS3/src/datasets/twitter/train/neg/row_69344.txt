How do I not feel like killing myself and thinking about suicide everyday?I'm 5'1 male, convinced myself that I'm gonna end up with the bottom scrapes of the barrel or no one at all, constant instances of disrespect from other people my whole life and rejection, people not wanting to to get to know me because I'm "different" depression kicks in hard, I work hard but I can't help but feel hopeless I feel like I'm not even going anywhere so what's the point anyway? No body loves me I need a better reason to live
