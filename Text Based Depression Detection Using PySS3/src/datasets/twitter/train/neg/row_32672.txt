Seems like theres no way out.I'm scared. I'm angry. I'm confused. 
I've been contemplating for a long time. Several attempts in my past. Not proud cause pa always said "your a fing low life coward if you give up on life." Things seemingly go good until they go bad. This time it was pretty bad. There wasn't any physical abuse this time like there has been in the past but sometimes the words hurt worse than the rod. I tried it before. It felt good. My eyes went dark. I felt a peace rush over me. There was no pain. If it wasn't for that officer I would have got away with it. Maybe I could do it again but for real this time. Idk I don't really wanna die. I just don't want to live in this evil, corrupt, misleading world anymore. The government does not have my best interest at hand, neither does family, friends don't exist. I'm grateful for what I have like health, intelligence, shelter, clothing, and even the joys of life. But some fing people are down right evil, EVIL I SAY. The evil comes in the day to steal that joy and every fing shred of optimism. I won't go into the details of every incident but trust me y'all this evil is a deep seeded hate filled evil that roots from a bad childhood. This evil is haunting me. This evil is my dad! He makes me want to kill him but but I don't like hurting people. So I want to kill myself because I see no way out. I tell you the evil this man possesses is the evil of hate, ignorance, and child abuse. I don't know what else to say. I don't know where else to go. I feel hopeless with nowhere to turn to. I'm afraid. I'm trying my best but the evil keeps tearing me down. Ive actually started to self sabotage my body by excessive alcohal consumption and chain smoking this way if I get cancer everyone wont judge me like if I killed myself which is pretty much the same thing to me.
