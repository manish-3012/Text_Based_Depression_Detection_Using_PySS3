just read if you wantLife has been pretty bad for about 2 years now. Last month it finally got to the point where I couldnâ€™t really take it anymore. I was contemplating suicide, but Iâ€™m a pussy so I just reached out to my dad for help. I still think it was pretty brave of me. I mean, after all, he is the man who has been abusing me for years.

Though he hits me, I am his daughter. I guess Iâ€™m pretty arrogant since I believe that heâ€™d help if I told him I was suicidal. He knows about my self-harming too, so that helps.

My parents and I went in for a mental health evaluation on my birthday, just a week ago. I was supposed to meet the psychologist again last Friday with my father for the results of the evaluation, but my father insisted that I donâ€™t go.

When he returned, my twin sister asked him about the results of the evaluation, and he just told us that the psychologist said that I â€œonly had a little bit of the disorderâ€. He didnâ€™t even state what â€œdisorderâ€. And apparently I will not be meeting with the psychologist anymore. So, that rid me of all my chances of getting better by seeking professional help. Iâ€™ve been unable to ask further since itâ€™s a pretty heavy subject. My sister followed up by telling me that it was pretty obvious that I was mentally stable and that Iâ€™ve just been doing it for attention. Sheâ€™s been repeating that for the longest time, since she found out about my self-harming. 

Honestly, I really hate my sister. Sheâ€™s not needed in my life. When she had discovered my self-harming, she went around and told all our friends, without the slightest consideration about my feelings. Sometimes I suspect that she is a psychopath. She doesnâ€™t really seem to harbour any sort of empathy.

But at the same time, Iâ€™m mad at myself for having been disappointed about the results. Maybe I am just doing it for attention after all. I donâ€™t know. But at the same time, I ask myself, who in their right mind would go to sleep at 7 in the morning, not shower for days, lay in bed all day and not feel the sunlight for up to weeks at a time? Maybe it is a normal thing to do. Honestly, I feel like some attention-seeking brat.

In all other aspects of life, Iâ€™m pretty normal. Iâ€™m doing pretty well in school. Though I didnâ€™t get into my dream school, I managed to get into one of the top 15 secondary schools in my country. Kind of a feat. My dadâ€™s bankrupt. We have a helper whoâ€™s stolen hundreds of dollars. Ha, ha. We also have the cutest dog. 

You know, Iâ€™d take my life if I could. But as I said, Iâ€™m a pussy. I want to end it all, and the only thing thatâ€™s stopping me is my fear of pain. To be honest, no matter how bad life gets, I think I wonâ€™t ever have the courage to take my own life. Iâ€™m so scared of pain, yet at the same time I have the audacity to contemplate suicide. Ha, ha.
