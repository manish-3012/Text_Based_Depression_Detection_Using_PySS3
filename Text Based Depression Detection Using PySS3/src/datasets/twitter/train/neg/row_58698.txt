GoodbyeI guess this is my last post before deleting, and leaving this earth for good. 

I have never been closer to killing myself. Im going to do it. I have every reason to do it, everything in my body tells me to do it. And I should. I'm nothing but a parasite at this point. 

Where do I begin? Well, I dont there is a beginning with any of this. I was always a bit troubled. And it worsens as I age. Being alive is unbearable. The only thing I'm looking at is the night sky, listening to Coldplay and smoking. Its nice. I might miss this part, slightly. 

There's nothing to hold onto or hope for. I might be young, but I know how it all works now. I know how people are, which are the root cause of my pain. Just because I'm young doesn't mean anything. 

It is my time, finally. I have been contemplating for years. But it has finally come. Thank you.
