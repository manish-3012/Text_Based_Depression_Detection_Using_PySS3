I'm gonna dieI wake up every morning for the past two weeks with that going through my head. Everyone moves on and stops talking to me, and the people I talk to have been the only reason to keep living to be honest. I'm so glad those people got the help they needed, or they are further away from suicide though. I no longer wish that I was successfully dead a month ago, because then I wouldn't been able to help those people. But I have to do this for myself, because there are always going to be people who need help and I can't suffer every day to make sure they get the help they need. I think I did enough, and today will be my last day helping and talking to anyone. After today I will be done, and I will be gone permanently. Nothing will hold be back from a successful attempt this time, I made sure of that.
