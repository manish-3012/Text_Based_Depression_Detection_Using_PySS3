I donâ€™t know anymoreIâ€™m not sure guys... I just feel like a sideshow to everything and everyone in my life. I try to be a positive and happy person for everyone but I just donâ€™t feel significant to anybody in my life. I just donâ€™t know if I can go on like this. I just donâ€™t feel like I have much purpose  in the world because Iâ€™m treated like a nobody by everyone I meet, so my brain keeps jumping to suicide. Just want to know if anyone has any reasons to live because I feel in a dark place mentally right now and I need some help or advice.
