I'll never have the life I want...so why not end it?My birthday is in five hours. I'm 24, live at home, no car, no license, deep anxiety, deep depression, crappy job, apathetic family, no friends, etc. Every day I do the same thing before work: read and write. I have nobody who really cares about me. Nobody who really gives a shit. 

I get made fun of at work for being weird and shaking due to my anxiety. People already say they know I have issues. I don't snap at people but I'm pretty sensitive and my hands shake all the time and they notice it. People think I'm retarded. I have stomach issues. I've shit myself a few times this year.

I'm in therapy but I'm not seeing much progress. It's like turning an eighteen car pileup into a seventeen car pileup. I don't think anything will help. I don't have a real way out of my parents' house. I am wasting away.
