Hate my meds, but I can't live without them.Fucking venlafaxine. Without it I'm always suicidal, but with it I sleep upwards of 12 hours a night, and feel sleepy and unfocused all the time. Ican't get it up, can't cum on the rare occasions I do get it up, even though I've been off it for a while now. Neither way is actually living. I probably get a grand total of two productive waking hours when I'm on it, and off it I get none because I do nothing. I can't keep up with this world, I tried getting help and it made nothing better, I'm just a burden on everyone either way. 

On venlafaxine I didn't want to kill myself. I wanted to try other things. I wanted to try an alternative, I wanted to try supplementing it with modafinil. And my psychiatrist said no, because he didn't get that while I might not *irrationally* want to die any more, in that state it's a fairly rational decision. 

What the fuck do I do now? I was staying alive for my girlfriend but then she got sick of me being so tired and useless all the time. I'm just done, I'm not staying alive for anyone or anything else.
