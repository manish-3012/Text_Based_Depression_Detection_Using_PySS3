Cousin just committed suicide now i'm feeling lonely.http://www.forevermissed.com/grace-thomas/#about

My cousin just committed suicide a few days ago and I really miss her. I'm slowly losing my will to live because she was my best friend and I don't know why she would do this. I feel like I have no one to talk to anymore. Has anyone else felt this way before? Feeling like no one understands you?
