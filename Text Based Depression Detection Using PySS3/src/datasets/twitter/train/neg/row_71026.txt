I watched a documentary about assisted suicide for people who suffer psychologically.And honestly I wasn't expecting to relate so much, the only light at the end of the tunnel is the end for me, I'm so extremely tired of being alive, I wish never existed in the first place. All I wanna do I cry, I want to rip my face off, I never want to see it again, Everytime I look in the mirror I cant help but think im better off dead. Everytime j think about my face or my body I imagine myself jumping infront of a train, hanging myself or jumping off a building. Everytime I close my eyes I imagine me killing myself, usually with a knife..

I just cant take it anymore, everyday is the same but worse, this suffering just goes on and on.
