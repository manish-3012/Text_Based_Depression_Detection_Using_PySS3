I just don't know what to do anymore. I don't know how to keep living.I am 38, obese around 400 lbs give or take a few lbs. I am on disability for ptsd and severe social anxiety. I have absolutely no friends and no family. I go months to years without anyone to talk too. I tried making friends but no one lasts they just ghost me or they lead me on for some sick mind game of theirs. 

I just can't take this loneliness anymore and don't know what to do anymore. I even tried dating but was told I am ugly, disgusting, worthless, told I have nothing a woman wants, even told no women would want me. laughed at, mocked at, made fun of. was even catfished a couple times. 

I just don't know anymore and don't know if I can keep living such an isolated life style or if I can even keep living life with being so isolated. I live in a very small town like Rowena Texas but I am 30 miles away one way from the nearest town. we have no taxi, no uber, no lyft. all our town has is 20 fast food places, a super walmart and several dentists and churches. I am far from religious and tried going to the churches but couldn't get behind it or even just be around it. 

I just dunno anymore, maybe its best I don't exist anymore.
