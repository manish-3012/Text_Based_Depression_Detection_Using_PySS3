i just want it to stopthere's nothing to life anyone, not like there's ever been. i just wanna be alone but I'm so fucking lonely. therapy doesn't work. nothing does. everything i do is exhausted i haven't eaten in solid 2 days and i still fucking hate myself. i sleep most of the time bc I'm always tired and that way i don't have to keep up with anything. i just hate that i wake up every once in a while. I've always known it would end like this and it'll be for the better. this new year's eve i promised myself that i wouldn't be alive to see 2021 and I'm pretty sure this is it. I'm so fucking scared of what will happen. i just hope its not as bad as it is now
