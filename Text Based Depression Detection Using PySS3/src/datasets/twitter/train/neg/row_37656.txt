I can't do this anymoreThe therapy doesn't matter. The support group doesn't matter. I try to tell so many people that all these things and more matter and it gets better some day and all that bullshit. And that's what it is. It's bullshit. 

In the end I'm still that bitch everyone hates. 

I'm just so fucking done with trying.

I'm sitting here and thinking that I just want that peace. I just want peace

Sleeping is better than any day I have woken up in this lifetime. Even the good days, they are nothing compared to the peaceful bliss of sleeping. I'm really just read to go back to sleep, and stay that way

Cause this will never end. I know by now that I can not be loved. And love is the only thing that matters to me in life. If I can never have the only thing I care about, then there is no point. 

All I really want to know is WHY. Why did I have to try so hard for so long just to be shown that it will always be the same. Why did I have to bother with even being born. Why do I have to even make this decision
