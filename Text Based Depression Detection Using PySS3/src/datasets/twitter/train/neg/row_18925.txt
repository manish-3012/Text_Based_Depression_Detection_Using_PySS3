I want to kill myself but have never been able to pull the trigger.I have been dealing with S.I. for a long time now, i would say close to 8 years if not more. Im a veteran and i loved my job it was hard but worth it. I got married at 18 to my high school sweetheart. Everything was great for a while. Then as the army started taking more and more time from us she became distant. At the same time my thought were getting worst and worst. To make a long story short she was cheating on me and that destroyed me and all the resolve i had left. I was chapter from the army with and honorable discharge do to my thoughts. In a few year i when from the best i have been to the worst. Now that im living in the civilian world constantly feeling like a failure. I lost the rwo things that made my life worth something to me. Everyday i think about ending it but never go through with it. Does anyone else feel this way?
