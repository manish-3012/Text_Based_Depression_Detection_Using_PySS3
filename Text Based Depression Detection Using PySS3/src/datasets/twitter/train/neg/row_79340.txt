I'm mentally ill living in provertyI'm fuckin mentally ill and living in proverty. I live in America with countless opportunitys but it doesn't matter because I'm mentally ill. I have dibilitating Depression. My life is over, out of all the possible outcomes this happened. It's doesn't even matter whether I'm here or not. I have no motivation and my time is running out.

Talk about getting absolutely shit on, yes it happens people don't get the same opportunitys as others. Also once your mentally ill nothing else matters. ðŸ–•ðŸ–•ðŸ–•ðŸ–•ðŸ–•
