Life is Amazing ðŸ‘ŒðŸ”¥Yesterday I cut myself and fainted. Today my ex/crush (complicated) said she doesn't want to give us another chance and likes this other dude instead and I just overdosed but I feel like I'm in the clouds cuz life is just sooooo amazing. I feel like I'm chilling in a pool but really it's my pillow full of tears ðŸ‘ŒðŸ˜Ž. I have the pool all for myself ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹ cuz I have no friends ðŸ‘ŒI'm definitely not breaking down right now or going crazy or anything I'm just having the time of my life. My parents don't understand shit and just think I'm sick ðŸ˜·ðŸ¤’ðŸ¤§ I just wanna jump a bridge cuz it's cool ðŸ˜Ž. Yo Jezus is mah homie Just wanna meet him rnðŸ˜© I'm jumping from excitement
