Not worth itEverytime I feel suicidal like this I try to remember that tomorrow will be a new day, I new chance. A lot of things can change, a lot of things can happen. I keep in mind that today was better than yesterday and that tomorrow will be better than today.

But sometimes it doesn't work.

If I'm not feeling suicidal, I'm anxious or just numb. If I'm numb, I know that soon I'll feel suicidal again, and if I'm feeling anxious, I wish to feel numb again, because it's bad, but it's still better than the anxiety.

I'm tired of telling myself that I'll be better when I know I won't. 

There's not reason for me to feel like this, but it is the only thing I feel. And it won't go away, because there's nothing that can change it. I think this is a big part of me already.

I'm tired of waiting for better days, for trying to feel better and always coming back to the same feelings. It's not worth it,

I wish I could feel numb enough to end it, I hope this will happen soon, because I'm just tired of all of this.
