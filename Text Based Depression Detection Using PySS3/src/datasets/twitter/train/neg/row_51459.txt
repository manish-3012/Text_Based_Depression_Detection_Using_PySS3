I'm thinking of (gently open the door) myself. I need advice.For those who don't get it, I'm thinking of hanging myself. I've been frequently looking into How To Tie A Noose and while I have yet to buy a decent rope, I've gone looking for any laying about everytime I go outside.

What I need help with is what to avoid doing when I actually do it. I dont want to fail at dying just because I forgot something very obvious.

Thanks.

p.s. This is not a cry for help as in "Save me, give me your overrated attention."

p.s.s Just Monika
