The usualIs there anyway to feel less selfish about wanting to die?
The only thing that's stopping me from ending it all is my parents, honestly I could see them giving up if I was ever gone. I am so lucky to have two wonderful people who love me, I'm not worth their love nor to I deserve it, but I receive it regardless.
I've had a little bit to drink tonight, that always reawakens the fevour of these god awful feelings, I know I should'nt drink, but strike me down if I never get to experience the feeling of no feelings for a hour or two.
I was only on medication for a few months, decided to stop since the thought of being on drugs to feel 'normal' sickens me. Didn't really get sick, but I got bad again. I should probably go back to the doctors and start again. Turns out I may have a thyroid problem too which adds to the depression and anxiety, good things come in threes right?
Anyway it's past midnight here and I just felt like rambling,thanks for reading and enjoy your day/night wherever you are in this world.

Please don't do it tonight
