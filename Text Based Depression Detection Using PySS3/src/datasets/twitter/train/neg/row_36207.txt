I am gay and I hate gay people. I don't see the point of living anymore.Hi everyone. Well, first of all it is not about internalised homophobia. I am OK with the idea that a man likes another man and I am completely sure I am gay, the problem is that I found out long ago how materialistic, evil, narcissistic and insensitive can the gay community be. It is aweful. I can't seem to cope with it. I feel lonely, alienated and genuinely believe that I will die alone since I don't make any gay friends. I have tried it many times and they are horrible evil-natured people. I didn't get the support I was expecting.   


I don't want to live like that. I feel lonely, with no friends, I am still a virgin and I hate what the gay community revolves around. I feel like I don't want to live anymore. What can I do? I have been getting a lot of suicidal thoughts lately.
