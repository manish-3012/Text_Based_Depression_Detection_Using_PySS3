I don't know what to do anymoreMy life is ahead of me, there is so much pressure, pressure to go to college and succeed. what do I do? repeat the same shitty job every day and do it until I die? I'm new to my high school, i'm a senior, class photo is wednesday and I don't have a class shirt to wear, i don't think i should be in it. the shirts have everyone's name on it, all but me. i feel like im the only one, I moved here six months ago, met a wonderful girl, she became my girlfriend, and she broke up with me for no reason, and she is hiding something.

I feel lost for an identity, i moved to four different high schools, im the oldest, what do i fucking do. I have a shit job where i'm used like a rag. nobody would accept me here, cause of their closed mindedness. bigots, nobody reaches out, nobody talks, i try to say something, but to no use. 

The feeling, the one where you try to say something but nobody helps you? Thats the one. Me and my mom were in trouble a bit more than a year ago, dad left to go find work, 6 hours away. Just mom with her shitty ass job to use food for four growing boys. One day, she lost her job, she quit. Out of stress, we had nothing, I couldn't do anything, we don't use welfare. my cries for help were never answered, I tried to talk to people, I cried, i fucking cried like something would happen, but it didn't. That's the feeling, of trying to do something but it doesn't do anything. Talking to people who i thought were friends, but they wouldn't help. 

im tired of being lied to, having people that are there, but don't do anything. 

it isnt your fault, just want someone to listen for once
