Here is super short versionHey so I'm divorcing after many years.
I did everything I could to keep the marriage going.
She walked away. 
I went from everything to nothing.
Got betrayed in every way.
Went from not working due to health issues to now working 70+ hours a week just to get by. 
She is in a new relationship. 
I am so devastated that I can't sleep or eat.
I haven't slept in 4 days and the last time I was able to actually eat was Saturday the 12th. 
My body doesn't feel normal and I have had blood come out of places it shouldn't.

But in order for me to afford to live this is what I have to do...
I don't think I can. I feel alone. 

I don't want to die but at this point it seems like it would be easier and just better for anyone that knows me if I do... I honestly don't know what I'm hoping to get from this post...
