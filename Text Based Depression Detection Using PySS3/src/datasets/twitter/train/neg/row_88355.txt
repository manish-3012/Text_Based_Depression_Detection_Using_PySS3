Not wanting to speakItâ€™s been over 4 months of me just not wanting to talk anymore. If someone wants to talk to me I give my least amount of effort to speak. I really donâ€™t care anymore. I secretly hope I donâ€™t wake up, get hit by a car, or have enough balls to one day just do it. I donâ€™t think life has anything to offer me nor do I care for what may come.
