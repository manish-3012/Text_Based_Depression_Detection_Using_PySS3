The cycle never ends and I want it to.Not sure if I should just relapse on drugs and alcohol or kill myself and end it all.
So many times this year Iâ€™ve cried with a loaded gun in my mouth. I just want someone to want me. I am always giving. I made my whole life and sobriety about helping others. Now Iâ€™m lonely and empty and have zero strength to carry on. I message random strangers and hope for some positive validation, like somehow the light will click and things will be a little brighter. Itâ€™s not working. I was told a problem shared is a problem cut in half. Thatâ€™s not fucking true. I keep sharing and itâ€™s getting worse.
One of these nights I wonâ€™t only load one or two in the revolver. I will fully load it to take away the chances. Iâ€™m so fucking tired of this pain. 

Everything Iâ€™ve suffered: being raped by a family member. Two girlfriends being murdered at different points in my life. A boyfriend killing himself. Years of drug addiction and alcoholism and homelessness.

Havenâ€™t I suffered enough? I canâ€™t even laugh at the joke that is God. Why would I believe? What kind of god lets a kid get fucking raped? 

I want it to stop. Please take my pain away. If something would cause my death sooner rather than later, that would be fine with me. Just make the pain stop. I canâ€™t live like this.
