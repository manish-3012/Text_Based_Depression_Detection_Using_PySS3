Idk manIâ€™ve been doing so well, finally started an apprenticeship about 8 months ago to be an electrician after years of depression and attempts, I thought I was on the right path. But all of a sudden all the constant thoughts that no one cares, would care anyways and suicide has all come back recently. Iâ€™ve started to drink more than I should and being in a generally angry mood and Iâ€™ve noticed that Iâ€™ve started to lash out at people for no reason, I donâ€™t want that. Iâ€™m too scared to take my life but Iâ€™m hoping one night soon when Iâ€™m drunk af Iâ€™ll do it and I succeed.
