My life is just about to end.She cheated on me. I let her back. She lied again and again and I let her back. She proves every day she doesnâ€™t love me but Iâ€™m still here. Sheâ€™s broken me down to my absolute core and I am so frustrated and hurt I feel like doing impulsive things but I donâ€™t want to I canâ€™t help it and everyone says â€˜it gets better!â€™ And I know it does but my chest and heart is heavy I feel like if I donâ€™t do something my bodyâ€™s just going to give out. I canâ€™t eat or sleep, I have no support system and Iâ€™m stuck in this place with my family 6 hours away I feel so alone and my life is a waste so whatâ€™s the point?
