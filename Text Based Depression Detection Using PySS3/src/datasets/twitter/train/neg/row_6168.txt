How do people want us to react to the saying â€œyouâ€™re not alone/there are others worse than youâ€??I never say anythjgn back but my thoughts are always;

-	so my problems are nothing and im overreacting 
-	bitch i know there are people who feel this way, thats why im in therapy where yall specialise in helping people who have mental illness dumbass
-	there are people who DONT feel this way?????? Never??? 

most of the time its the first one... which is why i keep bottling shit up and then boom i self destruct haha anyways
