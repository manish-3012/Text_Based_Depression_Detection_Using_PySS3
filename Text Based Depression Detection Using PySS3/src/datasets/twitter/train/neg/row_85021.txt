I hate life.I live in a  poor, disgusting area full of rape, drugs and shooters. I was abused by my parents when I was young. I was slapped acrossed the face, my hair pulled, thrown to the ground and was called a useless bitch for not being able to do my own hair right. I lived in a fictional world. I wanted everything to be fake because I wasn't happy. I was almost killed by my classmates, pushed into bushes, people laughing at me when I was choking on something, called ugly, was told I was meant to be bullied, and was kicked around. I was punished for protecting myself and girls would try to hurt me and chase me. Then rumors always happened and nobody would want to be my friend. My family member screamed and threw holy water at me after I told them I was part of the LGBT community. They tried to unlock the door, called me a demon and more. I then got addicted to abuse, and developed severe mental issues. I was emotionally back tracked than my classmates. I cut myself for attention, and got addicted to porn. I started to gain weight and acne made everything worse for my self esteem. 

I became a bully and emotionally abused people. I feel guilty and want to die. I just wish I disappeared. I got into more abusive relationships and ended up in a very dark place once again. I never had a good life and because I was crazy back then, I'm scared people will try to expose me in the future and ruin my life. Maybe I deserve to suffer. Why was I born.
