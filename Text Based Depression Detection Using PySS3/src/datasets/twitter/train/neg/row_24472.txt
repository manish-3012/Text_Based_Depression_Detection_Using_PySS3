Iâ€™m trying to cope with my depression but Iâ€™m literally all alone.I canâ€™t keep my house clean, I have no energy to get out of bed each morning. I work 50 hour weeks, so that I can have the extra money for my pets and partner. 
Iâ€™ve been trying to improve myself by setting small daily goals. Making my bed one day. Doing the dishes the next (literally the most overwhelming task for me somehow).

But he keeps belittling me. 

â€œYou literally do nothing every dayâ€ he says. He tells me I donâ€™t work out enough (he has a strict workout routine). I tried to explain to him that I have no energy and itâ€™s difficult for me to find the motivation to workout after working a 12 hour day. I told him that maybe he can help motivate me to workout by suggesting joint activities.

â€œThatâ€™s not my job. You say you hate your body, that should be motivation enough.â€

Okay, well Iâ€™m really really tired, and he doesnâ€™t let me hang out with anyone else so itâ€™s not like I can turn to anyone else for motivation. I also have severe ADHD, so I have a hard time remembering tasks or sometimes feel too overwhelmed to complete them. He turns everything into a personal attack. 

â€œI asked you to go buy eggs yesterday and you didnâ€™t go out at all. You obviously donâ€™t find me important and want me to starve.â€

Okay, Iâ€™m sorry. Iâ€™ll go get them now. Then he screams at me for not making them for him, and says that we have nothing to eat even though we do have food, itâ€™s just not food he wants.

Iâ€™m really really tired. All the time. Iâ€™m not trying to make my mental illnesses into an excuse, but I wish that he at least acknowledged them because Iâ€™m dealing with it all on my own and Iâ€™m at an all time low. I really really really want to end it, but Iâ€™m worried that he wonâ€™t care for my cats and dog when I pass. I donâ€™t have a single moment of security or contentment. 

Iâ€™ve never felt this lonely before
