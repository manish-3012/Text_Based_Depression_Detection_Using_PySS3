Non-visible handicapsI have a non-visible handicap which prevents me from having real relationships with people (no it's not autism, I've asked my psychologist, but I have a real diagnosis). I always felt ashamed of it, I don't even dare name it here because I fear the reactions people will have to it. I can connect to no one, every friendship I've ever had, every nice person I've ever encountered, it can all just melt away in an instant. I got a depression last year and I am still struggling with it, even though I take my meds consistently. I want to die almost every night. As soon as my brain gets the chance to analyse anything, I get suicidal and think about how pointless it is that I have kept living all this time. I don't dare name my handicap because it's so misunderstood and some even call it a gift. But let me tell you, having to live with it is a fucking nightmare. Today I lied to my roommates about where I was, since you can't really say "Yeah, just looking for a good spot to tie a rope to a tree." I am so ashamed of what I am, I have to hide myself constantly and will never be able to find another person who can truly understand me. I have maybe two real friends, my parents only ever wanted me to do well in school and couldn't give a fuck about anything else. Nobody understands me, my psychologist tries so hard but she'll never understand what this disease fucks up in your head. I'll never find anything or anyone worth living for. I just want to die. I am always so lonely, I didn't ask for this fucking "gift". If there is a god out there he sure is a cruel son of a bitch. Fuck everything. I hate myself so much for what I allowed myself to become.
