I never wanted to end my life, but now I'm going toIt doesnâ€™t always get better. Sometimes it doesnâ€™t change and, sometimes, it gets worse. 

I am so tired of being alone. I am worthy of being loved. I am worthy and I deserve love exactly as I am. But the only man I ever found attractive will never know I exist, let alone be mine. Iâ€™ve tried to force myself to be attracted to others. Iâ€™ve tried to forget him. Iâ€™ve had counselling, medication, professional â€œsingles coaches,â€ even electroshock therapy (ECT). None of it made any difference, no matter how I desperately wanted it to.

The ECT caused me to lose my memory, forget how to speak or writeâ€¦. But not him. Not his smile, his laugh, his face. Years go by and itâ€™s still there.

But it will never be and I know that, and I am done being alone.

My family died when I was an infant. I lost my friends when I lost my job and could no longer pay for everything. I tried the suicide chatline and they sent cops to my apartment. They kicked down the door, took me into custody, and, when I was released 72 hours later, I found my apartment had been ransacked, I was being evictedâ€¦and the cops had broken my jaw and cheekbone. I donâ€™t have insurance and couldnâ€™t get medical care. Then I was hit with a $150,000 bill for the psych hold. 

I have no job. I am in my mid-40s and I have no savings. No 401k. Nothing. I havenâ€™t had a job in three years. I live in my car. Iâ€™ve defaulted on credit cards, student loans. I was always a good person. I didnâ€™t have debt. 

So, yes, it doesnâ€™t get better; it gets worse. 

Instead of buying food today, I bought a gun. Itâ€™s the only way out now. Iâ€™m tired of being alone and I will not spend another another holiday or another night without the man who is worth spending my life with. Without being valued and loved. All I ever wanted out of life was to be a wife and mother. Nothing else matters. Iâ€™ve done it all and I know that now. I wish I had known how Iâ€™d be spending my birthday this year -- and every year -- and every holiday. I wouldnâ€™t killed myself years ago, not just attempted.

I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m even writing this. It changes nothing. I guess I want people to know what the suicide hotline actually does. Make sure that is the kind of â€œhelpâ€ you need. At least in death, Iâ€™ll be at peace.
