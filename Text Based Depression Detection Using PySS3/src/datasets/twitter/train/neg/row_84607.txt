I just hope that something will take me awayI don't know where this all came from, compared to others I live a pretty good life, but I'm still not contempt.
I'm currently 16, I lack the strength to end my life, I wouldn't want to put that burden onto others, the ones that do care.
I just feel hopeless, I am too fucking awkward to ever get a girl to like me and the only one that I am close with wants someone else.
I feel as if I'm a let down to my family, they have such high expectations for my GCSE results but I don't think I can meet them, I've spent too long pissing about, letting them think that I'm revising when I've actually been sleeping.
I rarely ever go out with mates either, in fact most times I ever leave my house now is for school, I'm hoping that college will change things but I doubt it, I'm just going to be the same fuck up I always have been, constantly letting the ones around me down, being too awkward to let any new relationships happen.
I constantly lash out at and hurt those around me as well, I frequently have a go at my family for nothing and then later come to regret it, the girl that I previously mentioned that I'm close to is frequently upset over me and I absolutely hate seeing her cry; she knows that I like her and she frequently apologises for "Not being able to make me happy", I feel like its because she's a lot more popular than me and feels that in return she cannot get with me. I feel so bad for making her upset but I constantly do it.
I put constant pressure on my family as well and I feel really bad for my mother, she does everything she can but I still act like its not good enough.
I hate how much pain I inflict on everyone but no matter how much I try not to,I end up doing it again.
I just want it to end, my life included. I'm too much of a coward to ever do that myself, I guess I'm afraid of missing out on the future, in case things do get better.
