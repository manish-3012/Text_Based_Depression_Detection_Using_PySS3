I feel like I don't deserve my lifeI guess I wish I could give it to someone else. I feel like a fuck up in every aspect of my life and I breeze through life without a genuine purpose. People don't ever talk to me and I don't really have anyone in my life except my family but I'm away at university and I just sit in my room crying because I l'm so incapable of meeting new people and making real connections with people.
