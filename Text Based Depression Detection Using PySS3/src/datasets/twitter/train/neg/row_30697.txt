I haven't a clue what I'm doing.I'll try to be terser than I am inclined to be.

I'm a university student getting a degree that I know will not bear fruit even if I manage to graduate (a dubious prospect). I currently live with my parents who will provide shelter and food so long as I am being educated.

For five years I have stagnated and atrophied in most regards. I spend all of my time sitting in front of my computer, endlessly cycling between a few websites and games. I have no significant passions or interests. I have one social contact with whom I interact every few months, and I interact with my parents rarely. Ironically, this almost seems to be a good thing; for months I have experienced intermittent chest pain that becomes especially painful if I laugh a great deal.

There is nothing that I want from life. To live is to suffer needlessly. My sole hope is that until I find the will to kill myself or simply die by other means, I manage to find a tolerable job that I am capable of executing, though that seems doubtful.

At the moment I am under little pressure, and thus remain in relative equilibrium, but soon I will need to acquire a summer job, and I am starting to crumble academically. By the middle of the last summer I found myself standing on the local bridge at 4 in the morning, and little has changed since then to indicate I'll be in any better a state by that point. I did not hold down a job for more than two months and quit at my therapist's behest. 

Speaking of therapy, I have worked with three therapists since October of 2010. No progress, no change. I suppose it provides a conversation, one of the only ones I ever have in a month, but it is clear to me that I will not improve.

I'm not sure why I chose to ramble. I suppose it passed some time. Oh well. With any luck this chest pain won't just go away and will shorten my life considerably.
