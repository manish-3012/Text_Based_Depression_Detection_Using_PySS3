Scared of being open to my therapist about me being suicidal.But I think she is the only person I can really talk about it. Waiting whole week to talk to someone for an hour about how I really feel hurts. I can't do this with my family because they will think I'm some kind of freak. If I open up about it to my therapist I'm afraid of the same reaction. Or her conracting my parents about how I feel. It's sad that I have to hold all these thoughts and emotions to myself, not being able to let them out to anyone but myself.
