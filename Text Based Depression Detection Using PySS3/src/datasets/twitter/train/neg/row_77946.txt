This pandemic has taken so much of my strengthI think everyone can agree that the pandemic has been complete shit. I have so much to be grateful for but I've never felt so lonely and so tired. I feel like I'm a burden to my friends and girlfriend, I feel like shit and now I'm faced with a possibility of tighter restrictions which is making me lose all hope of ever returning to normal. I just fucking can't carry on but I'm too much of a coward to actually kill myself so I feel in a pit. Fuck this
