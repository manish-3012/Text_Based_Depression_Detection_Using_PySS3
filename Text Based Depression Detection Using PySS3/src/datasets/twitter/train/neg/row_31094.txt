I just had a wonderful time... so why am I in pain?I just went to a show. It was about a popular youtuber. For once in my life I felt happy. But once it ended, it felt like a knife went through my heart, and I forgot what joy even felt like. Why does it hurt for me to feel emotions, even happiness? I don't want to live. I have no reason to live when all I feel is pain. I'd rather feel nothing. I wish I could remove my emotions.

Thank you for listening to the ramblings of a madwoman
