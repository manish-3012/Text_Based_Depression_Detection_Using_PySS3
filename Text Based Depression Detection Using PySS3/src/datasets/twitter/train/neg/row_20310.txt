its time to gothings arenâ€™t going to get better for me. my girlfriend and i are long distance and i just spent a month and a half in her state before having to fly back here due to my family telling me to and financial issues. i thought i was staying there for good and i was so happy with her. our plan was to both work and save up and then move in within the next few months. but my dad says i owe him $800 from the plane ticket (the one he made me buy) and from borrowing money for food etc. i am so unhappy and colors seem so dim right now, im debating between downing all my effexor or figuring something else out. im in so much pain and havent felt true happiness and stability since age 7. im 19 now and i dont wanna live in this fucked up world anymore. i cant get a job anytime soon bc im also in quarantine which also rules out hospitalization which never helped anyway. im done.
