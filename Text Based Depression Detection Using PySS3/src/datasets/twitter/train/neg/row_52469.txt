At what point do you sympathize with the one who is living hell and not the family?I love my family, its why I havent killed myself. But I am living hell right now. I have god awful digestive pain, I feel thobbing migrating around my face day in day out, sharp pains lasting for 5-20m in random spots in my body, brutal cluster headaches... But the worst part is this god awful shit hanging above my soft palate. Its big and sharp and I cant swallow it down for weeks on end. Then on days like this all of a sudden i feel these MASSIVE foul tasting things go down my throat. I can barely swallow them I cant throw them up and they squirm as they go down. Neti rinses result in nothing not even muccus comes out its all just clear. I have had bloodwork showing nothing but a slightly elevated white blood cell count.

It feels like im swallowing massive parasites. Its fucking disgusting and terrifying. No one believes me. They all think im delusional. I think I could be delusional but I've been on antipsychotics for months now and they do fuck all. My doc refuses to send me to any sort of specialist.

This has been going on for 2 years now and just getting worse. I have gotten into drugs to simply ease and numb the pain and weird sensations I feel but now cuz of that they REALLY think I am delusional but this all started happening BEFORE i got into drugs.

At what point does the HELL I am living outweigh the pain my family will feel by me ending my life. I dont know how much longer I can go on like this... this shit is seriously fucked up....
