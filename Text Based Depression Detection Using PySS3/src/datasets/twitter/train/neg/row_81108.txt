I tried (21m) to kill myself (when I was 12) now those thoughts are back, should I tell my mom? Note: English is not my primary language so I truly apologize for any grammar mistake.a little story when I was in school I suffered from bully but on a different level I got harassed everyday and even stabbed once (with a glass on my arm) and I didn't tell my mom I was always making excuses I was so sad that I googled "the easiest and painless way to end your life" yeah I did that  long story short I drank a cup of clorox wich is a cleaning product here in my country, my big sister was at the house in that moment and she took me to the hospital there I told her everything that happened to me, that I was feeling like a worthless piece of shit that didn't deserve love from other people beside his family, she cried with me and asked me why I didn't tell her before I said because I didn't want to bother her with my problems that she was having enough with hers so now she would have to deal with mines. I begged her to not tell my mom (she was at a business trip when that happened) she agreed with me, I started to visit the psychiatric and everything was going fine until I broke up with my gf (we had a 3 years relationship) the last months of the relationship were toxic and trash she said means things to me, and basically destroyed my self confident now I feel like a worthless piece of shit who doesn't deserve love, and suicidal thoughts are back and my sister is living out of the country. I called her and she told me that is the time to tell my mom idk if I should tell her idk how she would take it and that just makes me feel worst and think that everyone would be better without me. idk if I can make it
