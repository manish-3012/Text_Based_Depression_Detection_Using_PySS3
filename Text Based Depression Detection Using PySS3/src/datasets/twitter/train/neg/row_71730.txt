Nothing matters anymoreI have told people so many times how badly I'm feeling, and they don't believe me. They think I'm joking, they think I'm making it up, they think I won't really hurt myself. People say I can talk to them anytime, I write emails, I text them, I try to reach them, I go days and weeks and months without hearing from them. There is nothing keeping me here, and I can't imagine going through the rest of my life being this depressed and lonely. I see no other choice than to end this as soon as possible.
