I really don't want to go on, but I'm giving it one last tryI really don't want to be alive anymore now... but I come to you guys/girls for help because I am giving life one more try.

My mother in law has talked my wife into getting a restraining order on me.

Story: 
Alright, so about a month ago I got married and things were great. Then she went to her moms house to visit and never called or anything so i kept calling her moms phone and they wouldn't answer...

I honestly thought that she got on the road coming home and wrecked so I left 2 voicemails saying that if i didn't get a call back that I was coming over there.(meaning that I would be on my way there to make sure she's ok and everything.)

Anyway, she did the same thing yesterday and didn't call or come home or anything, and this morning I finally got her mom to answer the phone and she told me that they were on their way to get a restraining order on me because of "threatening voicemails".

The voicemail went like this " Hey i haven't heard from anyone over there in hours, and I'm really worried that April wrecked or something on her way home, so if I don't get a call from you guys to let me know she is ok, I will be on my way over there, cya."

I really don't know what to do... this girl is my whole life, and I really don't think I will ever be happy without her.

So with her leaving me clearly, mixed with my PTSD I suffer from because of the Army, I don't want to live anymore but I am coming to you for help so maybe you can help me see the light, and the reason to keep going.

Thanks for your time guys... I hope you can help
