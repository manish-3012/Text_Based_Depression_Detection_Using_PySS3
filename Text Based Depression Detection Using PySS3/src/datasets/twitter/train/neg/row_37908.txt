I need help or advice or somethingRecently Iâ€™ve been feeling like shit. Iâ€™ve been trying to hide it from everyone because I donâ€™t see why they should have to deal with me when theyâ€™ve got their own shit to deal with but it honestly getting difficult now. Iâ€™ve literally done nothing today, like my lessons were easy and and Iâ€™ve got no reason to be feeling like this but for some reason every little thing has pissed me off. I came home today and I just donâ€™t know what to do with myself. Just everything I do pisses me off to the point where I genuinely hate myself. Idk this Is probably just the sleep deprivation getting to me. I just canâ€™t hold it in anymore and pretend Iâ€™m ok when Iâ€™m not. Iâ€™ve  got really bad body image issues so Iâ€™ve started starving myself more and more. I feel like all of my â€œfriendsâ€ hate me and they just want me to leave so that can talk about me or just have conversations without having to involve me. Iâ€™ve got more work to do than I can ever hope to keep up with but if I donâ€™t do it Iâ€™m fucked for the future. Iâ€™ve got no backup plan so if I donâ€™t get into university I really donâ€™t know what Iâ€™ll do. It just all too much to handle and Iâ€™m really scared Iâ€™m going to get to the point where I will genuinely want to kill my self and i really donâ€™t know what to do. 

Sorry for the long read but itâ€™s 1am and Iâ€™m not even gonna try making this make sense. Thanks in advance for anyone who replies but I donâ€™t expect anyone to waste there time on me anyway
