I think itâ€™s time nowI was recently busted over some pot and one of the charges is a felony. I felony will ruin my life my career will be an shambles because I will be unemployable. I will have a record for at least 10 years. Iâ€™m going to see how things go down in court. 

This is all because I decided to eat the evidence but since this is my third offense idk how things are going to go down. Itâ€™s sad how prohibition has fucked me more then the plant ever could.

I want to go down as a martyr I want to leave a message for U.S to see how much is a bitch they  can make peopleâ€™s lives. 

I canâ€™t stop being depressed and thinking about suicide itâ€™s the first thing I think of when I wake up in the morning. Idk just wanted to share
