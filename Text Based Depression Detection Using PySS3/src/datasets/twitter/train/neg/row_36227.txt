College student in deep trouble.I'm in my second year of college and I am having suicidal thoughts. I suffer from some mental illness that has destroyed my life. It could be Bipolar Disorder, Depression, General Anxiety or all three. Maybe even more. It makes it impossible for me to just walk to class and sit down. I can't do it anymore. I feel most people would say to just toughen up, but they don't understand how unbelievably distressing it is just to be out in public. 

I need you on this one Reddit. I stopped going to class about two weeks ago and missed tests and other assignments in all classes so there's no way I can get anything above a C in any of them. This happened last year too, but I managed to work through it with the Office of the Dean of Students. I was VERY VERY lucky. It took a ridiculous amount of time working long nights to catch up. I have a 3.8 GPA, but this time I don't think I can fix it. I already failed one class because I missed more classes that is required to pass. 

I could withdraw from this class, but that puts me below the required number of credits for Financial Aid so I wouldn't be able to attend after this semester considering my family lives paycheck to paycheck. 

I don't even have a proper diagnosis from a doctor so I can't bring a note explaining my situation. I thought it wouldn't happen again which is why I didn't actually go to see a psychiatrist last year. For this reason, I believe I have Bipolar Disorder.
