I'm going crazyyyyyyyyBeen at college a month, I still don't know anyone. What hurts the most is seeing literally everyone around me in a group or with at least one other person. Everytime I see someone else eating alone if I wait a few minutes their friend comes and sits with them. Every day I watch them and I get angrier and angrier. I have social anxiety, I suck at talking to people. It helps when I drink but I haven't been able to get any in a week cause this is the only bullshit country you gotta be 21 in. There's a party on the housing lawn tonight and I'm in my room. I kept postponing buying stuff for my dorm cause I didn't know if I'd be around to use it. Every day I wonder why tf I'm still here. I've got no one in the world, everyone around me is having fun and I'm just watching, alone. I dunno what the point is.
