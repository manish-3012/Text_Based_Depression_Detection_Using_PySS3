Dying soonI really can't do this anymore. My dad is coming back to live with me and I can't deal with him, he is verbally and psychologically abusive. I saw my therapist today and he thinks just because I'm not self harming I'm doing very well, I can't take all this anymore. I'm going to do it tonight, I have my method and plan and I'm doing it. No one's life is going to change because of my death, life will still go on and most likely be better.
