I wanna overdose but I donâ€™t want to diehonestly I donâ€™t care how this sounds. YES I do want to overdose for attention. YES I do wanna expirience the pain so I donâ€™t have to do anything. YES I donâ€™t give a shit about long term side effects. I honestly miss the hospital only thing that stops me is I really donâ€™t want to go back to the mental ward. Iâ€™ve been two times this year for self harm and I hate it there only because the rooms are so empty that it messes with my psychosis and Iâ€™ve had some really really bad expiriences with other patients. I just wanna be able to take a break from life and have an excuse as to why I donâ€™t feel good, why I wanna sleep all the time. And to just stop me from making scenes, i wanna be to tired to be angry, to tired to be sad, but not in an emotionally drained way but in a physically I canâ€™t do it way. I donâ€™t wanna hurt myself or others anymore and its the only way that it would stop me.
