Iâ€™m so tired of this. 2019 is the year that I kill myself.I canâ€™t keep doing this. It will not get better; over the past 7 years it has only gotten worse. I donâ€™t have any friends or anyone I can talk to, I never have. Iâ€™m tired of waking up everyday and wishing it would be my last. I do nothing but sit in bed all day, thinking about how much I want to get out of my own mind. I donâ€™t know when exactly Iâ€™ll do it, but my walls are closing in and I feel so trapped and alone and Iâ€™m starting to break.
