We need to help our friend.I have a friend who tried to kill himself last night. He'd had a lot to drink and tried to jump out of a window but luckily another friend was able to restrain him. All of us are really worried about him because this mostly came out of nowhere. He has an appointment with a counselor,but what we really want is to talk to him about it. We don't know how to bring it up in a way that he will talk about it though. his tendency is to bottle things up and act like nothing is wrong. Everyone is freaking out about this because we care about him and we need him to realize it before he tries to kill himself again. Any ideas of what we can do? we're all at a loss here.
