Mommy, I kept my promise for 15 years, I'm sorry.I told you I would tell you when it got bad again, I'm sorry I didn't this time. I'm sorry I can't get it straight. I live with shame everyday that I still can't face life. I made my own problems, I never figured out how to step up and be responsible. It scares me. Death scares me less. 

Dying doesn't bother me, the thought calms me, it's  the messes I am leaving behind that holds me back. The hurt I'm going to cause you and daddy, the judgments, the fake people coming around saying they cared for me wishing they knew and would have helped.

I have asked for help, other than walking into a hospital and committing myself, there is no help for me now. 

I can't face my mistakes and consequences, I'm stuck and my fears have taken over. They may seem small and trivial to everyone but to me they consume my thoughts, my breathing, my body.

Today I have no control, I sit at work and cry non stop. I can't live day to day anymore.
