TiredIt's been two months since my beloved's death. Even being in loud noisy crowds doesn't help. Talking to people doesn't help. I want to do anything; jump, OD, hang, slit my wrist. Yet even when I'm drunk I can't. Why? My best friend, my one and only is gone. Anywhere I go in the world, I don't feel safe. Every friend reminds me of him. How do I carry on with such pain?
