Iâ€™ve pretty much hit rock bottomMy boyfriend broke up with me 3 days ago &amp; iâ€™ve just been destroyed emotionally. It hit me so hard I can only remember feeling this shit once before in my life. It comes in waves of â€œI know Iâ€™ll recoverâ€ to the lows of â€œthereâ€™s no point, and you know it.â€ Every time i feel I might be getting better the emotional anchor of missing him pulls me back down to rock bottom. On top of that my family dog I havenâ€™t seen in months has to be put down in 4 days. I just donâ€™t see a point anymore. I know itâ€™s so early and the loss is a fresh wound but it feels so awful I just want the pain to be over. Nothing feels fun anymore and all iâ€™m capable of is crying in bed.
