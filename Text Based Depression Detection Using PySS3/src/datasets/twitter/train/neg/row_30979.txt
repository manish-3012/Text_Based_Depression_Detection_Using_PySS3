Iâ€™m going to turn 20I thought Iâ€™d end my life when I was a teenager. I feel like thatâ€™s the only age where it actually has any effect on anyone. Iâ€™ve failed once not even a month ago. Iâ€™m going to be turning 20 soon and I feel like if I decide to take my life once Iâ€™m not a teenager anymore itâ€™s just pathetic. I feel the older I get, the more pathetic the action of taking my own life would be.
