I don't knowI'm sick of being attacked by people I can't fight back. I'm so outmatched and there's nothing I can do. All I want is my own life but maybe they're right that that's unattainable. 

I also want the dysphoria to stop. I'm not transphobic at all but I don't think I have the strength to be trans. This would be fine, only the problem is that I am. So I'm kind of stuck. 

There's less and less control all the time. Sooner or later I'm going to hurt someone and I just hope it is me and not someone else. But maybe they're right that I already hurt people. There's nothing I can do but eat shit and smile. I can't stomach it anymore. I'm fucked if I leave and I'm fucked if I stay. 

In the end I know they're right about how I'm worthless. I want to euthanize myself so people don't need to feel the referred embarrassment of being around me anymore. I want to go back and apologize to everyone who's ever known me and tell them that I'm putting it right and killing myself so they can have some closure. 

I have a book someone lent me. I want to give it back to them first because otherwise they won't get it back. Maybe I can mail it so I don't have to wait.  I wish I deserved to stay around and read more books like that. But it was an experience I didn't deserve. If I hadn't been reading it, someone who deserved to might have. 

I have to go now. I'm going to do all the stuff I never did as an apology. The apology won't be accepted but maybe that's not manipulation. Maybe that's just because I don't deserve it. After that I'll figure things out. Nobody depends on me right now; someone used to but now they're good. I won't be dragging anyone down with me.
