I am a person with a very good life, but I am tired of living.I am 21 years old and in college.  My life has been extremely wonderful; two awesome parents who have paid for my college completely so far, an awesome brother, a huge house, an amazing childhood.  None of that matters, apparently, because I am not happy.  I should be, but I cannot seem to appreciate anything in my life.

I'm tired of pretending I don't have suicidal thoughts.  Whether or not I would actually follow through is a different story, though.

All I know is that I want to die. 

* I am tired of dealing with *emotions.*  I want to be numb.  I don't ever want to feel happy or sad ever again. 

* I am tired of having a lot and not being able to appreciate anything.  

* I am tired of the ever lasting feeling of wanting more

* I am tired of feeling stressed out

* I am tired of having to feel like I have to live up to certain expectations.  I never, ever fullfill the requirements.

* I am tired of myself.  I cannot stand to be inside my head anymore.  I have tried countless times to like myself.  

* I am tired of faking my happiness.

* I am tired of having low self-esteem.  I know I shouldn't.  I recognize my talents, but the fact that I cannot live up to my own requirements makes my achievements mean **absolutely nothing.**

* I am tired of having friends that I cannot trust.  I am actually just tired of feeling the need to be around people.

* I am tired of thinking about myself

* I cannot forgive myself for the mistakes that I have made in the past year.

* **I am just fucking tired of everything that is involved with living.**

Last night I laid in bed thinking about different ways to die.  At one point I seriously considered getting up and throwing myself down my stairs in hopes of breaking my neck. 

The part that makes me not want to live anymore is the realization that I might have another 50 to 60 years of this.  I feel like I can't do much more than a few more months feeling this way.

I have no idea what to do.  I have already tried therapy, and it hasn't helped.

I just want some direction.

Edit: I suppose I should also mention I was diagnosed with Crohn's disease 4 years ago.  I have heard that depression is often correlated with the disease, but I have no idea how.  I typically don't spend much time thinking about it, though.  Most of the time I forget that I have it.
