Tired of being an unpassable, ugly tranny.Why even live? I look like an ugly 25 year old man with beard shadow. Skincare doesnâ€™t matter, hrt doesnâ€™t matter, hygiene doesnâ€™t matter. Why even try if Iâ€™m always going to look male? I really just wanna fucking die, which I will, alone. Iâ€™ll never have a boyfriend. If I passed my life would be infinitely better but I donâ€™t have genetics able to do that so why live?
