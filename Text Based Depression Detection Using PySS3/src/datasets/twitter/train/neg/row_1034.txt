I don't know anymoreI'm just find myself again sitting on the couch,drinking vodka and crying like a little kid,and btw I'm a 25 y/o male and just crying and drinking until I pass out,I dont know how much I have left,who know how much I can take this.I just can't understand where everything started to collapse.I dropped out of 2 universities,first try was business school,without any good reason I stopped going in my second year.After,I got into computer science where I dropped out after 2.5 years,at this point my gf at that time broke up with me because I didn't have any sense of direction in life.

Fast forward a couple months back,I felt into the pit,feeling lower then ever so my coping mechanism was to drink.Slowly but surely I stopped carrying about anything,quitting my job,and because I had so much free time now I began to drink even more,and it ended sooooo bad.....my last gf couldn't reach me by phone,which was unusual, so she had to leave early from work cuz she had a feeling so she came to my apartment and founded me passed on the floor,she called the ambulance,but I was already in a coma.I woke up in the hospital some days later.After a week from being externated from the hospital my dear,dear gf broke up with me,who could blame her after I did to her,I'm just a piece of shit.And now I'm here,no friends,no family,no gf,almost broke.What should a person like me do?maybe pieces of shit like me shouldn't be alive.

Maybe I have bored you,or you found this depressing but thanks if you took the time to read this and I wish you a good day.
