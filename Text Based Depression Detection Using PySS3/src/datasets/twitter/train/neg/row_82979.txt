Hey y'allMy content is equally important as all of yours. I'm not American but wanted a friendly tagline in lieu of a sour one. Kinda on the fence on tyin' a rope on the big old mango tree and going for a bungee jump to hell or pissing off to Sydney to squeeze all the youth and life out of me like a tube of Colgate optic white. Maybe I'll be feeling different in a few hours. That's the beauty of bipolar. I know i have advantages over others regarding money and situation but i don't wanna get to 25 with no achievements or worth behind me. The tree looks attractive right now, but I'm not here to give satisfaction to others. My brain gives up easily, it's natural state is hedonism. Maybe i could be a writer, don't mean to blow my own whistle but i think I'm quite articulate and perceptive. My dog would be confused too although my partner is there for him. Yeah sydney is the way to go. Maybe a huge shot of heroin would be the best way? I've never done it so i have no tolerance. I feel so misunderstood. My partner has his dick pointing towards another, my fault, i do suck the life out of everything and everyone. My hairbrained business failed before it could start, I've never put so much focus and effort towards anything before really. I have gotten... well i wouldn't say fat but big enough for it to be a point of taunt thanks to a whole buncha quacks i put my trust in while trying to treat my bipolar, don't ever accept Seraquel kids. I don't want my family to think it was their fault which is another reason i feel a slow descent would be the better option, just fade out of life and connection. I had an idyllic life and childhood but mindset like the big monster/companion it is has always gotten me. Sorry rambling on.
