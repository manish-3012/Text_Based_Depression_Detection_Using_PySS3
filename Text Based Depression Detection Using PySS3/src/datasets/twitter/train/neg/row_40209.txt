Please I've tried so hard and it still isn't workingI donâ€™t know what I enjoy 

Nothing I try works 

I hate myself more than anything 

I get too attached
 
I get jealous 

I donâ€™t understand how people have fun
 
Humour is my only form of self defense
 
I want attention but hate being payed attention to
 
I want pity but I donâ€™t want to be pitied
 
I want to feel anything but sadness
 
Everything I see is through a film of blue
 
I can only get an angry at myself 

I can only disgust myself
 
I always feel sick

Its in the back of my head

Always watching and weighing me down
 
Corrupting everything I see or hear or want
 
Its not fair
 
I tried so hard

Its not fair
 
Can I not get one thing good or right or anything
 
Please?

Id give anything just to feel normal

Meds didn't work
 
I cant kill myself
 
What would that do to the few people I love

They see things in me that donâ€™t exist 

I donâ€™t understand them 

But I understand how that I can hurt them 

But thatâ€™s the only thing I want most in the world 

Not to kill myself 

But to stop living 

Its so boring 

What is going on how is it fun its just a nauseating blur
 
Why did I have to want somebody again 

It messed everything up

This was supposed to be a fresh start 

This was supposed to work
 
Meds were supposed to work 

Getting away from family was supposed to work
 
Something was supposed to change 

How do they not get tired 

How do they not get exhausted 

What am I supposed to work towards
 
I canâ€™t make goals 

I fail everything I try 

My own mother said she hated me in her dying breath 

And I had to carry her ashes 

And this happens?

Its not fair 

Iâ€™m ugly and I hate working 

I expect too much of others and expect too much of myself 

I always fail to meet my expectations 

Why cant I just die 

Hit by a drunk driver and everybody stands around and says how sad it was and how much potential he had

I canâ€™t give up 

I canâ€™t even muster up the effort to give up

I loathe everything about who I am and what  I feel and what I do 

Everybody seems to have so much fun with life
 
And I get this 

I had a girlfriend I worked out I got good grades and I still woke up every day wanting to die 

Getting up in the morning takes 50% of my days energy 

Drinking makes it worse half the time and the other half it's fine 

But it makes my reality that much darker in contrast

I just want to sleep all the time 

I don't know how long I can continue for 

When will I just break 

I think it's soon
