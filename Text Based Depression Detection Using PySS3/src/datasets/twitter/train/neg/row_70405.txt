Want to die but don't want to hurt familyRealistically I don't think I have a future, even if I could get something together I don't think I want any of the multitude of possible futures that I could have.

I have felt like an outcast for most of my life and I feel incompatible with many aspects of it. I dropped out of college a few times, I'm afraid to go back into the situation because I hated college so much, but I don't see any other option. I could work a dead end job but I know I would hate that too. Even if I do get a degree, I would have to fight for a career, pick something (hard for me), "sell myself", I just don't have it in me to compete, I know this.

My family is dysfunctional, we fight, aren't that close, alcoholism, depression, violence. I know ending my life will only make things worse for them. I also do not want a funeral or any fuss made of my death, which obviously will happen in some way. I am therefore trapped in this world, I don't know what to do.

I have suffered from depression but I am not that depressed at the moment, just being realistic. I have sought help in the past, I have taken medication, am currently seeing a counsellor, sometimes it helps, but I know from these experiences that nothing will truly make things better for me.
