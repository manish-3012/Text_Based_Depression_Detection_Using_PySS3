You don't have to read it. Suffice it to say that I've been having a lot of money and credit problems, then about a month ago I became ill which gave me more money problems. 

Now things are getting worse. It seems like there is tragedy waiting to ambush me on every turn. I thought I had until November, but I got a notice this week saying our lease ends in September. We cannot afford to renew the lease. We've been paying rent 2 weeks late for a year. Our roommate also wants to end the lease. Paying month to month will be several hundred dollars more. 

My boyfriend will be able to stay with his mom until he finds a place and has enough money to get security deposit and first month's rent. I don't have anywhere to go. I asked my mom who lives in NJ if I could come stay with her for a while, but she is living in a tiny cramped apartment. None of my friends have anywhere for me, not even a couch. My boyfriend's mom is extremely religious and doesn't like me living with her son anyway, I can't stay with her. My only options are homeless shelter or church pew. I still haven't found a job either. 

I can't take one more bit of bad news. I am already a tumor on the people I love and care about. Now I have to be a tumor on society? I have no job, no money, bad health, bad credit, and now I'm going to be homeless. I don't even have anyone to talk to because no one understands. I have nothing left. I really can't do this anymore. I can't take any more pain. My whole life has been pain. It's not worth it. I'm not worth it. I don't see how it could get better. I've exhausted all my options, burned my bridges, ruined my life. 

Tl;dr - money problems, health problems, bad credit, no job, going to be homeless in 2 months.
