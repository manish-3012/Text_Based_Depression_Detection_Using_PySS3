I want to jump off a bridge.For the past several weeks I have been going through a really bad episode of depression. It got so bad that I went to the hospital last week. The following Tuesday I went to go see a psychiatrist. I got risperidone for my bipolar disorder. Anyways, it hasn't helped at all, it may have made things worse. I got overly arrogant tonight while in a state of mania and was extremely rude to my last and currently closest friend. I don't know what to do. I'm 18 years old and I'm alone I'm the world. I feel like giving up. I just want rest.

Edit: I went to a local bridge. Park my car on the side, hopped over to the sidewalk. Grabbed the bars and realized they've thought about this. They designed the before so I couldn't jump, thank goodness. Anyways, the cops came, took me to a hospital, and now I'm just waiting. I'm pretty tired but at least I'm alive.
