I want your opinionI'm not sure if I should commit suicide or not. I know it's difficult to talk about but I need to get it off my chest.

I've been depressed for a long time now and always been thinking about it. The only thing that keeps me not thinking about it is baseball and friends and family. Other then that I just can't escape these thoughts. 

I would like your opinion on the subject. 2 reasons why I wouldn't is the path I would leave behind for my family and friends to bare and death itself. Thank you
