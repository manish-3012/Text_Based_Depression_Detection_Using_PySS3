feeling scared, down, hopelesstomorrow i have court for felony possesion of a controlled substance (heroin) which i used to self medicate with, i dont really have a prior criminal record but the 2 times ive been in jail for only 12-24 hours scared me so much, i feel so trapped and i am not the type of person that typically would fit in with people that are in a jail. im very worried about whats going to happen to me and how long im going to be in the jail, i cannot afford a lawyer. they wont send me to prison right? prison being any sentence over 1 year, jail being less. I would honestly rather be dead then be in there it affects me that much and if i had to do a long time i dont think i could live to see it through.
