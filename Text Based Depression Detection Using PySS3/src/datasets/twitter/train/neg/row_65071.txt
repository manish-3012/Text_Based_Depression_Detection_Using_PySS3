Just need some uh, not advice but someone who understands.I've been going through "depression" for the last 6 years of my life or so now? And I can't see a way to change it now I'm not being rude but I'm not asking either.

I'm slightly overweight, I have no goals, dreams or aspirations for myself or future life. I quite literally don't care if I end up in a mansion or carboard box it's quite strange, I know it's bad but I don't care enough to change it and I never have and don't really feel I ever will.


I also am having issues with my partner in the sense of I'm a huge overthinker, extremely jealous.

I sound like the biggest fucking Oxymoron I know but It's just how I am and I wish it wasn't but there's no way I've seen, tried or been told that would change this even in the slightest. 

I had a problem a while ago with cutting and I don't really ever cry maybe once a year if that? But recently I've teared at almost anything and everything, I've wanted to hurt myself more now than ever and nothing is even happening I can't quite comprehend it.

I don't quite fear dying, It's more the leaving people behind or the lives I'd ruin by taking my own and for that reason I can't do anything. But I can't continue like this? 

I was on Anti-Depressants (150mg sertraline) for a year and they didn't help from start to finish if anything they may have made me lower than normal but it's whatever really because there's not a level it's just how I feel on said day.

I came here to just seek and find if there's any one quite like me in the sense of knowing and not, well.. Not, not caring but not having any inclination on changing to make your own life better?
