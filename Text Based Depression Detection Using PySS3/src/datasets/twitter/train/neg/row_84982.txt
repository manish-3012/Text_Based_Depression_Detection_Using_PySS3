Do I deserve to liveIf I died right now noone would care.i don't have any real friends.i always start conversations and get dry responses .i don't feel comfortable around  females  because of all the emotional abuse my mom put me through and then just left us.i will never find love .I keep getting reminded everyday that I am a failure and a disappointment to my parents  compared to my siblings.i had my first suicidal thought when  I was 10 because I was afraid that my grades aren't good enough for my parents .this all should probably end soon.
