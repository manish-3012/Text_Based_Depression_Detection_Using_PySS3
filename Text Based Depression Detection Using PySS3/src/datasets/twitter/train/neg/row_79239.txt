Its my birthday in a week, ill be 28, and i have completely fucked up my life.
just a few months ago I was in a 5 year relationship with a dream job, more money and possessions than i knew what to do with.

Today I am in a strange city with no job, no gf, no money, I'm a late on my rent and i have no food.

I don't qualify for any government assistance, I dont have any friends in this town and I am sick with a cold, so i cant even go out and do anything to improve my situation. I can't even begin thinking of any way out of this mess, I fucked it all up. Bad.

I didn't ask for advice, because frankly I can't even think of any question to ask. I'm just fucked. I'm thinking maybe i should an hero.

edit: I am not going to do it, thankyou for your concern, this really broke me out of the spiral, I have reached out for help in the real world and have bought myself some more time.
