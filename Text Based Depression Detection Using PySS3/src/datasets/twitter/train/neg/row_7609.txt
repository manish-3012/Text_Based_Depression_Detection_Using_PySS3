Today is not a good day.I'm two and a half weeks in to my second try of anti-depressants (diagnosed with depression one year ago) and have been given an unexpected day off which I am wasting as today as my depression is winning. I much prefer being busy and pretending I don't feel like this. Just can't find the motivation to do something.
