Suicide is on my mind 24/7Ok .. iâ€™ve been thinking about killing myself for almost 2 years ... 
It all started with depression i was [ 15 ] then when I first forced to went back to my country which is iraq ... I used to live in Malaysia since i had born ... 
Sadly , I found myself lost here , like no friends, enjoyment is no longer something i know , everything feels like a nightmare, and there is those time when i feel like Iâ€™m never going to get rid of this reality again...
a couple of months ago , my girlfriend of 4 years decided to break up with me due to the distance between us , she turned cold towards me like I donâ€™t exist in her life anymore .. 
since she left me , I started to think about killing myself and i am not going to survive this month , everything feels empty, dark , and nobody is here for me even my family thinks that Iâ€™m dramatic but the truth that iâ€™ve had enough of being suicidal and i want peace , i want to die ...
