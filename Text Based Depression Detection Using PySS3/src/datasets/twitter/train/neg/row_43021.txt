i don't know what's wrong with mehere's what happens when im super drunk:

1.always feel im hopeless and worthless. like no one likes me and everyone hates me 
2. i get emotional
3. think about killing myself and think of ways to kill myself, like cut myself with a knife (previously done several times) or think about what would happen if i overdose on my anti-depressant pills 
 4. i want to buy other peoples drinks and spend a lot of money 

**but the thing is, i still have so much fun throughout the night and i also haven't struggled with any self-confidence and people always call me a social butterfly because i can be friends with anyone instantly and im pretty outgoing. the 1-4 happens when i come home and im alone in my room. 

anyone experience this or similar to this before?
