It's not your place to judge the person who has given up.It's not your place to judge the person who has given up. On people, on hope, on life, on whatever. It's really not helpful to talk back to them and say they are delusional or wrong or ignorant. There's is a reason why one comes to this conclusion. There is a reason, after trying in all and every way they could, that they give up on something. Just because YOU live in that bubble of happiness, of privilege, of (honestly) ignorant idiocy, doesn't mean the person who sees through it, after having gone through it, is wrong.
The only thing you are doing is proving their point.
