Everything just keeps getting worseI donâ€™t want to be alive. Everything keeps falling apart. The past few years my body has slowly stopped working, to the point where I canâ€™t work anymore.
I have to rely on other people to help get me through the day. Iâ€™m pretty much stuck on the couch smoking weed trying to dull the bull shit pain and muscle weakness the universe has gifted me. Also just this last Tuesday the one person i thought was going to be with me forever just gave up on our relationship because he couldnâ€™t handle the emotional dependency from all of this. Iâ€™m stuck back in a home with a father who has been emotionally, verbally and physically been abusive but i have no where else to go. I feel empty and broken and everything has become such a fucked up mess I canâ€™t think straight.
