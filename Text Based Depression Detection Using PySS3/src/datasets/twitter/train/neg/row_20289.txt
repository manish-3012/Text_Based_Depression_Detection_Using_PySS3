Runner's highThe last 6 months has been one hell of a ride. Ive never been so hurt, so damaged, so unmotivated to move on. Ive been stuck with the pain. I wanted it to end so bad: my at the the moment pain, according to my therapist, but I did not see it that way. Ive had days when the coldness of a knife against my skin calms me down. Ive had days when I would run out of oxygen because I could not stop crying. 

I ran my third marathon a couple of days ago. It was not my best time. I went slow and steady. I was not prepared. I was not running with someone. I kept a pace I can handle and stuck with it. I did not over exert myself. I just let everything be. I went even slower on the uphills and enjoyed the downhills. I kept going. The last 2 kms, I could not believe I endured it all. I couldn't believe I stuck with life. I am so happy. Happy for being here. Happy for the strength to endure the pain. Happy for the support Ive received. 

Im going to keep a slow and steady pace in life. Ill go through with life one day at a time. Im letting everything go: the happiness and the sadness. I am accepting that I have no control of whats behind me and I will not let those deter me. Nothing can stop me.
