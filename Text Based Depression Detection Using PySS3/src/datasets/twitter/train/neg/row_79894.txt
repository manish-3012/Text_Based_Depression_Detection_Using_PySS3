I need helpThis is my 3rd post here in 3 days. I donâ€™t know what to do. I live alone, all my family lives out of state. I donâ€™t have many friends left where I live because Iâ€™ve pushed them all away. They think I just want attention, I havenâ€™t been able to come out of this depression for about 2 years and itâ€™s coming to a head. I am bipolar and untreated. I am afraid to get help. I have been in a mental hospital 3 times. Iâ€™ve seen doctors since I was 6 years old. I have horrible anxiety. I am about to be evicted from my home because my dog got in a fight with a neighbors dog and my landlord doesnâ€™t want us there. Iâ€™m frantically searching for a new apartment where I can have my dog. I have lived there for 3 years and Iâ€™ve only been late on rent ONE time. I always pay. I have a vehicle but it isnâ€™t very reliable. I live in the mountains, an hour and a half away from any doctors that could help me. Iâ€™m afraid. I want to die so badly. I miss my ex boyfriend more than I could ever imagine and life just doesnâ€™t feel worth it anymore. I cry constantly. I feel so sick. I donâ€™t want to work right now. I canâ€™t go an hour without thinking about suicide. I cannot live like this but my dog needs me. I feel crippled. Please someone help. What do you do when youâ€™ve hit rock bottom? How do you get up?
