Been 5 years. Never gets farther than picturing the bullet in my brain.It's not that I feel necessarily suicidal at any given moment, but more of an overarching feeling that that will be the end of my life. I guess it stems from feelings of failure. I don't and haven't felt anything towards life besides visceral enjoyment for a long time. After I graduated from college, I don't know, I stopped doing anything that wouldn't take up my brain 100% of the time. I stopped doing things that let me think; I don't write anymore, I don't listen to music, I can't allow myself to focus. 

I just can't focus though. I have to keep 100% occupied or I just start to creep in on myself. I don't know. It's never a pressing issue. It just seems eventual to me.
