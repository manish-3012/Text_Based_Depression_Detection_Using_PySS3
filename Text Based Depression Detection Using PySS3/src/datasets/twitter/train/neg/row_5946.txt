Every time I try to go in publicI wish the whole time I wasn't me. Damn it. From now on I protest my existence. No one wants me here, I don't want to be here, so I am now in protest of my even being here. No more trying to do things other people are doing. I am no longer a person. No more social gatherings. No more eye contact for that matter. It's just torture watching people be people and I know I will never have that.
