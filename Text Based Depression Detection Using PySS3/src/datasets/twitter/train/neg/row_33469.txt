How to help when you need help...My best friend is talking about suicide and wanting to die but I don't know what to do? I have the same feelings and thoughts myself so I don't know how to help him when I need the same help too. Is there anything I should do? Like I don't want to make it worse but I feel like I'm the only one who actually gives a fuck about his problems and emotions.
