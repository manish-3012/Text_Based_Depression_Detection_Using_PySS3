death, continuedI posted here before and saw something interesting.  I asked for information.  You know what I got back?  A bunch of people who wanted to do the same thing to me as they always do: spit back personal information about me.  This makes things worse, obviously, but at least a bunch of trolls are having laughs.

In the end, my desire to self-terminate grows stronger.  I have so little left now, but still have the same bitterness, just a bit stronger now.  The main goal throughout the process is to minimize the subsequent fallout.  It would certainly have been nice had the patrons of this forum been more respectful of my privacy, but that was obviously a bit of a ridiculous expectation, considering the source.
