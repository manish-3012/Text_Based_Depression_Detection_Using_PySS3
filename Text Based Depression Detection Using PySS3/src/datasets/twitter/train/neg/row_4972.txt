What's the fucking point anymore?I've lost everything. 2 months ago the person that mattered more to me than anyone else in the world gbosted me. I went from talking to her everyday and having day long conversations to complete silence in under 3 days. And it was all my fault. I fucked everything up without even realizing it. 

Then on Sunday within one hour I had lost everyone else that mattered to me. One girl in my "friendgroup" started rumors about things I've said. Twisting my words or making things up. She destroyed the friendships I had worked so hard on. The only friends I had and one person destroyed it all because they wanted to start drama to make their miserable life seem interesting. The people I considered my friends didn't even let me defend myself and prove she was lying. Instead they threw me out of the group like I was trash. 

I dont want to go on. The only future I saw for myself had all of these people in it and now I've lost all of them. I'm not strong enough to put all of this behind me and move on. I'm never going to forget this and I'm never going to be able to stop myself from letting it destroy me. 

I know killing myself is selfish and does nothing but make my family suffer, but at this point I don't care. I cant take this anymore. The only thing stopping me from killing myself right now is the lack of access to a painless method.
