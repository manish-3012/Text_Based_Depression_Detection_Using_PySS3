I'd post a big drawn-out thing about how much I want it to be over right now......except I feel like the people here would only try to encourage me not to do it and feed me a bunch of the same unhelpful bullshit I've heard from my friends, family and therapists over the last 25+years.  If anything I need encouragement to go through with it, someone to say that my decision is justified and acceptable, that it is my life and my decision. Life is not that valuable, as humanity evolves and expands, our lives will continue to become less and less valuable, and that it is ok to realize that lack of value.

I really don't understand the stigma around suicide in our culture, it seems so selfish to encourage people who are in pain to continue to suffer.  I would never be so selfish as to try and talk a truly broken person, such as myself, out of killing themself. Some of us truly have nothing to live for and that should be accepted.
