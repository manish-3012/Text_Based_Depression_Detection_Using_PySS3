I (/-///-//)must be to toxic to loveHey guys it's me again, 
     I will use a code everytime I speak on here maybe /-///-// 
That's my name
I feel like my boyfriend doesn't focus on me like he always tells me how he cares for my family but like he talks about my mum alot like all the time how he knows shes toxic because past trama and stuff and how my sister and I are stubborn and just spoiled and then my older sister is a bitch. Like some of these are true but every time we go out he talks about them then he gets down and doesn't want to do anything with me.... It's like my existence is less important. He only focus on my family and want to fix them like help them get better but we are both young and my parents aren't going to listen to him just because he said it... Then he puts me in a place saying I'm just like them because it's how I was raised and that I can't change it because I'm not putting in the work to.... Sometimes he tells me he's lonely and gdixkabxisjBaiifvs. I just I'm already down but now I don't think he likes me because my family and him and just idk what do I do I'm so lost my head is just so fucked.
