I can't go back to depression againIt's back. I've seen it coming for about a month or two but I've been in denial. All the feelings of hopelessness, nothingness and self-hate from three years ago. The suicidal thoughts. I thought I was free. I can't go back to depression. I'm terrified. I refuse to go back but I can't control it. I need help, I'm not healthy but I have no idea what to do. I'm scared to even leave my house because I think if I do, I might actually act on my impulses and throw myself in front of a train or something. Help me. Pray for me.
