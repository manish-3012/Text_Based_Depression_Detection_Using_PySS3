How well do suicide hotlines work?Ive been dealing with more in my life the past 2 months than I ever have. I'd even go as far as to say it's worse than when I got locked up for 8 months straight. Just because it's been a long string of bad luck and just one thing after another. Also my career  I've wanted my whole life could be in jeopardy and if I get disqualified I honestly don't know what I'll do and have no one to anonymously vent to besides reddit. I've never considered a suicide hotline because much like counselors its always felt cliche like theyre just there to talk because it's their job and what they do it to collect a paycheck and don't really care. But those who have experience with them how helpful are they?
