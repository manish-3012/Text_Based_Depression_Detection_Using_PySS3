I keep daydreaming about blowing my brains outI don't have a gun and none of my relatives do either, I live in a country with strict gun control and the closest I have ever gotten to one is an old shotgun my grandfather used to have, yet when I'm done with my exhausting days of school, work grandpa and hospital visits I can actually see myself from a 3rd person point of view, standing in my room, firing the gun against my head and falling to the floor. I imagine how quiet and peaceful it would finally be.

I just need a break, but everytime I feel like I can finally take a breath I sink deeper underwater (and if you want to shove your religion into this and say something along the lines of "god only gives you as much as he knows you can handle then f#ck you and your god). I'm definitely not going back to a mental hospital because it left me with more trauma than when I came there (totally not saying all mental hospitals are bad, the ones in my country mostly suck though), death seems like the only option because I cannot just run away nor can I pause my life for a while.
