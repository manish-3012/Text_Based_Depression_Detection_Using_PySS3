1st of November should have been itI am here at 15 somehow past my birthday.
I donâ€™t feel I should be here yet i find it funny I am. 
I had planned to literally put rocks in my pockets and jump off this really nice bridge with a flowing river I have always loved since I was a kid but now Iâ€™m still here, I am ashamed I am 15 and yet I still think Iâ€™m 12, when I was 9 my first best friend told me to f*** off because I was annoying and my little mind spiralled.
I honestly donâ€™t know how I knew how to do this or where it was influenced in me but I tried to hang myself off my bunk bed about a month after that but evidently the rope snapped.
About a few months ago I tried this again but with a different method of an old and kind of blunt steel ruler but that didnâ€™t work either as I panicked from seeing the blood and made a really bad bandage with paper form a copy and duct tape I use to fix my headphones.
I had a bottle of bleach to my mouth a month ago and I donâ€™t no what in my pale ceramic bathroom talked me out of this but just remembering stupid shit like my old wall-e toothpaste and giving myself a beard in a bubble bath when I was 5 somehow just made think â€œnot todayâ€. 
WHY DO I ALWAYS BACK DOWN!
I am almost a straight A student in math and English and Iâ€™ve been failing them now, staring at a class test with a very blunt 28% in front of me brought me only shame but a second later I laughed about it because I realised it didnâ€™t matter, whenever life becomes really shit Iâ€™ll kill myself.
Itâ€™s like a character form a movie just walking around listening to people when I want, now Iâ€™m only polite to people when I think itâ€™s beneficial, in my head Iâ€™m wondering how it will help me or what I can get them to do as some petty social obligation, I am clever and I hate that, I am literally a maniacal nerd..... let that sink in.

I honestly donâ€™t why I havenâ€™t done it yet because now all Iâ€™ve realised is that the girl Iâ€™ve liked for 2 years and rejected me a few months ago likes someone else and thatâ€™s frustrating....very frustrating.
After that confession along with the most blunt let down which consisted of â€œhaha Iâ€™m laughing right now, I like you too jkjk back to the conversationâ€(I barely paraphrased)
We were friends and I passed this confession off as kind of spur of the moment and continued talking about our favourite movies holding back tears.
Fast forward a few months and I start talking with a friend of a friend who turns out to be the first girl Iâ€™ve talked to since and guess what! Itâ€™s the first girl-scratch that-person my generation who also like books!!! I start talking to her about movies books and surprisingly monster and Iâ€™m actually kind of funny with witty jokes that I swear some made her laugh and this was FANTASTIC.
It was the first girl Iâ€™ve spoken to and it was the start of a fun new friendsh..... oh no,oh GOD no, please donâ€™t do this to me,nononononono....
I got a text from her friend, it said she likes me, I talked to my friend and he said I was kind of her 
rebound, and all this was literally nothing to her.

This is a long text with little content, sorry you read this.
