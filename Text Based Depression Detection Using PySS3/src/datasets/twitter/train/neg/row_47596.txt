Didn't think I'd even make it to this yearI've felt like this for so damn long. The first time I tried to kill myself, I couldn't have been more than 6. I was abused at home in the whole of my childhood, and badly bullied at school. Began self harming at 10 or 11. Attempted suicide too many times for me to accurately recall, and that's just trying to recount elementary school. 
I feel as though I'm going nowhere in life, and I'm honestly better off dead- which I can tell is an unfortunately common sentiment. Nobody truly loves or needs me. I've tried to help or befriend people, but I know everyone's only tolerating me. I suppose I deserve it, being a person with no worth or redeeming qualities. 

I suppose I don't feel pure sadness all the time, just some sort of dull pain and numbness. A sense of having been at this too long, quitting too late. Like I've died already, but continue to walk.

Anyways, in back in eighth grade I set a date. April 17. I've often attempted on that day, almost annually. Nobody ever noticed. My family didn't notice back then, none too sure anyone would notice now. As far as I'm concerned, I've got no potential, tons of damage, and no reason not to take my life at any given time.

I suppose that's all I'd like to say for now.
