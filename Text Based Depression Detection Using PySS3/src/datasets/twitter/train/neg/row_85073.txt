I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m supposed to doMy wife cheated on me whilst I was working over seas. I got home and she left me. She wonâ€™t give me a reason or admit to it. I canâ€™t deal with the pain and the loneliness and my mind is revolving around ending it. I donâ€™t want to do that to my family and friends but I canâ€™t get it out my mind. Just going around in circles that I should hang myself in our marital home because I canâ€™t see a way out of this.
The girlfriend before my wife cheated on me and left me, I found my wife and thought thatâ€™d never happen in a million years and it has. 
I feel worthless and alone and donâ€™t see how I can find someone that wonâ€™t cheat on me. I donâ€™t want to be alone so I feel like my only way out is to hang myself.
