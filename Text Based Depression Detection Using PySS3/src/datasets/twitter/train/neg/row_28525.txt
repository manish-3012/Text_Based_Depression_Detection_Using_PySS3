I deserve to dieI'm a terrible person. I'm lazy, fat and stupid and I'll never do anything worthwhile with my life. I wish I could work up the courage to just kill myself. I know jumping in front of the train is selfish because it causes delays and the driver can get PTSD, but I just want things to be over. I don't want to have to think and live anymore. I want to go to sleep and never wake up. I'm young, able bodied, but I don't appreciate what I've been given. I just want to die because I can't do anything. I can't take care of myself properly I neglect personal hygiene and I eat compulsively. I should kill myself already instead of letting thing get worse and feeling like shit every single day. My family doesn't love me, and everyone would be better off without me here dragging everyone down and without my failures to live up to their expectations. I can't do it anymore. I can't keep holding on.
