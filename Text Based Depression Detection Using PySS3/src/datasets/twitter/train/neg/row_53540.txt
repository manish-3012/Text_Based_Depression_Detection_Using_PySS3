I can't keep tricking myself into going on any more.The world is going to shit, it took me so many years to realise some really basic and important things about myself and my  life, I have nothing to look forward to, and even people who I call friends because I don't have anything better don't really care for me, I can send messages and days and days go past with no response. I'm old, i won't have a chance to fix all my mistakes, and I've lost everything that actually mattered to me a long time ago and only just realised how little there really is going on for me.
