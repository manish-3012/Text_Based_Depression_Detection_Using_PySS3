No where to goIâ€™m newly homeless disabled and in a hotel Florida with no more cash to get another night. my birthday is on the 11th lol tried to go back to an abusers( my father who choked me cause he doesnâ€™t believe Iâ€™m sick) house and they refuse to accommodate my disability.. Iâ€™m allergic to things like fragrance. I lived in a tent for 4 months even after a surgery to remove my gall bladder. I donâ€™t even want to kill myself I think I might have to though because I canâ€™t fend for myself with the disability I have. I m S o T I r e d 
My mom lied to me saying I could go back. I hate liars. My dad is like napoleon. My fiancÃ© is going to be in a condo with her parents ... I a m Goin g T o Be no w h e r e without help. Iâ€™m heart broken
