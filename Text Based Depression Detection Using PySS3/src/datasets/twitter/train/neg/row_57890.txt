I hate being aliveYou know, maybe if JUST ONE FUCKING TIME something would go right for me without causing some other part of my life to go horribly wrong, I might consider staying alive. But fuck. At this point every day is just another goddamned fucking chore. I have no friends. I'm a shitty terrible boyfriend. My grades are slipping at school. I have nowhere to go. Nothing to do. My life is a useless waste of time. The idea of waking up every day until I'm 70 makes me so unbearably sad that I just don't fucking see a point anymore. I've been a cutter for years, and somehow, I don't think it's gonna be enough this time. I think I just pissed my girlfriend off to the point that she's done with me?
How? By being an over-emotional freak and getting upset over TINY, MINUTE, things that she says. Because I'm such an emotional wreck all the fucking time, of course I HAD to shoot my mouth off. She left without even saying goodbye. So now here we are. I'm almost in tears and my family will be leaving soon so I'll have a great, big empty house to kill myself in. I fucking hate being alive and it isn't worth the pain I endure incessantly every single day of my life.
