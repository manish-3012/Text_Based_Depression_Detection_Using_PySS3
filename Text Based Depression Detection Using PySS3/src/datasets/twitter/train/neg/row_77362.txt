I'm a liar. I'm a cheat. I've personally ruined every good thing in my life and I think it's time to go.I lie. I've lied my entire life, small lies. big lies. gigantic lies. I lie and it's ruined any connection I have with anybody ever. 
I've cheated on every single girlfriend I've had. Growing up I thought that I would be better, that I would grow out of it and 'mature' I'm now 28 years old. 
I lost my best friend because I slept with his girlfriend. I lost the trust of my parents by lying about everything. I've ruined every relationship I've had. Including my most recent where I made a married girl fall in love with me. 

The thing is I don't really feel depressed. I'm quite a happy guy. I'm good at stuff, I have a reasonable job (that i procrastinate my way through) I have my own house and I'm not unable to get a girlfriend.

I just feel like I should go, I'm a bad person. It would kill my parents but they would recover.
