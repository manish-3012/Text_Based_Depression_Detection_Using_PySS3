I tried to give him his Christmas gifts because I know he is leaving me.I tried to give my boyfriend/fiance his Christmas gifts, because after my outbursts the other night, he has not wanted to speak to me. I asked him if he wanted a hug, he said no. He said I am the last person he wants to speak with at this point.

I said "I need to know what is going on, are you leaving me?" He told me to sit with the discomfort of uncertainty and to deal with it. He isn't telling me if he is leaving or not, but I know he is. 

I tried to give him the gifts I bought him for Christmas and he didn't want them. 

I am so fucked in the head. Nothing I do makes me change. Weeks of bliss go by and then I fuck up again and again. 

I'm tired of being alive. I have been happy lately, but I can't take the joy being crushed and taken away from me every time bad things inevitably happen again.

I really don't know why I'm even posting this. Life isn't worth living without him. We are long time soul mates. We are each other's best friend. Anyone who says I'll move on is full of shit.
