I canâ€™t see the point anymoreI donâ€™t even know why Iâ€™m making this point haha. maybe because Iâ€™m drunk. my life is falling apart around me. my family is abusive I guess, my mental health is declining and the mental illnesses are showing, and the only person I truly trust and love, who I depend on, who I see as my â€œtrueâ€ family, is drifting away from me. I canâ€™t blame him. Iâ€™m obnoxious, a complete mess. he swore heâ€™d never leave me, heâ€™d always love me, heâ€™d always be there to support and help me. I wonder, has he found another woman to replace me with? is he spending all that time heâ€™d devote to me on someone else? I trusted him fully, like Iâ€™ve never trusted anyone. I told him things Iâ€™ve never told anyone else. I guess it all goes back to him, but itâ€™s not his fault. itâ€™s my fault for being such a pathetic, broken mess. I spend most of my time either drunk or thinking about the next time I can get drunk. 

maybe there is no point. maybe this is just how itâ€™s meant to be. most nights I spend crying myself to sleep, wishing my father could will himself out of that stupid box in that stupid cemetery to hold me and tell me itâ€™s all okay. I guess I have daddy issues, and I guess nobody will ever fully love and accept me because of it. but I want him so bad, I can barely remember him and I feel so guilty. he loved me so much and I barely remember him? how disgusting. I just want to be with him, but I canâ€™t bring myself to believe in an afterlife, I canâ€™t convince myself Iâ€™ll ever see him again. I wish I could. 

all I can do is imagine a life where I run away, change my name, and somehow overcome myself to be a better person. a better woman thatâ€™s hard working, successful, lovable, not unstable, independent. or suicide. all I can see is all the ways I could end it. the blood splattering on the wall behind me, the bath filling with blood, the way Iâ€™d sway in the wind, the way Iâ€™d choke on my own vomit and struggle to breathe, I donâ€™t know. itâ€™s so hard not to order a pack of razors, itâ€™s so hard not to take all these pills at once and let it happen. 

I donâ€™t know. I have so much to say, but does it matter? Nobody cares what I have to say, what I think. Iâ€™ve always been completely alone, and itâ€™ll stay that way. maybe Iâ€™ll survive this night, but tomorrow Iâ€™ll just buy more alcohol, Iâ€™ll keep begging for harder drugs, and eventually Iâ€™ll push past my limit and maybe then Iâ€™ll be free. I doubt anyone will even notice. nobody will miss me, and nobody will care. oh well.
