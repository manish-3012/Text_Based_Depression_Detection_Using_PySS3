Just can't quite do itI have my gun, ammo, my room, and I can't bring myself to do it.  I'm just to damn shared to die I guess. But I'm so sick of living. I mean what's the damn point. Life never really seems to get better. It just keeps going like some unending purgatory, but I just can't do it. Ugh! On top of everything else turns out I'm a coward too.
