I fantasize about death constantlySometimes when I have found a partner who has mutual interest, I desperately hope that I die in some accident. That way I would go out when I was at a good place in my life, and not when I was lonely. Even when, objectively, my life is going great, I still fantasize about death.

I no longer have any fear of death. Extensive use of psychedelics and years of suicidal ideation will do that. If I died right now I would be completely content.

Whenever I'm out with friends, I often think: "I could very easily die tonight". I have these thoughts regardless of my mood. It's generally always in the back of my mind. 

Somehow, by accepting how transient life is, it becomes more meaningful. This is a limited ride. No matter how much you are suffering now, it will all inevitably be over at some point in the future. Life is horribly beautiful. When I go I hope that I've made an impact on others lives, and they think of me fondly.
