Literaly no one to talk toI can't tell anyone that I feel just a bit suicidal. I would be committed. I have a past of many serious attempts, and if I tell anyone about how I feel they will call 911.. 
Where/How can I express my pain? I really can't stand hospital stays, they are not that safe for young women. And as a student (been an undergrad for 7 years), I can't stand interrupting my semester every year...
