18 (f), college studentI am a freshman in college and its only been 1 month and I already want to drop out. I am stressed and depressed when it comes to thinking about school, and I feel as if dying will solve my problems. I donâ€™t want to fail in school and I want to be successful in life. I am scared and I struggle with learning things on my own, and I donâ€™t feel as if my college has anything in place to help me. I appreciate the freedom I get with learning on my own but I need someone a teacher to teach how to solve math problems and not just assign 20 page readings and 3 graded assignments due at end if the week. My mental health is really bad and I feel like starting school another year could help me but idk. I want to be a nurse and help people feel better but I canâ€™t even help myself and I have a mental breakdown every week. I tried killing myself two weeks ago but I couldnâ€™t do it because I didnâ€™t want to leave my mom. This ache and disgust I feel has ruined me and has caused me to push people out of my life. I broke up with my boyfriend and tried to find comfort in other things, and eventually found someone who just uses me for my body. I have grown attached to someone who doesnâ€™t care about me and who isnâ€™t there to comfort me. I was looking for comfort and someone to be there for me because I felt like my boyfriend didnâ€™t care, but I miss him. I feel closed off to the world and like theres no way I can get better. I really want to die and but I love my mom so much and I want to be here for me, but I feel sick. I have looked up ways to end my life and Iâ€™ve taken the gun that was in the living room and had it under my bed to a few days until I actually do it. I want to save myself and I feel like this is the only way I can do it.
