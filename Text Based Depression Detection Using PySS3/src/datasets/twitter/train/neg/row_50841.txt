I finally found a method that will worki am a 12 yr old boy with an emotionally abusive mom and im bored of life (this is basically the gist of it)

So basically I'm just going to hang myself in the garage with my dogs leash. im going to tie it to one of the garages things that make it go up and down and jump off a ladder

i found out this was effective because the leash is strong and not stretchy. I'm going to wait until tonight and finally leave this torture
