Twenty-FiveI always thought suicide was never selfish, it's the 'leaving of self' and letting go. Letting it all go with no pride no selflessness and choice. People commit suicide for life insurance purposes. People commit suicide for so many different reasons but I always knew from a young age what was the point in living the rest of our lives when we are all met with death at the end. Is it the experience in between that makes the difference? Life is kinda like the game, we all make strategic choices in life and whether or not we make it to the end is still up to our choice. It's the act of letting go. We all have our own reasons as to why we would want to leave everything/society behind, but the most selfless act may just be me letting go and understand at the end of the day; I only have myself. Ourselves. Everyone else around us and myself included understand the "purpose" of a life, its so valuable but yet no one values what a life is. To be happy? Why? To live happily down the next few years of our lives? I'm only 20 but since I was 13 I always knew what was the point of making it to 25. 

I haven't picked my choice to leave yet, who knows if I ever will, but why worry? No one else worries about a life only until *you* are a problem. And in this society what do we do with problems? We **solve** them or **suppress** them. What's the point in trying to solve a problem? Everyone just pretending to be your friend when they are constantly talking behind your back when you aren't looking, my family doing all they can to help me out of the suicidal ideation; yet I understand that they only want to see me happy but it is only taking a toll on their health and happiness. I have become the life draining force of happiness. I'm death's best friend at this point. A walking skeleton of just 'doing' what makes people happy. And when I do what makes me happy, society isn't happy. You see the irony? You see the selfishness in everyone? We're all selfish individuals, so I'm asking why can't I be 'selfish' or 'not selfish' for committing suicide? 

If I myself want to let go why can't society and everyone else understand that maybe it is just time? We all reflect upon our choices and I think I would be glad with all the choices I've made in life. 

Talking to a psychiatrist doesn't help either as she only tries to mend/solve the problem and come to a resolution to keep on going. Or on the flip side, even taking in all the advice/help from everyone around me, it is only the suppression of my suicidal ideations. 

Why can't I let go?
