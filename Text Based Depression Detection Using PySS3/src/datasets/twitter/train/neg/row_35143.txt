My lifeIâ€™m just a 16 year old boy living his life. Iâ€™ve been relatively happy for most of it but this year things got so much worse. For one Iâ€™ve never really experienced death before in my life but in one year Iâ€™ve had two. My grandma died of Alzheimerâ€™s and complications with her liver and one of my good friends jumped off a bridge. Anyways today Iâ€™ve hit my all time low. Iâ€™ve always thought of suicide as an escape but never actually considered it because I know how much it would affect those around me because of that friend that jumped off the bridge. But today I actually considered it for the first time. I just always have depressing thoughts about myself like who I am and why I donâ€™t deserve to be put in this world with all of my peers. I called the suicide prevention line to help with this and I guess it did a little. I still just get so saddened by my own life. I kind of want to end it but I know itâ€™d be so awful for my friends and my family. Sometimes I wish I werenâ€™t alive. It feels like something is slowly consuming me and is soon gonna take over me forever. This shit is kind of scrambled because my feelings have been all over the place today. Anyways I just needed to post this somewhere where people donâ€™t know me. And if you are reading this, I hope you are happy and never have to experience anything even close to similar to what I am going through. It feels like Iâ€™m a anchor to all of the people around me who are trying to sail on their little fishing boats.
