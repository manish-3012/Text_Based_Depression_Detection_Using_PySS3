I've always been scared to kill myself, now I want to make up my mind.I'm sorry if this comes off as generic, I've thought about it many times, and I completely loathe being gay. Hanging out with friends and families, suddenly you realize that you're not straight and normal, it painfully stings through my whole body. My parents loved me and I hope I can pay them back. They both worked very hard for me to get good education. In the church same thing, I have no where to turn to. I love my parents but I don't trust them. Through frustration and suffering, I realized how humans want to be accepted, how we crave love from our parents and peers, how we need each other. I miss the times I would wake from bad dream during noon and mom would ask me with a soft motherly voice "oh you're up, what's wrong, are you okay?" Well, I don't like being born to be hated for shit I didn't choose. And I don't like the gay stereotypes either. Life here might've been a pain, but the nostalgic deep curiosity I had for the universe as a child. I used to look at the Moon for half an hour and never get tired of it, I would often wonder what's beyond and what's Saturn's rings made of. It was a fun life up until now, when sex and hormones came into play. I noticed I was addicted to porn but I quitted when I realized that I was actually longing for intimacy. I am naturally very philosophical and curious always been and will always be. Well it worth the experience having a brief moment of consciousness in this existence, if I die I won't feel being hated by others, I won't be aware that I exist or ever existed. I'd be nice if I cease to exist, not ever to come to existence ever again. I guess that's all, I gtg, duty calls.
