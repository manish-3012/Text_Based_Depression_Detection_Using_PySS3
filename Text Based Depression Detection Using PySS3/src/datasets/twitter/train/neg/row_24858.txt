Iâ€™m considering suicideI honestly donâ€™t want to die, but I keep suffering way too much. I donâ€™t know why but everything is going wrong in my life currently. My heightened anxiety relapsed and itâ€™s 100x worse, I feel like the most important people in my life are abandoning me and I feel so left out. Iâ€™m so tired of everything, and I just want to end it all already. It would be best for myself and everyone else if I just died. Iâ€™m such a huge ass burden. Iâ€™m attending therapy tomorrow but I donâ€™t know anymore. I donâ€™t know if itâ€™ll work out.
