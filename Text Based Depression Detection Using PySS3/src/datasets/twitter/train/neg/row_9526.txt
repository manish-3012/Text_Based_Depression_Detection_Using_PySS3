Tomorrow I'm buying a combination of drugs online to kill myself with. It feels like I'm about to set off a death timer that will go off in a couple of weeks when I have the drugs and my affairs in order.I've been building up to this for years and when I turned 18 a few months ago I just knew deep down it was going to be my last birthday. I'm not changing my mind this time. I'm sorry.
