I am a bad person and I just wanna dieI just wanna end it all, I became this depressed, always angry, irritable guy that no one likes. I don't know myself anymore, my father texted me that Im just there when I need him, I tried to check if his okay and I texted him "How are you dad?" last monday but he didnt replied, so I just stoppped and now hes saying that. I don't know man, I just ruined all my relationships and no one understands, when I try to talk about it with other people, they say that theres others have worse life than you, or we all feel like that to bullshit, so I don't bother talking about it to anyone, nothing interests me and I just feel sadness, hollowness, anger, and jealousy for years now. I just wanna fucking end this because no one will really remmber me anyway. I'm just tired of trying to fix this but it just doesnt work
