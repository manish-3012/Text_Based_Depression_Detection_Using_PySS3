ramblingsometimes I don't want to feel better because I want to keep wallowing in thoughs and plans of ending my life. I know if i would get up now and do the things i need to do in the household, i MIGHT feel better, but I do not want to feel better. I want to feel worse so that I am more pushed to finally do it. After years of feeling like this, i know that those temporary "feeling betters" are just that... temporary. In the long term everything is hopeless. 

Another thought I have; im 31, having a callcenter job despite graduated with master degree in law. I am socially awkward, extremely ugly. I Always wanted to travel but Always thought "later, later when im skinny, some day ill do it" , and now im old. But right now i am very serious contemplating suicide. What if instead of suicide i just quit this job that is killing me litterally , and go travel? On the other hand; where would i need to go? Im sooo tired, so mentally dead already that i do not even know where to start or where to go. Its insane that i think another place would make me feel alive again. I am so depressed , if u would see me u would see it immediatly, im a zombie, already dead, i speak and move slow, without any energy. Everything takes up so much energy. How could i get a visa or on a plane if i hardly can move. 

I hate my body my face so much, i can't stand to live in it anymore. Every day i feel uncomfortable ugly and dirty. Ugly can't describe it, it's just a disgusting body. Can't live in it. What do i think that i can travel with it???? 

there is only one way , one solution.. it's not depression, it's not a deluded thinking or low self-esteem. Its all true, facts. I dont belong here and there is no hope on a better future.
