Iâ€™m not sure I have the guts to tryLast time I posted here I ended up self admitting to a hospital. But Iâ€™m not sure Iâ€™ve gone far enough to ask for help. This post is as close as Iâ€™ve gotten. I canâ€™t decide what would hurt less...jumping off a bridge into a freezing river, or drinking antifreeze, both seem like theyâ€™d hurt a lot, but maybe I deserve it. Even if I decide I doubt Iâ€™ll be able to go through with it. Iâ€™m suicidal too often, Iâ€™m tired of relying on others. I cause too much drama.
