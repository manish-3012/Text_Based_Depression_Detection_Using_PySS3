My live in girlfriend of 2 years left. I just want her back, or this hurt to stop. I am a senior year CS student, and my girlfriend who has been my entire life for almost two years now just left me. I know I still have lots to live for but I don't feel that way at all. I am stuck with the apartment, she hasn't even moved her stuff out yet. It hurts so much, everything we worked so hard to build is gone. The future we had planned. I just don't know what to do.
