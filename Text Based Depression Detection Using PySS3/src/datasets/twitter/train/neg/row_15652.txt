Another dayI think I might have  the balls to do it  soon. Iâ€™m  18 bipolar. I just live in my head all day everybody hates me. I hate this shit. There is nothing to look forward to I I just wait for the clock to tick until the day is over just for the next day to start again and more painful boredom. I walk my dog and  I work and  I try get people to do something with me like go get food and such. smoking  used to help not anymore. I just canâ€™t take this burning in my head anymore. Ive tied ropes and shit but donâ€™t have balls to just do it. There is no happy. There is all pain all time all the time. It burn burn burns in my head. i used to think about everything i could be missing but Iâ€™m pretty sure is just more pain.
