No reason to live anymoreI see no reason to live anymore. Iâ€™m 15 yet my life has been in a downward spiral for as long as I can remember. I love my family and I never wanna lose them but Iâ€™m gay so itâ€™s bound to happen idc about that though my problem is me. Iâ€™m the problem. Iâ€™ve always been the problem I keep surprising myself always able to start shit from nothing and self sabotage my self. Thereâ€™s really no reason I should live. Iâ€™m just a burden. Iâ€™m unlovable. The only people who can are desperate or my family. Iâ€™m not really self hating like the people on here I just feel nothing for my life. I wouldnâ€™t care if I died or I just payed in bed forever I donâ€™t know I canâ€™t focus very well even when typing this I might have ADD but ya. I just donâ€™t see a reason to live.
