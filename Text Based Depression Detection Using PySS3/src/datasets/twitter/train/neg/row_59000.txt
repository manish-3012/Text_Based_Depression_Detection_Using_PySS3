I can't even afford a rope to hang myselfDepression has crippled me. I am about to become a financial burden on my loved ones and I can't take it. I am no longer able to support myself. I would prefer death. At least then, I could retain some dignity.

Talking to someone isn't going to remove the sting of failure from my mind. I'm on medication for years, it made a positive impact but I'm losing the fight.

I don't know who I'm talking to. Maybe posting this will get the pain out somehow. I'm sick with the anxiety. I feel like I've done this to myself. I've no real trauma - just 20 years of feeling shit.
