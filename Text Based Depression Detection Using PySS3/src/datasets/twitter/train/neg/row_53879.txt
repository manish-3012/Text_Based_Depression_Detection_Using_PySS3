I want to end everythingNothing ever gets better. 
Getting only worse and worse. 
Im 18 and i can say that never, NEVER in my life i felt protected, or cared. 
I havent left my room for 5 years, fully isolated from even my parents, who hate me for being gay. 
I met this guy, who i fell in love with and for the first time i felt like there was a hope for me to end this kind of life and live like a normal human being, but he left . He says hes family and friends wont accept that he loves a guy and is now with a girl. 
Every morning i wake up from terrifying dreams and first thing i do is check my phone, if there is any notification(i have muted everything else), hoping he will simply wish me good day. But no. 
I could not take the courses i wanted to take cause in my country i simply couldnâ€™t find non-homophobic job. 
If this is how its always going to be, whatâ€™s the point? 
if theres noone who is just gonna hold me
And when ill be old, ill die and noone will notice it until my body starts rotting and then they might find it 
Is that worth all the tears, all the nights where i simply cant sleep and if i do i have terrible dreams???????????????
