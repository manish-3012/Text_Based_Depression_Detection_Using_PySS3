I'm So tired, and its okayI'm going to kill myself tonight, i just can't deal with my family's manipulative abusive behavior anymore, sick of feeling like a failure, sick of being yelled at, physically hurt, and mentally beaten down.. tonight i was called a snake.. cause i was looking out for my own needs.

im sick of calling suicide hotlines, sick of feeling like a basket case, this is the end of the road.

tonight when everyone is asleep, i have two suit ties i have tied together in a knot, i am going to hang myself from my garages rafter, and weirdly i feel really good and calm about this decision.. its okay, my friends will be hurt but they will move on, they will heal.. 

my poly partners will really hurt but they will find people who deserve them more.

i can't fight anymore, i've got nothing left in my lungs, im so tired and its time to realize when to throw in the towel

whatever awaits me whether it be hell, or the dark black void.. ive made my peace with it.
