I'm such a burdenI feel like such a loser. Don't have any friends, ambitions, don't have a job, not going to school... I just sit in my room feeling awful all the time. I feel like a broken person who can't handle the world and doesn't deserve to be happy.

All I do is burden other people. My dad kicked me out because I couldn't find a job and was just generally doing nothing with my life, so I had to move in with my mom. I feel bad because she's already very poor and now has to put up with and support me. 

She also deals with her own mental health issues, so me being a depressed and anxious mess isn't helping much. I feel bad that I have to rely on her support so much since I'm technically an adult and should be supporting myself at this point. I'm just waiting for the day she gets sick of my shit and kicks me out too.

I somehow have less luck getting a job here than when I lived with my dad, so my mom has been pushing me to go to college. But I'm not sure if it's worth the time, effort, and debt since I have no idea whether I'll actually follow through and finish or not.

She often tells me how much it pains her to see how much I'm hurting. She's tries to get me out and do stuff, but I'm such an anxious mess that even going to the store is a challenge. She's even broke down crying because she doesn't know what to do with me.

Because of all of this, I have constant thoughts of wanting to end it all, but I know I won't because I'm a coward and despite feeling like a constant burden, I know my mom couldn't handle it if I was gone. I just always hope that I don't wake up whenever I fall asleep.
