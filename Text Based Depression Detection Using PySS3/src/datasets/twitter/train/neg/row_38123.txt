I can't handle itThis is the first time I've written this. All I can think of its writing a suicide note and hanging myself in the closest. I'm engaged to a beautiful woman and like a dumbass I was texting random women so I could feel attractive or something. She found out and I don't want to hurt her anymore. If I live I'll never do something like that again but for now I can't live without her.
