I saw a quote yesterday and I can't get it out of my head.I don't know who it's by but it was something like, "I'm not saying I would kill myself, but if a car was coming towards me I wouldn't bother to move out of the way." This is exactly what I feel all the time. I can't see myself killing myself but if I was in a situation I can't be so sure I would avoid it.
