my dad makes me suicidaleverything is always about him. if i want/need something and he doesnâ€™t feel like doing it, he wont. and heâ€™s ALWAYS the victim in every situation. he acts like heâ€™s going above and beyond for me for clothing me, feeding me and putting a roof over my head when in reality heâ€™s still receiving child support for me from my mother. heâ€™s a piece of shit and im done.
