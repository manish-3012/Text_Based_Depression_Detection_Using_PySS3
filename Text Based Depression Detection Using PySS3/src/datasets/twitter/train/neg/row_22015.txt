Bye finn, please don't forget meIt's not your fault. I know you dont care. I know you're relieved I'm gone, even if it's just a bit. I'm sorry I hurt you

I don't have the words for how much I love you. There are no words. I'm at a loss. I want this last chance to try and get out how much I love you but I just don't know how

Thank you for being here for me. Thank you for putting up with me. Thank you got loving me at one point. The best day of my life was when I met you. I never imagined this would happen but I'm sorry I ruined things. I'm sorry I'm a bad person. This note will just make you mad at me. I know it will. And that makes me really sad but I know I deserve it. I hope theres no after life because I don't want another conscious moment with out you.Â 

I dunno if you care or not but it's not your fault, this was inevitable. I'm glad you didnt love me when it did though, so it hurts you less. i hope you have a good life. I hope you find a better partner, i don't know how anyone could ever love anyone more than i love you. But i hope you get the love and support you deserve.Â 

I know you can lead the life you want. You're so talented and smart and loving. I have no doubt you'll be an amazing forensic psychotherapist. You'll be an amazing husband to someone. You'll be an amazing dad to pets or kids. It's hard to picture not being there for those things but with or with out me you can accomplish them.


I'm so so sorry, I love you Finni
I hope you can forgive me







This is real
