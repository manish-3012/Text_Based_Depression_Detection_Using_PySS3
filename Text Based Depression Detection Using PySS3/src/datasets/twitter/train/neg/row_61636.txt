the funniest shit happened todayi ordered rope on amazon yesterday, it was supposed to arrive today. my balance is empty and i made sure i ordered it correctly. it didnt come. apparently there was some sort of mix up now its being returned because they though it was cash on delivery even though i clearly have the reciept for it. 

now, i know what youre thinking. maybe this is a sign i shouldnt kill myself. id like to think so, but now that its come to this im going to be evicted from my home and i dont have anywhere to turn to. im not really sure if this is better.
