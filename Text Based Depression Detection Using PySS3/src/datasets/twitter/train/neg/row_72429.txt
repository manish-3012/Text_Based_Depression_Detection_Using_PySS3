A woman cried in my arms, and I felt nothingA woman from my church today was talking to me about how her husband died recently. She was a mess, crying and balling hysterically, and I felt absolutely nothing. Nothing. No emotion. I'm a fucking psychopath.All I could think about were my dark thoughts that I had, and all I felt was the numbness that I constintly feel every fucking day of my life. I felt no compassion or sympathy because my emotions are just dead. I feel like such a shitty person. That woman needed me and I couldn't do anything to help her. I feel horrible about myself.
