I just want it all to end....I am really trying to get past the shit that's happening in my life, but the break with my girlfriend, my exams, me fainting in a public place and no one bothering to help me up all adds to this overwhelming urge for it all to end. I just sit here all day trying to get to Friday when my girlfriend probably will dump me, and I just sit here looking at forums that say breaks=breakups and I know that in my heart, but the slight hope of her taking me back is haunting me so much I just cannot cope... I just can't, the pain is so huge that I cannot possibly get through it.. I know I made another post about this only yesterday, I know I should accept that she doesn't love me like I love her, but some part of me would rather die than accept life's realities, and it just fucks me up so badly...... I dunno how long I can take this.
