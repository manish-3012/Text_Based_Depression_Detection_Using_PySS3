Please, help me.I'll be dead within the month, I can't struggle through day after day anymore. I'm 17. I've attempted upwards of 6 times to take my own life. All between this year, Janurary-march. I've been struggling through each day by listening to music that mirrors my emotions. (Migraine-Twenty-one pilots) I just got my first car last week which is a pre 1999 model so it emits much more CO. The CO poisoning idea won't leave my head, it haunts me, night after night. Please, no helplines, killing myself is simpler than calling one of those. I'm intelligent, not bad looking and athletic. But I have no self esteem, no confidence and no will to live. I never accept any girls into my life that want in because I'm too insecure to have someone emotionally dependent on me when I can't even depend on myself. I fail to see tomorrow. Sorry if it's kinda scrambled and incoherent. I'll be back on this throwaway in a few hours.
