TiredI feel like I canâ€™t even speak my mind without being told to shut up, when people donâ€™t want to hear or see the truth. Free speech? When I talk, I use my oxygen to stand up for what I stand for. I donâ€™t talk out my ass.

I wish that I wasnâ€™t here, everything is dead or floundering and it alllll adds up.
