Don't really wanna go backI haven't been depressed for the past year or so (yay!) But I feel it may be lurking back around. I'm fourteen and its time to socialize but my only friends are Radiohead and my guitar. My family loves me and its all (mostly) good but I haven't talked to anyone my age or with my mindset since school ended, even then it was hard. Help
