is it worth living to save the feelings of one person who cares about you?The only reason I'm still here is because my brother just left for college: he's a genius and he has a great life ahead of him and he's going to be a great engineer. I'm worried if I kill myself when he's only a few weeks into college it will screw him up and make him fuck up his future.

The thing is, my life is just painful enough that I might do it anyway.
