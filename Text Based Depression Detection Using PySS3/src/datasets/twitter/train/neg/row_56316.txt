I don't think I'm cut out to exist.I can't handle it any more. I hate that I'm always the supported, and can't be supportive. I'm not productive, I'm an emotional and financial drain on everyone, and any efforts towards changing that get swept up in my lethargy and vanity. I can't muster up the work ethic to make it through a liberal arts degree, and I'm an emotional plague of locusts that latches onto anyone the least bit kind to me like a drowning man trying to pull them down. It seems to me like I should have some value if I was put on this Earth; but I'm no good at getting insights into anything, and I'm no good at surviving. I almost killed myself, how good can I be at living? So why *am* I here? It seems to be a rather egregious mistake on the part of some horrible stochastic cosmic joke factory. People think I have some intelligence or wisdom, but I'm really just a failure; a fraud, and a faggot, and a freak, a transgendered shut-in without any real prospects, an aberrant, defective model with sub-standard brain chemistry and bad algorithms.
