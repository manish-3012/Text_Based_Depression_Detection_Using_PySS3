Probably killing myself in a few hours. I want to thank all of youI've never posted here and made a throwaway account for this. Reading what you guys wrote to everyone else for the past few weeks helped me live a month longer than I would have otherwise. This is too much though. I don't have money for food, don't have friends, don't have a job, a car, a home, or family. I am ugly. I have a below average IQ. I don't have any skills. I haven't eaten in a couple of days and am miserable. I have been for years. 

I want to thank everyone that posts here though. You're all great people and the world needs more people like you. You have good intentions even if it doesn't help everyone. 

I'm not posting anymore. I'm not changing my mind. I have no prospects or ways to improve my life. Thanks for the last few weeks though
