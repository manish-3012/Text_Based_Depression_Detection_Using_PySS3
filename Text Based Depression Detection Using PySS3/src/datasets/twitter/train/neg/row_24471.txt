I don't deserveI don't deserve to kill myself, I've never experienced rape, murder, physical violence. Hell even my cousin which got kidnapped and almost beaten and cut to death and peed on, made clean up after them, for hours, even he isn't suicidal. I'm not terribly poor, I'm pretty well off. Although I have a cold and unlovable family, it could be worse. My dad could be a child molester, my mom could have been physically abusive. 

I have it pretty good, well good might be an exaggeration, but I have it better than most. So why am I so unhappy, why can't I feel anything at times or too much sometime. I would be better off dead, I don't do anything, do I have aspirations? Yes; do I do anything about it? No. I hate people, can't stand them most if the time. I can't work, I'd rather rot on the street. I'm good for absolutely nothing; I'm only good at feeling sorry for myself. Do I want to kill myself? Kind off, I'm not sure. Maybe it's just the easy way out, I know at least a handful might miss me. But would they even care 1 month after? Will I have made enough of an impact on their life? Who knows. I really want to die, I really want to die. But I feel like I shouldn't but will I ever be able to do, anything?

This is really "ranty", but I'm not sure what to feel. Do I even want to get better and face real life? I'm not sure I'll ever be capable. Maybe if I could live on welfare for the rest of my life I might be able to at least live and maybe pick up motivation on the way.
Well for at least now my life seems hopeless and maybe sooner or later death will come knocking on my door if I don't get better, soon. I just hope my life doesn't end here, and maybe one day I'll know how it feels to smile.
