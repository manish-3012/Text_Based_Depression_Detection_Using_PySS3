told my best friend of my plans.You can see my prev post for my situation if interested.

He knows all the details of my current situation and surprisingly he was cool about me talking about these "dark thoughts" as I called it. He said he would probably do the same thing in my situation. Though he also gave me advice on things to do if I decide to not go that route as well. Just telling someone really did make me feel better though it didn't alter my plans at all it is still nice to feel more at peace and more normal for the time being. I would really hate for my last weeks or months here to be totally wasted laying around watching TV and sleeping excessively like I have been. It definitely gave me the energy to spend as much time with friends and family as I can. I pretty much ignored everyone in December with the exception of Christmas where I put on a good show. Here is to making the most of what time I have left! Though still hoping for that very slim chance of a positive conclusion with nothing happening of course...but also trying to be realistic at the same time.
