Sometimes I wish I'd never been born at all.Hello everyone.
It's late night here. My life went downhill. 
 I was struggling with heavy depression a year ago, it was my absolute nightmare, the worst time in my life. I thought that I got over it, that I'm much more stable now, but turns out I was wrong. I was so afraid of coming back to that feeling, and yet there I am. I feel so ashamed and pitiful writing this, but I really can't keep it inside for much longer. There's nothing keeping me here anymore. I don't find happiness in anything, and I tried to. Ive tried to see positives, I've tried to help people that are close to me, I've tried to keep my mind busy, but it all failed after some time. I have no education, no perspective for the future, I'll be no one, I won't be remembered, and I'll probably die as nobody. I've cutted myslef off from everyone. I don't have strength to write about things that led me to this, because it's too painful for me. At this point I just wish for a quick death. But I know I'll never commit suicide, because I'm too scared of it. I don't have enough courage to do so. What can I do? I'm so hopeless, I don't have strength for anything, no energy inside. I'm waking up every morning, and asking myself why am I still here, what's the point of living like that?I hate myself because in the past some people suffered because of my actions, especially person that I cared the most about. I can't change what I've done. I wish I could just disappear, not die, just disappear. 
Thanks for giving me some of your time,and sorry for any grammar (or any) mistakes, english isn't my first language.
Have a nice day.
