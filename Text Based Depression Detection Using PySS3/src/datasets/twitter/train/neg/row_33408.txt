I feel like a disappointmentEveryone around me wants to get better and I know they care about me. I wish they didnâ€™t because theyâ€™re helping a lost cause. Everyday feels like a waste of time. Iâ€™m not fulfilled. I have no passion. Iâ€™ve tried so hard to get better, but it all feels useless. I wish I didnâ€™t care so much about my friends so I can just swallow the pills but Iâ€™m too much of a coward. Too scared to know Iâ€™d be the reason the only people whoâ€™ve kept me alive are in pain. It makes me feel so selfish. I have a supporting family and great friends but I just canâ€™t be happy. Iâ€™ve already got what I need to kill myself, I just need to wait for the day where I finally succumb to all of this. Iâ€™m scared of actually dying, but the thought of being able to escape this waste of time that I call a life sounds enchanting
