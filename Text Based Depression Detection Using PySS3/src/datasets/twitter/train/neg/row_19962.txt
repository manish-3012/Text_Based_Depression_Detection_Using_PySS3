Am I really loved or is it fake!?Well this all began at my art show I had.I had a booth in a craft show and this boy walked by my booth who came to see my digital artwork. I thought to myself "Wow he's cute." Now we have been dating for 4 months. he helped me set up my art booth up this time, than he came to my house for dinner. I am so happy around him and we hang out at least once a week or more but tomorrow is the art show again and I'm really just considering if I should even be suicidal around him? It's like I am but I'm not. it's just a big mess help!
