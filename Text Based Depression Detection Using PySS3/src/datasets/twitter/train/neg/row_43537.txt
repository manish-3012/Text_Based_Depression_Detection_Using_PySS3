Hey redditMaybe this will end up being just a post that will be passing by on your feed,but I have to take this of my chest.

I just can't take this crippling loneliness,I felt alone around people,around friends,around my ex so I pushed everybody away.I don't know what to do anymore,I sabotaged everything,every aspect of my life until I ended up with nothing.I'm just to stupid,and to tired to to try to make things better again cuz I will just end up being self destructive again.I don't really know how much time I can't take this anymore.

Thank you if you have had a minute to read my problem and I hope you will have a good day.
