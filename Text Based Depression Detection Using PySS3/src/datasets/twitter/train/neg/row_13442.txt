Ready to do itDon't even know why I'm here.  I've been depressed, anxious, and suicidal my whole life. I've been hospitalized twice, been on various meds, therapy etc..Although its been a while since I've done all that. I'm not going through it all again it's all pointless for me.  After being hospitalized in 2013, I've had renewed suicidal ideation for the last 2 years or so as I always repeat to myself that I need to kill myself. I'm finally so ready to do it. I just don't see the point in living like this with so much pain. I have no friends, my coworkers hate me, my bosses hate me I'm struggling in my professional job due to my depression and just don't have the motivation to do anything. I hate my job and as others have said on here, what's the point of living just to suffer and be a slave to pointless meaningless crap. I'm also just not very good at it due to anxiety and not being able to focus. im probably going to get fired soon
