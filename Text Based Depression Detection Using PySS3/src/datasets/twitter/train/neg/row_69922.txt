Anyone willing to chat ?I'm having a full on zombie day. Spending it mostly glued to my screens. 
I try to face real life but I have no desire to. I cant get over the guilt of my past mistakes and wasted years of my life. 

I'd really like to talk if anyone in this sub is open to listening and just holding space.
