My friend is talking about suicide and I'm scaredI don't know what to do. I can't handle this. I'm phobically afraid of suicide and I can't handle this by my self. 

I know this girl online through tumblr so I can't really reach her. I've asked her if she's gotten help or ever talked to somebody but she hasn't answered those questions. I don't want my friend to die and I'm afraid I've done all I can do. 

Her tumblr is [here.](http://get-dressed-get-blessed.tumblr.com/) I really didn't know what else to do except posting here. 

She talks about being sad and hating her body sparsely but it hasn't been this bad in months. She just posted this;

&gt;being alone makes me realize the saddest shit. nobody loves me. nobody gives a shit what I do or donâ€™t do. nobody fucking listens. nobody genuinely loves you for you. nobody. I am fucking alone. I always have been and I always fucking will be. I canâ€™t do this anymore. my life is just bullshit. Iâ€™m fucked in school. my family hates me. my brother is the worst person Iâ€™ve ever known. Iâ€™m fucking hideous. I just canâ€™t go on with anything anymore. Iâ€™m not happy. Iâ€™ve never fucking been happy. I see no point in my life anymore. Maybe I need to suck it up and quit bitching and continue my life being terribly unhappy. whatever


She added the last line afterwards which makes me feel... slightly better? But I'm just so scared and I don't know what to do. I feel like if I recomended her here she wouldn't go. She tends to have a very 'nope don't worry about me :)' attitude...
