Easiest, most painless way to kill myself with household goods?Hey guys,

I've been wondering what is the easiest way to just kill myself without violent means. I really dont want to end up alive in the ER without a body part or screaming in pain for the rest of my life because I damaged an organ. What's the most painless way to kill myself without really buying anything?
