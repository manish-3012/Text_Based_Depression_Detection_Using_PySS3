Please talk me out of it, Iâ€™ve never been so close to doing itIâ€™ve only neared suicide one other time in my life and someone called the police and I had the worst 4 hours in the hospital of my life. Since that moment, I decided if I ever needed to do it, I wouldnâ€™t tell anyone. I have a jar of super strong painkillers and if I take them all right now Iâ€™ll die nearly instantly. Iâ€™ve had this jar waiting in my closet for a year or so. 
Everyone says look at the good things to live for. While I seem happy and successful on the outside (I was just at the admit reception for an Ivy League college, for example), my life is horrible and fucked. I have the stomach flu and my mom accused me of lying. Sheâ€™s heartless. When I was little she would cut up my stuffed animals in front of me and force me to copy the Bible while remaining isolated from friends. Iâ€™m emotionally scarred from the fact that she constantly tries to ruin my life, will never be proud of me, and hurt me so many times as a child. All I wanted was love and yet she called me evil and even blamed my grandmaâ€™s death on me. My parents throw knives at each other.  Their divorce is lengthy and I pay the price. I had a boyfriend who I loved, but he left me because he was intimidated by me. I found a new one to love but he raped and beat me many times. I have friends but it all seems vacuous. 
I donâ€™t want to end it but I think Iâ€™m going to. Im sorry to be grim. Somebody please just tell me something to convince me not to
