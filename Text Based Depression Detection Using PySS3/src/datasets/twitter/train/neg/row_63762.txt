Anyone else put a "time limit" or "goal" on something to attain, but if you dont reach it youre going to just end it?I come to realize im only really living on they hope I can make a very unrealistic and almost luck based dream happen. Id rather put my everything for the most part into it : time, money, passion and energy into chasing the dream than grind out everyday for the sake of just continuing to live. I wish I could just tell my family members there is almost no way im going to make it out of my 20's alive, without all the drama, and they would just accept that I have accepted that, and its not even something to be sad about anymore. 50 odd years of just existing to exist for others isnt what im here for. Ive got probably 2 strong years of going for "it" in me, by then life will have picked out for me what ill be and if I still hate myself ill be taking the easy way out.
