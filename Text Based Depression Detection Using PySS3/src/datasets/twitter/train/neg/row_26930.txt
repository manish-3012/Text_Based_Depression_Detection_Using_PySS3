Drowning in debt and lonelinessUsing a throwaway account for obvious reasons. I've been riding on the depression train since I was a teenager. Suffered a tremendous amount of physical and emotional abuse at the hands of my parents as a child. I also suffered some sexual abuse at the hands of some distant family members. I've been in and out of therapy for almost ten years as well on and off antidepressants, but it hasn't seemed to make much of a difference in my self esteem and general outlook on life.

At 297 pounds I hate my body and have found that no one finds me attractive. In addition, I have a large amount of debt that is seemingly starting to spiral out of control. The money I make at my job is no where near enough to allow me to pay down my debts as well as live. 

Meanwhile, on social media all I see are cheery posts from people who have not talked to me in months giddily posting about their marriages, honeymoons, trips, and babies. It makes me so angry and bitter that they are able to get the praise of the world while I continue to go ignored. Sometimes, it gets to the point where I want to hurt them.

But I know that would be wrong. One of the few things that I have to look forward to is a visit from my friend. Other than that, I just feel like a pathetic, lonely, failure estranged from all of society. The hole I've dug is just deep in regards to my financial situation and my relationship to society as a whole. I think it would be best that I lie in it soon.

I'm hoping somewhere here might be able to help me feel better, but I'm not getting my hopes up.
