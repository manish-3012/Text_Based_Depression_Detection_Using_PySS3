I just want to go to sleep for a really long time.I just want to go to sleep and not wake up. Even the suicide method Iâ€™m thinking of is drowning - involves losing consciousness and never waking up ever again. Nobody can help me but me. Iâ€™m not sure if itâ€™s too late or not but I ruined something perfectly good with my head and self doubt and now I canâ€™t even wake up to face reality anymore.
