I donâ€™t want to feel this way anymore.I keep flipping between being so depressed and feeling absolutely nothing. I donâ€™t want to feel this way anymore but the first appointment I can get with a psychiatrist wonâ€™t be until March. And I donâ€™t know if I can last that long. Iâ€™m about to just give up on everything. If I was just depressed I could handle that, have been for most of my life. But this numb, nothingness feeling is whatâ€™s breaking me down. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore.
