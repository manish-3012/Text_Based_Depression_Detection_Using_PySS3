If you ghosted me then you ghosted meSo ya. I called. Said I really needed a friend. I posted. I reached out. Every one of you "friends" knows I have a progressive brain disease. You step up to come by maybe walk my little dog or help w a grocery store trip or heaven forbid help to get to medical treatment? Nope.

Not fucking one of ya. Not one  message or a sorry I can't but hope you feel better. Not even some empty platitude cliche meme. 

I'm trying to get myself better. Ketamine mega infusion numbers 4 and 5 this week. But if I don't get better you fuckers better not even think about showing up for my funeral.
