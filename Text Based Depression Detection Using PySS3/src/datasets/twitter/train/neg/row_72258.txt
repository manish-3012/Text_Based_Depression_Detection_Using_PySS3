My friend is suicidal.My friend is really depressed, and keeps telling me he does not want to live any longer, he drinks a lot, (i fear this adds to his depression), but no matter what I try and say he still feels the same. (and no, therapy is not an option, i've already suggested it.)
What do I do?
