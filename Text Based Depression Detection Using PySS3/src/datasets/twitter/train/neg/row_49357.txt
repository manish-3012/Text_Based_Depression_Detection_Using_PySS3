things were going so well....Things have been going well but now my life is at a standstill and im losing the will to continue. My life is not moving forward, the hole that i am in is too deep. It feels like my girlfriend is becoming more distant and doesnt want to see me. She says its because she doesnt want me spending money to go see her but im not dumb enough to believe thats the only reason. My family is falling apart. My life is in shambles and i am struggling to get a job and get it back together. I need someone to talk to.... someone thats not going to argue with me, someone that understands.... I am at wits end.
