First time feeling the need to call the crisis hotline.I've always had thoughts of suicide. As I described it, it's like that buzzing white noise you here; it's there when my mind is quiet. I called out of work again. I'm not brushing my teeth at night. I hold off on self care steps if I know I'm not going out. Socializing and even the act of putting on a face tires me out. 
My husband and I just moved into his parent's house for a year to allow us to pay off debt and save up. I feel like I'm losing my freedom and privacy for a year, even though I know it's for the best. This is just making my normal suicidal thoughts worse. Anyways, the crisis hotline didn't help. Their responses felt littleke I was shaking a magic eightball. I searched out other places to kind of just vent out my thoughts and found here. I'm so afraid I'm going to lose my job if this keeps up or something else.
