I'm not afraid anymoreI don't know what to do.. i tied a slipknot this evening but i don't know when i will use it... i'm just breaking apart since 5 years of depression and i just want to die... i'm 20 years old by now and i just can't see any reason i shouldn't kill myself immediatly

i just want the pain to end... i really don't have any real reason to kill myself but there's just this darkness around me and it's eating me alive...
