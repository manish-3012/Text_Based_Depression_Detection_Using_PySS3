Iâ€™m going to kill myself tonightIâ€™ve decided tonight is the night I do it. Iâ€™ve given up on everything and I just want to stop feeling and surrender to whatever death has to hold for me. Iâ€™m a liar, a cheater, a thief, a bad person and I deserve this. I hurt people due to my selfishness and I see no reason to give myself a future. Even if hell is real, I feel like I deserve it. I hope I have enough pills to get the job done. I hope I get to see my mom again once Iâ€™m dead.... goodbye
