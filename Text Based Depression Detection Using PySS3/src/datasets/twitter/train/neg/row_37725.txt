I never post to reddit, but I have no one to talk to.Iâ€™ve had strong suicidal ideations lately and I donâ€™t know what to do. I want to fix it, but I donâ€™t know what will help.

I take medication for my anxiety and depression, but sometimes I still become suicidal. Iâ€™m not sure if I should try asking for a higher dose of medication, a different medication, or try seeing a therapist.

Most days everything feels hopeless and the thought of talking to my doctor or a therapist terrifies me. I feel like if I told them how strong my suicidal thoughts were and that I had thought of several different plans to kill myself that theyâ€™d send me to a psych ward. Maybe thatâ€™s what I need, but I canâ€™t as it would pretty much ruin my life financially as someone who makes very little and lives paycheck to paycheck.

I have no help. I have no one to talk to. I moved 300 miles away as soon as I turned 18 because my sister (legal guardian) was an abusive negligent drug addict. I have no one to stick around for besides my dog, and he is what has kept me here this long.

All of my struggles would go away if I were dead. My financial problems, my failures in college, my childhood trauma, my chronic pain and mental issues. I know people would miss me, but I can usually reason it out that they wouldnâ€™t miss me enough that itâ€™s more important than getting rid of my problems. My sister has tried to connect with me as an adult and acts as if everything between us is normal now that she isnâ€™t addicted to drugs, I hold a grudge against her for years of abuse and I donâ€™t care if sheâ€™d miss me or not.

Most of the time I think I want help, I want to stay around long enough to work on my problems and try to make my life better. I donâ€™t want to leave my dog behind. I have more things I want to experience. I donâ€™t want to die, I just donâ€™t want to be where I am in life.
