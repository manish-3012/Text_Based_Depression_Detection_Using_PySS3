Never posted something like this beforeThis is going to sound like a jumbled mess. But here goes. I canâ€™t stop crying. I donâ€™t know why. Itâ€™s one of those things where you think youâ€™d grow to get used to the feeling, but you never do. I feel like Iâ€™m pushing my husband away, but anything I do to try and fix it only makes it worse. He knows I have problems. And I tell him that Iâ€™m broken, but I donâ€™t know how to fix it. Iâ€™ve been like this for as long as I can remember. I started cutting again. There are days when I feel so numb that it just helps me feel something. So I know heâ€™s been struggling knowing that. I feel like a burden to him because heâ€™s constantly trying to make me happy, at the cost of his own happiness. But it doesnâ€™t help because it just makes me feel more and more like a financial strain and he doesnâ€™t deserve that. Heâ€™s too good. He deserves better than me.  I get angry. I get angry and selfish because weâ€™re different and I try and mold him into something I need. I like to dance, he doesnâ€™t. But selfishly I force him to do something he doesnâ€™t like to make me happy. We got into a fight last night and he started crying. And I know itâ€™s my fault. I hate knowing that I hurt him. I donâ€™t have friends. Of course I have family. But Iâ€™ve always been the â€œbad exampleâ€ daughter. I know they love me, but I feel like every decision I make isnâ€™t the right one. I feel alone, but I also know that Iâ€™m not. Itâ€™s just my in my head. 

Since I started writing this, I feel better. I just needed to vent.
