finita la commediahe'll move on just fine, however i can't take it anymore. i can't fight for anything anymore including my own pitiful existence. i don't need me, just like he doesn't. i don't need anybody's support really, just sitting still and counting my last hours til i can finally be free of dehabilitating chronic pain in my body and torturing mental state. i miss him, i hope he will miss me as well. at least a small bit. at least the idea of me, the thought of being with me.
