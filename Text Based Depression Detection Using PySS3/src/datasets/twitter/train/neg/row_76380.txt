I donâ€™t knowEveryday my mom comes home and screams at the top of her lungs about how she â€œhates her homeâ€ and â€œhates it hereâ€ and no matter what I do she persists, in tears, screaming for hours until she goes to sleep. I get two to four hours of sleep a day. Only when sheâ€™s at work. I canâ€™t bring myself to sleep in the daytime unless Iâ€™m high. Iâ€™m searching for a job but canâ€™t get one because I have a record after a drunk incident this spring. Everyday that goes on, I sit in this house with my mom and listen to her cry and cuss and scream like she has for the past 23 years. She screams at me, the cats, everyone. And she blames me for â€œnot cleaning upâ€. I clean and cook every day. I have to to keep my mind off of killing myself. My mother sleeps from when she gets off work to when she goes in so from 4am to 11:30pm. I want to die. 


I spend my nights watching my favorite Netflix show to distract myself from my ruined life. Tonight I donâ€™t think anything will help. Iâ€™m tired. We have no money. We have no food. Iâ€™m going to be going to court in a few months. I think I should just go ahead and die.  I canâ€™t see it getting better. It hasnâ€™t since I was a child and it wonâ€™t now. Living with my dad isnâ€™t an option, heâ€™s tired of me. My mom refuses to let me leave the house much anyway, just like she used to when I was a kid. I have no friends. I have no one. I donâ€™t know.
