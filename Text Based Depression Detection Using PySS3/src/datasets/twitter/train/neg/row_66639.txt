The pain is the only thing keeping me from it.The extreme discomfort of dying is terrifying. The state of being dead is what I want, but the act of dying is another story. Iâ€™ve practiced hanging myself without doing it by hanging from a doorknob. The feeling is so horrible. If I had a gun Iâ€™d be gone by now, but I signed away my right to buy one when I committed myself to a hospital last year. 

Life just does not seem worth it. A third of the time we are sleeping, another third we are working, and the last third is shit when youâ€™re depressed anyway. And I feel such existential dread due to the mystery of life. It seems so pointless. I donâ€™t know how being dead feels but in my mind thereâ€™s a decent chance that it beats a depressed life. Even if itâ€™s simply the absence of consciousness, feeling, and time then it beats life. My imagination likens it to the state of deep sleep where we arenâ€™t dreaming. We just have no perception of our experience. In death, I imagine itâ€™d be like this except there would literally be no experience to speak of. Anyway...just very hopeless. Thanks for reading
