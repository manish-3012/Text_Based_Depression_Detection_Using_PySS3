not safe, never wantedit's too much, even fellow trans people want me gone because i don't fit into their binary system that also requires hating your body even though it causes intense dysphoria being called a woman or my birth name but my experiences are invalid and i don't deserve basic respect as s trans person and i don't exist anyway because people erase me sole existence with their chosen language, hey show me they don't want me, the world isn't meant for me and i know that no one here cares either because every time i posted here i didn't get actual responses and if i did and replied people ended up ignoring me and not giving a shit about what's happening anyway so i can as well just fucking leave
