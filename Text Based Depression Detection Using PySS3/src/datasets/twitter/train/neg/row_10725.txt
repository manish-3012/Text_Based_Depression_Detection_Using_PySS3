Why should i keep livingNobody loves me. Even I hate myself. I have never been in a relationship. I am mostly sitting at home cutting myself and waiting for my death while I donâ€™t have to worry about school. Idk what I am going to do when it starts again. Should I stay alive for the slim chance of finding someone that loves me when everything will end in eternal darkness and pain. Why shouldnâ€™t I just skip living when it only hurts me. And is slitting my wrists really that painful when I already cut myself to feel better?
