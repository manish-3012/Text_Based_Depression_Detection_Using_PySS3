Is this real?First off, I'm not high or have done any illicit drugs. I'm 27F and majorly depressed, with PTSD, BPD, ADHD, GAD. Lots of letters, great. Currently on Wellbutrin XL 150mg and Adderall XR 25mg. I don't have any CYP2D6 enzyme activity. Now you know my life.

My chest has hurt all day, and I feel like something awful is going to happen. I was worried about a panic attack, so I took some (1mg) Lorazepam that has since worn off. It didn't help much.

I feel dissociated and like nothing is real, but that if I move too much to the sides I'm going to cause something awful to happen. I have to sit really still, inside (my skin) especially. Is this a delusion? I know it's not true, but I can't bring myself to move because "what if?". This includes looking at people and talking much. I need to minimize these things, or I'll cause something bad to happen. I don't know what the bad thing is, but I'll have caused it.

It's been similar to this all week. I can't live like this. It's too painful to feel in crisis every. Single. Day. It's exhausting. I've been chronically suicidal for most of my life (since grade 6), and I do honestly think that's the best plan. However, I don't want to do it out of panic like I'm feeling right now and failing. Currently, I'm torn between trying to avoid a doom that's not going to come by just doing it, or trying something harmful to see if I'm even real. I'm midway between crazy and sane. I don't know what to do, if anything. I want to hide somewhere quiet for a few days, like the woods (NOT a hospital, that's not good).

Also, I see a psychiatrist and therapist once per week, and I have no interest in going to the hospital because I don't want to lose 3 days min and/or have to deal with the hospital. I'm in Canada, but still. I have stuff to do (stuff I'm failing to do) but I can't just junk them.
