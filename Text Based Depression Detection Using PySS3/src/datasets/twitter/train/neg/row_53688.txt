I want to...[SH trigger warning]I want to cut my wrists and I don't know whether it's because I want to die or because I want to feel alive.

I'm in the mixed state of my life right now.

I want to cut so badly now, even though I know I will regret it.

I just want to explode in a million directions. I want to die.
I want to get off this fucking roller-coaster.

I have the razor blades in my drawer. I'm thinking of doing it.
