I Just Want to be Happy Again.My mom and dad aren't happy. My dad is an old, fat fuck who doesn't do anything other than work. He comes home and sits on the couch and watches Pawnstars. My mom is sad, regrets marrying him, yet won't do anything due to his age and me and my sister.

I'm not happy. Seeing my parents like this is depressing. Going to a high-school is fake, I am believed to be the more popular/happier guy at the school yet it's the exact opposite. Health is shit. Grades are shittier. I'm on Spring Break, and seeing all my "friends" doing cool stuff while I am just sitting in my bed is far from uplifting.

There is this girl, named Kim. We talk and text and are close, and i'd love to start a relationship with her. But, I feel that if I don't feel good about myself, then how can I love her. She is amazing, and makes me feel amazing too. 

I can't tell anyone all this shit. Parents, no. Kim, no. Friends, no. I just feel like it'd be better if things just ended. I have a weird fantasy about dying, and seeing how everyone would react, like that Christmas movie in a way I guess.
