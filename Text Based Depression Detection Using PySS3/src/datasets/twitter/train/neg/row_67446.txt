Please help, what is the best way to kill yourself?

My name is Jordan I am 16 years of age and I have pretty much ruined any chance I have at being happy. I have built this reputation of just being sad and lonely, so making any move in order to turn my ways around just seems off and never works. I have no friends, the people I do see normally just make fun of me. Never had a girlfriend or people I can trust. My dad was born with 2 kidneys that didn't function correctly. So his entire life has has gone through 3 different kidney transplants. So I know he wont be around much longer, my great grandpa just passed away and he meant the world to me. The sadness is just overwhelming and I am desperate for awnsers. 

Please bare in mind I am 16 years old and I live in Canada, so it's not like I can just really quickly pick up a gun and off myself. Things like sleeping pills are hard to get ahold of. 

By best im hoping to find the least painful way with the higest sucess rate. 
If it is hard to get ahold of but does the job than please still recommend it, with just ideas to get ahold of it. I thank you for listening. :)
