Despite being on Sertraline (Zoloft) for 6 months, I still can't help but think it will be better if I go18, M. School is going well, I'm studying medicine and my grades are fine. I don't really have any close friends, but there are always people I can hang out with, I just don't like them enough. 

I think my biggest concern is that I'm too reliant on my mother. She pays for my education and pretty much everything else. I don't like her at all, she's a religious fanatic and has wildly racist/homophobic/bigoted views of most things. My sister (21) is even worse. I don't have a dad (left when I was 6). 

I don't really know what to do, because I can't stop thinking that if something goes wrong with my education, I'm going to be unqualified and unemployable. Those thoughts make me even more depressed and I have started to slip. 

I know my problems are not severe compared to others' by any means, and i know I shouldn't be complaining, but I can't stop this depression from taking over. 

My GP prescribed me with Sertraline, i've been taking it for about 6 months and it helped at first, but now it's as if I never started taking it at all.

Any advice?
