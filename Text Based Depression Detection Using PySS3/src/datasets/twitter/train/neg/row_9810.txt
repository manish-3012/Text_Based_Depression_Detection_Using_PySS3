AdviceI know this isn't what this sub is about but I really can't find a better place. 
Is there any subreddit dedicated to "tips and tricks" or "death hacks"?  I'm not joking.
In case I really commit to this (and I hope I do) there are a couple of things I want to happen:
I don't want anyone to find my body for at least 6 months, I don't really want it to be painful, I don't want to risk surviving and having permanent damage (like a bullet in the brain just making me blind or something) and I want it to be fairly quick, so I can't stop myself. 
I'd be glad if someone could help me, this isn't about prevention.
