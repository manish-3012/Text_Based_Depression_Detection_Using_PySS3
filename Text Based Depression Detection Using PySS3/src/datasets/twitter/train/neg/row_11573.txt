I'm Done. Yeah, I'm getting tired of life and everything in it. I despise my life, people, how this world operates, and so forth. No matter what I do or try, things become even more progressively worse. 

This life has nothing to offer to me and vice versa. I have constant self doubts, negative circumstantial incidences occurring to me, and the inhabitants on this planet just put me in an even more depressive state. I may be very young, but I know what I am talking about. There is no real opportunity in this world for most of us. This is the same reason why every generation gets played and is forced to meddle for themselves. Not only do I blame my own incidences and sheer dumb luck, but I also blame governments, politicians, corrupt entrepreneurs, educational systems, and others for this evil rapid transformation on the standard of living.

I'm too moronic and hateful to function in this cold and evil world. People can say "It gets better" but it really doesn't. At least for some of us that is. I'm glad that I am going to annihilate myself from this corrupt monstrosity. I don't care what anyone thinks of this, or care for whoever gets hurt in the matter. Hopefully someone reads this post when my death is investigated so they can find out the horrible truth of this life just as I have. Goodbye.
