I'm at my lowest again but this time I have no idea whyI'm in therapy since march last year. Everything went so well and I made such huge improvements. I started university, had good grades and was finally able to figure things out with my boyfriend. I really don't know what happend but two weeks ago I visited my best friend who lives on the other side of the country (I choose a safe way to travel, don't worry) and I feel dead inside since I'm back.  I don't feel anything but a weird grieve and the only thing I want to do is running off to somewhere far far away from everyone. I have problems getting out of bed and I get extremly upset when I see people I'm close to. Also, I don't feel hungry. I just want to leave everything behind and go. And I have no idea why I feel this way.
