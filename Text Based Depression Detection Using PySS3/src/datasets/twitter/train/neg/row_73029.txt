Vent?New to this sub. Also never posted on reddit before, so hey. here's my situation, everyone.

I'm an 18 year old girl. I failed my first semester of community college, I still live with my mom and stepdad, I'm too depressed and unmotivated to go to my fast food job half the time so I don't have enough money to pay for all the things my mom demands I pay for, I can't live with my dad because he has terrible anger issues and I'd probably become even more suicidal and depressed, all my high school friends treated me like shit but I guess I'm making some new friends, I'm still in love with my ex who broke up with me months ago and then hooked up with me (took my virginity) and went right back to his other ex, I currently have a speeding ticket and 800 dollar fine to pay off in 3 days and the court is 90 miles away (I got it while on my way to hook up with my ex, he lives far away cus of uni) and I can't pay it off or even call them because my mom took my phone, I have serious issues with abandonment and rejection, I don't feel loved by anyone, and I feel like I have no future at all. What's the point? I had bad grades in high school, I just gave up on college, and I have no goals because I have little faith in myself. The only thing looking up for me is the fact that I've found a few good friends but I don't even know how long that will last. I've always told myself I'm going to wait until I'm 23 (5 years from now) to see if my life is worth living, and I'm gonna stick with that, but I really can't see anything other than more and more suffering for the next 5 years.

Any advice, if there's even any to give? Sorry if this is poorly worded or weirdly phrased, I have kind of a scattered mind. I guess this is just me venting, sorry if it sounds dramatic or whatever. I'm just sick of feeling constant loneliness and I have no one to talk to about any of this so I guess I'll just post it for a bunch of strangers
