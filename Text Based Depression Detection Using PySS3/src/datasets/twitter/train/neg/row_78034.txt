Shouting into the voidI have a friend that I've talked to about all this but I can't talk to her anymore. I don't know what's stopping me, but I can't. Now all I do is shout into the void that is this site and quickly delete what I post. My emotions are no longer intelligible and cannot be put in words anymore and I need them all to stop. I want to die so that they stop. So that everything stops.
