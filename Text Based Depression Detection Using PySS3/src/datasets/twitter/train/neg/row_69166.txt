If I mention to a therapist that I've thought of killing my dad?I get really guilty when I don't tell things to certain people. I feel the need to fess up to my friends supporting me if I make a suicide rehearsal, etc. So important people my life know I'm suicidal and I update them fairly regularly. Kind of out of guilt thay I'm doing bad things and thinking bad thoughts and I need to confess. Probably a manifestation of Catholic Guilt tbh but I digress...
And over Thanksgiving break from college I had to see my dad, who cheated, divorced my mom and remarried. And he was being really rude to my little sister and my mom and I started fantasizing about the car I was stuck in with him crashing and killing us both. I've thought once or twice before that if I was going to kill myself, it'd do the world some good if I took him out with me. He truly is awful.
When I started with this therapist a few months ago I was asked if I had suicidal thoughts or homicidal thoughts. I said yes, suicidal, and no, not homicidal. Now I don't know if that's accurate. And it scares me. I don't want to be seen as dangerous and crazy. I think(/hope) it's pretty normal to think violently when extremely provoked. I'm worried that my therapist will subconsciously judge me if I classify myself as having homicidal impulses, even if it is super rare, and it will change our blossoming and helpful relationship. If I admit to homicidal thoughts, is he required to do anything? Tell anyone? Do I go on some watch list? I have no real desire to do hurt him, nor means or even a plan. Advice if this is something I can keep to myself?
