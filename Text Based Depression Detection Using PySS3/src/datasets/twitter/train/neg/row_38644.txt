Urge to dieHello, this is my 1st post in this channel. And my english is not good
I always have an urge to suicide, even when i feel i am happy( like done well on a test)
The thought is not always in my mind, but it randomly appears, when i'm hanging with friend, when eating, when doing homework. When it happens, my mood drops down quickly for minutes, but then it recovers
I'm really tired of this, i'm scare one day it pushs me to the end.
