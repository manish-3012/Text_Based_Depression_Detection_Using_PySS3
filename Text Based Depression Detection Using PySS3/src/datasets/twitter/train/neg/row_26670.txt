I don't think I can take it anymore.It's been almost a month since my ex decided she didn't want to talk to me at all (we had been broken up but still friends). I thought I would be ok not talking to her but now I'm starting to realize that we really may not be getting back together. I  cant imagine life without her. I'm surprised I even made it this far. I just get more depressed as the days go by. I sit at home and play video games all night, sleep all day, and repeat. None of the places I've applied to will hire me. I've gotten to the point where I can't focus on class, the professor can be talking and I may be writing but I'm not comprehending any of it. And to think that the whole reason our relationship is ruined is my fault to begin with just makes it easier to do what I'm thinking of doing. Of all the ex's I've had I choice to make the worst mistake of all with the one girl that I truly loved and wanted to spend the rest of our long lives together. What type of person does that make me? She was my reason for waking up in the morning and now I can't even talk to her and it's my fault! I'm just ready for the pain to stop.
