I'm just losing it and death seems pretty good right now.Depression, anxiety and insomnia are eating me alive. It's like these disorders are people, especially depression and anxiety, and are stabbing me in the chest. Literally with no care to how I am with this, they just stab, carefree. Sounds stupid, I know, but let me try to explain. Every damn time I am embarrassed. Angry. Even happy, for fucks sake. I feel sad and anxious. I feel anxious about being angry, like I might act out or something stupid like that, even though I know I won't. I'm not a violent person. But I'm fearful of my anger. When I'm embarrassed. I feel stupid and sad because of that. I feel that everyone instantly hates me, because I screwed up. When I feel happy. I don't deserve it. I want it, but we don't always get what we want, do we? And even when I do get it, my depression takes me back down again. Every time? It's a gab. A stab, directly where those emotions bubble at the tip of my abdomen. Where I feel the pain and hopelessness most. And it's the worst thing ever. A lot of people like to sleep out of these feelings. I can't. I'm forced to stay up all night crying and thinking too much. And it's a stab each time. Because it's more time to think and be depressed. And then I set myself up for future anxiety and depression, by thinking how the future is going to suck. And how the past sucked. Add in traumatic flashbacks.. you'll see what it's like to be me. With my heart or some shit stabbing me every chance it gets and then making me think back to worse times, and then stabbing me more during. And it's the worst thing ever, because I can't even fucking explain it right. Im sorry.
Im sorry.
Im sorry...

I can't anymore.
