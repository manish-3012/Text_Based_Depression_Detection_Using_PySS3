I really wish I did kill myself.About 7 years ago I got the whole hospital intervention shit because I was suicidal. I decided to live because i really thought if i improve things about myself, my life would improve as well. Putting drugs and self-harm behind me has yet to help me in any way, in fact I'd say im boring now if anything. At least I was interesting as a fuckup, and could say i was having fun, albeit in a terribly unhealthy way. People really told me life would be better if i shaped up, i feel like ive lost a large part of my identity and really just dont know how to be happy anymore. Im so fucking empty. Now im just your average community college loser with no real world experience, and a laughable job. I have no interests that dont include dying. I swear if i could know that my life would be so monotonous and devoid of improvement i would have killed myself right then and there at 16. Thanks to both my stupidity and the wonderful background checks, i have to die in a painful way because i cant just buy a gun to blow my brains out. Im a fucking coward. Too pussy to just open my veins. I used to cut a lot, really deeply too. Now im just tired of hurting. I only hurt myself in angrr now when i would otherwise hurt somebody else, and im incurring real injuries to my head and wrists due to high impact. I really wish i didnt wake up this morning or would just have a heart attack and keel over. Every night i wish i dont wake up, every single one.
