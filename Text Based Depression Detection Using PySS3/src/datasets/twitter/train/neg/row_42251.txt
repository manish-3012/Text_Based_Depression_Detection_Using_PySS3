The only think preventing me from killing myself is my mother being alive.A bit hyperbolic but I honestly believe that if my mother wasn't alive I would have no issues with killing myself.

I do think some people would be sad but I feel it wouldn't bee too big of a deal. I sound heartless I know.

My mother would be absolutely destroyed mentally if I killed myself. That thought sickens me that much that I will never off myself as long as she is alive.

I in no way want her to die but I know she will eventually.

I have no real hopes and dreams. 

This world wouldn't even notice me gone. Hell it probably would be a little better.

But hey, that's just reality. And reality sucks!!!

Uhh why I do I have to feel this way :(
