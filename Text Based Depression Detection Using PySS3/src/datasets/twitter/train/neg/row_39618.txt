i'm addicted to marijuana and i wanna die without iti have major depression, ADD &amp; borderline personality disorder. ive tried many different antidepressants but they never work like they should, or they work for a while and then stop. weed is the only thing that consistently helps me. it feels pathetic but even one day sober and im sobbing and yearning for death. i cannot handle my emotions. im currently unemployed and i ran out of weed a few days ago with no money to get more. without it i take to binge drinking &amp; cutting myself. i dont want to be stuck in this cycle. its the only thing that helps me focus or allows me to possess even a modicum of a desire to continue living. if this is how my life has to be then i just want to fucking die already
