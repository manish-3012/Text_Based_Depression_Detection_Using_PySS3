Why haven't I done it yet?Suicide is something that I have thought of everyday since 2012. I had a gun, my note written and when I was ready to go someone came home in the middle of the day and I didn't go though with it. And now not a day goes by that I don't think about suicide and how I should just have done it then. My life hasn't got any better, I've tried counseling, meds, talking to people and I always get "just be happy" as a response. My parents, specifically my dad just thinks I can't let go of my past (an awful relationship that affects me to this day) and move on and be happy. I'm anti social, and I just don't know why I'm even here. Nothing in life is motivating to me and I keep slipping deeper and deeper to a point where I don't think I can come back from it. Idk I'm just too scared to actually go though with suicide for fear i won't die and then I'll just look dumb. If I knew 100% I would die if i shot myself I would have been gone years ago. But like I said I always chicken out, and it leaves me thinking of suicide 24/7 literally, not a moment goes by that I don't think of wanting to kill myself. And it sucks I just want a way out, life is not for me
