Keep Saving Lives.To the people who spend time reading posts and replying YOU are saving lives. There's nothing minimal about that.


To the people who come here for help, at this time, I only ask you to save your own life and accept the help that comes your way.


To the people who come here but decide not to post - please give it a try, even if it's to get things off your chest, you're in a safe place here.
