It comes and goes as it pleases.40 minutes ago I was trying to overcome my anxiety and go down to the gym. 

10 minutes ago I am in the apartment looking down and trying to pull myself over the fence;  surely I wouldn't be able to survive falling 20+ floors. 

Right now I am just sitting here, looking down. Wondering what is the point of everything. Am I calm?  I don't even know. Why am I doing this. I don't fucking know. 

But no matter how many times I look down from. the balcony and try to reach down, I always end up back in my room. 

Time to suck it up and work on that assignment I have been putting off. 

Doubtful that the teacher will accept 'I was feeling suicidal' as an excuse for passing up homework late. 

...Overwhelmed, would be a good word to describe me I think.
