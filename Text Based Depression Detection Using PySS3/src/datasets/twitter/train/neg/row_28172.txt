how is it possible to be happy when there's so much evil in the worldI wanted to type some long detailed post about my feelings but I just don't have the energy

one of my friends died in a mass shooting

another survived

at one point in my life i was in love with both of them, just not at the same time

the one who died was the best person i've ever known in my life and i miss her every day

she made me wanna be someone better than who i was because of how great she was and how well she treated me

i listened to the other one cry about how she missed all her friends, how she had been to 7 funerals in a week

she may as well have died that day, she will never be the same

my life got so dim after that day. two of the people i spent my most formative years with, two people i let inside my world gone for no reason

my mom tells me that i have to get a job and get back out there, get back on my feet

i don't think she understands that's never going to happen and i'm just waiting for the right day

i'm sorry mom
