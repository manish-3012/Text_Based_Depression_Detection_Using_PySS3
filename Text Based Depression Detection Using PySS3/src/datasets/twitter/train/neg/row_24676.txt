Friend in needI need help. I was on Reddit recently, just browsing. When I decided to search up my very close friends Reddit account, since he knows my accounts name and has seen all my posts I decided why not, if he's seen mine why shouldn't I see his. So I found a post from a few days ago that my friend had made saying he had tried to kill himself a few days prior to making the post and that he had spent a few days in the hospital recovering. Now my friend (we'll call him Joe) has had it tough in the last year or two. His parents split, he had to move far away from us and a girl he adored broke his heart. Since he lives far away, I only get to meet up with Joe very rarely. School and money have a habit of getting in the way, but we do talk a lot on Skype and text very frequently. Joe has told me he has felt depressed in the past and that he is now on anti-depressant medication, but I was completely unaware of his suicidal thoughts. Anytime Joe has come to me and told me he has been feeling down I have tried my up most to help him, letting him know that he is not alone and I am always there for him. As I myself have dealt with suicide a few years ago. Joe and a very close friend of ours, who also knows the whole story,  are going to talk to him on Skype later this evening about this and just to offer him our help, I don't know if thats the best thing to do so I would find it so helpful if anybody here could point me in the right direction to help Joe because honestly I am shaking right now writing this an dI have absolutely no idea what to do. I really appreciate any help that you guys can give and if I'm posting this in the wrong place could you direct me to the right sub reddit, thanks.
PS. This is a throaway account.
