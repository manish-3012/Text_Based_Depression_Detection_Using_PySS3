Can't do itI made this throwaway the other day to get a small thing (of sorts) off y chest as I'm using it more than I thought I would. I'm currently sitting in my bed, under the covers, hysterically crying, having a nervous breakdown. I'm trying so hard to distract myself from my blade and it's getting harder. So here I am reddit, once again, crying for help, and I probably won't be heard. At least I'll be able to say that I tried. 

Edit: really sorry, my typing is horrible. I'm still trying to calm down.
