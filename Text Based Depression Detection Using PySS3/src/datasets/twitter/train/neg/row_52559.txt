Would I be at peace?Look I'm not really looking for people to tell me no don't do it and I'm not even saying it will happen.

But I can assure you that I deserve to have a new life or just be gone and at peace. 

So my question is, will I be at rest and peaceful if I hypothetically we're to kill myself?
