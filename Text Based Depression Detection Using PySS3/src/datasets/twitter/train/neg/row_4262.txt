I think I just tried to kill myselfIâ€™ve been in a dark spot for a while and tonight was a very tough one. Ive been drinking to try to numb the pain of everything. I told a friend about what I wanted to do and I eventually got the courage to do it. I put a belt in my door frame, put it around my neck, and tried to hang myself. I guess I blacked out but the belt pulled out from the door frame. I woke up laying in the corner not yet realizing what happened. I eventually came to the conclusion that my attempt failed, further supported by the slight damage to my door from the belt pulling out.

I guess I can finally say Iâ€™m not a pussy and actually attempted.
