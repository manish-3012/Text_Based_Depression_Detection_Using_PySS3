I'm tired of tryingI just dont have the energy anymore. I'm cutting everyday and just cry. I'm sick of this endless cycle. I want it to end so fucking bad. I'm almost 14 and transgender. I know I will never achieve what I want and that i will never be a real boy. Everyday I'm reminded that I'm a worthless sack of shit thats illegal in 15 countries and people will never know the feeling of waking up amd being instantly heartbroken and sad because you will never be what you want. I'm so sick of trying to be happy when I know I will never be. im tired of fighting. I just want to give up. I just want to be happy for once.
