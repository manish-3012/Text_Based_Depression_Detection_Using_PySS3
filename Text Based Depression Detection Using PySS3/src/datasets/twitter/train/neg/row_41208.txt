I can't do anything about my depression.I've been remotely depressed for a year now but never like this. I just feel like everything is a big joke. I've noticed that the more I grow up, the more I see things around me. And I'm only 16 turning 17 in a few months. I've started to feel depressed last year because of my neglecting father. He ran away 3 times and came back every time due to money and not having a home. The fourth time occurred this summer, he came back and promised to change and my mom told me to make the decision and I agreed. But, what do you know... He runs away because he hates picking me up and dropping me off for sports practices. So he tried to come back (maybe 2 months ago) but I said "fuck off" and hasn't seen him since. I've always hated him since I was young. He threw one of my toys at my mom's eyes and ran away to America and that was at the age of 5. 


Now that I'm growing up, I am exposed to a lot of problems. Last year, me and my mother went to finalize our last step to get a green card. But, because my aunt is from my father's side, since my father isn't technically allowed in America, we couldn't get the green card. This makes our life financially harder and we don't have a lot of money. Now, this makes my chance to get into colleges harder because I am an international student. And recently, I've been thinking it about it a lot and the more I thought about it; it led to thinking about a lot of other things in society. And I think society is ridiculous.
