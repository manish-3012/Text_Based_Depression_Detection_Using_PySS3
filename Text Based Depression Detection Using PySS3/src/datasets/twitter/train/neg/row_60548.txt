â€œYou have so much to live for, so many people who careâ€And thatâ€™s the problem. Are you really guilting me for wanting to end my pain because itâ€™s going to hurt others? Is that nagging voice in my head that says â€œif you end it you will finally stop feeling so god damn sickâ€ an inconvenience to your plans for me? Iâ€™m so angry and my chest aches for relief but Iâ€™m trapped. Trapped in my boyfriendâ€™s love of me. Trapped in my familyâ€™s expectations. Trapped in a country that cares more about money and power than people. How much longer until I run from it all, leaving a hurricane of destruction behind me. I find it hard to believe Iâ€™m going to make it to the end of this year before being found with a bullet in my head or strung up by my neck.
