Not a bad ideaSo around 2 years ago, my oldest brother tried to overdose due to having untreated depression for 1-2 years, (as well as ADHD which mightâ€™ve partially caused the depression, idk donâ€™t quote me on that I donâ€™t know things). Thankfully, he had second thoughts and called 911 and heâ€™s still here today. However I still think about that sometimes. I know I would be absolutely devastated if he succeeded, as I look up to him, however, he fell back into depression about 5 months ago, despite seeing a therapist and being on a medication for his depression, anxiety, and ADHD. And Iâ€™ve wondered if heâ€™s hoped his attempt was successful. Though I honestly donâ€™t blame him, despite being in a loving household, a nice house, and having plenty of food, he was still depressed. And I feel the exact same way, but the only difference is no one in my life knows about my depression. 

I think about his suicide attempt almost every day. Because maybe it wasnâ€™t such a bad idea. Just when he thought he was getting better, he started having panic and anxiety attacks again, as well as feeling real depressed. So honestly, whatâ€™s the point? I feel like shit now, but if I go get help, Iâ€™ll probably just go back to feeling like shit, except x5. Iâ€™m stuck in a weird limbo. I donâ€™t have a reason to live, I donâ€™t have a reason to kill myself. Iâ€™m think about writing a suicide note, Iâ€™m too much of a pussy to kill myself. I want to stay in bed and sleep until I never wake up, I want to go to school and actually get an education. I want to be a normal person, I get an freeze up the moment a teacher calls on me. I want my friends to find out about my depression so I can at least talk to them about it, I push them away then get a panic attack when they start to even slightly figure it out. I fucking hate this. I wish I could just be one or the other and stop being so damn indecisive. I either kill myself or I donâ€™t.  Thereâ€™s no fucking in between.
