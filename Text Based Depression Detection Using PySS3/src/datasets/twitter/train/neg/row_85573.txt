I'm confused.I am really struggling right now. Irdk how to do anything, what path I should take, whether I should live or die even.

I've become so empty and so unknowing in my own self idk what's good or bad.

I mean I should realistically be okay. I have great friends, there's a girl I'm deeply crushing on who's just human perfection and I'm not even sure she sees it, and then there's my child so realistically I should be okay and yet I just can't be.

I just don't know. I'm not depressed, I'm not happy. I'm not suicidal, I'm not wanting to be alive. In not anxious, but I'm not confident.

It's strange, I've went beyond depression and become indifferent to everything. Emotionless. And this is dangerous I know it, yet I'm to indifferent to care.

It's weird, and yet I love it and hate it at the same time.

It's hard to explain. I'm just. Empty.
