Getting BetterSo, for the past week I've been carrying a suicide note around with me everywhere I went.  I was just incredibly depressed, I was really ready to kill myself.
Today, I was roped into going to a stupid church dance, I didn't want to go, but decided to anyway.  I was mostly just hanging off to one side, not dancing or doing anything.  One of my best friends, who's a girl, was there and we ended up talking for about an hour.  We talked just about everything, we talked about boys and girls and all that stupid teenager stuff (excluding my suicide).  I really needed to talk like that, I found out that my friends really do like having me around and that they truly appreciate me.  I also found out that the girl I'm interested in isn't interested in me whatsoever, but I'm feeling hopeful right now, this gives me a chance to find someone who will really like me.  My suicide note is in the trash.
I have to thank you guys too, I've posted on here a few times, and I've really appreciated everything you've done.
Sorry about the horrible quality, I just have a lot to get out.
