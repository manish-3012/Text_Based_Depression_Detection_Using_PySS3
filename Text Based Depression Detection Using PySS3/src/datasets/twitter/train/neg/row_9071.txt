How do real people enjoy things?I watch the shows, play the games, go on walks, talk to friends. And I always feel empty and dead. My soul is evil and I need to rip it out and free it from this shell. This man's body I'm trapped in. I want someone to come into my room and beat me to death. Make me suffer and bleed until I whimper my last pathetic, disgusting breath. A death rattle for the stupid, lazy cunt that ruined every opportunity she ever had.

I hate me
I HATE ME
JUST FUCKING DIE
I JUST WANT SOMEONE TO FUCKING KILL ME
