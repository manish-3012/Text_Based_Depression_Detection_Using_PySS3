My vegetationSo after 14 years of battling my depression (I'm 30 now) it seems that life has finally slipped out from my hands. Some bad things happened during these years, my both parents died and i handled that really poorly to be honest. I never had any ocassion to be involved in relationship with a woman or having intimacy, rejections made me embittered, however i understand that because of ugliness, poor health and very low socioeconomic status - it simply isn't the part of life for me.

I really want to somehow make peace with the case that I'm unlovable but my brain and hormones doesn't want to let it go and I'm unable to find peace.

The second major contributor to the feeling of worthlessness is my living on disability benefits, I live in a small town which is located in one of the poorest regions of my country (Poland) and I'm unable to find a proper job despite having masters degree in accounting. Now I have 2 year gap in my CV, my qualifications are rusty.

Concluding all of that I'm really struggling right now to find any reason to continue this life. I also have no siblings, my loneliness is at ultimate level now.

My medications somehow keep me numbed, so I'm able to vegetate, but what's the point of that ?

It is pretty obvious that my already poor health will deteriorate even more with time passing and loneliness will feed me with more and more bitterness.

Across the last 14 years life has given me many clues that I'm not welcomed in this world, but i fought anyway because of ambition to achieve something. Now I see that nothing was achieved by me. My fangs are blunted, my claws are cutted off.

When my mother died last year, i secured a second spot in her grave for me. I do also have some savings to left for the person who would handle funeral so no one burdened and I would be even.

Life is not designed for the disabled people, that is the harsh true.
