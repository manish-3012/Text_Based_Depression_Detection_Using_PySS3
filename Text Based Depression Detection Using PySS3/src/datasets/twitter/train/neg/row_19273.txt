I'm starting to care less and less and I'm really scaredI know I could never actually take my own life. I fear death too much. But I'm starting to just stop being careful. Like crossing street, I literally will say under my breath "someone please just hit me". I wouldn't like jump in front of a car, because then that person would have to live with guilt. But sometimes I just feel like if some freak accident were to happen to me, it would be for the best for everyone in my life. I know I'm annoying to deal with and that very few people actually care about me.
