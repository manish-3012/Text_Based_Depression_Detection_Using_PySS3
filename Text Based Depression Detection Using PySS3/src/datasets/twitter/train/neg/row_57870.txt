Took my remainder of citalopram. I'm sorry.I've been on cymbalta for a while now but still had a small supply of citalopram.

Things aren't going to get better. They were supposed to and I did everything to make my life better but I don't feel better.

I'd rather sleep forever.

My last thirty pills or so I mashed up into water and tried swallowing that. It was the most disgusting thing I've ever tasted and I dry heaved / threw up a bit. 

I'm sorry for everything and everyone I  leave behind. The world and I don't get along. When I'm with people I want to be alone and when I'm alone I want to be with other people. Borderline, germaphobia, avoidant personality disorder... Things that make life hell..

I'll sleep it off and see if I'm still around tomorrow.

Update: I tried to eat something just now and I felt sick. Been throwing up since then. I think it's out of my system. Thank you for your concern
