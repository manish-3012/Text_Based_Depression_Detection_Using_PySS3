I feel like iâ€™m already deadeverything feels like a chore. waking up. getting dressed. walking. eating. staying awake. talking. moving. everything is forced. iâ€™m not enjoying anything except sleeping. i get so relieved at night when the day is finally over and i can sleep. i feel terrible for my friends because as much as i want to have a conversation with them, i canâ€™t keep myself interested for more than 2 minutes. i could barely even pretend to be. iâ€™m so tired of having to do everything. i wanna sleep forever. i just want to rest. iâ€™m tired. i feel like i was a mistake. my brother is like this perfect golden child. he doesnâ€™t argue with my parents. he keeps good grades. has a job. healthy relationship. no medication. no illnesses. super smart. Then thereâ€™s me. always arguing with my parents. mostly father. grades arenâ€™t like his. cant get a job.  canâ€™t commit to anyone. depression. anxiety. relapsing. i canâ€™t study because depression. i canâ€™t focus. i feel like a huge disappointment to my parents. i failed to be the daughter they wanted. i didnâ€™t live up to their expectations. they would probably be less stressed if i was never born. ive been thinking of giving up for the past couple days but iâ€™m afraid whatever i try wonâ€™t work, and i donâ€™t want to feel guilty if it doesnâ€™t. i feel like a dead man walking at this point.
