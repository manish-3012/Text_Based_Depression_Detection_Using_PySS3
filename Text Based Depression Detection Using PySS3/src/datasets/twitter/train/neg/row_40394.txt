Just having a hard time this evening. Don't know where to turnI'm not as bad as I have been in the past.  I'm not going to hurt myself tonight.  I just don't know how to ask for help when I hate myself as much as I do right now.

A couple of years ago, I was at the point where I had intrusive thoughts/fantasies of driving myself into a tree and I was crying uncontrollably every time I was alone.  I am not as bad as that today, but it feels like it's headed that way.

Tonight, I am alone and I have had a couple of drinks.  

It's been hard the past few weeks to keep the demons at bay.  

Feelings of self-loathing.  Panic.  Desperation.  Sadness.  Worthless.  Loneliness.  Anger at myself for not being ok with being alone. I'm a fucking introvert for god's sake - I LOVE being alone.  But not right now.

I'm just having a hard night and I could use some nice words.
