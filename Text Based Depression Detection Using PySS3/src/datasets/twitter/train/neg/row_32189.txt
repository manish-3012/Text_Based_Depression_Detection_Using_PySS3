Please, Help Me.Hi SW.

So, I've been depressed for a little over seven years now, but it has gotten really bad since two years ago.

I don't have any friends, so I keep all my suicidal and depressed feelings bottled up inside me. I play hundreds of suicide scenarios in my head daily, although I'm too much of a coward to act on them (though I probably will very soon). I feel pathetic and worthless. I just wish to sleep one day and never wake up again.

I'm tired of crying myself to sleep every night. I really need someone to talk to and hopefully, maybe feel a bit better. Please help me.
