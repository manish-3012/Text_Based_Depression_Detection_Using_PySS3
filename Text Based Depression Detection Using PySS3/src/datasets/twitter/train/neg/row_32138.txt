Iâ€™ve been a burden my whole life.Iâ€™ve been a burden my whole damn life! Title says it all! 

I was supposed to be so much more then this! 17 fucking years old for what?! Iâ€™m a disappointment, Iâ€™ve only burdened my parents. They hate me anyways. Iâ€™ve stayed on this damn earth for my siblings but fuck theyâ€™d be better off without a person like me!

Iâ€™m everything wrong with the world! My existence screws up everyoneâ€™s lives Iâ€™ve ever come in contact with! I canâ€™t even fucking kill my self. I hold the blade but canâ€™t fucking do it for what! I should be able to! 

Itâ€™d be better off for everyone if I did it. 

I try so hard to be only good and radiate happiness but my past is still there. Iâ€™m still just a burden. I can be as kind as I want but theyâ€™ll always see me the way I am. 
Nothing.
