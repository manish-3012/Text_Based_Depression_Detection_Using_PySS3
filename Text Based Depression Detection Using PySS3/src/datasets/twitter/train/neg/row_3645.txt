What would you do in this situation?My family is abusive. They yell and fight constantly. I don't have anywhere else to go. Due to a series of unfortunate circumstances, I'm unemployed - so signing a lease elsewhere is impossible. I've already driven to stay with different relatives (who are also fighting), and having to stay at hotels during the Covid situation is difficult. I was rejected at 2 hotels because I'm not an "essential worker" (being abused and homeless isn't enough to warrant support, even though I'm capable of paying the full amount at an empty hotel). 

If any of you are suffering, I'm sorry you have to endure the various emotional and physical hardships of life. Your own worth exceeds the personal narrative of your human story. In a cosmological sense, this isn't our definitive nature of being (thank God). Frida Kahlo's last words were: â€œI hope the exit is joyful and hope never to come back." 

Sorry for the pity story. Any input is appreciated. It seems using an AirBnB and looking for new employment is the best solution. Thoughts? 

Thank you
