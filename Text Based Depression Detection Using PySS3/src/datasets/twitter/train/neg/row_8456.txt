Just had a horrible fight with the love of my life and just need some grounding.Hey, so I am 31 and my name is Chris and I have been suffering from migraines for days now and my girlfriend, who I love, yelled at me on call a bit ago because she got frustrated with her internet and it made the pain explode so I hung up. She went off in text and just really made me feel horrible and I am not thinking straight and everything is just bad right now. I am not usually suicidal but the pain is so fucking bad and my mind is spinning I just need some grounding. I don't think I am going to do anything but... I just wanted to be here so I can spit out my thoughts.
