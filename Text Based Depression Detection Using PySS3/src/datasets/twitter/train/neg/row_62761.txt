What's the point of going on?I have had suicidal ideation for 18 years now, but it has never been this bad. My mom died of liver cancer in January and I haven't been the same. I went on an opiate beinge after being clean for years. Went inpatient in April, but it didn't help long term.  My father abused me until I moved out at 19. He gave me my mom's car after she died because mine was repossessed. I am very irresponsible with money. I am so depressed i haven't cleaned my house in weeks, so i just go out to eat when I am hungry and it consumes a lot of my money. My dad called me and yelled at me because I haven't been able to make payments on the car. He is writing me out of the will,  which is fine. I'm just really upset because he told me I am worthless because I don't pay my bills. That isn't true. I legit forgot about my water bill and my water was shut off. My sister paid it and I am paying her back today. Ironically I work in mental health, I just don't see the point in living anymore. Almost everyone in my life puts me down because of money. I'm an atheist and my dad keeps yelling at me that I'm going to hell and I need to be a Christian. I know he is a piece of shit. He also told me black people don't want to work and I must want to be a black person. WTF? I do work, full time plus overtime every week. I just don't want to keep going through all this bullshit.  My mom was wonderful and always helped me when I fucked up.  So yeah, I've been enabled for years mostly because she felt guilty about the abuse. My siblings are depressed too, but I have a long history of mental illness.  Major depressive disorder, borderline personality disorder,  OCD, and PTSD. It just really sucks. I am taking my medicine but can't shake these suicidal thoughts.
