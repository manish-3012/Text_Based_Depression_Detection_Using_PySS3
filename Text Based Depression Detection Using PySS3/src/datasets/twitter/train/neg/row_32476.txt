Just wanted to write somethingHaving suicidal thoughts (waking up with them going to bed with them) like last thing you remember before sleep and first thing in the morning and just keeping on thinking "LetÂ´s think about something positive" but I donÂ´t like how they have increased in frequency and I called my doctor about that. I donÂ´t know why I think itÂ´s a courtesy for me to call someone and ask if they also want dinner. I think it will stop feeling that though cause to me it is stupid.
