i am dyingplease help me. I cant even explain myself. I am dying everyday my heart hurts I have panic attacks I dont how can I live. Last year I moved schools and my life has fallen apart. My whole family is depressed from moving so I avoid speaking to my parents about how I feel knowing it will only make them worse, because I have tried to talk to my dad and he cannot, he just cannot understand. My mom is struggling and I am scared for her, I tell her and she cries and it has gotten to the point that she ignores every sign i give her and everything I say even though she knows that it means I am dying. she ignores it and pretends I will be okay. she tells me i am so strong for dealing with this but i am dying. I think about killing myself but even death seems like a hopeless option. I cannot think of one option i am completely trapped. my chest hurts so much. i sometimes think i am going insane, i catch myself thinking things and doing things and i think i am going insane. if i dont kill myself something will kill me. somehow i will die. i cant believe my life has come to this, had i not moved my life could still be whole. but i dont know if that is true. i am so alone. im so alone. im so alone. i need not to be alone. i am constantly thinking about killing myself, but not how or if i will, more just thinking about the idea of killing myself, what would happen blah blah blah. i dont think i could do it. but there are so many things happening in my life right now that i never even imagined my life could get to, i could stoop to but i am. And that makes me think that even if i believe that i could not kill my self now, the pain will eventually drive me to do it, im speeding in one direction and there is no turning. im speeding towards death.
