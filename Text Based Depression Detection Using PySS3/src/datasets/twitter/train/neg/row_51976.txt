A friend who I'm no longer that close to has talked about being dead several times.We're friends online; I've known she for five years. We've grown apart largely because she's, honestly, a very difficult person to get along with. Minor disagreements (not liking a show she likes) become huge and last for an hour (her arguing as to why it's great). She has a general disdain for anyone she thinks doesn't jive with her moral code (which she sets alarmingly high, yet considering how much she judges other people, it doesn't make much sense). And so on. It's come to where I don't feel like I can have a real conversation with her because it'll just feel like debating.

In any event. She's talked several times now about how she wishes she were dead, and she wondered what it would be like to be dead, and how she won't commit suicide because of her family (who she complains about constantly) and her good friends (sometimes she claims I'm the only one). Because "she's not that selfish."

I've told her she needs help. She says she can't afford it. I don't have the strength to be her counselor all the time, particularly when honestly, my patience with her is already pretty thin. But she's my friend all the same. I know this is for suicide, but I don't really know if this fits in the other subreddits either. What can I do?

Thanks for your time.
