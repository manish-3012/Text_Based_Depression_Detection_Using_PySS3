I give up. Completely.I'm 30 years old. I'm old and washed up.

Lonely. No dates. Very few friends. Everyone moved far away. Plus no one ever visits me. I don't see anyone unless I see them.

Never been good at anything. People seem to patronize me and deem me as incompetent at nearly everything I do.

Never felt truly accepted in any social aspect of life. Sports, coworkers, clubs, etc. People don't gravitate towards me the same way they do to others.

Unless I text first I don't hear from most people.

Whenever I try to make plan things all I get are excuses.

I've tried several meetup groups and didn't have a good experience at any of them.

I was fired from my job because I sucked. It was my first junior software position and I blew it. I worked super hard to get there and I lost it so fast.

I think I'm extremely unintelligent. Takes me long to learn things. Also have a huge problem with self discipline and motivation. Never stick to anything.

People mock me and have rejected me because I'm not a "stereotypical" black person.

I am bad at tests. Got a low SAT score. Graduated college with a 2.0.

Everything I tried I was told some variation of how im "not cut out for this" or how "maybe ______ is not for you".

To make matters worse I also suffer from ADHD, Aspergers and Depression. Been mocked for those too.

I would like to have children but I don't think its gonna happen. Can't meet a woman to save my life.

Honestly if I had a gun I wouldn't be posting this shit. I would load up the chamber, put the barrel in my mouth and pull the fucking trigger.

I just wanna sleep forever and never wake up. Fuck this planet. I give up.
