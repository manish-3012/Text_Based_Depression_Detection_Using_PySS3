3rd post. I am going to kill myself.I don't know when or how. I just know that I am going to. I keep fucking things up and I can't see myself living to even the age of 30. I hate myself and everything I do. 

I cause people a lot of pain. If I go, I'd make people sad for only a little bit instead of a lifetime of sorrow. 

I don't think there's anything anyone can do to stop me...and I don't care anymore.

I'm just done.

Thank you guys for everything.
