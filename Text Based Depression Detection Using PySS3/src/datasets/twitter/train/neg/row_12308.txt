Iâ€™ll try to be quick with thisSo Iâ€™m very young, 8th grade, and I canâ€™t do this anymore. My grandma recently passed away and I watched her fall, I called 911, and I watched her heart stop. Iâ€™m failing all of my classes, and I want to apply to this really prestigious school, but my grades suck, and Iâ€™m in the depressive episode and I canâ€™t get out of this. Iâ€™m so sick of living and living and living over again. Itâ€™s tiring, itâ€™s exhausting.. this work is extremely stressful and the teachers donâ€™t give two fucks how our mental health is..
