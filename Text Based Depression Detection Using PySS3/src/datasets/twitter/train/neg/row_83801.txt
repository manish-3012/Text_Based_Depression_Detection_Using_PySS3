"It gets better."I fucking hate people that say this. First I become depressed as fuck, then I finally find someone that cares about me and loves me back, then his mom hates me and won't let me see him anymore. Come to find out she's forcing him to move out of state now and I'll never see him again. I'm losing all hope for my life right now, I have nobody left to hold me up and keep me here. I might as well just give up so he doesn't have to worry about me anymore. Nobody would have to, pure bliss. My parents are watching tv in the room next to me and they don't suspect a thing. Tonight may be the day, guys. It was nice while it lasted (not really)
