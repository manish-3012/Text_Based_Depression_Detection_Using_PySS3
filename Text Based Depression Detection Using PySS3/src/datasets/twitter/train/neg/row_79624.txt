I don't know what to do...I'm only 18, and I know I have my whole life ahead of me but at the same time it feels like I don't. I know that might not make sense, but that's just how I feel. I don't have any talents, only one friend, no hobbies interest me anymore, and I don't know what to do with my life. Everything is uninteresting and I'm terrified of ending up in a job I hate with a life that's unfulfilling. My anxiety just makes everything worse, and I've tried to get help so many times but every time has ended in failure. The first time I tried to get help for suicidal thoughts the doctor told me my reasons weren't a legitimate reason for depression. Maybe he was right... I don't know anymore. All I know is I'm too scared of the future and I just want to die.
Sorry if this is all disconnected and makes no sense. I'm just writing what's on my mind.
