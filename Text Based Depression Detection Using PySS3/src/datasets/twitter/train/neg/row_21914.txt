Fed up of the lying parentsJust had a massive row with my mother.  She refuses to take responsibility for her actions.  My father was mentally and physically abusive and he always claimed he was doing it for my own good. He would never admit his wrong. But my mother didn't even try to protect me.  Now he has dementia and she goes on about how he was evil and how she hates him for what he did to her children.  Ok she was a victim of his abuse as well.  But there was a time when I told her something that he had nothing to do with.  I was molested by a friend of the family from the age of 6 to 10 years old.  He even raped me.  When I was 13 I worked up the courage and told my mother.  Her response was shut the hell up.  You're telling me too late.  People will blame you.  That response triggered such intense shame that I have spent over 3 decades blaming myself, believing that I was a sluttish child who did something to attract his attentions.  I hate myself to the point where I can't bear being in my own skin.  I hate people loving or caring about me.  Two years my mother was actually commending the man who molested and raped me.  When I reminded her what he had done she sheepishly told me she'd forgotten.  How on earth do I forgive her?  I can't.  I don't care that she suffered abuse at my father's hands.  That doesn't exonerate her from the damage she's done to me.  At 11 when I started my period she slapped me across my face and said in disgust trust you to start so early.  At the time I had no idea what a period was and thought I was dying.  Today she is denying she did any of that.  I can't take this life and all this lying anymore.  I just can't forgive forget and move on.  I have so much hate and anger inside me.  I want to die to show them what they've done to me.
