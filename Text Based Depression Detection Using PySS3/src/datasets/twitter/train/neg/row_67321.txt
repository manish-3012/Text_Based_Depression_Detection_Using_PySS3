Only reason Iâ€™m still here are my 2 catsTheyâ€™re literally everything for me. I canâ€™t imagine not being with them. Theyâ€™re also one of like three things I care about at this point. The biggest consequence to suicide would be not getting to be with them. Honestly if I donâ€™t end up doing it now, then I will probably kill myself when they die.
