once you had thoughts of dying for years it ends up cementing and then theres no way backi wanted to die for over a decade now sometimes it's because of pain sometimes it's because life is just underwhelming, i am 27 years old i feel i've done everything there is to do whats left is things i can never experience, things i could experience if i was rich or famous but i have finished living now it's not getting any better it's like being forever stuck un purgatory life never moves even though it does but to me it doesn't, i feel like i am stuck in a neverending loop even though i 6 months ago moved to my first apartment one that i don't like at all it's not mine because i am renting it so it's nothing i want, i want a nice apartment that would be mine i can never have that, i lost my youtube channel which was part of my life and i never accepted that. i failed at multiple projects that were supposed to finally begin my life properly it was my hope

I have reached the end now theres nothing left soon i'll be 30 then 5 years pass 35 then 40, i just don't feel like enduring any more of this, i wanted to be rich and famous and i can never be that and i want to hurt myself every time i see someone else be it sometimes i attempt it weakly with a knife just because i see someone like that so to me theres no point even typing it makes me feel like doing it again, i wanted to die for so long but i have come to the conclusion that i am not capable of ending my life i have tried in very weak ways but i don't have it in me to actually do it, and sometimes death feels like a release to think about other times it terrifies me like when i saw some australian suicide help machine thats like a coffin that sucks out the air and kills you that to me is terrifying and not at all a comforting thing to think about, i don't know what i am am i suicidal i don't know all i know is i am done with life completely done there is nothing left that i will realistically be able to do, everything left is just part of a rich life not my life never will be part of my life and i do not accept that, the things that help me feel better are things just not part of a life like mine, i traveled and felt nothing from it it was just exhausting because i wanted more out of it, theres nothing left all i have is painful memories, constant loneliness, constant feelings of being a ghost and an outcast who fits in nowhere, constant selfhate to the point of not even wanting to try to improve my life any more i just want to wrap this life up because there really is nothing left to offer me, and it's killing me inside to be stuck in a life i don't want, i hate this world so much and i can't stay in it but i am forced to.
