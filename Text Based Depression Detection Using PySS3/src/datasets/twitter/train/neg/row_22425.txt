No one is taking me seriouslyI keep telling people that I'm suicidal, and they just aren't doing anything. I'm too depressed to help myself, and they aren't helping me.

This morning I told my husband I wanted to slit my wrists and he said "oh \[pet name\]," patted me on the head, kissed my forehead and said he was going to work.

I think it's because I have a serious repression game and most of the time I do a good job acting fine, but I am NOT FINE, which is why I keep telling people. I even once said, "I am not trying to be dramatic. I am seriously having suicidal thoughts," and still nothing.  I have reached out to a recommended therapist three times and not gotten a response. I'm debating going to a hospital, but what happens then? Are they going to do a 72 hr hold? I don't want that. I just want someone to fucking help me.  I know rationally that my life is not that bad and this is straight up depression taking over and I don't know how to make it stop on my own.
