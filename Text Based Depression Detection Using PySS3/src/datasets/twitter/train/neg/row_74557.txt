Feeling like people don't understand meLast post I made here some people made me feel uncomfortable saying if I'm trying to start a fight this isn't the place for me. I'm just trying to find understanding people to talk to. Last thing I want to do is fight with someone on here when I'm feeling suicidal and going through a hard time. I don't know what to say now. I'm very suicidal and I want people to understand me and not criticize me when I'm in a very vulnerable position. I feel like people are against me and treat me like the bad guy and that just makes my suicidal thoughts worse. I sometimes feel like the world is against me.
