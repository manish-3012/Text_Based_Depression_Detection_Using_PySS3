no one will grieve me when I die, not reallyif I were to die tomorrow nobody would actually grieve, the most they'd feel is guilt, guilt for the gossip they spread, guilt for not being better people, guilt for the rumors, the lies, guilt for not seeing the signs, it may even eat them up for a long while afterwards, but nobody will actually care that I died, it'll be all about them and their feelings, I have no one left who genuinely cares for me enough to actually go out of their way before the fact, oddly though, that isn't why I'd do it, I have no specific desire to make anyone suffer, it's just a fact, I'd do it because my life is complete and utter shit and no matter how hard I try I will never form a healthy connection with another human being as long as I live, if I had the energy to do put in the effort at all right now
