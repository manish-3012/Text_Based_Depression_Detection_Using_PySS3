Help with final wishes?Looking for a good way to commit suicide but looking for some specifics. I don't have a wife, children or family that rely upon me for financial support and no one will be hurt or even really notice if I was gone. I would prefer for it to be at least somewhat painless, in no way hurt someone else that may have people that need them and/or love them (no driving my car into oncoming traffic, etc...) and I want it to be 100% for sure.  That is probably the most important factor.  I have tried three times in my life and couldn't even get that right. If it can't be made to look accidental but matches the rest of the criteria, that would be acceptable. I unfortunately do not have access to or a way to purchase a gun or I would have already done so.  A felony conviction for an act of stupidity (official misconduct) approximately two decades ago prevents me from obtaining a gun and I don't know of anyone that can obtain one for me outside of normal/legal channels.  I wish I did.....  My conviction wasn't for anything horrible that hurt anyone else and I am not going to make the last thing I do in this world change that.  I am seriously asking. So, please no "suicide hotline" posts.  If you want to post something derogatory or mean feel free to do so. I am past the point of that kind of thing bothering me. Just want to find a somewhat painless to hopefully painless way to end without hurting anyone that is a sure thing. If someone has some truly serious idea(s) that would fit all of this criteria, it would be greatly appreciated. If you don't want to send your answer publicly but think you may be able to help in this matter I am sure we can figure out a way to do this privately and I would be willing to pay for assistance. I will definitely pay to have someone do this for me (to me). Thanks.
