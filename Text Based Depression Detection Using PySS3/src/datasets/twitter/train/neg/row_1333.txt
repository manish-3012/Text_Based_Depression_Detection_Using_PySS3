Right now, I feel like Iâ€™m on the brink of doing itI went to counseling yesterday to be evaluated after a long struggle with my past. There have been many triggers that made me decide to go. Iâ€™ve had a crisis back in May where I almost voluntarily admitted myself to the hospital. 

In addition, a recent breakup has been almost traumatic for meâ€”I cry every single day when I think about it. Itâ€™s been three months, and I still cry every day. 

I also start grad school on Monday, and have been feeling impostor syndrome. I feel like Iâ€™m unqualified to be in that position. 

My 3 roommates also had an intervention with me because theyâ€™ve noticed Iâ€™ve been acting strangely and lashing out. Iâ€™ve noticed it too, so Iâ€™ve been isolating myself to avoid complications. However, they have taken my social withdrawal as an offense. During the intervention, I told them my problems (notes above) and they still seemed to invalidate what I felt. 

Iâ€™m not sure what else I have to look forward to for the future. I have been depressed for more than half of my life now.  When the crisis counselor asked me what my â€˜baselineâ€™ was, I couldnâ€™t tell him because Iâ€™ve been depressed for so long. 

I feel like if I were to be placed on medications, I would probably try and overdose on them. Iâ€™m not sure what to do now.
