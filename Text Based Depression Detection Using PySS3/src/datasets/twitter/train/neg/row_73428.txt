I donâ€™t deserve anything goodI just found out in a single week that four people from my workplace are moving into greater things, and Iâ€™m just stuck here in this dud position for eternity since I currently donâ€™t have the funds or credentials to move on myself. And a fifth person is leaving next year.

My boyfriend and friend are grad students and will be getting their PhDs in a couple years, inevitable that theyâ€™ll move away too. Long distance never survives.

Everyoneâ€™s leaving, and Iâ€™m going to be alone, because everyone deserves good things except for me.

I always made a promise to myself that Iâ€™d kill myself if life didnâ€™t get better by age 25, and Iâ€™m turning 25 in a month.
