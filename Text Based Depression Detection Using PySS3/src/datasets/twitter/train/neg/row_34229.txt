A Message to Everyone HereHey guys. I read this sub from time to time because depression has played a huge role in the lives of the people I love. It makes me sad knowing people are out there feeling so much pain, loneliness, and hopelessness. Feel free to message me if you would like to chat about anything. I'm no expert but I've done what I can to try to understand depression and what can be done to help. Unfortunately depression doesn't have a general solution. But I am someone who believes there is a solution for each individual person. The difficult part is that each individual person has to seek out a solution and dedicate themselves to actually fixing whatever the problem is

It doesn't matter who you are, there is some path you can take that leads to you becoming a happy person, whatever that looks like. That is the real you. Whatever depressed mindset you're in is not you. Don't listen to your brain, it's fucking you over. Think about who you could/should be and fight your ass off to get them back. You get one life, don't end it early because you got off to a bad start or whatever. The conscious mind is a very powerful thing. It doesn't matter how you feel, you can force yourself to do shit. Start with exercise, food, work, then figure out what's right for you. When you don't feel like doing something, tell your brain to fuck off and go do what you need to do to get your life together. Do it for the real you!
