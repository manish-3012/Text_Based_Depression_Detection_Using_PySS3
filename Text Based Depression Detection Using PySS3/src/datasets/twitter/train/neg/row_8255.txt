Coworker/friend is suicidal. Should I tell someone?I have a coworker who is also a close acquaintance; we don't hang out outside of work but we do talk often through text. He just told me tonight that he's finally decided he's going to end it, and he is very at peace with his decision. He said it will not happen tonight and probably will not happen this week, but he doesn't know beyond that. He has a specific plan in mind, but he needs to buy a gun in order to make it happen. 

I have read a lot of websites and the info provided here on how to talk to him, but I'm scared. I'm considering speaking to my boss about it (maybe without mentioning the friend's name?). My boss is very understanding and I get the feeling he's possibly dealt with emotional troubles himself in the past. 

I'm scared right now. I don't even know what to say. I'm afraid something I'll say might make it worse, might drive him over the edge. He said he's made the decision and not to argue with him about it, and I'm trying to follow all the guidelines in talking with him but I'm scared.
