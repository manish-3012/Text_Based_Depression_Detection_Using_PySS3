I can take my life at any second and donâ€™t know what to do, im not suicidal i just want my voices to stopI look at this sig sauer p320 everyday. I hold it to my head just about every morning and night when the voices come. Iâ€™ve been doing this for a year, the only thing that stops me is not that i might regret it but that im embarrassed to die and i still love my mom and I canâ€™t imagine her or my dad finding me dead yet. I still have those human emotions. I dont know what i should do, i know eventually Iâ€™ll do it when im older but what should i do now. I have no answers but i cant keep wasting away like this. Can someone help me?
