What a long strange road itâ€™s been.            I donâ€™t have reason to be as miserable as I am, and to be honest looking back on life I canâ€™t pinpoint the moment things went wrong. Which is a newer feeling for me becauseI have an eidetic memory. I was always told how smart I was because of how quickly I could learn new things, or how quickly I could read. Even at a young age I was reading books of college level quicker than a young boy had any right to. 

          For all the instances and moments locked away in my head of times I literally canâ€™t forget, I donâ€™t know what brought me to wanting to die at such a young age. I remember all sorts of things in my life that hurt me, tore me apart inside, things that made me feel hollow and wounded. But for the life of me I donâ€™t know what specific instance brought me to the brink that day 14 years ago. All I do know is what happened after that because that day something in me broke. I donâ€™t know what it was, and I have never been able to fix it, but a piece of me broke that day and left me with a piece of madness inside. 

          From that day on those thoughts that seemed so terrifying and dangerous; slowly began to lose their edge. The thought of dying became a way of comforting myself. Because if I just died it was all over. The end. I could stop all this pain and misery I carried in my heart like a lead weight. They replaced all the normal dreams of a child because what use are dreams when the sweetest thing I could think of was my own death? What need was there for me to think of the type of job I wanted someday or type of house I wanted to live in when the only real dream I had was to slip into the cool embrace of death. 

           Overtime these thoughts are my companions. They make me feel better when Iâ€™m sad, they lift my spirits when things become too difficult. I know... well I knew that I could never follow through with it. I was a smart kid and I have a big family. I knew that suicide was nothing more than taking all the pain and abject misery I held in my heart and dealing it out like a deck of cards to all the people in my life I cared about. These thoughts were just things that made me feel better. And for 14 years these thoughts have been enough, everyday I take solace in these thoughts wishing things were different. 

             But suddenly I donâ€™t feel the same fancy I used to. I donâ€™t feel the edge taken off my pain when I picture myself dying. Iâ€™m worried that this means my madness has begun to just grow and Iâ€™m not sure if I can stop it. I donâ€™t feel okay anymore.... I donâ€™t know if I can be okay anymore. The small fractured part of my heart that was once contained has begun to spread and now most days I feel as though I have a ragged gaping hole right in the center of my chest. I donâ€™t know what to do with my madness anymore, but I felt the need to write this. Iâ€™m sorry this is poorly composed itâ€™s 5am my time and I havenâ€™t slept in 2 nights.
