Nothingness. I can't take this anymore. I am scared of nothing but one thing. The concept of death. Not the dying process but the process of eternal nothing. No thoughts. No feeling. No doing. No being. It scares me, a fairly confident and normally very lively person into an anxious panicky person. I get ridiculously upset and have pain attacks and. I longer want to live and then experience my fears as I am in a state where I am too upset and scared to continue. Most nights I start asking myself "why live?" and things about what the point of life is then crying myself to sleep in a state of emotional pain. I can't take that it will happen after roughly 80 years of suffering. Living in a small house. Probably alone. Working a dead end job day in day out for around 40 years then do nothing for 15 and be in misery for the whole time. I'll be just another one of billions who has come and gone and been forgotten then soon lost. Sure my family will miss me but hey, they're nothing to the world so as their loss I'll be nothing to the world. I won't have done anything amazing with my life and I won't be able to leave a mark. I will be sedimented into the rock of this earth and churned around by the belly of this hell of a planet. I don't want to feel this way and don't want to be nothing. I want to die. It's 2:20 am. I'm off to try to  sleep. Will reply to you on the morning if I don't kill my self by then. I'm on the brink.
