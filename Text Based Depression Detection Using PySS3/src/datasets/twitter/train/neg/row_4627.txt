20 year-old burnout that can't get his drivers liscenseHello, I am a 20 year old man. I have lived at home with my mother since graduating high school 2 years ago. I went to a trade school and walked out with a certificate of pc service and support. Problem is that I live in a rural area 2 hours outside any major city centre and have failed to get my drivers 8 times now. I even passed drivers training but flunked the actual road test. Everytime I take it I keep fucking up. Yet I know that if I don't get my drivers i'm going to be stunted for life, so why don't i just end it all and blow my brains out? 

The problem arises in my family. You see they happen to have deluded themselves into thinking that I have potential and am destined to actually move out of my mothers basement. I know that if I finally man up and splatter the cieling with my gray-matter that it would destroy mymother which would make life significantly harder for my two younger brothers aged 18. My younger brothers are more succesful so I dont know my my mother hasnt written me off as defective and moved onto coddling my siblings instead.

I'm too much of a sentimental puss-bag to put my family through that. Why cant they just see me as the fuck-up that I am and allow me to die without remorse?
