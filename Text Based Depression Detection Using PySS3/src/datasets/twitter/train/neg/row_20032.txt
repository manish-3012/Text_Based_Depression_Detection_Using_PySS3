What are some good and efficient ways to distract yourself from toxic thoughts when youâ€™re on your own ?I donâ€™t have any friends or family members I could talk to or do something fun with, so it has to be something I could do alone.

I tried it with watching Movies and tv shows on Netflix, it worked pretty well sometimes but Iâ€™m at the point where I donâ€™t have anything interesting to watch anymore.

Video games can be helpful Aswell, but currently they donâ€™t seem to work anymore.


I mostly just lay in my bed suffering from from really bad thoughts I canâ€™t seem to get rid off...


So what helps you or do you have any ideas what else I could do?.
