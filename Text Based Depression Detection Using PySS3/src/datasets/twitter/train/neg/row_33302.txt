Iâ€™m sick of being here. Let me go homeIâ€™m sick of being forced here, I know people would miss me but Iâ€™d be better off dead, I hate it here. I feel like everyone secretly hates me and Iâ€™d be better off gone, I arenâ€™t mentally stable enough to do my dream job and I can barely function as an adult. I am honestly just a failure. Iâ€™m completely useless and hopeless. I hate being unable to do anything on my own and Iâ€™m a burden. I bet everyone would be relieved if I just offed myself, they wouldnâ€™t have to put up with me anymore and Iâ€™d be free. I hate being here. I hate it so fucking much, but Iâ€™m fucking stuck here. I canâ€™t hurt people but at the same time I canâ€™t fend for myself. I just donâ€™t know.
