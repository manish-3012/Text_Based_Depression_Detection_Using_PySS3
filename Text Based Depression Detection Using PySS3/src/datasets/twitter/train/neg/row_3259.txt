I feel aloneAt this point I don't have any friends, they have all ghosted me, I'm not over-exaggerating, I have nobody besides my boyfriend. As wonderful my boyfriend is, I can't let the pressure of him being the only person in my life be weighed on him, I can't always rely on him to be there, he has his own friends and other things that take up his time, I can't always be a priority, I understand that. When I had other friends this wasn't an issue, but now I just can't help but feel alone constantly. I feel completely alone when I'm sad, crying in bed alone at 3am, I feel like I have nobody to turn to. I don't know how long I can go on feeling like this. I just wish I had somebody to talk to.
