Expectant father, closer and closer to suicideI'm 33 yo, my wife is 6 months pregnant and I love her and our daughter, but my depression has been so rough, so chaotic that I''m seriously thinking about ending everything. I can't see or feel joy or beauty in any shit, I just wanna lay down in my bed and stare the walls until I fall asleep. I don't give a fuck about the preparations for my daughter, I just find enough strength in me to wake up and work so she can have a life provided by me. But even that is now shrinking and I don't any fuckin' way out. Fuck.
