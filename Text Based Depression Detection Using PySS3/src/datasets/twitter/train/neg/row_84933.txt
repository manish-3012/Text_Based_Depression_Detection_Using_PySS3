Decided to quit my major, buying gun soonI posted a bit ago about my personal problems. It was thirty or so bullets long. None of them have improved. I didn't get the grades I want and don't have the energy to retake, so I'm just going to drop the major and volunteer work associated with it.

I'm going to buy a gun in a few weeks when I get back to the city after break. I plan to drive out (if the insurance company ever gives me the check for my totaled car) to a gun store, get a gun and some ammo, and shoot myself in the head in one of the abandoned construction zones near the fringes of the city. No more stress, no more shaming, no more of feeling like there's a pile of cinderblocks on my chest. Just silence.
