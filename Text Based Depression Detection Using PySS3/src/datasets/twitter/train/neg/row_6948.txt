i can't liveI'm on holiday, and there's no hope for me. Knife wasn't sharp enough to cut, nor can I speak to family about what I'm facing. My dad saw me crying and simply told me to "stop misbehaving." I just need to feel better, and there's a box of pills near me. I could take them, although I'd end up in the hospital in this country, and I'd put my family to shame. I just can't live.
