My life is not going to go anywhere and I feel like there is nothing I can do about itFor starters I barely passed high-school and I'm too unfit both mentally and physically to join the military.

I dont have my license but I do have my permit. Driving terrifies me and the fact that people seem to do it effortlessly both baffles me and makes me feel shame.

I'm 23 (about to be 24 this month) and I've never had a job. While the thought of getting one excites me, it also terrify me because I know sooner or later I would be fired do to my incompetency.

I have no confidence in anything that I do and as I mentioned previously I am incompetent at anything I do.

Ever since I was 17 I had suicidal ideation but now at 23  they are stronger than ever. When I turned 17 I was hoping that I would have a freak accident and die when I graduated highschool, but as you can see that did not happen. When I turned 20 I made a deadline that I would kill myself and the age of 25.

I genuinely don't see myself improving or turning my life around.
