Nobody will notice if I disappear.I have bipolar type 1. I'm in university right now, no friends there. All of my friends are online, in a skype group. I can technically interact with my friends daily if I want to. Some of them talk quite frequently with me and vent to me and seem to trust me, and I do really care despite the barrier of only being online. In fact, I really love one of them and they're important to me. But I know nobody feels the same as I do. They trust me, but that's the only value I have to them. I'm not a best friend; they seem to reserve all their demonstrations of care and indications of liking others for other people. Nobody asks how I'm doing even though I ask them and try to be nice. Right now I'm starting to take a break from talking at all. I'll talk if someone talks to me, but if not,  I'll continue being quiet. I know they'll all forget about me this way, despite the effort I've put into being nice and trying to connect with them. I dont know how to express my concerns to them. In fact, now I'm thinking that seeing everybody forget about me while I take a break will be too painful emotionally while I'm already feeling so awful, and I'm considering stopping talking to all of my friends to save myself the trouble :/. I can't see any other way around this. I don't think I can tell them, and even if I do I'll just have my concerns confirmed. I'm extremely lonely and nobody cares. I'm extremely miserable and nobody has so much as a nice word for me or an ounce of concern. Theyd probably not care if i expressed even my suicidal thoughts. I'd really rather be dead. There hasn't been a day in the past 7 years that I looked back on and thought the decision to go on living was a good decision. I feel so awful, and I don't know what to do or where to turn :/
