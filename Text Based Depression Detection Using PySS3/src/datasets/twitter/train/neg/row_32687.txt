On the brink.Lately I've been feeling useless. I'm a stay at home mom with an almost 2 and 3 year old. I have back problems that leave me bed ridden, crippling anxiety, and severe depression. The best part is that my husband makes too much for me to get any kind of reasonably priced help and not enough to lay for insurance. I've been struggling with suicidal thoughts for as long as I can remember and tried to commit suicide several times but obviously they were not lethal enough. These past couple months have been hell. We relocated for my husband's work and it's been one big snowball effect between health and using the last bit of our savings. I can't even get my daughters  a birthday present this year. Every day it gets worse. I can barely get out of bed, I cry through out the day, I have several panic attacks, and I've been researching all about suicide and finding an affordable gun. I love my husband and daughters but it's getting to the point where their laugh or smile doesn't make me smile even a little. I'm pushing them away, telling them to play in their room, and locking myself up. I don't want to wake up in the morning. The only thing that's holding me back is that I know my husband would rather live in the shelter with our girls than find them a better home with a mother that can love them like they deserve and a father that doesn't have to devote 65 hours a week to work, come home at 4 am and sleep until 12, leaving only a couple of hours engaging with them daily. I want my girls to have something more. Someone who can properly love them. I don't even know where I'm going with this. I have one friend but he just says stop being depressed. My husband doesn't know what to do and I just want to die.

Sorry for all the typos. I don't really feel like proofreading right now...
