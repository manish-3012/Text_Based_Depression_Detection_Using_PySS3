If guns were more available in my country, i would already be goneIts just that i dont have a good way of co miting suicide. Some are too scary, some are too unreliable and others are unavailable. I've seen what a shotgun shell can do to a human head, and i swear to god if i could use that i wouldnt be here right now. Pulling the trigger is so much easier than taking those last steps. It would be so perfect if i could use a shotgun, im so jealous of you american bastards with your guns.
