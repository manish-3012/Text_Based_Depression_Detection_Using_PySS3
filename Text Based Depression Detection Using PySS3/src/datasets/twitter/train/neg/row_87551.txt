I'm 27 and going nowhere in life, whats the point of living anymore?27, finished up a useless psych degree, no career prospects, no romantic or relationship prospects, life is at a standstill going nowhere, most days I just want to stay in bed and sleep my life away

Life is a chore what reason is there for me to keep going? I'm at a point now where I can know for a fact that its not going to get any better if anything itll get worse
