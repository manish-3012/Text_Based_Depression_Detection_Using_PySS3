"The road to recovery is winding"is there really any point to trying anymore if I have to make it through the twists and turns

I can't stop crying. I can't eat. I can't sleep. Dammit I can't even smoke cigs. I constantly feel like throwing up. I don't have anyone I can talk to. I have been working so fucking hard for months and months and months and months and it has felt like a waste of time for too long. I'm getting tired. I've been self sabotaging and reckless and thats only made it worse

what is the fucking point man
