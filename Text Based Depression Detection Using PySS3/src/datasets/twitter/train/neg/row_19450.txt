Can i call the suicide hotline if im not suicidal but just having an emotional crisis?I need to talk to someone, preferably on the phone to vent but im afraid iâ€™ll prevent people who are actually suicidal to not have the chance to speak to a suicide prevention hotline worker because im talking to them and there isnt enough workers to speak to them.
