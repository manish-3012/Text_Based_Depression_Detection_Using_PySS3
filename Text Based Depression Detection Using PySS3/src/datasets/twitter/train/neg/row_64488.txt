It was going so well.Hi, I'm 14 and up until a few months ago, I loved my life so much. I had plenty of friends, I started excersising, I was hitting on plenty of girls, and life was exactly how I wanted it to go. But that july, I had lost my father. I had no idea how to handle this, I loved my dad so much and I could tell that he cared for me alot. Suddenly, life wasnt so simple and it took so much mental energy to do the easiest of tasks. I couldn't handle seeing my mom in so much turmoil, I was pissed because I didnt seemed like my sister didnt care at all, and i was tired because i was just bottling everything up. I'm not able to run anymore because the heart condition he had might be in my, so excersising may put me at risk if dropping dead in the middle of the street. I stopped socializing and my grades went to shit. Everything just went downhill. Since then, I've had 2 close calls. One time, I want to go grab the rope I kept under my bed for just in case scenarios, but it simply wasnt there. The second time, I want to grab one of my dads old guns, but we did not have any ammo. Now I'm just contemplating what to do. I dont want to put my mom through the pain of losing a child, and I'm struggling to keep how I'm feeling bottled up. I really just dont know what to do. 

Sorry if this is all over the place, I'm just moreso writing my thoughts out.
