Today is the dayI've spent the last two weeks maxing out my credit card driving my little Toyota from Oregon to Virginia. I am currently in a hotel across from a 24 hour Walmart. I'm gonna buy a grill, a tent and some charcoal, go into the national forest and take my forever nap. Ive had a lot of fun but now it is finally time to go. I was hoping for some advice on how to make sure I don't fail, like should I get two grills? I was thinking about duct taping all the vents in the tent, as the rain fly still let's air in. Should I just put the grill in my car? Anyone with good advice would be greatly appreciated. Not looking for pity posts or any type of help. 

So long world, you are beautiful and all, but I just don't care anymore. Give me freedom and/or give me death.
