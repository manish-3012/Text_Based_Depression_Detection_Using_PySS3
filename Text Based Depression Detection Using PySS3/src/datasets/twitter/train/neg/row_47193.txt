Today is my birthday yet I want to dieEveryone is wishing me happy birthday and I hate it. I hate today. I hate the day I was born. I wish I was never born. I wish I was a piece of cum my mom swallowed. I wish I wasnâ€™t here. I literally did nothing but cry all the fucking day. 

Whatâ€™s wrong?
Me, Iâ€™m the one thatâ€™s wrong
Iâ€™m the problem
Iâ€™m the issue
Iâ€™m not supposed to be here.
