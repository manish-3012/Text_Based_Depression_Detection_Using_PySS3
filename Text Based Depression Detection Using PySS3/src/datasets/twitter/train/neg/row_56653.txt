One year from now I will kill myselfI wish I never existed. That's my most wanted desire now. I wish my parents aborted me. I wish my parents let me die when I got that rare disease as an infant that caused them so much money and forced them to marry. I wish they never did any of that. They wasted their time. Look how that child ended up becoming. What a complete waste. Now they hate each other but continue to be together for our sake. This is all bullshit. 

Nothing would get worse if I didn't exist. I'm invisible to the people around me and I make zero significance. The only thing that changes is that people won't be able to take advantage of me anymore. 

One year from now. If things are still the same. If things don't get better. I will kill myself. I have planned it out already. Even a close friend told me it's okay for me to do it if the pain is too much to bare. It's decided.
