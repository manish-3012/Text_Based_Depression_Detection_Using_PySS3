Constant painI have severe depression and anxiety....... i'm tired of having constant severe chest pain/tightness, shortness of breath, and dizziness 24/7.  I can't stand for more than 2 minutes without feeling sick, and i'm basically bedridden these days.  I'm only 20, this isn't fair........... I don't want to die, I just want this to end and if death is the only way out than so be it I guess.  I've had so many tests done and the doctors can't find anything wrong with my heart, I have no idea what's happening to me.  I was fine 6 months ago........ now I can't even take my thyroid medicine because i'm scared it'll give me a heart attack.  I just want help, I can't keep doing this
