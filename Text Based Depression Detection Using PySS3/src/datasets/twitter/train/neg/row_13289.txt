HelpNot really serious about suicide (at least right now), but figured that I could always use some help. So here I am, half the world from where everything meaningful thing to me is for reasons I've recently lost my job, bill is starting to pile up, not sure if I can afford to stay here for any longer. If not, things is gonna get real shitty also for reasons. The only thing which has been keeping me moving is my parents and my girlfriend. I love my parents, but everything is so hard right now for all of us that maybe, just maybe, it would be better off without me. My girlfriend, we are half a fucking world away and since then she has been so fucking distant. I'm not a dumb little shit who doesn't realize what is going on here. I fucking know.

I'm not really trying to suicide when I'm writing this, but I've been thinking about it a lot. I haven't gone out in 3 days, and I feel like I'm hitting on a wall. Everything I'm doing now is so fucking terrible just cause my mind is full of shit. Just looking for a place to pour this all out.
