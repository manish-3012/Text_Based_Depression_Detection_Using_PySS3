GoodbyeGirlfriend rightfully left me today on my birthday, I wasn't good to her, she made two Reddit post about me previously. Due to not wanting people to help me when I'm in a time of need. Along with our constant issues previously. We have of her trusting. Just a now 28 year with just an associate degree. 

Lost many people who cared due to my stubbornness and ignorance. Great aunt also in the hospital. I am struggling at health as an personal trainer. Struggling to pay bills. Can't even put into full sentences what I am feeling and this time I won't be okay. 

I feel I'm the barrel of the bucket of life. I started writing letters to tell family, friends, previous love ones goodbye. Parents leave for a little tomorrow and they will back to their son hung.
