Lack motivation, falling into depression, suicidal thoughtsI am not sure if I am posting in the right place, I do not believe I could ever be brave enough to actually go ahead and kill myself, but I have been having these thoughts... what if, why not, who would care, etc...

I am in my third year of college after failing my second year, though I know I could get the grades I lack motivation to study for them. I am behind on my uni application, and have missed the deadline for my accomodation and student finance, and hate myself for this. I am supposed to have finished my Duke of Edinburgh around a year ago, but I am lying to my advisor as I have not really started my driving yet. I am overweight and cannot maintain a weight loss attempt for more than 2 days, I am killing myself with how much I smoke. Basically, all I feel as though I care about right now is sitting at home, smoking, eating and watching Netflix.

I know this is unhealthy, and I fantasise half my time about a fresh start. I tell myself exams are still 3 weeks away, you can revise enough to get your Bs, you can call SF Wales apoligise and see what they can do, you can apply for accomodation late and just hope you still get where you want to go, you can start your driving lessons next week, you can stop eating all this shit and get healthy.

But then the other half of my time I fantasise about just continuing as I am, until I smoke myself into an early grave, or die from a heart attack, or theres nothing left for me to do than rid myself of this planet so people can get another cancer off the earth.

I just feel so sucky right now.
