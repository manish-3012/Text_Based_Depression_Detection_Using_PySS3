I want to jump off an ocean cliffItâ€™s pretty much guaranteed death. My body canâ€™t either take the hit from falling or Iâ€™ll drown since I canâ€™t swim. Life is straight up terrible. Not just for me, but others too. The only ones who think life is beautiful are the ones that got everything set and flowing nicely.
