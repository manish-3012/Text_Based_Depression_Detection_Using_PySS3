What is the best suicide method?To keep things brief Iâ€™m aware things can potentially get better. But in order to do that you must be willing to change,which i am unwilling too. I donâ€™t want to deal with the pointless hardships of society and would rather die soon. I also donâ€™t want any pity,i just want my question answered.
