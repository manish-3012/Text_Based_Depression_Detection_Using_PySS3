I hate so much about the way I amI can't stand myself. I'm depressed and hate myself for being so pathetic. I can't bring myself to do any schoolwork because I just don't see the point. I hate university, I'm not failing but I'm close to it, for a couple of my classes. I really just want everything to end. There's a bridge near my house, and every day I force myself not to jump off, because there's a small part of me that is stupid enough to think I'll go anywhere in life. 

I hate myself for being so pathetic, been hung up on the same person for 2.5 years, knowing full well that a relationship there will never happen, cause if I have this much self-loathing it's a certainty that other people pick up on that; or at least they know I'm not a fun person to be around. I have 4 projects due this coming week and I haven't started any of them, but I don't really care. I'm so annoyed at myself, but not motivated to do anything about it. 

For the past few months I've just been thinking about suicide almost constantly. I've told a couple people this and they don't care. Could be they don't believe me, could be they have their own shit to deal with, but probably is cause they see me how I see me: pathetic and not worth the effort. It's no wonder I don't have any friends.

I just want this all to end because fuck this life. Happy fucking birthday to me. Just fuck this all.
