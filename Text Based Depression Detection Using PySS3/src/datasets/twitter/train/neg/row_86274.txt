How do I tell my parents and my daughter that I need to go?I'm in so much pain. In general, I find life fascinating and I have even found the positive energy in the universe amongst all the negative. But I have so much physical pain in my hip for the last 2 years. I have lost all quality of life, I can barely walk, and I can't sleep at night due to the pain. My parents, although they live in a different state, they love me a lot. It will be an arrow through their hearts when I go and I dont know how to go about telling them. 




My daughter is 5. I have custody of her on weekends and she is the brightest thing in the universe as far as I'm concerned. She looks up to me tremendously. She knows I am in pain, but she can't understand the extent. If I go it will mess her up for a long time, and she may never recover. But, it feels like there is a red hot serrated knife lodged in my hip 24/7. I have seen over 5 doctors and surgeons over the past few years and none of them agree on what the problem even is. I'm recieving no help except disability. I'm alone all of the time. I cannot sit, I cannot stand, I can only lay flat. Tonight, lying here in bed, it won't stop. I've made myself sick on anti inflammatories. 




I want to shoot myself, but I want to put a bullet through my hip before my head. I'm 30 years old now and the idea of living another 30 yrs in this kind of pain is laughable and terrifying. I've been dealing with the pain for 2 years and I've already reached madness. 




I feel so stuck because of my daughter. Should I record her a video and just go?
