Why i hate 420I was a senior in high school when Columbine happened. It threw our whole school upside down. Fast forward many years and many school shootings later. I still hate them all, but i, like everyone has gotten used to it. Fast forward to April 20 2018...8pm. I got a frantic call from my cousin T! She asked if I had heard from Brian. No why? She dropped that bomb on me... Brian died earlier.. I'm so sorry! My heart sunk. I had to give the phone to my mom. A year later and it still hurts like yesterday! ðŸ™ðŸ’”ðŸ’”
