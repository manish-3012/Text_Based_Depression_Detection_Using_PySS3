I'm 29, have a "successful" life on the outside. I've been battling suicidal thoughts for 10 years. Attempted once back 8 years ago. I can't do this anymore.I'm 29, in the military. I can't fucking do this shit anymore. I only keep myself going so that my family thinks I'm not a complete waste of space. But I know I am. Ever since I was mercilessly verbally and physically beaten by (mostly my mom, whom I love dearly still), I can't shake that I'm a worthless fat piece of shit. I'm not even fat. I'm considered a success by my peers. But every day, I can't get passed the fact that I'm a complete fuckup. Yet I still live for my family. It's a paradox. 

I don't know what to do anymore. I don't want to bring attention to this matter for fear of consequences within my professional career. Being a treated, emotionally crippled financial burden on my family is far worse than being dead. 

I'm posting here because I have lots of friends, but I don't want to let anyone know how fucking miserable I am in my mind. I keep the attitude that I can "fake it till I make it". I've been doing it for 10 years now. If it hasn't stuck by now, I don't think it will. 

I've done the pills. I've done the counseling. The only thing, oddly enough, that kept me alive was marijuana - it gives me profound insight into my life's dilemmas and how to fix them. I have been clean for over 2 years now, with nothing available to me except alcohol. Yes, I'm fully aware of how alcohol completely destroys your serotonin levels and thus your mood. I can't smoke pot anymore because of the military random testing. It isn't approved for depression treatment.

Fuck it, I just want to end it by means of an "accident" so that my life insurance pays off to my family.
