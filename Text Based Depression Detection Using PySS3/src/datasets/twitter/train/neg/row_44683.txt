Does anyone else want to die but feel like they canâ€™t?I donâ€™t want to be here. Iâ€™m ugly, and so incredibly short that I was bullied my entire life. I canâ€™t commit suicide though because of the pain it would bring my family. I kind of wish I would get hit by a truck, so I could finally die but my family wonâ€™t have to find out about how I really feel.
