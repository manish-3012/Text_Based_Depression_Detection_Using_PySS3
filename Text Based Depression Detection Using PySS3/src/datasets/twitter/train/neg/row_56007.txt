Humanity makes me want to dieSeriously I want to kill myself because I feel like I'm surrounded by people who don't understand my suffering and what I'm going through. People who don't understand social issues and psychological trauma in certain people. I can't take it anymore. I feel like I live in a society that doesn't understand people like me and being around all these people and living in this world really stresses me out. I think it's because I want there to be a change in society to help people feel understood more and I feel like that's never gonna happen and it makes me want to just give up and die. So that I don't have to live in a world where I feel like everyone's against me and my feelings don't matter. I'm just so angry at the world and I wish there was a change that could happen. But I don't have any faith that it will because I'm losing more and more faith in humanity.
