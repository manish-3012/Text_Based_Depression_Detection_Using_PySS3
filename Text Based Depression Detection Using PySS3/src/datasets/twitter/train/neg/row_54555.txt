What keeps me hereI've been thinking a lot lately. Thinking about why I bother trying to live this life. I feel like what used to be a vacant thought has slowly turned into a nagging voice in the back of my head that won't let go. I've grown tired of this life. 

At this point the only thing keeping me from really giving up on myself is the thought of my loved one's finding me or finding out about me. I don't have many loved ones in this life but I have a mother who loves me dearly and the thought of what I would put her through just to escape breaks my heart. I feel so inclined to leave this place, but I can't even consider it an option while there are people who would be hurt. 

I don't really know in what direction to go at this point. This life is slowly becoming a prison sentence and all I want is freedom.
