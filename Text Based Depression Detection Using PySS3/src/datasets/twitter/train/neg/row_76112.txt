Meaningless lifeWhatâ€™s the point of life? Iâ€™m only gonna grow up to get a job and pay bills and work like a slave for the rest of my life. I donâ€™t even have friends i can hang out with. Nobody likes me. Thereâ€™s just no point. If i want a good paying job i have to go to college and keep working and having an impossible debt to pay off. Then iâ€™ll get a job and work until i die. Whatâ€™s the point?Doing things you love are expensive. People with mental illnesses are outcasts of society and itâ€™s not fair. This is why i want to commit suicide. The only thing stopping me is my family and the inability of knowing what comes after death
