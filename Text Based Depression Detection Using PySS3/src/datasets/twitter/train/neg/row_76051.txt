Taking too much spaceTo preface this, both my older and younger sister have mental health issues that strained my family to the point where I was told to suck up my feelings because my mom couldn't handle it all. 

I still think about that, and I still can't suck it up. I've failed at fully faking it, and I believe now that I'm just going to be a further problem for my family if I just keep on living. I want to die, just so they don't have to deal with it and so they can focus on the bigger problems. 

If I die, they don't have to worry about my college, my hospital bills, my food bills, anything. They can focus on my sisters. They won't have to worry about fixing me. 

My mom could focus on herself for once, and my dad would have extra money 

No more clinical trials, no more ECT, no more medication, no more therapy

All I have to do is suck it up and do it, right?
