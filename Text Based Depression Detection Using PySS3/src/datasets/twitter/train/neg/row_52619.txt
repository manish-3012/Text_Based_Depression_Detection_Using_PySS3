The countdown has begunI never thought I'd be using this account again. I really thought I was good again. But here I am.

Back to crying alone, feeling helpless, devoid of hope and happiness, feeling like nothing is gonna happen right.
I'm just so alone in this battle. There's literally no one with whom I can talk about this, get support from and/or feel like they have me.
A blackness is slowly enveloping me, and there's no one to hold a flashlight for me. 
I can't do it alone. This is not it. 
I can't go on like this anymore. I lose some hope in my life everyday, and when I've lost the last of my hopes and this hits zero, I'll probably end it. 

Home and university both are hell. I don't have enough money on me to escape this life. Why is moving to a new country and starting life anew so difficult?
