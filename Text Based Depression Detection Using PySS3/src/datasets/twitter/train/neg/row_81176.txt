Suicide seems like the right thing to doI've met a road with two paths. One is a long life of hardship, loneliness, and depression. One is suicide, freedom, and release. Ive tried many times to make my life better but ive failed just as much. Im exhausted, lost, and sad. It feels like my friends are passing me by as they go off to college. While im left behind in living with my dad working a job with a wage of 7.25 with very low hours. Im not that sad anymore. Suicide doesn't sound irrational or saddening. It just sounds like the best option. A good option. Its just the right thing for me to do.
