Will i ever succeed in life?Guys i'm freaking out, i dropped out of school when i was 16 due to social anxiety now i'm 18 and i really need to get back and finish school, the 2 years i wasted i stayed on my room playing games, and i know i shouldn't do this, it was immature on my part, i know this could fuck up my future, and i must know if i will have a decent job in the future with a fucked up education, i left in 7th grade because i had repeated previous years due to another mental illness, more specifically ''Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder'' and knowing how fucked up i am in my school life, ill probably have a shitty future with a shitty job, and if that's the case i would rather die, i'm hoping to fix this by getting my GED but still, i fear my resume is fucked, i don't know what to do.
