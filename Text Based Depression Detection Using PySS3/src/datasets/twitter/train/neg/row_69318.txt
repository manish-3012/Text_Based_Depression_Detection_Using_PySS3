SorryI hate doing this. I hate having to post on here. I'm sure there are people who need everyone's support more than me and I just feel like I'm wasting everyone's time but I'm in so much pain.

I've gotten to the point where I feel like I've let so many people down and a few people have basically given up on me, so now I'm starting to think everyone would be better off, or at least wouldn't care if I were gone. I can't do this. I just can't do this anymore.
