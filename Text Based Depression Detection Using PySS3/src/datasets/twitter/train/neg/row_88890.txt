I'm so tired... so.. very tired...Everyday its a battle.. everyday its hell in my own head.. everyday the things I dont do or the minor things that happen somehow give reason to blame me for everything and throwing me under the bus with no way to defend myself.. without a voice... with no one to protect me.. just myself... I protect others when need be.. im always there for others.. no ones ever there for me.. im tired of being in the dark about everything.. im tired of being blamed and thrown under the bus for things that shouldn't of happened... 

Others are allowed to hurt us.. walk all over us.. use us as a doormat... even the person I love to the fullest never protected me despite protecting him... the friends I have never stood up for me.. one of them who tried to is also being put down... the closest friend I ever had.. she died... so long ago... I remember her every day... it hurts.. my lover even hid things from us for years... im forced to "trust people" yet no one gives me a reason to trust them... 

Im tired of the verbal abuse.. im tired of the mental abuse.. were broken.. we've been broken for years.. no one truly cares for us... I suffer from severe depression and anxiety as well... and I can't stop breaking down for weeks.. im tired... very tired... im thinking of ending it by tonight or sometime this week... I can't take the pain.. I cant.. its enough! 


Please... I want it to end... for good...
