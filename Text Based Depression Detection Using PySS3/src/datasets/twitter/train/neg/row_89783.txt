I feel destroyed by life and not sure if I can rebuild anything?I am not depressed at all,before all this happened I was a very happy passionate person with a thousand interests.

The reasons I want to suicide is:


- Brain damage most of all that happened in July,I can't feel what things evoke,I can't think,so the things I was passionate about don't effect me much.I can't watch films it's a confusing experience and even processing reading is hard, these were all things I loved.everything is harder.Some things have improved,but it would improve more if I was sleeping properly.


- Which brings me to my next problem I can't get any real sleep,no deep sleep for five years,I have a faint rest that feels like I never slept this has taken a complete toll on me and I look a wreck all the time and can't function,I think five years of this is enough.



- Reason three is I'm completely constipated it started three years ago and is still going,many days I can't eat anything,because if nothing's going out you can't keep eating,added to the sleep issue I just feel destroyed,dizzy and unable to carry on.


All three things were cause by a psyche drug I was on,I tried to taper off it but everytime I try the brain damage gets worse.Even when I was off it for over a year it had already messed with my sleep,bowel mechanisms so much that I was still suffering.


Again,I was a pretty,happy,incredibly passionate person who adored life but I can't live like this.When I read other people's problems on here I cannot believe how lucky they are.

Would appreciate any advice?
