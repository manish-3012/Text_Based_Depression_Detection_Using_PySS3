Iâ€™m struggling to find an answer, why should I keep living?Iâ€™m 23, a college drop out with notions of one day becoming a doctor.
But I canâ€™t afford to study.
Even if I could I donâ€™t know if I could ever get in.

I have nothing.
At best Iâ€™ll work for the next 2+ years saving every dime whilst living with my parents.
Iâ€™ll be 25/26 when I start, and then itâ€™s 6 years of college and fees.
There are hundred if not thousands of applicants and 3 positions for my situation..

Iâ€™m a monumental fuck up, I canâ€™t stick to anything beyond this notion.
I am so deeply unhappy in my life.
I havenâ€™t had sex in over 4 years, I havenâ€™t had a girlfriend in even longer.

I genuinely donâ€™t have an answer to the questions, â€˜why not just kill myself?â€™
I might one day get to study medicine, thatâ€™s the only sliver of hope I have.
Even if I did get in, I donâ€™t know if I have it in me to pass.

Iâ€™m trying not to cry while I type this in the work toilet.
