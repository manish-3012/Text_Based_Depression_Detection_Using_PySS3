do my parents even care at this point ?after months of only wearing long sleeve my mom  found out i been cutting myself. i didnt expect covid to cause me to stay home 24/7 which means i would have to eat dinner with them everyday. i hid it for a good 4-5 months but one day she came into my room and asked me to show her my wrist. i told her that i was busy and that we could talk later but she insisted and began to pull my wrist towards her. i think she thought i got a tattoo without telling her because she didnt expect it and she ended up crying. asking her if she did anything and that she would help me get rid of the scars. its been 7-8 months since i relapsed on self harm. my mom will make jokes like "why are u still hiding it i already saw it hahaha" and just little comments like that which make me think that shes belittling me. i genuinely feel like shit all the time and my whole family has known about the severity of my depression. coming from a cultural background my parents treat depression as a mental illness and they pretend like mental illness goes away if u dont aknowledge it. after many breakdowns, outbreaks, straight up attempts, my parents still refuse to get me any form of help which includes therapist, psychiatrist, or even just being prescribed to anti depressants. she told me if my extended family found out i was doing any of those things it would bring shame into our family. they definitely care more about other people than me right?
