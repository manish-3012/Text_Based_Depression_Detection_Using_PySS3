I need help, cause I feel like anytime I do one thing wrong, the whole world hates me.I love sharing stuff on Reddit. So I saw a bunch of people downvoting posts on my local go-to sub r/Knoxville. Most of the posts that were downvoted were posts of people wanting information about getting around town and looking for local places to eat, shop, visit, etc.

So I made a post discussing my anger at those who downvoted those posts who wanted help. I called those people who downvoted inconsiderate and rude. The post was immediately downvoted to 20%.

Later on I discussed on r/AmITheAsshole, that if I was one if I was to shoot a stray cat that was attacking members of my family and damaging my property, I had some people whom helped me change my decision to rather trap the animal than to shoot it, and I had some who called me psychotic maniac and stated that I should be attacked in the face by such cat and die.

I deleted both posts because people were so aggressive to me. I donâ€™t go around calling people obscure things and stating that acts of violence should be bestowed upon them.

I am done with life.

I donâ€™t feel like living in such an aggressive world anymore.
