Late night lonelinessHavenâ€™t had access to a counselor since COVID, and mentally iâ€™ve been doing terrible. My insecurities and feelings of self-loathing have transpired outside of my normal life &amp; into work and personal relationships. And I canâ€™t control it. Iâ€™ve been feeling on the edge for the past few years, and my patience for things has deteriorated to the bone, even the smallest inconveniences send me spiraling emotionally. I was kicked out of my engineering program at school for poor grades &amp; forced to switch to a less honorable major, my coworkers treat me as if iâ€™m incompetent after being there for 2 years &amp; the fast paced environment is getting to me, I inherently feel like iâ€™m never enough in any sort of friendship or relationship &amp; just feel like iâ€™m biding my time till I get pushed aside. I hate being 24 years old still living with my parents &amp; ultimately I hate feeling like iâ€™m on a treadmill of self-pity going nowhere fast. I promised myself Iâ€™d end my life if I get through college to make my family proud &amp; earn an iota of self-worth/self-respect. I donâ€™t see myself accomplishing anything worthwhile while I feel like this. And its increasingly difficult to just act okay around people. I crave to just feel like Iâ€™m worthy or feel like I belong. I guess if anyone relates to feeling like this, how do you cope or keep your feelings in line to get through the day?
