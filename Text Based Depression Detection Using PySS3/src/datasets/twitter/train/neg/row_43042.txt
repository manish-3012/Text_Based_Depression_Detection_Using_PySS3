I'm glad I didn't go todayCompletely shattered by a recent breakup, I woke up this morning and called off work. My plan was to get what little affairs I have in order (bills and rent), get drunk, take some pills I've been collecting then hang myself. 

A close friend was in town from San Fransisco. She gave me a guilt trip, as she always does when she's in town. I went out and spent the night with my three closest friends. I'm not sure if they know how much they mean to me. I've told them before but I don't think they really understand. They saved my life tonight and don't even know it. 

First time I've truly smiled in weeks. 

Thank you A, J and C. Love you.
