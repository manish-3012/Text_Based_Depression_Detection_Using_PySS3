Extremely depressed/lonely, struggling with suicidal thoughts.I keep struggling with suicidal thoughts and don't know how best to deal with them. I've spent more and more time each passing day thinking about it and am really quite afraid that I might get into such a slump that I will make an irrevocable split second decision.

I'm terrified of the thought that I will manage to justify suicide as an acceptable solution to my circumstance if only briefly.
