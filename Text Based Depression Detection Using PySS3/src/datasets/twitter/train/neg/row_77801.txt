I have too many problems and I don't know how to fix themI can't stop thinking about killing myself. I am so tired of trying to get better, be normal, be happy. I don't think I can. 

Ever since I was a little kid I have wanted to die. My mom was abusive to me and since I was homeschooled I had no escape. I started self harming at the age of 8 years old and now at the age of 20 I am covered from my chest to my ankles in scars. I spent ages 14-19 constantly in and out of psychiatric wards and hospitals, which left me with more trauma and very few friends. I have become the most mentally ill person I know and I feel like a monster. Bipolar II, PTSD, anorexia, anxiety, body dysmorphia. My mind is fucked up and so is my body. I have the ugliest face of anyone I know  Even though I am a 20 y/o female I get mistaken for a teenage boy on a regular basis. My nose is too big, and my entire face is asymmetrical. I think a rhinoplasty would help but it costs 12k+ and I know I will never be able to afford it.

More than anything I desperately want to be loved, have good friendships, and be happy but I don't see how that will ever be possible for me. I want to get better but I do not know how. Everyone says go to therapy and take meds but my PTSD is the result of being sexually assaulted by a psychiatrist ward staff member while on heavy sedatives, so I am scared to get help again. I have been trying to help myself by getting a service dog and forcing myself to get a job, be social, and "fake it until I make it" but I al still so depressed everyday. I don't want to ache like this anymore
