One year ago I got out.I have been out of wilderness for one year, yet my head cannot seem to leave. 

From watching people slit their wrists, to having every single thing I told my therapist written down and told to my parents after I was told I could trust them leaves permanent scars in my head. The write down what you say, how you act, how you respond, who you talked to, they write down everything. And then they decide your future. You're not allowed to talk to kids without a therapist being there. Everything hurts. Just not being allowed out of sight, never being trusted, always being lied to, just everything. It always hurts. 

Now my girl who I have been on and off with for six years is talking about dating this other guy, and she calls me her boyfriend but I'm not allowed to call her my girlfriend... I say "I love you" to all my friends and the only person who does not always say it back is her. 

I just don't see the point anymore. Existence is pain that I cannot get over, trauma from that place, along with shit from much before, I just can't fucking deal with this shit anymore. 

I'm not sure if I want to die but I just really fucking don't want to be alive. I'm living in the past and cannot think about my future. The girl who I thought would always be there for me only talks about herself and when I mention me she does not respond. I'm always there for her. no matter what. I just don't know if I should. It hurts. Every day. It hurts.
