Remembered why I came here againBy July/August I became aware that living in total misery until death was now about to become a reality, hence suicide as a preferred way out, and why Iâ€™ve stayed here as long as possible (which may have jeopardized a possible way out).  I fear leaving this subreddit - that will mean I am in the blender.  Take care all.
