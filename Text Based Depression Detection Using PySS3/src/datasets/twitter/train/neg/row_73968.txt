Holding it out for my parents' sakeAs the title says, I have no other reason to live except for my parents. They love me a lot and would be absolutely crushed if I ended my life.

Besides that I have no other reason to live. I have got no friends. The ones I had left me when I could no longer serve any purpose. I have never been in a relationship either. My only sibling hates me to the core of her heart. To add to it, I am not close to either side of my family at all.

All I have is my parents and my dog. For many years, all I desired was to love and be loved back (platonically and romantically) but that desire has mostly died out. I don't desire love and affection anymore.

I have no other desires anyway. I don't desire a big house or flashy cars or branded clothes. I don't desires dozens of social contacts or head turning handsome partner. I don't desire fame or popularity.

All I ever wanted was to peacefully live my life wity my loved ones. But it doesn't like that would come true either. But it doesn't matter anymore since most of desires have died out, rest others will follow the suit too.

I often think about ending my life, what prevents me is my parents. They love me a lot and have provided me all sorts of material comforts. My abrupt passing will leave traumatised for rest of their lives. So I hold it out so long as my parents are alive

I plan not to live any longer than my parents. Once my parents are gone, I will follow along as well.

That's my little sob story. Thanks for reading
