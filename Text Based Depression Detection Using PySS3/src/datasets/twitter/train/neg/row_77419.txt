if only my wishes could really change the world.I want to be eloquent about this, but the words are falling from me, just as the hope is falling. I'm going down, down. I don't know how long I can keep doing this. There is too much in the world that is just too hard. I want to change the world, but I can't even change the chemicals in my brain to make life tolerable. I wish I could help everyone here. I wish my love for you could make a difference for you. I wish I could heal myself. I wish all of us could find some way to survive, but I think I must give up soon. I'm so tired.
