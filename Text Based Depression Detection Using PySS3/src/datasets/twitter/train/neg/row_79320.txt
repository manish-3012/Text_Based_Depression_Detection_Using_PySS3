When is it enough already...I have failed at life, I am ass deep in debt, my car was just stolen, and I have no friends.  I can't think of a single reason to keep living, yet I can bring myself to jump off a bridge. I could literally kill myself right now and nobody would bother looking for me, for at least a week and possibly as long as a month (when my rent is due again).

So how much further away am I from finally reaching the despair bottom I need to blow my brains out?
My 33rd birthday is in two days... I wonder if that will be perfect day, since I will be completely alone yet another year on my birthday.
