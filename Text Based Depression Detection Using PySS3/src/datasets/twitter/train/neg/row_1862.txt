I want to be doneI feel so tired and alone. Iâ€™ve struggled with mental illness since I was a kid and I just want to be done with everything. I donâ€™t feel like anyone loves me or even likes me, except maybe my parents but I donâ€™t feel like it goes beyond loving me just cause Iâ€™m their kid. They donâ€™t actually love me for me. And even if they do, I donâ€™t feel like I can open up and talk with them about how Iâ€™m feeling and about my problems. Iâ€™m just to anxious to do it. 

Iâ€™m very lonely. Iâ€™ve only ever had a friend once in my life, but it didnâ€™t continue after third grade. I wish I had someone I was Iâ€™m;octant to. Someone I could trust and openly talk to about anything, who made me feel safe and wanted. Iâ€™m tire of being an unwanted nuisance to everyone around me. I want to go somewhere where I feel like I belong. More and more often it feels like the only way I can even get to a place where I would feel okay would be to just be done and kill myself. 

I guess it does feel good to at least get all of this off my chest.
