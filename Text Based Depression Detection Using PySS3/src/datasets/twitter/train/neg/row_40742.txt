I want to stop existing, but maybe come back.I feel like I want to die really badly maybe every other week. I know when I wake up after a particularly bad day, itâ€™ll be bearable again to live. Not great. Just bearable. About as often as I want to die, Iâ€™ll have a really great day and be motivated to live for a bit until I wake up the next day. I wish there was a free trial to being dead, just to make sure itâ€™s a good route. I can cancel my death subscription if it really ruins the lives of those around me too much, because I think I keep going for them anyway. 

Like a coma, but without the crippling medical bills.
