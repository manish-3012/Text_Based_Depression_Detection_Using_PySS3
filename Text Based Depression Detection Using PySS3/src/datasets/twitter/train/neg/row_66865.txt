Journal #1I want to leave this world. I donâ€™t belong here. I feel this darkness around me. I feel it closing in. Iâ€™m a failure. I have no friends. I have no job. I canâ€™t do anything. Iâ€™m just a leech. I have too many problems. Mental problems. I wasnâ€™t born with them, I developed them as I got older. This is a horrible world. Iâ€™m not sure if I can stand it. We are all going to die at some point anyways so why not just get it over with. Maybe I can validate my existence by making the time others around my have more enjoyable. That is my goal. Maybe Iâ€™ll feel better about myself. Iâ€™ve always liked to help others. However I think because of this people have taken advantage of this/taken this for granted. I have no one there for me. No one truly cares about it how I feel. No one knows how sad I am. I guess thatâ€™s my fault for not opening up to people. I just donâ€™t feel comfortable I guess. I feel like no one would want to listen anyways. But I wish someone would. It hurts so bad to hold it in. I have so much pain inside. Iâ€™ve started to cry before I go to sleep more frequently. I think this is because I lay down in bed and reflect on life/ how my day went. And I usually do nothing every day. And Iâ€™ve achieved nothing in life so far. I wish I wasnâ€™t born in the first place so I never had to deal with this stupid life. Itâ€™s so dumb and pointless. Everything comes to an end at some point so why would you delay that? Everyone is forgotten at some point. Everything is forgotten at some point. This is all so stupid. Iâ€™m broken. I need help. I donâ€™t know how to ask though. Iâ€™m scared. I donâ€™t know how much longer I can last. 17 years, and I have done nothing. Benefitted no one. I have no one. Everyone I know looks down on me. Even my family. Because I am useless. This makes me want to crawl into a crack and never come out. I want someone to talk to so badly. I feel as if I have no one. I canâ€™t do anything. I just want to be happy. Is that to much to ask?
