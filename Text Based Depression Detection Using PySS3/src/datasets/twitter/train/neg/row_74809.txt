I steal from people I love to buy drugs.My boyfriend is an addict. He's selfish. He lies to me all the time so that he can get high or fucked up on whatever he can get his hands on. His parents treat him like a child. He wont stop until something really bad happens- jail, detox, felonies, probation, hurting his family and hurting me hasn't changed him. I'm afraid of what has to happen for him to get better... or die.  I enable him because I love the drugs and I love doing them with him. I'm not happy unless I'm on opiates. Maybe I should run far from him but I can't bring myself to do it. Now I steal from my grandparents, my parents, my friends, strangers.... so I can get money and buy pills. I feel so ashamed but I don't think I will ever be willing to quit. I think I should just kill myself... slip into the peaceful numbness and OD... because I don't have the strength or desire to change
