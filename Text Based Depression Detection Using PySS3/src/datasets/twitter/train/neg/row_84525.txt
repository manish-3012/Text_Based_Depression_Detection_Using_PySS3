Is this all that life can offer?Hello Suicidewatch, I need your help. As I'm typing this on my phone, I'm sitting on the floor of my bathroom with a bottle of pills, debating on finishing the job today and leaving this world. 

I've not had the best life. One thing after another, from an abusive father, suicide thoughts since I was 12 ( I'm 20 now), and the never ending mountain of despair that I deal with in everyday life and work are starting to weigh down on my life at this moment. I have no one else to turn to. My best friend and roommate won't listen when I speak to him about my depression. His philosophy is things around me can always get better, so suck it up. 

Where it so easy. You know I think about the positive things in my life. I really, really do. But once the positive runs out, the bad rushes in. Bad memories from childhood, the death of a friend, the lose of a loved one. It all is just too much. I'm tired of dealing with these problems. It's been damn near 9 years that I've been dealing with these demons. And friends I think they are about to win. 

So, I came here in desperation. Just talk to me. Ask me what I do. What I'm in college for. My likes. My hates. Talking really helps keep my mind off things. 

I need the distraction right now.

Edit: I guess I should go ahead and mention for clarification: I'm a Male, 20 years old, and living in the southern United States.
