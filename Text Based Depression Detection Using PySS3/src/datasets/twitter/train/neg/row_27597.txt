Could honestly kill myself whenever I want to and no one could stop me. My life is fucking shit compared to other peopleâ€™s. Teenage years wasted.Iâ€™m at breaking point and no one knows. Doubt they care either. Is it really that hard to tell? Anyway, it doesnâ€™t matter. Iâ€™ve deliberated over it too long. One of these nights Iâ€™m planning on escaping my house without my family knowing and then kill myself. Fucking done. My life is trash compared to other peopleâ€™s. Drew the short straw in every fucking aspect. Iâ€™m 18 and my life is just fucked and has been for the last several years. Teenage years should be memorable but no I did fuck all, suffered with bad social anxiety, depression, didnâ€™t go out with friends because I have fucking anxiety and panic attacks over that shit, Iâ€™m skinny as fuck, Iâ€™m not close to my parents, I think about suicide every day, and it has been the same old shit for years. Not to mention the lying in bed doing absolutely fucking nothing either. What the actual fuck can I do at this point? Iâ€™m done.
