I don't want to get better, I want to get worseI don't want to get better. I want to get worse. 



In a way I hope something really bad happens to me, where I get more suicidal so I'll actually go and do it. 



I'm too anxious to get help, but that's fine as I don't want to get better. I want to get worse I'll actually have the courage to do it. 




I was standing by a train line the other day (to wait for a friend who was coming to me, I never went with the intention of jumping). But when I got there I thought about jumping. 


I have lethal amount of pills on my bed side that I can take at any moment. 



I find I get more suicidal at night, and I often purposely stay awake at these times. Certain songs make me suicidal, so I often listen to them, day and night, I'm lessons at school, etc. 




I don't want to get better. I want to get worse so I can just die. I hope something really bad happens to me and I have  no option but to kill myself, or something similar.
