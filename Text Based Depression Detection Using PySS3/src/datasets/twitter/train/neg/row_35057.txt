How do I tell my parents that I feel suicidal?I've suffered from anxiety and depression for a few years, but I've never told my parents or anyone else about it. Lately it's been getting really bad because school is fucking stressing me out, and I honestly just want to hang myself before I can disappoint anyone any further. I know I'm too much of a pussy to ever do it though, so my question to you guys is how do I get help? I know that my parents would do what they can to get me into therapy and all that, but I have no idea how to even bring it up with them. I don't want to be any more of a burden to them than I already am.
