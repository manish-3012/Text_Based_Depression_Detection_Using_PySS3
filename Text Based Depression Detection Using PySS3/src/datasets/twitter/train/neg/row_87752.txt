I just don't have anything left to give.I've had the most difficult 4-6 months of my life. I could write you a book but I don't care. I just feel so broken. I'm 30 and there isn't one single sincere relationship in my life aside from my grandfather who is dying. When I think about how alone I am it feels like I'm being crushed from the inside out. I won't make my grandpa suffer my death so I am going to try my hardest to hold out for him. He's had too much pain in his life already. But I've started tying up loose ends. I've deleted all social media aside from reddit where I know no one. I know how I want to go. And now i will try to hold on just a little longer.
