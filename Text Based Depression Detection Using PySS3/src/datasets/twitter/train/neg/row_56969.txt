FuckAll the protesting. All the violence. All the anger and frustration shared by so many people. On top of that - a virus that continues to kill people. The world is on fire. This is a powder keg that is fit to explode. There is no more happiness. All that is left is more violence and a full-blown fucking civil war. This is what continues to drive me towards killing myself. Call me a coward, but I want to escape all this. I donâ€™t want to live in such a angry, depressed world. Iâ€™m a cynical piece of shit and all I see is the negatives. There isnâ€™t a light at the end of this tunnel. Only more hate.
