Its tempting, but I'm sure I'm not going to do it.Hi. I have had and continuously have problems with myself. I have had such a fucking bad time most of my life and I don't know when it will end or how if it ever will. It's alot of my own fault but not all of it. Ive been willfully ignorant and lazy just because it feels good in the moment and I've made bad decisions in my life. I probably seem sweet and kind but I feel like I'm really just a big leech on people in the long run and right now I dont care if I am. 
It takes a long time to get into the specifics of my problems so I wont do it now because I'm exhausted or just lazy. But trust me when I say my body and mind have been very badly wired because of several things. Life feels so shitty for me most of the time. And also it can be so scary to a point where I feel like I can't take it anymore and reality starts feeling sort of slippery. 
I have stopped caring what the people that I assume care for me would think if I were to die earlier. I try to care about them back, and I don't want them to suffer, I don't want to hurt them, I would even protect them from harm(I don't think I show it however). But deeper inside I don't really care what they would feel or go trough if I were to check myself out early. But I probably wont do it. 
I have forgot what thought loop lead me to write this short ramble, I am drunk right now. But this is how I think and feel alot of the time. Please direct me to a more suitable sub if this shouldn't be posted here. Thanks for reading.
