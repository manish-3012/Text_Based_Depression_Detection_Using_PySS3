what's the pointIdk I realise I should be grateful that I have a great boyfriend but he lives sooooooo far away from him, I barely get to see him. What's the point going on and on with my stupid miserable life without him? He's the only thing that ever made me happy and smiling. For once I felt like I actually belonged somewhere. Now I'm back home back to my stupid garbage life in this boring af hole of a place.

Lastly I'm not sure why anyone would want to be my boyfriend. I'm not intelligent, I barely talk, I'm fairly attractive on the outside. Wtf does he even see in me? Just imagine if I was a dude nobody would ever want me, nobody would ever talk to me.

So maybe my life is also a complete joke and a lie. Side note I've been emotionally abused and bullied for most years of my life. Maybe I should just end it. I don't know. I've been thinking about ending my life since 2011. Oh well :/
