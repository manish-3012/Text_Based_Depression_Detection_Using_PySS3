Iâ€™m here for a good time, not a long timeItâ€™s not gonna be today or tomorrow. Iâ€™ve known it since I was a kid, though. One day Iâ€™ll be done. Iâ€™ll exit the building by myself, of my own volition, before the showâ€™s over or anyone has the chance to kick me out. 

Iâ€™m not afraid. I just donâ€™t want to yet. I fantasize about it, though. I was dead before. I remember dying in the hospital (injuries, not suicide)... there was a wave of nothing that took over and then pain and bright lights when they made me live. They said I was dead for eight minutes. I wish sleep felt like that. 

I lack the *need* for survival and replication that other mammals do. I wanna go on my own terms when the time comes to do it. No burdens. No apologies. No old age. I just hope my mother is dead before I decide to do it. 

It will come, though. I canâ€™t wait to sleep.
