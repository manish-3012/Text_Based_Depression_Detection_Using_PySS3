So fucking lonelyI'm still here living with a wife that hates me and is seeing another man, and I keep trying to be strong for my kids but every single night I lay here lonely as shit unable to sleep. My wife doesn't talk to me unless she has to so once my one friend goes to sleep I am so utterly alone. I thought I could do this any everything would somehow work out but its just worse each new day. I wish I could find just one person who was available when I actually need them..
