My boyfriend broke up with me and now I have nothingLast night my boyfriend broke up with me. He said it was because of my depression but that it wasn't "my fault". He was the only person I had, I have no other friends or people in my life and I just feel catastrophically alone. I think I'm gonna do it soon. I turn 18 tomorrow, but maybe I won't make it to then. Just needed to write it somewhere.
