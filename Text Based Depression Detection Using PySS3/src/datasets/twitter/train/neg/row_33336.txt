I'm currently looking out my 5th floor dorm window with the urge to jumpI've been fighting depression for a few years and I finally feel the urge to take my life. I can jump out this window any moment now.

I've never been loved or had friends. I'm also not good at anything. I just want to stop hurting all the time. I feel like my entire life has been nothing but pain.
