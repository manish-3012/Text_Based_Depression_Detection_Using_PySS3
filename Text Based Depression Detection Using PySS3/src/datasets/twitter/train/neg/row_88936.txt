any other suicidally depressed autistic folks out there?How does one stop, both intentionally and unintentionally, pushing everybody away, when doing do so is at the core of their very nature? I cannot stand others but my brain and my heart and my life is permeated with complete loneliness and despair and ennui without anyone in my life as it is now
