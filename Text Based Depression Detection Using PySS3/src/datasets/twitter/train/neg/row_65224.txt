SuicideSo my girlfriend left me because she wanted to improve herself, and I just wanted to be a part of it, but I am emotionally attached to her, I gave her everything that you can possibly imagine, affection, and other stuff to make her happy but it still wasnâ€™t enough, so I was trying to find a way to suffer, like get a sickness, I even started not wearing mask just to attract covid to myself, I wanted to get sick in order for me to forget, any help? How to get sick fast? I prefer cancer
