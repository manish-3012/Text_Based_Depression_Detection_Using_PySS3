I donâ€™t know why to go onI feel at the end of my rope and utterly alone. I can honestly say I do not matter to anyone or make a difference in any life. Nothing I try to do ever just works for me, every thing is try, try, try and try again, and maybe Iâ€™ll stumble into mediocrity, but nothing is ever a success for me, and I am sick of the constant struggle. No one wants to listen to me whine and go on about how I feel about everything Iâ€™m upset about, or if they do, it is only to make fun of me and call me all sorts of terrible things. I donâ€™t know how to make the pain of living stop.
