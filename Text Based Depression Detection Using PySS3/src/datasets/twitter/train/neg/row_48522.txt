I had a near miss and now I canâ€™t stop thinking about what could have been.A couple weeks ago a man sped through a red light right in front of me. I instinctively slammed on the brakes and right after I could only think, â€œwhy the fuck did I do that!â€ 

If I had died, it wouldnâ€™t have been my fault. No one would feel like they could have done more or wondering how long I had been contemplating suicide. Just a tragic accident on the roads. 

If I survived, then people would at least take my physical pain seriously. I also would probably get more slack for my anxieties/ptsd. I could probably get a prescription for my issues. Shit man 
 
I hate that I hit the brakes
