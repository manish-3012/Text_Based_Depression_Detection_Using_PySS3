My friend plans to commit suicide in two months, what should I do?I've known who this girl was from school, but only started talking to her over Facebook last night when she messaged me. We talked for a few hours and today we spoke again, only this time she told me a few things. a) She was being emotionally abused by her mother, b) she is, and has been, self harming for about 3 years, and c) she plans to commit suicide in two months. Now obviously I'm a little overwhelmed that a person I've never spoken to in real life is confessing all of this to me, but she says she 'feels like she can trust me'. She apparently has been 'sectioned' in the past when she's told her psychiatrist about this, and so refuses to speak to anyone of authority about it, she said that the Samaritans 'do fuck all' and the school counselor just called her mum when she told them. I'm really, really worried and overwhelmed right now, what should I do?
