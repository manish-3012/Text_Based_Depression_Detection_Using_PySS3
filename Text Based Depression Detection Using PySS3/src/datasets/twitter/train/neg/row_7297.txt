Really sad tonight, I need a friend.Same old same old, here's my story: https://pr.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/38xzc0/please_read_my_story_i_have_no_one_else_who_can/

Ok, so I'm alone this weekend and it really got me thinking about a lot of things. For starters, my parents are on a romantic getaway, my sister is on cloud 9 with her boyfriend, my best buddy is having issues with his girl, but at least he has someone, and I'm spending my weekend watching netflix. If I had someone in my life right now, I'd be having a blast right now. Not only that, but I tried to get my mind off things by going to the mall just to mingle a little, and when I was there, NOBODY even noticed me, if I was a dishonest person I could've stolen stuff and gotten away with it, yeah THAT unnoticed. This can't all be in my head, I can't be this invisible. What is it about me that makes me so transparent? I'm just your everyday guy who shouldn't have THIS much trouble getting noticed. I'm tall, I have big arms, i keep my hair nice and neat, I dress nice, some have even told me i kinda look like Andrew Garfield(I wish that, but I kinda just laugh that off!). And I'm not just waiting for something amazing to happen, I've put myself out there, I talk to girls all the time(never ends well), and I use online dating(NOTHING). I don't mean to complain or seem desperate, but there's nothing wrong with wanting attention. No one wants to go through life feeling completely invisible, but for so long that's been my life.
