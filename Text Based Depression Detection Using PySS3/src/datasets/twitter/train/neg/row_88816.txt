He resents me and I never make good enough progress.Everytime I approach my boyfriend after an arguement, I ask, "Are you in a good place to talk?" To which he will say yes and it's never yes. He told me he bullets me because its satisfying, that its pay back. I know I deserve it. I'm a fuck up. He told me today he resents me. I started panicking but stopped it quickly so I didn't annoy him. 

I can't do this. So many people in my life hate me, my whole family hates me. My boyfriend doesnt want me playing video games anymore so I formatted my computer and have no friends anymore. 

I'm moving with him in a month and quite frankly, I can honestly say I going to kill myself in the new house. I can't be loved, I'm just a pile of trash and a waste of space. Im panicking and in a chat with Suicide Prevention.. but I just dont want to do this anymore.
