The hotline stopped me last night. I feel like Iâ€™m going to go through with it tonight though.I donâ€™t even know where to start.  Nothing in my life feels okay.  My parents hate me, I have no friends, I hate my job, and more than anything I hate myself.  Iâ€™m sitting in my car with several bottles of pills ready to take all of them.  

Iâ€™m in constant agony due to medical complications, my employer lied to me when I was on short term disability so I went 5 months without pay and accumulated thousands and thousands of dollars in medical bills for problems that are still ongoing.  

My own mother just called me a piece of shit because i asked to borrow $50 to pay rent.  Iâ€™ve never asked for money in my life.  Meanwhile the just bought a new car in cash. 

I have childhood trauma that has haunted me every day for over twelve years.  Iâ€™m 21 and feel like Iâ€™m a failure.  No amount of pills or therapy have made me feel better over the past decade.  

In my last relationship my girlfriend tried to kill herself 4 times, it broke my heart.  Iâ€™ve had an aunt and an uncle who have both killed them selves, I know if I do itâ€™ll break my moms heart just like their deaths did, thatâ€™s whatâ€™s stopped me before but I donâ€™t think it will this time.  

I was going to take my life 5 years ago, I got got scared and stopped.  I was going to take my life last night, I called the prevention hotline and talked to a woman who said more kind things to me than anyone has in the past year of my life, I truly appreciate that woman.  

I feel like Iâ€™ve finally come to terms with everything though.  I had a dream last night that I was in a grave, it was very calming. 

I know this has been a mess, Iâ€™m sorry.  Iâ€™m scared and donâ€™t know what to do.  Iâ€™m sorry.
