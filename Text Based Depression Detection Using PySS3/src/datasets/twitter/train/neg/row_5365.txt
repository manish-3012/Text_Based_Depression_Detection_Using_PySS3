Why do I even bother.So, yeah. I'm old, 27 almost 28 and my life is just one shit show after another. Bipolar 2, bpd, self harmer to the extreme.

I don't even have legitimate reasons to be depr3ssed, I'm just so scared and pessimistic about the future I don't want to live to see myself fail again.

I came out as trans just about a year and a half ago, been on hormones evet since. My mother doesn't speak to me anymore because of it and I can tell my father says straining to maintain a relationship with both of us. No matter how many people tell me how good or feminine I look, every time I look in the mirror I see a fat stupid old guy pretending to be something he's not.

Today should be a good day for me too, I moved I to my new appartment, hanging out with a friend and staying the night at her place. And yet all I can think about is slitting my worthless throat wide open and watching the blood fill the sink.

I've no reason to live, I've nothing left to offer this world. I keep claiming I want to be a writer yet I can't even get my ass to sit down and write anymore. I'm probably an alcoholic and a drug addict and I'm not sure I give a damn. 

One of the only things stopping me is the knowledge that if I did it my friend would follow suit, she's even told me so. I don't want that on my head.

Not even sure why I'm posting this or what just expect to gain, I just really fucking hate myself to tonight.
