First post on Reddit, I feel like you guys could help me in advice.  I wrote while depressed and don't know what can happen happen with my life at this event, I'm just hoping you guys could help me out.                   Went to prom, in the end I got the feeling that no one will ever love me. I feel that ive been lonely my entire life, and most people use me. I know what its like to have a heart broken. It physically hurts. I just want to be cared about in life, but I feel like Ive been living a lye that I think people care about me. I don't know what to do. Idk if this is gonna be a down fall or if this is gonna be encouraging . If this is a down fall Idk if I can make it out of this one. I hope when I wake up, I will have the courage to continue and try again for the hundredth time at life, this time though I know things are gonna be different. I guess that I'm just reach out to this subreddit for final hope. I had a therapy before so Idk if this is gonna help me in learning or be the end. I'm just reaching out in a stupid way. Sorry
