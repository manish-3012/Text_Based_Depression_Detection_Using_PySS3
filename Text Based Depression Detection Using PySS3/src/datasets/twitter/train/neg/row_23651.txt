Fuck I don't know why I'm writing this, it's 3am and I'm not thinking straight. I'm fucking tired. I'm fucking tired of having no reason to get out of bed and shower and put on clothes that don't look good and don't fit right and looking in the mirror and fucking hating myself because I've got such a weird looking face and an awful personality and even worse social skills. I'm fucking tired of having no friends and no goals and no talents and generally being the most boring person on the fucking planet. Im fucking tired of getting up too early to do a ton of shit I hate to do and hoping next year it'll be better because of all the stupid shit I'm doing now and being wrong every time. I'm really fucking tired of being alone. This world wouldn't change at all if it woke up tomorrow and I was gone.Â
