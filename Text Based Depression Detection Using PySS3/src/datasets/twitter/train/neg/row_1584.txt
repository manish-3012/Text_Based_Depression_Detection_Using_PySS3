Afraid of the future(sorry if I don't speak english well) I am 13 years old and live in austria. I am afraid of the future, because of corona and school. I wozld like to have class at school. But doing my homework at home is really hard for me. I forget most of the time to do homework, I don't have the motivation, my grades are bad and so on.
It is not easy for me to find a place where I can kill myself, because my mother is sick, so she must stay home with me. I also can't buy anything online, because I am not allowed to order something on amazon.
What should I do?
