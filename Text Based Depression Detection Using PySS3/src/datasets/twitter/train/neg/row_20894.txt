Recurring nightmare, i can't remember when i lost whatever i had left but it won't matter tomorrowThey say everything happens for a reason right? Butg i can't get this fucking itchy static scratchy feeling out of my skull and when i close  my eyes i see the exact same face imprinted on the back of my eyelids, it's garfield, he's pulling the skin taut around his ((im not joking)) genital area and his whole body is shaking and his breath is hitching and i just dont know what its supposed to mean but i have 20 olanzapine and 4 bottles of calpol in the kitchen cupboard, don't bother replying with bullshit excuses for why i should keep breathing because i died a long time ago already. Goodbye.
