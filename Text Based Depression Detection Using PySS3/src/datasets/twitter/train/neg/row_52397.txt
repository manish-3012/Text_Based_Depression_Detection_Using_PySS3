Being a junkie was easierI need someone to tell me why it's worth it. Because right now all I'm doing is hurting everyone around me and they won't even tell me how. I've been planning my suicide for months and every time I convince myself it will be okay I get another wall of text about how my problems aren't worse than anyone else's and how I'm a shitty person. I can't even say how close I've come to attempting suicide this week, because that would make me even worse of a person. I've never felt so alone and I've never felt like such a fucking horrible burden.

Just tell me why I shouldn't do it because I know it would make things worse for people but it would be so easy for me to cloudgaze on the train tracks right now and I can't talk myself down this time.
