I feel nothing. I am nothing.My son is the only good thing Iâ€™ve ever done with my life. Heâ€™s truly brilliant and kind and hilarious and hardworking. Heâ€™s ten, and has such big aspirations. Iâ€™m in awe of him. 

I cannot give him the life he deserves. I am too fucked up to make it through a single day at my stupid job without crying and having a suicidal breakdown in the bathroom at least once. Honestly, itâ€™s usually more than once. Today was only twice. That place sucks any  energy I can muster to keep living and by the time I get home, I just sleep. It was the same at my last job. 

I donâ€™t think I was built to survive in the world we are living in. 
Iâ€™ve had clinical depression for 14 years. I know the downs and I know I can have good days, too. But everything is so hollow and Iâ€™m so tired. 

I walk around all day with a sob in my throat. And a death wish in my mind. 

I donâ€™t want to get married anymore. I donâ€™t want to keep hurting my kid, not being there for him. I donâ€™t want to get up and go to work tomorrow, a mandatory sixth day in a row. That alone almost broke me. I can only really try to live the few hours between getting off Friday and the overwhelming anxiety of Sunday night, when I begin dreading work again. 
I got into a fight with my fiancÃ© and I came to sleep on the couch. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll be sleeping. 

I know Iâ€™ve told this sub this all before. And about how I want to drive out to the overpass and jump off. I know Iâ€™ll die, other people have done it there. 

I love my son so much but I know Iâ€™m hurting him everyday Iâ€™m like this. 

Iâ€™m no mother. 
Iâ€™m just an exhausted husk.
A perpetually sad and aching ball of flesh thatâ€™s going nowhere. 
I reside in the dark place. Pulling myself out day after day is an exercise in futility. 

I wasnâ€™t built right for this world. I am nothing. 
I feel a strange calm, quiet inside. I know itâ€™s shitty but I want to give into this voice thatâ€™s been constantly telling me to end it for years. Constantly. If I zone out doodling, Iâ€™ll literally write â€˜kill yourselfâ€™ without even thinking. Itâ€™s so ingrained into me that I have no choice. The voice and the world have beat me into this nothingness.
I canâ€™t even cut myself right anymore. Iâ€™m just so tired. 

Thanks for reading if you did.
