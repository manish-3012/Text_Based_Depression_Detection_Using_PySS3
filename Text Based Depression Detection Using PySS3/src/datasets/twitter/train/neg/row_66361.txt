My life is better than it was but Im still suicidleAbout two years ago, I made a decision that I wasn't going to kill myself. I'd love to have a good story about it but the truth about was. I just got sick of playing the victim. Im now years out of work but have started to do volenteer work to get my work exp up and got friends now. But I still feel the darkness inside of me. Like I get so insecure. I went for a few drinks with a group of friends. They left me alone for a second to order their beers and I felt alone. Sometimes I think they hate me and dont want to be around me. I also go to a counsellor. He thinks Im doing better but the darkness is still there. I know it is. I cant fight it.
