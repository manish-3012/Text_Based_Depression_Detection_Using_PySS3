Why carry on?Hello,

for the most part of my life I have been a happy person who was focused on his future. I always wanted to be a teacher, so I went to the university and studied the subjects German Language and History. I did get good grades, but I also realized that my social life would probably never change. Neither did I find new friends nor a girlfriend. And every time I mustered up the courage to ask someone out I got rejected. But still, the thought of becoming a teacher kept me going. So I graduated the university with honours and started the last step in becoming a teacher: working at a school. This was the time were the failures began. Since I had to move away from the university town, I didnt know any people and since I have socially unacceptable hobbies (Video Games, Anime, Manga, Board Games) I couldnt make any new connections. Meanwhile my work was going poorly and my superiors already mentioned that I would fail the practical exam. And so I did, and the Re-Try also failed. Now I could never become a teacher and was unemployed for almost a year.

I am now in a new education for a job in the law system, which I found to be quite appealing. I think in America it would be called a Citizen Representative. Its not what I wanted, but still acceptable. But my old social problems are still with me. Since I moved to a new town I tried to make friends and become more likeable, but it all failed. Nobody asks me if we want to do something together and should I ask, people â€ždont have timeâ€œ or â€žmaybe another timeâ€œ. Should I write a text message I usually dont get a response at all. Same thing with women, they either already have a boyfriend and are happy and if they dont have one they arent interested in me either. Even a girl that shared my hobbies doesnt care about me. 

In summary, I am now 28 years old, failed at my dream job, have no friends, never had a girlfriend, never had sex.

So, why should I go on?
