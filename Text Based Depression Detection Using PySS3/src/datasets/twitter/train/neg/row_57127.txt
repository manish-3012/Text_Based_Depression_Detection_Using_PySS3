Sometimes I wish I didn't have my closest family.I wish I could just end it without feeling bad for anyone. I've tried so fucking hard for so fucking long to rationalize my existence, but every time I arrive at the conclusion "so that I don't hurt my closest ones". I never asked for any of this, I never chose to be born into this world, and I wish I never was. But I just can't bring myself to inflict that kind of pain upon my mother, my father or my brother, so I guess my purpose here is to live through this pain so that they can have their joy. I wish there was nobody holding me back.

Sorry if this doesn't fit, I just felt like telling someone.
