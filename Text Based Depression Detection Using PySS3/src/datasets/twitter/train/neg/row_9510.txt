Considering itWhen i was around 13 years old, my parents where getting divorced,in that moment it was just the worst thing that ever happened in my life, our whole buisness went belly up because of my dad, my mom and him always argued very strong, and my life was just a shit storm with no end, this was the first time i had considered it...but one cousin of mine was one step ahead of me. My grandma and i found her hanged in the bathroom, i just craped my pants, i cant remember much of that day, it devastated my whole family, i remember my mom hugging me and telling me to never make that stupid choice, and for many years, this event, my cousins death was just like my light in the dark, every time i wanted to end my life,  always thought about her and how it fucking teared apart my family. Its ben 14 years since that...and its harder and harder for me to stay straight out of that thought.
I have no girlfriend in the past 7 years, no one to cares about me, and for many years i just battled it, i told myself to just calm down, that someones coming, and yes, some girls have come, but its just been mean spirited people, some even more damaged than I am, i have this thought every day that I'm a horrible person. Any way, my life is just....empty, i wake up feeling like shit, feeling ugly, fat and dumb, then i look in the mirror and confirm it. I study music, and I fucking suck, for some time it gaved me the calm i needed, but now i just cant stand me, i study hard and fail so much, my teachers must hate me for sucking so much, i just have a hard time convincing myself to be better but i just cant, and thats the other thing, my music, since i started people where always surprised whe i told them that i study music, is just rare in my country, and some people always say that i will starve to death, because theres no jobs for that here....i have battled this with positive thinking and studying harder, but now....is just like a posible future and it freaking scares me, how can i be such a pussy. Anyway, i dont think i have the balls to do it, but somehow it freaks me out that after 14 years of my cousins death, i'm considering it again. And here I'm, sorry for the long text and my bad english, but if theres anyone there, i just need to talk
