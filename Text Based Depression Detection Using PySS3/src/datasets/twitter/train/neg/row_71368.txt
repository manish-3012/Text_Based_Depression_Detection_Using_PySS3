How to help a friendMy best friend recently got kicked out of college because of his mental health keeping him from meeting requirements. He just keeps getting hit with bad thing after bad thing and I'm so worried about him and his wellbeing. He's overseas and I feel powerless as far as helping him. I know there's no magic words I can say and make everything okay, but I also don't know how to express my support in a way that's warm and not cheesy and cookie cutter. I'd appreciate if anyone could lend any insight, thank you
