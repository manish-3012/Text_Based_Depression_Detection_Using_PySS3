Mind is stable I can go through with itSo prior to incident last year that destroyed my life I was mentally stable, strong willed and actually considered suicide because the depression was unbearable. A dark nasty gloom in my mind putting me in warlike conditions. A mental scenario of demonic darkness. I felt no emotion. My look in the eye could have killed a person.

Then last year this incident..
I became quite anxious reversed fearful and the thought of suicide terrified me. What about the pain, what about the consequences, what about the people who count on me and the list of concern is going on.

A person with such mindset can't possibly pull through something like suicide. Way to fearful.

But now it changed. It noticed my anxiety that appeared last year worsens when I take Tyrosine. I stopped taking it and there's this stoic calm again that I had in 2018.

Worlds of difference and what confidence it gives me. I have no emotions. That's the difference I think.

So I feel in a position that I could drive up there and do what I planned for quite a long time.

I won't quarrel about God,and faults of people and the possibilities of getting better and that there's more to life and bla bla bla.

I have had enough.
