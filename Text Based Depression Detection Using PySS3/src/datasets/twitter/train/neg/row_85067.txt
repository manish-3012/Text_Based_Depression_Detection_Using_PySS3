I used to be like you.You probably hear this way too much. But it gets better. I write this with a familiar pressure on my chest. But that's better than what is usually happening. I'm on my road to recovery and I don't want to go alone, join me. Find the one thing you love more than anything and let it make you. If you ever need anyone to listen to you, I'll be here.
