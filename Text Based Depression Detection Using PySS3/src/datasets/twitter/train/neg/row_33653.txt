i have no job no worth and i want to dieit's so fucked up that i'm only 19 and i still feel this way. i've had one 'job' \(test shifts only\) that lasted a few weeks and it was so stressful that i went home crying almost every day. i'll never get a job in a creative profession but that's the only think i'm even halfway decent at. my previous employer is right, i'm not going to have any luck with employment unless i can just magically fucking guess exactly what my boss wants me to do from vague instructions which isn't possible for me because i need things stepped out like i'm an idiot child \(i am an idiot child after all\)

i can't even cry right now because nothing bad's happening, mum just told me to try harder to get a job and that's reasonable because i'm one of those fucking losers that isn't trying because it's too hard. everything wrong with me is my fault but i can't do shit to fix it because i'm just a fucking nobody idiot.
