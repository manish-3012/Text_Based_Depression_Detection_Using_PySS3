I'm getting closer and closer to a suicide attempt, this would be my second...On 30/09/16 I tried to kill myself. I took several antidepressants (details in the link below), and whilst they made me very ill they did not finish me off. For the 9 or so months that followed that failed suicide attempt I was genuinely happy that I'd failed. However the last 2 months have been extremely difficult and I'm creeping ever closer to convincing myself to try again. 

In the last year I've lost my psychologist, she moved to Canada. I've lost my best friend, she's strangely decided that I'm the source of all her problems and is seemingly picking fights with me for fun. I was abused as a child, sexually, and my abuser is about to have his first child. I don't have much in the way of support, the NHS are aware of my situation but aren't particularly fond of providing me with any help. 

Long story short life was so bad this time last year that I decided to have a good go at topping myself, 11 months on life is considerably worse and I'm wondering if giving up on giving up was the right call. 

I'm writing this because... I have no idea. Drama. Attention. Pity. Help maybe. I hate myself and I really want to kick this breathing habit, so I'm not expecting anyone to turn my life around. 

Ps... I did an AMA 9 days after my attempt, feel free to have a read, it mate provide more context than I'm doing now.
