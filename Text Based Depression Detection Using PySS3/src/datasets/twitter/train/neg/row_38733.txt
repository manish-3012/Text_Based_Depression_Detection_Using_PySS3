I ruined a 13 year relationship with the 1 person I love most and all I want to do is slip awayI loved her for since I first met her. She means everything to me. I used to be happy but my last job changed me to an angry and cold person. I took my stress out on her and she didn't deserve it. Last week I told her that she is better off without me. She blocked me on everything and I miss her soo much. To add insult to injury, my dog hasn't been feeling well and I spent over $1000 I barely had just to find out there is nothing that can be done to make him better. What's the point? I'm alone and I want it to end so I stop destorying everything I love.
