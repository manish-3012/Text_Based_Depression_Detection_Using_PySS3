I truly want to die but I donâ€™t want to hurt othersI donâ€™t know what to do anymore. Iâ€™ve never posted on Reddit but I donâ€™t know where else to go. Iâ€™ve been suicidal for years, and I feel very ready to die. No fear, no desire to live. But the one single thing stopping me is that I donâ€™t know if my family could ever heal, especially my mom. I almost wish I didnâ€™t have them because it would be so easy for me to kill myself. Would they eventually heal? Even my mom who is very close with her children?
