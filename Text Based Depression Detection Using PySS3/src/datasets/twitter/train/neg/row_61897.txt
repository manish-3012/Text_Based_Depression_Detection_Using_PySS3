Toxic people:Toxic person:

"You're special if you stay with me but you're dumb and insecure if you don't. The only great people are the ones that endure the hardship of a violent and agressive relationship, or else go insane.

You're never going to make it without me you're nothing and you don't deserve my respect or the dignity of my presence if you go. 

You deserve better I'm sorry. Don't go, if you go you will just be a normie, someone forgetable and you will never touch someone's heart or feel love without me. 

It's just me and you against the world right? But I get to control what we do, and how we do it. Sometimes I'll let you make choices but they will never override my desires and if you don't do what I want I will abandon you.

FUCK YOU PIECE OF SHIT INSECURE WORTHLESS POINTLESS. I'm not sorry, we need to make up because I deserve forgiveness. I did nothing wrong you should apologize to me or I'm done."

"I think I want to die. "
