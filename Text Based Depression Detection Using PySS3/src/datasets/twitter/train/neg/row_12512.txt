I wish I was born in AmericaI saw a comment from someone living in the US saying that all British people are mentally challenged babies.

If I was born in America I wouldn't have low functioning autism and I might have a grasp of basic English instead of not being fluent in any language.

I cannot wait to kill myself because of my birthplace.  I would actually be HUMAN if I was born outside the UK.

Not being able to speak BASIC English, having low functioning autism, having bad teeth and being deformed make me want to kill myself.
