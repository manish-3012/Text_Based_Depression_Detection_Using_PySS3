I don't feel well... Insecurities drown me...I just feel too insecuree about myself, I am not sure what is my purpouse or if is it even worth the effort. Does somebody care about what I think or how I might get through that? I feel drowned. These thoughts and feelings just push me deeper and I want to feel good again. I need help or I may just fall even deeper as the months go on. I am troubled.
