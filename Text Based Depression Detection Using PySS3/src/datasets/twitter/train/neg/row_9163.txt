I would never kill myself, but I have suicidal thoughts constantly. How do I make them stop?The woman I'm in Love with left me almost 5 months ago now...and I'm still extremely messed up over it. Most of the time I can fake being fine well enough that I believe it myself, but some days I just can't do anything. 

I have a few things that make me feel better, but almost regardless of how I feel I see ways I could kill myself constantly and it's always something burning away in the back of my mind. On bad days sometimes as the train I take to class approaches I find myself imagining how easy it would be to just take a big step forward and be done with dealing with everything, on a very bad day sometimes I see it happen in my head very vividly. 

But as much as I feel ignored by people around me I also think of the people who would miss me and the fact that even though some things are really shitty right now I have good things going for me...I don't think I would ever actually be able to do it thanks to that.

But I still have these thoughts all the time and it scares me. Does anyone have any advice to help stop this?
