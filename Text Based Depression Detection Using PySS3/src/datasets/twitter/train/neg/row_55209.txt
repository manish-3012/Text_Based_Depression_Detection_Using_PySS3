Pushing people away is fun!!I love this! I never thought itâ€™d be so easy! Just basically be a bitch, and thatâ€™s it.




Yesterday, I pushed my mom away by yelling at her for throwing away my money(it was a check; on the seat of my car...made her feel like shit). Iâ€™m pushing my â€œfiancÃ©â€ away by threatening to leave his house. I hate my dad already, so yeah...just basically tell him....





I know I sound bad, but itâ€™s actually working. Maybe I can get all my â€œfamilyâ€ to hate me even more...my fiancÃ©â€™s family hates me anyway, so they donâ€™t have to be pushed away as much.



Then Iâ€™ll kill myself once thatâ€™s done. Iâ€™ll be dead, and then nobody has to worry about taking the trash(me)out. Iâ€™d be dead. The coroner would show up, theyâ€™d do something to me, and Iâ€™d be dead and free of living. Have tears in my eyes just thinking about it. How happy it makes me. I just want to be alone when I die. Have no one there.


Iâ€™ll be as cold as I was when I was alive. No one will give a single shit. Iâ€™ll be dead. Dead to people who *used* to love me. Iâ€™m better dead, anyway. Canâ€™t be mean to anyone. Havenâ€™t gotten any good Karma. Been trying to change that, but people still see me as a bad person, so I will always be a bad person. Gave up trying to change that. Nobody will ever love meðŸ–¤ I wasnâ€™t meant to live a successful filling lifeðŸ’•
