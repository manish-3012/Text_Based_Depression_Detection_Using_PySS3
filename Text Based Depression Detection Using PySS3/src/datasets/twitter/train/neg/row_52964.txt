JUST LET ME FUCKING DIEIâ€™m sick of it. I feel like shit all the fucking time, my schoolwork is suffering, and thereâ€™s nothing for me but my friends and family. I donâ€™t want them to suffer, but I hate it. I just wish they hated me so I could go in peace without a bad conscience. I know that seems incredibly selfish to all the people on this sub that donâ€™t have that and it probably is. But I canâ€™t tell them about anything. Nothing fucking helps. From gaming to drawing to reading, Iâ€™m just fascinated for a few weeks then itâ€™s just same old fucking sadness. â€œJust eat better, get more sun and exercise moreâ€ yeah like that shits gonna help. I already eat like fucking shit because I use food to help cope, itâ€™s either too much or too little and extremely unhealthy. But I donâ€™t give a shit no more, no fucking point in trying. And I donâ€™t see how sitting outside will help with anything, I want to die, hows being outside all the fucking time gonna help? And for the exercise thing, I canâ€™t do sports for shit. Pe is the worst time of the week for me, Iâ€™m so fucking sick of being mocked because I canâ€™t do anything as good as anyone else, I wish people werenâ€™t so idiotic as to measure worth in athletic ability, I wish I wasnâ€™t overweight and ugly as fuck. But no way to change that without being mocked by others for even trying. And therapy costs a fucking ton, I canâ€™t be a financial drain on my family like like that. I think I deserve to suffer with all this because of how fucking selfish I am, having thoughts like this while others struggle much more. I canâ€™t even fucking punish myself through self harming anymore because of how much of a pussy I am because I find explaining away the bruises difficult. I just want to die so I can not suffer anymore, but I donâ€™t want to do it myself because Iâ€™m too much of a coward for that. I just wish I could go with knowing that the people around me wonâ€™t suffer, but I know how much itâ€™d screw them up so it just constantly feels like Iâ€™m suffering just for their sakes. While I know how much they would suffer at my death, have they considered how much i suffer staying alive for them? I just wish I didnâ€™t want to fucking die, I wish I could just be happy.
