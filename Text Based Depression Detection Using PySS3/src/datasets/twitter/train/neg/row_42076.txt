Bit overwhelmed and not sure what to doLast night though I ran into a situation which I don't really know how to handle.

I'll provide some back story and I appreciate any advice I can get. I started dating this girl a little over 3 months ago. Yesterday she sends me a text saying she wanted to take a break. I'll spare the conversation that followed, but she basically had lots on her chest, I listened and suggested we perhaps talk later (I was going out to dinner with a friend for his Birthday). Later in the evening she sends another text asking me to come over.

I end up going over to her place after dinner, she is a complete mess. She starts crying and telling me how she just doesn't want to live anymore. It takes an hour or so before she even answers why. She basically tells me she feels very alone, suffers from horrific nightmares about her father (he committed suicide) and just doesn't want to do it anymore. She admits the last few weeks she'd come home and start drinking and smoking (she didn't smoke when we first started dating) and most recently started cutting herself.

I've actually been there myself, I have a noticeable scar on my arm which I've always joked was from a pirate fight, I'd never told her this (or anyone besides immediate family), but I tried to connect with her on that level, explaining I myself had been there, I'd wanted to kill myself and I'm glad I didn't. It didn't seem to help much, so I ended up just holding her, trying to make her feel better.

Not really sure what to do from here. She isn't open to therapy or medications. She said they haven't worked in the past. I'd really like to help her, but honestly, I don't know if I can go back there emotionally myself... and I think what has happened last night, in my mind has ended the relationship. I can't break up with her though, I'm scared of what that might do. If she feels alone with me, I can't imagine how she'd feel without me... 

I really need advice.
