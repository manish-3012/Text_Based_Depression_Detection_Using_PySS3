i canâ€™t remember a day this year where i havenâ€™t thought about suicideand itâ€™s at this point where iâ€™m done with everyoneâ€™s bullshit lies about my life. i know for a fact itâ€™s not getting better, thanks for the nice lie though. nobody knows me inside at all. i donâ€™t think i can go on any longer at all. no one knows whatâ€™s going on in my mind or actually knows whatâ€™s wrong with me. the only thing thatâ€™s making me slightly temporarily happy is my siblings, food and music. but i canâ€™t be happy. i donâ€™t even understand how people can live normally, iâ€™m so far away from normality. iâ€™m at this place in my mind now where i canâ€™t imagine living or a future for myself but i donâ€™t have the tools for my plan. living is literal torture. thinking and having my brain is complete and utter torture every day. my days are numbered. i canâ€™t wait to die finally, when the time comes.
