killing yourself without hurting peopleis impossible, i know, but it feels like a rock and a hard fucking place. it's darksided to hurt people by commiting suicide, but if there weren't anyone in my life (or, at the very least, that i was living with) i would be so dead by now! i want to fucking die! i don't
want to hurt people, but most of them don't even care because i am so damn unlikeable and most especially when i'm depressed. i hope i die in my sleep. i hope a trade places with someone who deserves life. i hope i can finally reach a point i can kill myself without the comsequence of people hurting.
