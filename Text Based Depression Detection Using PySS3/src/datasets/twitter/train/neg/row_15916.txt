Probably going to delete thisBasically, I have had thoughts relating to suicide for several months to a year now. I went from being legitimately suicidal, to being a teen with occasional suicidal thoughts. I am not currently in danger, but I wanted some help. I frequently think of what would happen if I killed myself. I think of the personal experience,  the pain, the person that finds me, the people that may or not care about me, how it would affect family and friends, does it make me go to Hell, etc.

Is this something to be concerned about? Again, this may be deleted to cover up my emotions, but I wanted to get some help first.

Thank you all.
