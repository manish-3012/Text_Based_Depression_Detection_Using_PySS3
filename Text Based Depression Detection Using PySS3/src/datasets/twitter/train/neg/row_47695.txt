I'm stuck and unmotivated to do anything.I attend school but i just can't get myself to care enough about it. I think I might have figured out why though, I know deep down inside I'm probably not going to live an entire lifetime, I'll probably end up just like my friend a few years ago who committed suicide. But I can't do it because I know how it will affect my mom. I recently have been put on lithium and I'm hoping that it helps with this, but I have a feeling it won't. I have bipolar disorder, but I have been faking being happy for throughout the day that sometimes I realize that I feel like shit, but I can sure fool just about anyone that actually meets me. Most people think I'm doing completely fine, but I'm a horrible wreck hiding myself for as long as I can.
