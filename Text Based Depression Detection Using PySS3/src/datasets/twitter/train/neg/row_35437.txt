This is the endThanks to everyone on this sub and generally the Reddit community for being so supportive of me. My time has come. Depression has taken everything from me.

I gambled all my money away. I have no friends and I'm always lonely. I hate my job. I don't care about anything anymore. Depression has taken all my interests and hobbies. My heart hurts when I think of everything I've loved and how apathetic I am right now towards all those things. I've tried everything, both medications and holistic/homeopathic treatments and nothing has worked. I've tried Prozac, Zoloft, Cymbalta, Lexapro, Venlafaxine, Xanax and many more. Right now I'm on a combo of Cymbalta, Abilify and CBD. I am dead inside, nothing is working for me. Nothing. I've tried all kinds of bullshit such as therapy (biggest bullshit of them all, absolute scam, and i've been to many different therapists before coming to this conclusion), massage, vitamins, supplements such as zinc and gaba, yoga, sports and even fucking colon cleansing. Imagine shoving water up your ass because you don't want to be depressed anymore haha. What a loser I am. I've tried "positive affirmations" which only made me feel like shit even more (repeating a particular mantra for a particular number of times, everyday) because I was lying to myself. "I am good". "I feel better every day". "I am self conscious". Fuck off. I'm not good
I'm not better. In fact, I keep getting worse and have been slowly getting worse for the past five years. Nor am I self conscious, at this point my consciousness is so low that it's barely even existent. I can't lie to myself anymore. I can't do this anymore. I can't live in such pain anymore.

Thanks for bearing with me. I hope you will all be able to recover and fall back in love with life because there's clearly no chances for me.
