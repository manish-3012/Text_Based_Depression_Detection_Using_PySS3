I'm such a waste of spaceI honestly think it would be a relief to everyone if I just died, I'm too much of a burden on everyone and I know that for a fact cause everytime I get to close with literally anyone they abandon me. I need to find meaning or I'm gonna blow my only meaning out the back of my head.
