The thoughts are back as usual.Iâ€™ve managed to cut so many people out of my life. Whether on purpose or not, whether I cared about them or not, Iâ€™m 31, 2 years sober. Been actively trying to date for 16 years. No success, no relationships, just rejection. I know what the problem is, and has always been. Me. Im an emotional tornado, and I will randomly destroy friendships because Iâ€™m a fucking loser, and they can do better. I havenâ€™t talked to a human in over 24 hours. Just responses to stupid reddit comments. If I died, it would be a while before anybody noticed.
