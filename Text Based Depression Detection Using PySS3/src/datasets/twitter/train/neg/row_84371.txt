I want to do it.I don't want to live in this world anymore.  Day in, day out, I get along with nobody and share no interests with anyone.  All I do is work and sleep.  I don't make enough money.  I'm fat, ugly, I have manboobs (gynecomastia) so a woman would never find me attractive.  No woman ever has either.  My family relations are superficial and empty and I don't really get along with them.

But though I WANT to be a man about it and just do it and free myself from the ball and chain of Earth and its gravity, I don't have any actual gumption.

I'm even banned from /r/depression because one of the moderators doesn't like me or thinks I'm too much of a downer or something, they won't tell me why they banned me.

Can someone give me an actual reason to live that isn't some bullshit contrived idiocy by some idiot that has never been miserable in his life but fancies himself a kind, charitable dispenser of sage wisdom?  I'm sick of the platitudes.  I want to die in my sleep because false hopes and instinct prevent me manning up.
