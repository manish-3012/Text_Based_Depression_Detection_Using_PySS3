Brother beat me to itMy brother took his life not long ago and all I can think is that he beat me to it. I have to stay now and lately that has been a tough fight. Iâ€™m 31 w a career thatâ€™s full of sick/death. I canâ€™t tell anyone close to me that Iâ€™m struggling because theyâ€™re still hurting from the passing of my brother. I want to stay and I want to be fine but lately the only comforting thoughts I have are ending myself as well. Iâ€™m just worried about family if I do. 
 Yes, Iâ€™ve been to counseling and Iâ€™ve even been in the church the past few sundays. Iâ€™m really searching but I canâ€™t find something to cling on to for me to stay. 
 I want to stay but Iâ€™m not sure how long I can hold on. 
 Iâ€™m only posting here because this is the only place I can really release these thoughts.
