Assisted suicide in GermanySo Germany passed a law that legalizes assisted suicide. Anyone knows how that works? Can someone physically healthy who isn't a german citizen get an access to it?

I presume not but would still like to get more info on it, can't find much online. Not really suicidal just interested in the topic. Its one of the things that happened without media coverage because everyone talks about covid.

Sorry if this is a wrong subreddit for this.
