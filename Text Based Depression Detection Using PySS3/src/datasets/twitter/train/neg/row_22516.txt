ConfusedIs it normal to hate yourself? When the lights are off and it's late I really hate myself. I think about all the weird shit I've done over the years and I start to think that I'll never have a real job or a relationship that's healthy. I feel like a burden on my friends and family. I go out and smile but I feel like I'm actually dying a slow death. My bills are out of control, I still hang out with my ex who I think sees a bunch of guys ( I know, super unhealthy), and my dog of 14 years is dying. Once he dies I think I might end it. Life isn't fair it just is. And what it is makes me feel horrible. I'm like 50/50 on this but once my dog is gone I'm not sure I'll make it much longer. Anyone else feel this way?
