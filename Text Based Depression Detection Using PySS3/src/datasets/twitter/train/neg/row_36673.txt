Cliched title hereA lot of SW posts sound alike. I don't want to be like that but don't know how to help but sound mopey and sad. I'm not. I wouldn't say I'm happy either. I'm just tired and emotionally and physically drained. But not calm though. Extremely hyper like I'm going pop a vine pass out and die. I wish I would instead of all this pressure. My stomach hurts I think it's my liver

I took a few more Prozac than I'm supposed to, finished the entire bottle. I think there were about 10 in there, hopefully that will be enough. I'm really sleepy but glad that it's happened and done with. I'd do it again if I had the chance

I think I should get to bed, I've barely slept. Goodnight
