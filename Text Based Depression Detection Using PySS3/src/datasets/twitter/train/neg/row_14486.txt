Would it be manipulative of me to reach out to my ex boyfriend for support?I want to die. But more than that I want him to hold me and tell me he loves me and cares about me, even though we canâ€™t be together. He wonâ€™t even talk to me. I donâ€™t want to spring this on him. And I wonâ€™t do it. Itâ€™s not fair. Itâ€™s not healthy for either of us. But I miss him so much. 

I wish I didnâ€™t mess things up. 
I ruin everything. All my friendships and relationships. My therapist said I might have BPD. Our appointments are so far in between :( about six weeks. I wish they were closer so I could have something to look forward to. I feel like I wonâ€™t make any progress. Itâ€™s so hard to find one you actually like and when that finally happened I donâ€™t even get to see her.

I want to live a normal happy life and keep trying but what if Iâ€™m never good enough? What if Iâ€™m not successful? What if I donâ€™t find my purpose? What if I just keep suffering?
