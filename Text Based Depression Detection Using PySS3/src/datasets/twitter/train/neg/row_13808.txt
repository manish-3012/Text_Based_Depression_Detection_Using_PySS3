How long does it take before acting on suicidal thoughts?I've been depressed for my whole life, and during that time I've always thought "I would never EVER commit suicide, I value the gifts I've been given too much (intelligence, and looks, although I don't get any female attention). And I don't want to hurt my family and friends." That was a long time ago however and I've recently realized that I've been "joking" and fantasizing about suicide more lately. I've also realized that any opinion and feeling, nay the very embodiment of who I am as a person is because of hormones and chemicals in my brain, and those things change. I guess what I'm asking is, did you guys think you'd never make an attempt at your life, and what have you done? I've never posted on this sub before so I don't know if this will raise any red flags or anything so I just want to add this disclaimer that I'm not going to harm myself, but if you want to talk to me, I'm down.
