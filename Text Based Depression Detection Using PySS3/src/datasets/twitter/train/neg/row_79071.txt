My sister, the mortician.Today, I received a text message from my old sister(She recently started her career as a funeral director/embalmer) saying that she has received a body that passed away from a self inflicted gun shot wound to the head. 
She needed someone to talk to, not because of the sight of the injuries, but because she was suicidal at one point and thought that it couldâ€™ve been her if she didnâ€™t think a second less to do it. I got pretty stunned when she texted me that it was a suicide victim, I wanted to ball my eyes out because it couldâ€™ve taken one more second and the person mightâ€™ve snapped out of it and couldâ€™ve been alive still. 
If youâ€™re having about suicidal thoughts, keep in mind that even the funeral home will even cry for you.
