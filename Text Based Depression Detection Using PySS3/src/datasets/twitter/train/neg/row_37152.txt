I Don't know?7? Months self harm free and the urge just gets stronger and stronger every day. The past few days I've just been shit... 
My family stresses me out especially my nephew (he's 12) My mum has full custody of him and he's told me to go kill myself numerous times.. I wish it was that easy.
My partners family stresses me out especially over the past few days. 
Stress is my trigger 
I just want to scream and cry. 
I live near the woods so I could go out and scream till I can't possibly scream anymore but the cops will probably get called...
My OH knows about my depression but he doesn't really know how I'm feeling at the moment. He would want to come over and make sure I'm OK but he's fucking annoying. He annoys me all the time by doing small stupid things. 
I don't even know where I'm going with the post?
