Anyone else suicidal because you feel like the ugliest person alive?I know it's ridiculous but l have BDD and even just catching a glimpse of my reflection in the window makes me want to die...I'm so tired of feeling this way about myself and the only thing thats keeping me from ending it all is that one day I can hopefully  get plastic surgery and transform my whole face so I won't feel repulsed everytime I look in a mirror. Pretty pathetic huh?
