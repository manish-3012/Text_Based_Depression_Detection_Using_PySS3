It feels like everyone is a stranger nowEveryone I was once close to, I feel like theyâ€™re strangers. I spent so much time with my now ex boyfriend that itâ€™s like he was the only one who knew me and the only one who made me feel at home. Now Iâ€™m completely alone and nothing/no one is helping. The day he broke up with me, he was already liking some girlâ€™s pictures. Iâ€™m so intensely depressed and I really REALLY want to die. Now.
