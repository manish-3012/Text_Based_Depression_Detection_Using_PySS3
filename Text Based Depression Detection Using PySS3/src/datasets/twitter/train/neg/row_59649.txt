How can I help my friend?My friend is bipolar a couple of weeks ago she said she thought she was getting manic. Instead she has plunged into horrible depression triggered by a guy she had a couple of dates with dumping her. She'd convinced herself it was going to work despite all evidence to the contrary. 

I'm in a different country and its all by text because she won't Skype me. She won't reach out to helplines etc. She's got a vague plan but not the means or a time. I'm not judging, I'm feeding her emotions back but I'm frightened and I don't know how to help her. 

Any advice?
