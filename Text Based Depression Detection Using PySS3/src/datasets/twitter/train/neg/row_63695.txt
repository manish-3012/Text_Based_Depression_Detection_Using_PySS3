I really canâ€™t take it anymore...Throwaway accountâ€” obvious reasons.  Sometimes writing this kind of stuff helps me calm down.  But I just have to say, I canâ€™t take being alive any longer.  I want to die, genuinely.  Thereâ€™s only 2 things Iâ€™d miss: my friends and my mom.  Thatâ€™s it, those are the most important things in my life but theyâ€™re still not good enough for me to carry on anymore.  I failed last semester.  I got put on academic probation.  I told myself Iâ€™d turn it aroundâ€” I didnâ€™t.  Iâ€™ll get kicked out of school now, and Iâ€™ll inevitably lose the friends I made there.  Iâ€™m still a total fuck up who wasted $40,000 and I donâ€™t deserve to be alive.  I wish every fucking day and night that I was happy and that I wasnâ€™t depressed and bipolar.  I had a bad manic episode last week.  Iâ€™d been hallucinating and was having difficulty distinguishing reality from imaginary.  My friends donâ€™t know anything about that, but they pulled this weird prank on me while we were all on FaceTime and it freaked me the fuck out bc I couldnâ€™t tell if it was real or not and I wanted to literally shoot myself in the head to stop all the paranoia spinning through my head.  I forgave them, why wouldnâ€™t I? Itâ€™s not their fault they didnâ€™t know.  Theyâ€™ll never know.  Theyâ€™ll only find out when my mom has to tell them I killer myself at my funeral.  I just want to go to sleep tonight and hope to god I donâ€™t wake up in the morning.  I hate my life and Iâ€™m sick of pretending that Iâ€™m enjoying it.  Every fucking thing triggers me and I start crying.  I HATE MY LIFE AND I WANT TO DIE. IM FUCKING ANGRY ABOUT IT.  WHY DO I HAVE TO BE LIKE THIS???  I know for a fact Iâ€™ll be dead after I get a letter home saying Iâ€™m expelled for flunking out.  If I canâ€™t go back to school Iâ€™ll hate my life so much more.  Being at home during quarantine is the worst thing that couldâ€™ve happened.  I thought I was finally getting the chance to rehabilitate.  I was wrong.  Iâ€™m better off without this life I was given and at this point I donâ€™t care if itâ€™s selfish.
