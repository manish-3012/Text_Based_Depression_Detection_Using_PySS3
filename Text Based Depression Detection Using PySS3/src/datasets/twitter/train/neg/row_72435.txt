Oh my fucking God!My little brother who I really love and rarely get to see refused to come over this weekend. I later found out why: because he's scared of me. Just for a background, my mom lost custody over him 9 years ago and I've struggled through so much mental illness since. I don't know if this was because of something I did or said or if this was because of something somebody else told him. But either way, I am so fucking devastated to hear this. I've got two options that I feel like doing right now: grabbing that .22 pistol and emptying a round into my skull turning my brain into a mush and becoming a ventilator bound vegetable for life or run away and disappear forever. I'm probably going to cut again for the first time in 6 or 7 years just to punish myself for being such a horrible person.
