In the middle of another low... I don't see why suicide would be a bad thing (in my case).In a shitty college with shitty people and I don't have the motivation to make myself feel better by joining clubs and finding new people.  I am on antidepressants and I am seeing a counselor.  I'd like to have a discussion about why killing myself would be so bad, starting with family.

I haven't been close to my sister for over 10 years.  She'll post on my facebook wall intermittently, but that's about it.  The last time I saw my biological mother was when I was in 1st grade (I'm 23 now).  She'll be okay.  I have two stepbrothers, but we aren't very close either.  My stepmom is great, but we aren't close.  My Dad has always been "there" and singlehandedly raised my sister in a foreign country (the US) with little money while studying full time for a JD.  He loves me, but I couldn't care less how sad I'd make him feel.

However, family isn't the biggest issue.  I only keep some contact with my best friends from high school.  The friends that I have in my current school have either also moved on (I'm going to be a super senior), or have weird quirks that keep me from being able to develop any deep friendships with them.

I am fully aware of what I have accomplished and I have accomplished some good things, but that is irrelevant given that I'm feeling shitty about my social life.

I guess right now I'm more confused about why I feel so rejected and lonely.  I just get the sense that the world would lose nothing if I ordered from cyanide pills and died tomorrow.  I'd definitely make some people sad, but they'll move on and that'll be that.  What would be so bad? Really, I am listening.
