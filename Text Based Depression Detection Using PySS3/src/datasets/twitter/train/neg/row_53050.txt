HelpI just watched a really triggering scene in a tv show. I wasnt sure if this was the right subreddit to post on but I feel so helpless. I dont think I really want to die, I just want to be saved. I want someone to need me alive and to tell me that. I can't do this on my own. At the end of the day I don't know if I can be saved, I just can't keep living like this. There's nobody I can talk to about this without feeling guilty. I'm sorry.
