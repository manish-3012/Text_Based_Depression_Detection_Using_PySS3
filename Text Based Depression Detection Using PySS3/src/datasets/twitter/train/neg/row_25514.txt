As a suicide survivor..Is this the appropriate place for me to be saying this? Because I haven't found any other place on reddit that fits the bill. 

Let me fill you in.

I'm one of five siblings. Nearly two years ago the only younger sibling I had, my little brother, hung himself. 

Not to go into to many details but there were many points of view about the world that my brother has that I became aware of and independently shared.

First was the idea that everything about us or that we do is insignificant because of how expansive and magnificent the universe is.

The second I feel is that ultimately our world is in trouble,  but that there isn't much we can do about it at this point. We lost. This may be a bit reaching on my part but I know he was very environmental and politically dissatisfied to the point of protest in the state of things. 

In the nearly two years since his death I've had some troubles. Legal and otherwise. But ultimately the reason I make this post is due to one single belief. 

Everything about my existence is self contained. And all of it ends the second I do. People ask l, "How would so and so feel if you died?". My answer, "I won't ever know, because as soon as I die there is nothing. ". 

It has made the idea of death more comfortable. And in turn,  more appetizing. It's an option that becomes less frightening and more welcoming. 

That's all I have to say at the moment. But its ever present in my mind.
