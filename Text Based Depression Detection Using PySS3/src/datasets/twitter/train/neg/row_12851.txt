Here it Goes for the Whatevereth Time.No more friends. My endeavors are a joke. I sleep way too much followed by not near enough. I don't even feel like I'm a part of my own body anymore. Everyone has moved on without me. As soon as I get the courage, it's over. That may be a while, so I'll try to hear some people out until then.
