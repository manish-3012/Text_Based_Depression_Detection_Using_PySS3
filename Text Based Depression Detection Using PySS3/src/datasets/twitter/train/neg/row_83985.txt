My girlfriend left and so did my will to liveSo a couple of months ago I got blindsided by the love of my life breaking up with me and I had to move out of her place. It wasn't that I did anything wrong just for her "the feels just aren't there" which I am really struggling to come to terms with. 
Since then I have lost all my motivation and interest in life. We used to work together too but I couldn't bear seeing her so I quit my job.
The only thing that gives me any kind of focus is researching ways to kill myself (which I have done a lot if). I have now got a very well thought through plan which leaves a tidy body and is peaceful and has a back up built in to increase the chance of completion. Knowing this has brought me some level of piece having an exit when/if I need it. 
At this stage I am not about to do anything because of the effect it would have on my family. Everyday though I regret not having already done it and wish that I had. 
I don't want a future that doesn't involve her and spend most of my day thinking about how I would do it and what letters I would write.

No idea what I am trying to achieve by posting but since I spent the whole day here I thought I should post.
