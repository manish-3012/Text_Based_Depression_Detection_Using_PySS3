[maybe urgent] a thread from /r/cringe was about some guy. Did some research...read insideHe had a reddit account less than 10 minutes ago. I clicked on one of his comments, which was in [this thread about his videos](http://fr.reddit.com/r/cringe/comments/3a1xpo/guy_explains_how_he_exercises_on_public_transport/). When I went back the account was gone.

I feel like this guy is not "just a crazy guy", after watching his [video on why he acts like that](https://youtu.be/ToLOQWkUeYY)

His reddit account [(now deleted)](https://www.reddit.com/user/Mangagaman) seemed to be old.

He speaks somehow about suicide in the video uplinked. Does anyone has a way to check him?!?
I tried to send a message on his OKC and Skype from what I found from google but no answer so far.
