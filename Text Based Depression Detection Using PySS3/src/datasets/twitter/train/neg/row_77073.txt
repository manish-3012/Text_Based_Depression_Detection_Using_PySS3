Please help; Intervention, trying to find substance/depression help for a friend who is on Medicare/MedicaidMy best friend's mother is having a hell of a time finding answers for her questions, as am I, so I figured I'd ask you folks. My friend is a redditor and knows my account, hence the weirdly-named burner.

My friend is on disability and has Medicare/Medicaid for insurance. She's also severely depressed and has expressed suicidal thoughts/desires. She also has substance abuse (alcohol) issues and her family is planning an intervention, but we can't intervene and give her no options for treatment, especially because we think she's a suicide risk.

She lives in Illinois; I'm driving up there this Thursday for the intervention.

Here are the questions:

* If we take her to the ER and she voluntairly admits herself, can she stay at that hospital, or will she be transported to the state hospital?

* What kind of detox/rehab options are out there for her? The Medicare website is ridiculous and I can't find any information. It'd be safer for her to do a medical detox, and she needs help. Major help.

* How to intervention? Right now the plan is that she comes over to my mother's (she knows I'm coming up for Memorial Day, but not of our plans) for the Champions League final on Saturday (she's a HUUUUUUGE Borussia Dortmund fan, that's how we met), and then after the match I'll take her "to lunch", but say I have to make a stop at her brother's house (where the intervention is taking place) and go on from there. Is this OK? Right now Dortmund is "her nugget of corn" (whatever that means) so match has to come first.

Please help. I've crossposted this in r/depression and here
