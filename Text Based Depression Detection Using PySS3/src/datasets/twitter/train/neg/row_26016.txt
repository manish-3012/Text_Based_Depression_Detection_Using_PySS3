I am going to jump right now and I am serious.Thats it guys, its happening, I can't just live a life like this anymore, I am going to jump from my apartments right now, its going to be enough just to kill myself. If you don't trust me, I can send you a picture from where I am going to do this. This might be a last post if I won't survive the fall. Goodbye everyone, see you on the flip side.
