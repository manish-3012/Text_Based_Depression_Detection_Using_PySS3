I'd rather be deadif I had to choose I'd be dead. if I could choose that's what I want. but I know if I fail I'll face thousands of dollars in debt (lol amerikkka) as well as losing my freedom for at minimum 72 hours. but no one tells you how to stop being a worthless piece of shit when you've supposedly done everything right but no matter what you're still nothing to anyone else, you're just supposed to suck it up no matter how useless you are. if only I was dead.
