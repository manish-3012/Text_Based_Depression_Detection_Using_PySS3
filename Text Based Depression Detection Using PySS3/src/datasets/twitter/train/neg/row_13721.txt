advices?Reddit, I need help.

I am actually pondering on the pros and cons of a suicide, and the method.

I canâ€™t find a reason to go on anymore. I mean, besides hurting my relatives for a while, what will it do? The world will go on.

I donâ€™t even know why Iâ€™m this close to this, but for at least the last five months, every time Iâ€™m left with my mind, I go into a depression-like state. Thatâ€™s the main reason Iâ€™m reading in my classes and that Iâ€™m constantly playing video games. Heck, I even wait to drop from sleepiness before going to bed, because I donâ€™t want to have any time to think before falling asleep.

I canâ€™t just stop and think â€œright now, Iâ€™m happyâ€ anymore. If Iâ€™m not occupied, I go depress. I mean, I think Iâ€™m happy sometime, I went skiing lately with some friends, and itâ€™s been fun, or when Iâ€™m drunk or high, but godamnit, I pummel down to depression whenever I start thinking.

Iâ€™ve been faking a normal state for a freaking long time now, because I donâ€™t wanna worry the people I know with whatâ€™s happening with me, I mean, they got enough things to think about without it.

I might be a little attention bitch thought, but, I thought that before doing anything, I would ask the hivemind, since youâ€™ve been unknowingly helping me keep on for a while now. So please?
