No religion sucks reallyI used to be some kind of Buddhist, believed in reincarnation some other kinds of supernatural things. (Now I know that not all Buddhism branches believe in reincarnation)

Now I'm an atheist and am pretty sure I'll cease to exist than I die. I think, if I cease to exist anyway why to endure this painful life?

But I'm not about this.

I just feel is so much sucks I'm not a religious person, be it Christianity or some other thing that gives meaning to the life and allows to find comfort in it. I can't go back now to being religious, it so much sucks.

What do you think?
