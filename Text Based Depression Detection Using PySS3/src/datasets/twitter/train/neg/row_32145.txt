Who will find out?
If someone who is a parent attempts suicide but fails, will their childâ€™s pediatrician/school be notified? 

If both parents of the child have custody (not married), what happens to the suicidal parentâ€™s custody? Will they be deemed unfit and no longer have custody of said child? 

Is this the correct sub for these particular questions?
