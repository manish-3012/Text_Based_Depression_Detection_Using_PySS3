Preparations just in caseI bought food supplies for my pets and already have a plan how to secure fresh water for them. My cat is also an outdoor cat, so she will be more than fine. 
I love them, but I am affraid that my next panic attack may be my last one. I'm losing my mind.

And please don't tell me to visit a Cuckoo's Nest, because psych wards in my country look and feel like taken out straight from some horror movies. 

Not to mention, it's a very religious country, so I don't wanna hear how ungrateful I am for giving up on God's given life or that there are many really sick people who wish they could live.
