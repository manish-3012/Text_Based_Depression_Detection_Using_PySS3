There's really no point.I see no reason in going on. Everyone hates me. It's evident from the way people react to me in public (though I just mind my own business and try to be nice to people) and online, too. You can check my post history, the things people have said to me on my post on r/amiugly. My "friends" don't care, they just put up with me out of pity. There's no good reason...
