Slowly im doneI've been pushing myself forwards since years, but slowly i really think im done.

I never learned to be happy. No one ever acted like it was of any significance how i feel, so naturally i learned that i was only valued for performance. So i perform on quite a high level, 2 university degrees and a nice stack of cash and beeing in great shape, but honestly im lonely and miserable. Never had any true friends, never had a real family, never had a relationship, never have i been happy, all i have is depression and suicidal thoughts.

If a train would run my over, it would be the best thing that ever happend to me.
