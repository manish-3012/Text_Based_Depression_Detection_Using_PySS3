I can't keep doing this.Ever since I basically flunked high school 5 years ago I've been stuck working shit jobs. I graduated but I'm missing a half credit to get into college.

I don't want to live like this ever since that one teacher who hated me robbed me of my future. I honestly want revenge against him.

I think when I kill myself I'll make up something about him in my suicide note. You can call me a bad person but I could care less.
