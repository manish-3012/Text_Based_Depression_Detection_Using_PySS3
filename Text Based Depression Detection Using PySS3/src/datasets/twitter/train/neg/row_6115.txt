Its 3:09 in the morningI just want to end my suffering, why am i up this late i hear you ask, im thinking about all the possibilities that could happen in the future and none of them are positive, im at that stage where everyone and everything is so distant from me, this may be a midnight blur but i just want to commit suicide already

But im just to scared to do it, and if i were to attempt it and fail i feel like i could never try again
