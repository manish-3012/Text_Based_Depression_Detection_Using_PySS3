Listen up people..Guys its been 4 months since I started crying. I am so lonely so alone. I dont want anybody. Suicide is the solution but I cannot do it. My parents guys my parents. I dont want anything Ive lost my faith. Please someone say I umderstand you. I have to die. I am powerless. I cry everytime and getting more angry. If a happy person suffers from something I feel satisfaction. I am ugly as hell guys. If I like someone she doesnt want me. They dont like me. I cannot smoke pot. Fuck man fuck I AM HOPELESS.. PLEASE CAN ANYONE KILL ME? I WILL GIVE ALL I GOT. I wish my patients wont be sad when Im gone. Hit me with some 7.62 or 50cal for precision.. Guys please I am begging please please
