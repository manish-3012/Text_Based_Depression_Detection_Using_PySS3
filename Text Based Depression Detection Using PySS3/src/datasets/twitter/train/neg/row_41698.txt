No more hurtIf things do not go well this week, I will be ending it all for sure.  nothing has given me purpose. All people want to do is hurt me and I'm tired of that. 

I can't deal with life anymore. I'm hurting and no one gives a fuck about me. All people want to do is hurt me

Edit: I'm still here, surprisingly. Woke up disoriented and extremely nauseous. I'm afraid my method didn't work
