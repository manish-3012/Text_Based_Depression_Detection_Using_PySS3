It's so sad the fact that my depression led to suicide being the only thing I want to do now.I've been in bed for the last 36 hours, doing nothing, eventually watching the AGDQ. Sleeping and watching how every single person I like or even love are doing better and better. They were my only reason to live, but they don't need me anymore, as they are doing better and I feel, more often than not, being USED when people need to feel better.

Everything that I ever said to these people, I feel it with my heart, but nothing ever moves forward.

I selfharmed for the first time a day ago, I really wanted to feel something. Anything. A desperate call for atention, not from anyone but myself. 

Needless to say it didn't work. I don't feel bad for doing it, they aren't harmful at all.

No more gibberish, you all probably read a lot of these a day. So that's it, I just want to end my life and dissapear from everyone's lives.
