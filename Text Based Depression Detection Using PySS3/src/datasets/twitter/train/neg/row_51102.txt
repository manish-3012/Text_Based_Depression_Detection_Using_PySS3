Please help!I know this community doesn't allow pro suicide threads, so I'm not going to discuss that. Let's say that theoretically, you only had 2-3 months to live because you are dying of a terminal illness that does not affect your physical health, what can you do to help people? You have no money or worthy skills that you can share. Is there some good you can do in this world that would actually be meaningful and impactful before your time is up? I'm looking for the most impactful things that someone can do in that time that don't cost money and don't involve required skills.

Thanks in advance!
