I was too afraid (wtf did I just do??)I almost did it. But I was too afraid. I was there with the thingy around my neck. (I did this in anotger way but won't go in details). I was scared. I am scared.

I let my body weight do it's job. Then I starts imagine what I'll look like when someone finds me. Originally this was just selfharm but escalated bc my feelings and thoughts came over me.

I suddently panicked and took it off my neck. I got air into my system and then realised what I did. Broke down bc there's no escape. I can't die. It'll break my family.

Don't know if it's a suicide attempt or not, but I don't know where to put this.
