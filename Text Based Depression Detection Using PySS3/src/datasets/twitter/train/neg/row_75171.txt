Itâ€™s my 21st birthday on Sunday and Iâ€™m 90% sure that itâ€™ll be the day I finally kill myselfIâ€™ve had so many problems for so long and theyâ€™ve only gotten worse in the last few months. Iâ€™m starting to get the help but it just feels too late for me. Iâ€™d rather the time and resources of the NHS go towards someone who has a chance instead of a waste of space like me. 

To me, thereâ€™s just something poetic about dying on your birthday.
