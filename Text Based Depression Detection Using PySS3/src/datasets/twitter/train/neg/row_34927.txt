Anyone else listen to music about suicide when theyâ€™re feeling down?I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s healthy to do this but Iâ€™ve been listening to Suicidal Thoughts and Everyday Struggle by Biggie a lot recently. The songs lays out so many of the emotions Iâ€™ve been feeling about my own life - that Iâ€™m a disappointment to my parents, that I donâ€™t want to be alive anymore, that I just wanna â€œslit my wrists and end this bullshitâ€. So much music is talking about relationships or money or parties, and none of that interests me.

Why seek out a relationship when Iâ€™m going to be dead soon? Why should I think about money if it has no meaning after youâ€™re gone? Why give a shit about parties when all I do is get too high and drunk and just fall asleep or throw up? Itâ€™s nice to hear some artists feel the same way I do and have the balls to talk about it. 

Any other good songs out there about suicide?
