Self loathingAnother post today! Woohoo.

I hate myself. And I would appreciate it if people stopped lying to me about it and just admit they see the flaws that I do.

For starters, I am grotesquely ugly. There are a lot of factors that contribute to this outward ugliness, most notably being my nose and body. I also hate how I can't talk to people and it's ironic because I am hyper-empathetic, but can't connect with people. I just literally have no idea what to say.

And people tell me that I'm not but their actions tell otherwise. I'm literally always the last kid to be chosen- it happened today in my school club. We were doing introductions, and I was the last kid to be called on and I wasn't even called on. Someone said that they thought we were done, and someone else checked the numbers and said that there was one more person. It happened in gym class a lot too.

I just don't have worth like others do. I had ambition and dreams but now I'm taking it day to day. 

I am a let-down. A failure.

I am not who my parents wanted me to be, nor am I what I wanted myself to be.

I think about sitting down at a table with my younger self and imagining how she would feel. How disappointed she would be. I am not a straight-A student. I am not popular. I am not cool or the head of the cheer team. I'm just me. And sometimes that's exhausting.

I don't know. I feel that I am caught in this cycle of self-pity and I feel ashamed of it. But by directing all the anger onto myself- the rest of the world feels more bearable. And maybe one day I can change who I am. Easier said than done.
