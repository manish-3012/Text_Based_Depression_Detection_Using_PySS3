It was a short, but interesting rideI cant handle it anymore. Im on Vacation with my incompetent and depressed Parents and i just cant handle all the stuff theyve been doing lately. Im almost raising my little brother alone leaving NO time for myself. i know vacation and beaches are something for relaxation but its doing the exact opposite for me. At least i know that if im gone no one will care. maybe some friends for max 2 days. thats it. Fuck me. Im sorry bro i could only get to know for 6 short years. ill miss him the most and he will probably go insane without me. im sorry. i know its hard. fuck me. my mind is going insane. fuck. fuck. fuuuck. the only thing stopping me is him and i will keep fighting just for him. but its getting hard. really hard. harder everyday to hold onto my miserable life.

Just had to get these thoughts of my mind.
