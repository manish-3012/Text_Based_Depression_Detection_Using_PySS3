I am having a lot of troubleI have been threatening suicide for the last 15 years or so. I tried probably 10 times and failed, and things eventually got better, and I was glad I failed. 

I really don't feel like I'm going to get better anymore. I'm on a crowded train trying to hold back tears, and this has been my life for the last year. 

I'm so sorry I was an alcoholic. I wish I got therapy sooner so I wouldn't hate having sex with someone I love. I wish I went to the police about my rape and I wish I told them the truth the night they came from a domestic disturbance complaint. I wish I studied more and I wish I spent meaningful time with people instead of being sad or pissed off all the time. I just get meaner and sadder and I am barely holding it together again. 

I will not go to a hospital and be stripped down to check for razors or drugs, when I need help for being sad and lonely and stupid. I'm sorry.
