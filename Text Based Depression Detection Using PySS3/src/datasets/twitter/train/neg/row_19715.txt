Why I cannot sleepI wrote about every soul I touched. Every skin I felt. I wrote about every eyes that sparkled with happiness, with sadness, with fresh tears. And somehow I was so filled with happiness and sorrow I didn't have enough pages to fill them with. It wasn't selfless, it was selfish. 

I wrote about how their hearts broke and mended and broke again because I wasn't looking their direction. 

I wrote about how everything I touched, I left marks, as deep as the scars on mine. 

I wrote about love beaten and battered. I created a victim of the people i touched and suddenly I was a monster even I couldn't escape. 

Maybe that's why I can't sleep.
