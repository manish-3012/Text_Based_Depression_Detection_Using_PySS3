Does anyone else feel like their suicide is inevitable?I've been suicidal since at least age 12. I'm 23 now. Ar first the thoughts were few and far between, then more frequent, more and more. I've alway known when I kill myself I'll write some letters first to my friends and family. I knew if I didn't write them I wouldn't kill myself. But lately I can't stop thinking about what I should write. How to have my family find them. I want to stop thinking about it. But step by step I keep getting closer. It might not be today.   It might not be this decade. But eventually. Preeeeetty sure. Anyone else feel like this?
