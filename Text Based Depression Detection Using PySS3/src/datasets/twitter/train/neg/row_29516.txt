I'm genuinely afraid for my brother.He's only 16 and he's talked about killing himself. He's been very moody and sharp lately when normally he's a fun loving jokester. He's talked about being a burden to our family and always wants to be alone.

I have a huge suspicion as to why he's so depressed. The problem is, the reason why is going to be a post on /r/raisedbynarcissists *real soon*. I completely understand why he feels like this, too - if it weren't for that whole self-preservation instinct thing, I'd share his sentiments too. But it doesn't seem to matter what I say to him - he tries to ignore me when I try to talk to him or spend time with him. I'm scared for his wellbeing. And I don't know what else to do.
