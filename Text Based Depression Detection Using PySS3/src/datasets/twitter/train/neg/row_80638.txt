19f, going to therapy tomorrowOkay gonna keep this super short but Iâ€™ve been struggling with mental issues since I was 11, Iâ€™ve attempted 4 times and Iâ€™m just really a fuck up at this point. I havenâ€™t graduated high school due to it and the past two weeks I lost control and ended up at a and e twice in a week to see a crisis nurse. Iâ€™m seeing a psychiatrist for the first time tomorrow (Iâ€™ve only been to counselling and youth therapy) and Iâ€™m fucking terrified. Iâ€™m getting diagnosed for the first time (possibly borderline personality disorder) and I kind of donâ€™t want help. I reached out for it but now that itâ€™s happening, I donâ€™t want to go because I donâ€™t want to admit that Iâ€™m fucked up. I donâ€™t know what to do
