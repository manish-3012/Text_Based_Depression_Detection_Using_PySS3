Sad downfallIâ€™ve been looking through this subreddit for a long time. Iâ€™ve noticed that people comments used to be full of love and support. Now itâ€™s comments from other suicidal people saying â€œjust do it and end the suffering.â€ These times are so hard and itâ€™s just heart breaking. The people here that used to rescue each other are now the ones crying for help, only to be met with â€œme too.â€ Itâ€™s the damn pandemic. Iâ€™m sorry it came to this. Iâ€™m not blaming the people who comment â€œsameâ€ and â€œjust do itâ€ because me too. I wanna just do it. And I understand why Iâ€™d want someone else to just do it too. I know dying is better than the suffering too. Itâ€™s just an observation, not hate. The frequency of posts increasing (at least to me it seems to be) is also just really heart breaking. Stay strong guys. Suffering is hard and I understand why youâ€™d want to do it.
