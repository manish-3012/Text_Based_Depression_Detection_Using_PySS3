revenge porn site anon-ib is ruining my lifeI already battle with being suicidal and having bipolar 2 disorder, but now my underage nude photo from high school has shown up on the site anon-ib. every time I email the website owner that it is an underage photo it gets taken down, and then someone else posts it again with my full name, town, school, and personal information. authorities can't do anything because it's based in another country. I can't believe I have to battle this and it heavily contributes to my suicide ideations on a daily basis
