Maybe I should convert to Christianity. Or start taking meds.I wake up, and I seek validation until the day is over. Until those beautiful hours of sleep, when my thoughts finally become unbound from myself, and I dream. I dream of beauty and of splendor, of hope and of love, but the catch is, I wake up. The memory of who I am sets my brain ablaze from the minute that my eyelids open, and the game begins anew.

The day is new, and I exercise. I run around my block like a madman and I lift my weights like a convict, looking forward to that moment when I can stare at myself in the mirror. I always hoped that one day I could wake up and never need to look in any mirror again. But that will never happen I don't think.

My day continues. I go to class, chasing this lofty ideal of academia and professionalism, but the truth is guys, that's not who I am. I am not some fine analyst of *literature.* I rush through my assignments and readings like a woman rushing through a blowjob. Even when I read for pleasure, it is a waste - I stare at myself in the mirror again, and as I gaze into my lifeless eyes, I wonder if they ever even looked at the words on the pages. But thankfully, that task is now over, and I can move on to the next one. It is now time for work.

I clock in, and I seek validation. From the big manager who drinks too much. From the medium manager who smokes too much. Even from the small manager who yells too much. I smile at the women, the old men. I even smile at most of the young men. All I hope is that they smile back. But do you guys know who I don't smile at? The hot young men. I'm scared of them. They know that they're better than me. they know that they're not gay. They know that they had a real childhood. And I know that they did too. So I hide and I cower, and I give them their change.

But, gentle readers, one day something very *different* happened to me.

&amp;#x200B;

One day at work, I walked up to a grassy hill on my break. I sat, closed my eyes, and meditated, because somebody once told me that was a good thing to do. While listening to the trees that I easily could climb, and while sitting in the grass that I easily could rip out, I heard something very *different*. I opened my eyes, turned my head, and was now gazing into the face of a thirty-inch brown falcon that was perched some fifty feet away. For the first time in my life since I was a young boy, I felt alive. I felt powerless. Deep down, I wished that this falcon would fly to me and rip my flesh apart with its talons, but it did not. Instead, it flew past me, into the sunset, letting me know that I was spared and could live the gift of life for another day. I was elated. I had discovered what it meant to be alive, to be a mouse, to be running away from a world of falcons. I really thought I figured something out.

&amp;#x200B;

The next morning, I woke up, and I looked deeply into my betraying, cheating, belittling, empty and gray eyes, to see if there was any new spark that could revive me from this delusional hell of vanity, self-obsession, and self-preservation. And all they told me to do was to run around my block again.
