Just failed another exam this week. I can't do this anymore.I just can't take life anymore. This week has been especially stressful, with a ton of exams and projects all within 2 days. I just did horribly on one of those exams and all I could think of while struggling with it was how I would commit suicide afterwards. I should be typing my essay now because it's due in 2 hours and my mental health has prevented me from doing anything useful, I think it's just better to give up permanently. I've been like this for over 5 years. Thank you all for reading this, I'm not certain I'll commit suicide, I most certainly want to, but I don't know. I'm sorry about this
