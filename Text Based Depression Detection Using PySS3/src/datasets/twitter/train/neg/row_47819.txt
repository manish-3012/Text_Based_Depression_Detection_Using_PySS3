I can't imagine ever being happyand that's why I'd rather die. For me to even have a chance at living a decent, normal life there's so much shit I'd have to work through first. 

The amount of things that are out of my control in my life is crushing, honestly. Social anxiety, depression, stuff that I can't really help but experience and I don't know how to even begin working through it. The issues themselves make it hard to work through. And there's more. Things I'd rather not talk about here.

So I'd rather just give up. If there were an easy solution to all of this, I'd use it. Only because I see no other way. I would love to progress through and get better, but I don't see that happening any time soon. The situation I'm in is just too fucked for me to come back from. 

I'll never get better. I wish I could.
