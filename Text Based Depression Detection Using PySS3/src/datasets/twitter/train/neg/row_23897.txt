Nothing to live forJust lost the only thing I had worth living for. Iâ€™ve been abandoned again, just like always. No one really cares about me. I knew I wasnâ€™t good enough. Iâ€™ve never been good enough. Iâ€™m so sorry but I canâ€™t take this pain. This is for the best 

Goodbye everyone, I doubt Iâ€™ll survive the night.
