I don't want to live anymore.I hate the sensation of simply existing. All I feel is hate and sorrow. I'm too much of a pussy to use a bullet, so I settle for a cigarette. I'm too stupid and lazy to go to college or get any kind of job that will pay the bills, so I just sit in my dad's house and take up space. I'm a leach and I know it, no matter how hard I try to convince myself that I'm the victim, even though my upbringing sucked. The pain is overwhelming so I numb it with alcohol and escapism. I don't know what will happen, and that scares me. I don't want to risk ending up like my family; drunken lazy fools. Suicide just seems like a perfect solution.
