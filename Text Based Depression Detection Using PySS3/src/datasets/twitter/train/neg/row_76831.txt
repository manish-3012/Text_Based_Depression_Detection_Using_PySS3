Guilt is the only thing stopping meThrowaway because obvious reasons, I'm 22 years old, I've lost everything I've worked for since high school, I lost my apartment, I lost my girlfriend, both of my cats, my trucks transmission dropped, I lost my job, I have no real line of support through any family, all I ever get is "I know it's hard but you'll make it through, you're strong" 
3 weeks ago I tried to hang myself, wound up on suicide watch in the hospital, prescribed Zoloft and ativan for depression/anxiety yadda yadda 
Anyways I started feeling even more restless and anxious about everything since I started zoloft, blurred vision, muscles cramping up, I'd get sweaty out of nowhere even if my house was cold, turns out these are "serious" side effects and I was told to go to the ER immediately. 
Well I guess it wasnt that fucking serious because I sat there for 4 and a half hours without seeing or talking to anybody, so I stopped taking them, but I still have a my bottle of ativan. 
I genuinely believe that the only reason I am not dead and writing this is because of the guilt, knowing how my few friends will react, knowing how my parents are going to feel regardless of how distant we are. 
I dont know what to do, do I go through with it and give up? I have no fight left, I have no desire to live. Please reddit, tell me what to do.
