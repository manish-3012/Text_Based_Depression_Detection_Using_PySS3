rantany small inconvenience just pisses me off too much, and it feels pathetic when people have actual much worse lives they have a much better reason to feel suicidal. I don't even have any problems in life except worrying about exams, education like many other people. it just fucking bothers me so much and I don't have any good hobbies or things I really enjoy. I couldn't really die because I would feel too bad for my mum, but I feel ill hit a breaking point in my twenties or something.
