"You should be in the hospital" yeah I'm still paying for the last time and that was 3 years ago, no fucking thanksIf you're gonna charge me almost $10,000 to survive then let me die in peace Jesus Christ. Last hospital visit when I was gonna kill myself just about ruined me financially so fuck that noise. Especially when a big part of why I'm suicidal in the first place is debt. So tell me how taking on more debt would be a good idea?



It's my birthday but I'm thinking about killing myself, how ironic
