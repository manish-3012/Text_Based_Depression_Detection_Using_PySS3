I feel like im losing my sense of self more per day And theres nothing i can do.Backstory. Im a crossdresser because my Biological Male parent Raised me as such to rape and abuse me for my life. I got abused for a while before my mother was able to remove me from that part. I never stopped dressing as a female though due to circumstances. I saw psychologists but never was issued one permanently As of now i have bipolar and depression diagnosis. Everyday especially now  like im becoming more violent to others. my boyfriend tries to show me love but i push it away. I keep feeling like nothing i do matters nothing i want means anything. I have no friends My family is all gone Im left alone with no job trying to get on disability. I feel like nothing is worth being alive for I feel like its all gone. I am here questioning if i should post because to everyone i interact with in real life i act calm and collected and fake everything. I dont know what to do anymore ive called hotlines for a while but i still dont feel like i can do anything I really dont know what to do anymore. Today has been my worst day so far though I've Chased the last of my freinds away Made my boyfreind question being with me got banned from a chatroom where i would put some sanity in and stopped talking to my brother. i just dont know what to do anymore. Its like my self is just gone and im trying to exist. Im posting to get some kind of help outside of hotlines or other things (i am trying to get a pyshcologist but thats hard with the healthcare system here) so i really have no idea what im doing anymore.
