Im literally worthless the only reason I was born was to be tormented. Sorry for the long post I donâ€™t have anyone to talk or vent to.I canâ€™t do anything. All I do is sit in my room and just watch tv. I live in the middle of nowhere Iv never had friends or anyone in my life outside of the people I live with. Even then I feel completely isolated at home. Neither of my parents did anything to prepare me for life. They let me do whatever I wanted which at the time was great but ruined my life. Now that Iâ€™m over 18 they just want to kick me out even if it mean me being homeless. Like how do you tell someone who has never went to high school a day in there life to move out. I canâ€™t even face people do to how retracted my life has been. I donâ€™t know anything and Iv never done anything. And Iâ€™m constantly reminded of that by my sibling who goes out of there way to tell me how worthless I am. The idea of leaving the house terrifies me. Even then like how? I know this is an overused and looked down upon saying but I never asked to be born. Iv been thinking about that a lot and itâ€™s just to perfect if a saying for me. I never asked to be my parents kid. 

I just want to be done with the pressure and be done with the judgment.  I donâ€™t want to live with it anymore.
