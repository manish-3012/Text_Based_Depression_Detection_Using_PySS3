I Don't Even KnowWanted to just vent about my thoughts and choose to come here. Some days i feel pretty well about life but then other days i just question whether or not things will go the way i hope they do. I've had thoughts like this before but for a time forgot about them but every now and then they come back like today.

I don't have many friends either I've lost touch with people or they've went ghost on me. The few friends i do have are a mix of regular and new ones. Had my heart broken over the summer and while i'm mostly over it some days it just bothers me that it didn't work out and i regret opening up to someone who didn't deserve it.

Have i messed up in my life before? Sure and i try my best to not repeat those mistakes and be a better person for it but sometimes feels like it's not enough. I have things that make me happy but on some days even those things aren't enough. 

I don't feel sad very often more of an empty feeling. I wonder if i ever did choose to end it all would this empty feeling go away? I don't know if i have the guts to do it. It would suck leaving my family and the few friends i have  behind but if i'm going to continue feeling this way long term then there's no point in trying anymore. 

I wouldn't even bother telling anyone if i was planning to end it. It would hurt too much knowing how'd they react. Most of my friends are mostly online so i doubt they'd ever find out and just forget about me after a while. I'd rather have them forget about me then actually know what happened might sound selfish but that's just how i feel.

It does feel a bit good to vent about these thoughts properly tbh i still have hope that things will be fine as time goes on but if they don't guess there won't be any choice left to choose but the last resort. Thanks for reading.
