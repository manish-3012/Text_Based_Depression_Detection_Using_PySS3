I'm really frustrated.I feel like my life has been an uphill battle for years now. Back in 2013 my younger brother killed himself. I've always had anxiety and I constantly dip into depression, so the realization that he was struggling so much and I hadn't been there for him has always bothered me.   


I dropped out of school, have struggled for years with manipulative figures in my life and a lot of bad decisions. Recently I found a way to go back to school and I've been picking myself up, but I always feel so lonely. I don't feel like I can talk to anyone in my life at this point. None of them make me feel better and talking to them always makes me feel pathetic. Many people in my life give me terrible advice or the way they support just makes me feel worse (despite their good intentions)   


Now this month I'm really behind on rent and terrified of being evicted. I feel like I'm going to ruin anything I've tried to build in the past year and I just don't know why I keep holding on. I have a family that cares and I guess I wouldn't want to hurt them, but I'm aware that that reason isn't really working anymore. The worse I feel, the less all the reasons not to hurt myself matter. I constantly think about hurting myself on a regular basis and I just don't think things will ever line up for me or work out.
