Self destructiveThis is just another rant. Nothing to see here.

Just being self destructive. Dont care to work out anymore. I still put on a smile and I can still crack jokes. Everyone thats close to me has an idea I'm in a mood and I'm trying to keep them at a distance but my friends and family know something up. 
It's no ones business but my own. But who cares. To be honest i dont care. 

I drink heavily now. I stay to my routine of work and then home to drink/rinse and repeat. 

But none of that matters.
I can sit here and mindlessly blab on the interwebs throwing caution to the wind knowing that is doesnt matter what I say. None of you will be able to rat me out. 

Eventually I'll peacefully fall asleep and never wake up. But that moment is not right now. Couldnt care less about your opinions for reasons of survival

In the mean time I'll continue to exist. 

I post here just to have an outlet of thought process. Just to see my thoughts in black and white and that helps me. 

I am not alone. I have a support circle. I just dont care. And tomorrow morning I'll wake up and suffer my thoughts some more. 

My happiest moment is the day I can finally leave
