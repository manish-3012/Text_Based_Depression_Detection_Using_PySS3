so tiredI feel empty. My body is heavy. I hurt. Does it ever get better? I've felt like this for so long...

I just want to disappear..Not force my family to deal with what I leave. A body. A funeral. The suicide of their daughter, their sister. Oh the shame... "What did we do wrong?"

I wish I had never been born. I want to be gone. But how can I put my family through that? Is it worth living just so they don't have to clean up the mess I will make?

I can't live. I can't move. I don't fit anywhere. I'm too socially inept, too stupid, below average. Please give me the courage to leave this, I can't go on feeling this way
