Is a missing persons better than a dead person? Please read fullI want your opinions about what you think would be more bearable for the ones around me, to think of me as missing or as dead.
I could skip town and kill myself or just kill myself here. 
Context: my father lives alone with me, the dead of his mother was really hard on him and my sister barely speaks to him; my sister and mother live together with my mom's boyfriend, my mom has a heart condition and believes she won't live to long, my sister is 19; my girlfriend is depressive, she takes pills to help her deal with that and even though she says she loves me very much, she wants to be with other people; I have two cats and I guess my father would either take care of them or give them away.
I just don't want to cause other dead because of mine.
