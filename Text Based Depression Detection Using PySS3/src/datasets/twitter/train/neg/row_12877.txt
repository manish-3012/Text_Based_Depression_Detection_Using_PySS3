I can't do this anymoreI wish I could stop crying over my friend for leaving even thought she promised she'd always be my friend and never leave me. I have a feeling she'll comeback since she told me she loves me but I can't do this anymore. Everyday I cry no matter what happens, I try taking to my friends over kik to distract myself but I'm afraid to tell them how I feel. I wish I had a friend, I don't want to be alone anymore
