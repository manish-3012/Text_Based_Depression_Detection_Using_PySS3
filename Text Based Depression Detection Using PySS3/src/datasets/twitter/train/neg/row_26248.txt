I'm determinedBetween August 2013 and June 2014 I was in a really abusive relationship.  It started as fun BDSM sex that was enjoyed by both Patrick and myself.  Then it got all about him.  Suddenly he was forcing me to deep throat him, rim his ass, lick his feet, and be whipped whenever he wanted.  I was expected to be available when he wanted and if I wasn't, I'd get beat the next time he was over (this happened once).

Through some weird psychosis, I developed deeper feelings for him, or I thought I did, and he cut everything off.  But I was left with depression and a huge hole.  I've never filed a police report because who would believe me?  27, white, big guy let a 24 year old abuse him for 8 months?  And since the relationship started out as BDSM....it's grey anyway.

I begged him for help.  I sent him emails begging to talk.  Eventually in December  I tried to kill myself, and I sent him this too.  I landed in the hospital, because he called a wellness check.  Then he filed cyberstalking charges against me.

In April 2015 I tried to jump off golden gate, and was stopped and hospitalized.  I sent that to him too, and he filed for a restraining order.

Because of the abuse and depression and suicide attempts, I lost my job and I chose to move out of the state.  But today I was forced to come back and be given a "deal" on the cyber stalking charges to get them dismissed in a year.  The deal made me admit responsibility for sending him emails he didn't like and forces me to enroll in a domestic abuser course.

I'm done.  I'm gonna go buy a case of beer, a hunting knife, and some sleeping pills.  I will die tonight, alone, in my hotel.

I just wanted to get my story out there, since no one so far has cared.
