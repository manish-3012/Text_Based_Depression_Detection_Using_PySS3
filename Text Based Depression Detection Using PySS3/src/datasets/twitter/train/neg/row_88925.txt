â€œFollow your dreamsâ€Donâ€™t worry thatâ€™s exactly what I intend to do tomorrow. Want to constantly deny me happiness then Iâ€™ll deny my existence. I wonâ€™t be like some of these 80 year olds that have hated themselves for decades but never took action. I wonâ€™t be one of these halfhearted attempts that get nothing accomplished. My familyâ€™s feelings will not chain me to this reality of destruction people call life. Perhaps it wonâ€™t work but Iâ€™m not one to give up very easily. And I understand encouraging suicide is a shitty thing to do, but whatâ€™s more insulting is people begging you to live in agony rather than be at peace. What is wrong with being at peace? Anyways...
