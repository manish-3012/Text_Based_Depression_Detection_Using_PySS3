I wish I never existedI wrote a long post but my computer turned off suddenly when I was about to finish it. It's like life is mocking me.

Suffocating, abusive family, abusive long\-term relationship, no license, no job, friends ghosted me after revealing my depression, childhood friend told me I have no real problems because I'm pretty. That really hurt\- that she would resent me so much for something so superficial that any sadness I feel is invalid. I'm desperate for independence but have no way out. 26 years old and tired of everything. 

Bf fluctuates between telling me I'm the best thing that happened to him and the worst thing that happened to him. i dream uselessly of someone swooping in and saving me from this situation but anyone who would help someone as useless as me is probably abnormal and would also grow to resent me. I'm so tired of being alone, tired of being the one who people come to for emotional support, but never having it reciprocated. I'm tired of being yelled at, tired of being scared, tired of crying, tired of being the emotionally mature one in this relationship. 

I can't get myself out of this hole. I have no more hope.
