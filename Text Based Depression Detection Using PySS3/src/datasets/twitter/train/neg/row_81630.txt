Being driven to suicideI think my partners negativity is driving me to suicide. It started months ago as depression but the past two weeks after reaching out to him for help, I get supportive remarks followed by negative conversation. An example that happened today was me asking him last week if he could help me get out of bed in the mornings if Iâ€™m not up. I only wanted him to make sure I wasnâ€™t laying down when he left for work so I could get my daughter to school. When I asked him why he didnâ€™t do it he said â€œI shouldnâ€™t be mothering youâ€. Far worse has been said the past few weeks but thatâ€™s what started this episode. He said him and my daughter are â€œliving around my needsâ€ because Iâ€™m in school. Last week when I was trying to open up and talk to him about my struggles he jokingly said â€œmaybe you should kill yourself alreadyâ€ and laughed. It isnâ€™t as dramatic as it sounds but since he said that I canâ€™t get it out of my head. He offers support but never gives it. And Iâ€™m quickly going down hill. I donâ€™t eat or drink water. I sleep maybe 4 hours a night. I havenâ€™t seen my friends in months. My grades are going down. And I have no interest in being around my own daughter anymore because I feel like such a burden. Someone help me
