every small inconvenience leads me to believe the only option is suicidei don't understand a math problem? if i kill myself i'll never have to do math again. someone left me on read? guess i'll kill myself. bad anxiety? suicide would be easier than recovery.

i don't have depression but i have really bad social anxiety. i'm 15, im not sure if i'll make it past that. everything pushes me to the edge (literally) and i hate it :(
