I don't have any positive thoughts or emotions anymore. My life feels completely meaningless... I think it's finally time.This has been coming a long time. I have been wrung out again and again for the last several years, and it feels now, more than at any other point, that my time is up. This is all I get. I made it through the holidays like I said I would, but now I have to face the reality that there isn't anything left in my life to make me want to keep being myself. Through my actions, I have given myself no reason to exist.

I don't like any part of who I am; I don't like how I've lived my life, even before things got really bad. I always had nondescript fantasies of being a successful, together person, someone who handled everything with finesse and intelligence, but I see now that was never a possibility. Even as a kid I was unstable, awkward, and obnoxious, I just wasn't self-aware enough to realize it then. After my breakdown several years ago, those traits have only grown in intensity, eating away at the parts of my personality I liked, my relationships, my efficacy as an independent person. Those are all gone now.

I simply feel defective now. I'm unattractive, I'm transgender, I have various other medical problems, I can't think clearly anymore, my personality is nonexistent, I have emotional instability problems that I can't even begin to explain or address properly, and I've defecated all over the opportunities my parents gave me to ensure a successful, happy life. I have nothing happy left, just anger, pain, anxiety, and a gnawing obsession with killing myself. I've fought to regain my life for too long, and all I've done is lost. Every battle just fed my suicidal thoughts, and we've finally hit the climax, the high point where all the anticipation pays off.

I'll be alone tomorrow. I think I'll do it then. I already have a spot picked out. Will emergency services respond if I phone in for myself?
