I don't really think I want to kill myself, but I'm a huge failure and I just don't see any way that this could end in a reasonable matter without me being goneI dont have a job and I live with my mom and my lack of income is a large burden on the household. Im 23 and I suck at everything. I'm not really depressed I dont think, I'm just like a 5-year-old trapped in an older mans body and I happen to see the writing on the wall....I think I'm wasting everybodys time being here, i have no discernible skills to make me valuable to this world and I'm wasting everybody's time, as mentioned earlier.

I spend the majority of my time playing super nintendo games, I live in this strange bubble where I've fulfilled everything I've ever wanted to do when I was 5, and I'm just realizing now how bad this life sucks for a 23-year-old. My time is  divided between street fighter 2 and masturbation, I'm a waste of space and I have no reason to be here. I live in the middle of woods and they call to me to hang myself and belong to a world where I can live in an afterlife that is better than this shit. I wantg to jerk off in peace without acknowledging this presence. I can't be here anymore
