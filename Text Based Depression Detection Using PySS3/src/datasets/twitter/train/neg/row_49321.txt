i just wanted to be lovedI have no hope anymore, im completely alone in the world. I lost all of my family, and now I lost the only person left that loved me. A few days ago he came back and told me he loved me again, now he says 'i dont think i love you anymore' im completely crushed. all i wanted was someone to love me in this world but im so unloveable. i hate myself and i want to be able to escape myself, i feel like death is the only way out.
