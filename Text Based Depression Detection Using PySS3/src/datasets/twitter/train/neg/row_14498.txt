I feel like I'm getting closer to suicide every day.I'm a 5"4, 115lb, 16 year old male. Currently in my Junior year in highschool. I'm a American-Filipino. I was born in the states and always thought I was the same as everyone else. I get discriminated every school day. Constantly being the target for being short and asian. I don't have any friends anymore because I switched to a different school. My classmates pick on me daily and I don't do shit to anyone.

I recently applied for a summer job at the school for the Tech Department. The job is basically cleaning computers and putting them back where they belong. Only a few of my classmates were choosen to apply including me. Today the interviewer told us who were hired. They were all hired besides me. I'm one of the shortest students at the school and I'm very confident that it was the reason that I was not hired.

That really took a blow on me because that job would've been nice to get some money/experience for future jobs. I realize that all these HR people and interviewers are full of bullshit. He says "It's not personal why you were not choosen." It was pretty obvious because of my height.

I know everyone says to ignore it and don't let it get to you. But when it happens on a daily bases for years and years and years, it really gets to you.

So I'm asking you Reddit, what should I do?
