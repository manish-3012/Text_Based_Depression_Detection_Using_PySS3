Itâ€™d be so easyI have enough respiratory depressants in my drawer right now to kill dozens of people, possibly hundreds.

I could create the perfect cocktail using massive amounts of opioids, benzos, ketamine, GBL, and to top everything off; beta-blockers so my body canâ€™t produce adrenaline to counteract anything.
