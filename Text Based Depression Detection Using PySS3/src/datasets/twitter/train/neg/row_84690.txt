No epiphany after a suicide attempt (graphic mentions of self harm in post)I see posts all the time that are like â€œI failed my attempt and Iâ€™m so glad! I realised life is so good!â€  
  
For me, just under 3 months ago I was in a psych intensive care unit where I had snuck a razor blade in and tried to sever my carotid artery. I missed it by 4mm and had emergency surgery on my neck at 4am. Prior to my admission to that unit I had also attempted my femoral artery and cut through the lymph nodes, nerves, sheath, muscle etc in my groin instead, missing the artery by â€œa stroke of luckâ€.
  
Anyway, for the last 3 months since being discharged Iâ€™ve never had a moment where Iâ€™ve been glad Iâ€™ve lived. Not a single moment. I wish more than ever I died at the end of August. All Iâ€™ve had since is more pain. More annoyances. More moments of isolation and loneliness. More hatred for â€œthe daily grindâ€ of getting up and working.   
  
I actually tried real hard after my attempt to better my life too. I took my meds. Went to appointments. Downloaded Tinder and tried to socialise with people on there (biggest mistake).     Took up more hours at work. Tried to be more charitable and help people. Tried to spread positivity.   
  
And it worked for a bit of distracting me. But ultimately Iâ€™ve never had that â€œomg Iâ€™m so glad I didnâ€™t die! I canâ€™t wait to live my life now!â€ moment. Sigh.   
  
Even worse is after an attempt everyone floods around you trying to support you but now 3 months on Iâ€™m lonelier than ever. Canâ€™t remember the last time I saw someone in person. People donâ€™t reply to me for days at a time. Iâ€™ve gained weight. Drinking alcohol more. Feel like everything is funnelling back into another attempt.   
  
Eh.
