Why should I care anymore?Two years ago, when I was a sixteen year old girl, I was a false positive for being suicidal, was shipped to my local ER against my will, and held overnight there. Back then, I was looking for someone (like a therapist) to talk to about this. I believe that whole incident made me 'Tip over the edge' and my depression has been getting exponentially worse since then.

Now I'm having an extremely hard time even caring about my own life. Like I never want to live anymore, I end up drifting between "I don't care if I die" to "Please fucking let me end my life right now!", and when I get to the latter moments, people I know say the same token, selfish, guilt-trippy shit that is located on the sidebar and similar things.

My life isn't that great right now, and depression and anxiety just makes everything worse. I just got to my University last semester and things have gotten slightly better after getting away from my parents, but other things began to take their place in that regard. And I don't even want to seek help anymore, because of bad experiences in the past and the whole corporatization of mental health issues to make good publicity and turn us into walking fucking billboards. (I personally don't like Bell doing this but if it legitimately helped someone who reads this, I'm sorry.) I don't know why I should even care about life or living anymore because I haven't seen anything good in the world and I don't feel like I ever will. Everything "Good" gets scooped up and turned to shit by *something* and it's just an endless fucking shit tornado.

TL;DR I've just basically gone extremely apathetic about my own life at the best of times and I'm wondering if there's any reason *not to be*.
