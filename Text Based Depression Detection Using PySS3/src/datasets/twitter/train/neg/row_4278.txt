Fucking shit canâ€™t handle thisI hate doing this I just feel like the only end to These worries is if I fucking end it, I canâ€™t fucking take the fear anymore I wake up in states of worrying about life and death, I want this terror to just fucking end once and for all. It gets better for like 30 seconds or an hour followed by fucking hours upon hours of godless fear. THERE IS NO END I hate posting on here because part of me doesnâ€™t want to die but holy shit this is exhausting
