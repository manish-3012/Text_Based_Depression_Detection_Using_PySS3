Just need to talk, no idea where else to go, last time people were friendly here.I just feel that I have things together enough to coast until my alcoholism finally destroys my insides and then I have forced my hand.  Been facing this daemon for the past 14+ years, have done all the AA, therapy, rehab bull shit.  None of it worked.  I got tired of being a waste, said fuck all that.

I turned my back on all that and cleaned myself up on my own terms, got a job that I don't hate and am good at.  It provides just enough to for a comfortable life, booze and way less than I should be putting into savings.

I am on booze fueled cruise control till my liver goes out and then there is the self fulfilling mossberg 500 12g slug under the tree in the wood at my spot I have picked out deep in the woods far away from anyone else.
