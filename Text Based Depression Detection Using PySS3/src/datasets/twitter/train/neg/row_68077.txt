tired of being who i amHi. I feel weird posting here but I don't have any where else. Basically, I'm in my 20's, have no friends, and feel like my life is going nowhere. Most people my age are having the times of their lives but I just feel really stuck and like I don't belong anywhere. I have never even dated anyone and people around me are starting to get engaged which is depressing. I just feel disgusting looking and worthless half of the time and the only time I leave my house is for work or my lsat prep class. I see other women my age and wish I could be like them but I'm just awkward and weird and really, really tired tbh. I just wish I could be a beautiful girl with a loud, outgoing personality and am tired of being who i am.
