I just want to chat it's been awhile.I have been feeling sickeningly depressed lately. I'm 19 years old and have a wonderful girlfriend of 2 years but, other than that I don't have anyone. Me and my sister moved out of our family home because of the drug abuse that went on there. My sister was my best friend and she ended up ending her life shortly after she moved out. I know I can speak with my girlfriend but I have no one else. My job puts me in a position where I don't see others. I am in online college courses and only go in for my exams. I only find comfort in Reddit and I have been thinking more and more about ending my life as well. I feel alone even though I know I'm not. I should be grateful for having a partner but she is a bit emotionally neglecting and I have trouble speaking of my problems as well. I just need some one to chat with. Or idk something..
