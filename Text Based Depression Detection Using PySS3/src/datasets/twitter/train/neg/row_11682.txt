Iâ€™ve been planningI had a baby 3 months ago and Iâ€™ve been suffering from ppd really bad. Iâ€™ve been depressed most of my life but I was managing it well before the baby. My Dr. prescribed Zoloft but I donâ€™t want to take it, I donâ€™t think it will help and I donâ€™t want to be depended on it. 

My husband is not very supportive and heâ€™s struggling as well. I donâ€™t know if he could take care of the baby on his own and that hurts me as well. It kills me when I look at her and think about what her like would be without her mom but Iâ€™m struggling. My heart is heavy every day lately. I have been planning my suicide, thinking about buying a gun but I also canâ€™t imagine the thought of my husband finding me. I just want out of this rut. Why am I not happy? Why canâ€™t I just be a happy person? I look around and wonder how everyone has so much energy and is able to wake up every day with a good attitude.
