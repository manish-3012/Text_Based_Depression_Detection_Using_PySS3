Feeling guilty and wanting to kill myselfI've struggled with anxiety and depression on and off throughout my life, and I've actually been doing pretty well lately - until today. I accidentally cut someone off in traffic - I had turned onto a one-way street in the right lane, and there was nobody in the left lane. I needed to get in the left lane to make a turn, so I put on my signal and checked my mirror but in hindsight I realize I didn't physically turn to check my blind spot. Someone must have pulled out of a driveway without me noticing, because all of a sudden I heard honking and see someone directly behind me. Luckily we did not collide, but I still feel mortified at how close I came to causing an accident, and I feel like I should just kill myself.

I do realize that this reaction is out of proportion to the situation, and that the harm I would cause my friends and family if I killed myself far outweighs the harm I caused today with my carelessness. Still, the thought has been playing in my head like a record all day. I keep mentally adding up all the fuck ups in my life, and it seems like they far outweigh any good I've done. =/
