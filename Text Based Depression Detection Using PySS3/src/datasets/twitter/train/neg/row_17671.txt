i just feel drainedi know iâ€™m a disappointment to my mom. and my stepdad. i know iâ€™m pathetic. if im only 19, what chance do i got for the rest of my life? im so pathetic. i hate myself. iâ€™m a bad person. iâ€™m not smart. i cant get a job. i know my parents and my whole family is disappointed with me. i have nothing to live for. i just take up time and space and money that could be used on so many other things. the only reason i havent killed myself is the fear of hell. i wish i never knew what religion was and i would just be dead already. im sorry for being me
