back to school...school is what really fucks me up. it does NOT help my battle with OCD, i hate it. the teachers, pupils, atmosphere... even my friends don't seem to care about me

and i never did any work thanks to worrying about bigger things like ocd. the dead line has passed. they have already sent it off for marking. i'm in large trouble when i get back from this 2 week holiday

i would get a job so i can leave school but i'm TOO SCARED. i'm RIDICULOUSLY socially anxious, and if i wasn't i'd have left a year ago... can barely speak to any one...

i just want to die, ocd alone is bad enough
