Every day is the sameFor the past 25 years I have battled with suicidal thoughts, several attempts and lots of trips to the crisis team. I dont know how I have managed to stay alive. Thinking of ending everything and finally not feeling all the pain...it's  a positive. I know it's not an 'if' but a 'when' as I'm sure lots of people do.
