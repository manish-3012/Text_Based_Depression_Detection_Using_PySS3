Detached from realityI feel like I would be just as happy as a heroin addicted homeless man as I would if I were as rich as Bill Gates. Nothing really appeals to me.

I don't really enjoy anything that I do, I do it mainly because it wastes time. Everything just seems to be entertainment before you die, in the end it really doesn't matter. There is no such thing as "productivity", because everybody is going to die anyways. I feel as if there is no real reason for as to why I do anything, I just do it. 

I constantly have to remind myself that I am me, and this world is actually a thing.

I wish I would die in hopes that there is an afterlife that has more meaning than this.
