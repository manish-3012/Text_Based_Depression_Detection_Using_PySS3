First time seriously considering suicideI've been so sad for so long. For the last month I've been 24/7 sad. I can't take it any longer. I took the steps to help myself for years. Good job, absolutely fit, gym bjj everything. If I had a superpower It would be being miserably sad every day. I just don't want to keep suffering. I can't take it any longer. I swear. I don't know what to do anymore
