I'm exhaustedI don't even have the energy to explain it all.

My dad is crazy, my military career is fucking stupid, my job is a waste of time, my daughter can't get her shit together, and I don't think I love my wife. And to top it all off, 40% of the country is fucking traitors who are trying to ruin our way of life.

So I'm just too tired to explain why I can't do this. This is all I got.

It's my life. I think I have the right to end it.
