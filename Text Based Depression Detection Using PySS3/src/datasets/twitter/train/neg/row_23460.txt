I feel like life isnâ€™t fixable.Iâ€™m truly just at a loss at this point. Like so many others, I just feel completely done. My life is a fucking dumpster fire. Iâ€™m drowning in debt, Iâ€™ve lost my job, most of my friendships, my relationship is hanging by a thread, and I have no hope for the future of this country or my place in it. 
Even before I lost my job, I wasnâ€™t any happier. I worked horrible hours at a shitty warehouse. The work was brutal, and my work-life balance was non-existent. Work, sleep, repeat. Thatâ€™s my fucking life and thatâ€™s all it has been for years. And I have no hope of going anywhere else or doing anything else because this fucking country doesnâ€™t want to give the basic necessities of living to its people. Weâ€™re just a bunch of fucking cogs in a machine.
I just donâ€™t get what Iâ€™m supposed to do anymore. Not only do I have to worry about my own depression and feeling like Iâ€™m broken, now I have to deal with a broken system too? Maybe, MAYBE, I could fix myself. But the whole god damn country? How am I supposed to go on living like this when the future is so overwhelmingly bleak? I hate this life.
It feels like Iâ€™ve tried everything from anti-depressants to weed, with a dash of therapy in between. Iâ€™ve been trying so hard to overcome lifeâ€™s challenges. I do what Iâ€™m told I need to do to get better, yet I donâ€™t get better. My brain is locked in a place of despair and hopelessness and Iâ€™m convinced thereâ€™s no point to any of this.
I lay awake crying at night dreading my inevitable future and whatâ€™s to come. Will I be evicted next? Will I experience homelessness too? Drug addiction? Perhaps Iâ€™ll just die on the street. When I think about that it makes me feel like Iâ€™d rather take matters into my own hands and find a less miserable way out.
But the reality is that Iâ€™m afraid to die. I really am. Iâ€™ve only had 26 years on this planet. They werenâ€™t ALL horrible. I knew what happiness felt like once when I was a young girl, when things were simple. I guess thatâ€™s just being naive though. I donâ€™t want to continue on this way... I canâ€™t. My fear is the last thing keeping me alive, but I just donâ€™t know how long thatâ€™ll hold out. Iâ€™m getting truly desperate. I need help but I canâ€™t fathom what help thereâ€™s left for people to give. 
If you made it this far, thank you for reading. I donâ€™t really know why Iâ€™m posting, I guess itâ€™s a final desperate plea for a view that I havenâ€™t thought of or a tiny reason to believe this life isnâ€™t pointless.
