AdiosAfter a long downhill I am finally done. I'm not stupid, I know what I'm want to do. I have a degree in math, was in a PhD program, learned Spanish during a two-month trip, and decided to stay there for a year because I loved it. But I can't find work. 

Now my phone has been shut off and I'm out on the street. Never had much of a family, and without a phone or house, I've lost contact with my friends. I have a car and a laptop and some clothes. But I've been depressed for so long I can't do anything.
