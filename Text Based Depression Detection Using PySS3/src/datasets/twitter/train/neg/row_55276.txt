Question about moving forwardNot sure this is the right place but r/depression side bar says suicide stuff should go here. Has anyone here been at the point they no longer want to die but due to situation know they have to? Not like terminal illness but still a situation where the people that are supposed to protect (in my case the police &amp; UK health care services) are forcing you into a situation where the only option is to end your own life. Where does one go from here? How did you move forward?
