I hate my bodyI hate my stretchmarks, acne, scars. I'm so flawed and it hurts. I have no problem with any of these things on other people, but somehow with me it's a problem. I feel like I don't deserve to exist. Like I can't be happy unless my skin is smooth, hairless with flat belly. I hate it and have troubles changing clothes before physical education in front of others. I hate it so much it makes me cry. I've gained weight after starting to eat normaly (I ate very little before) and can't stop blaming myself for having stretchmarks. I want to be born again so I can get a completely new skin. Unfortunetaly I inherited skin problems and it makes me want to die. I feel like the worst, most unlovable, hideous person in the entire world. I hate it so so much I want to crawl out of my skin and die in a corner. I've posted this on r/bodyacceptance, but my post was removed and I was adviced to post on body dissatisfaction, but there can't be any mention of wanting to die, so now I'm posting here. It's not urgent, I'm just sad. Those are just my thoughts and feelings, I wouldn't kill myself.
