i've been living with my sister (10) , my dad and grandmother, my mom is living with another man, she left us

if my dad do what he is going to do, everyone will be fucked up mentaly and im already shaking and feeling very cold, the worst thing is, im not an adult (im 16) so me and my sister are probably gonna end up in seperate familys, guys i've been going trough this for years, im not secure about anything, i dont even know where im going to end up in the future, because i've been treated like object just because im underage, ill be just traded around to every family, and the worst thing is that i care about my sister and i dont want her to expirience this. 

I dont know what should i do, please help me. thanks for your time
