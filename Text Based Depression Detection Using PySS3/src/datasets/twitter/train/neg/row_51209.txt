Thank you so much everyone, I just love all of you.[I wrote a post yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/94qnad/just_hit_20_my_life_is_just_fucking_miserable/) expecting no attention at all, but somehow it gained 3k views and I got bombarded with nothing but helpful, thoughtful and positive messages and PMs. It helped me so much. You guys have no idea. I think for 5 years I've never been happy this much. My face was filled with smile for whole day. Thank you. Thank you so much. To know that I'm not alone in situation and there are people actually care about me was the best fucking thing in my life.

You know what? I decided to ask out my crush. I've never talked with her, I just saw her face and had a instant crush. I don't know how this will work out but I'll make some plan for it, I'll definitely do it in this month. If it goes wrong, fuck it. I've got nothing to lose at this point. But I'm feeling confident thanks to you guys.

Just thank you so much. I love this sub. I love you guys. Thank you.
