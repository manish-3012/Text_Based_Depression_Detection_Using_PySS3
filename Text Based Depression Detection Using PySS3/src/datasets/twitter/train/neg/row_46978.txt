Thought my new job would help, but...it's just given me some new stuff to feel suicidal about.  Comparatively speaking it's not such a rough job and my coworkers are fine, but it's outside my comfort zone and now instead of wanting to die when I think about not having a job, I want to die every time I make a small mistake or think about the tasks I don't like.  Not great pay or a good commute either, and no benefits.

I'm only part-time but all I do is work and sleep.  I come home starving but too tired to prepare a meal, watch videos, fall asleep early, and wake up unhappily close to the time I'll have to leave for work again.  I don't have a lot of days off but so far I've spent them sleeping.  When I was unemployed it felt like I had zero energy and now it's negative.  I'm even less interested in checking messages than I used to be, I'm making no effort to see friends or play games, and I certainly don't want to tidy up my horrendous living space or do any creative work.

I soft-committed when I interviewed to staying around a year, but I'd rather go back to the gig hellscape and be an embarrassment to my parents than live this way for that long.

I don't know whether I should close with an "invisible disability" angle or a "we were lied to about the value of grad school" angle, but uh, I am very tired.  Someone tell me something exciting you've baked recently?
