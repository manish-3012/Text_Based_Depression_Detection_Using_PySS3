I'm in so much painI just want to die, only one family member who it will hurt but I can't do that to her. I live alone, no friends even online.. Infront of people i'm tense and anxious and the second I'm alone again I just break down, overcome by loneliness, regret and guilt. Using various drugs and alcohol to distract myself but it's unsustainable and there is no "fix". I've tried dating, socialising and stuff but there's only one person i've ever loved and there's never been another person I even *enjoyed* the company of. All I can imagine in my future is loneliness, a pointless job with a pointless existence and *always* missing my ex. I can't physically do it, falling asleep can take me hours, even after 2-3 days without sleep plus drinking and taking various drugs I will lay in bed for hours crying, stuck in various daydreams involving my ex etc. Sober it's *far worse*. There's no chance of fixing that now but life goes on, they're better off without me. So I *have* to work 40-45 hours a week, in some mundane, shitty paying job just for the liberty of living, except I hate *living*, no amount of money, drugs or anything is going to change that and the only reason I have not to end it all is my "one" family member who would be hurt.  I feel like i'm obligated to live for them, even though i'm a constant disappointment and burden I know suicide would only hurt them more. 

Whatever happens i'm going to be miserable for the rest of my life, constant chest pain, headaches and *that* sinking feeling.
