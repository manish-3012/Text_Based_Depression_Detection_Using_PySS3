JealousPretty jealous of all these people posting about how they're going through with it.

Wish I had the bravery to do it, I'm past caring if I'll hurt anyone, it's been 7 years and at this point my mum just ignores my suicidal episodes and turns her phone off.

Not even the hospital can help, or the countless meds , doctors, psychiatrists and therapists. Im an incurable case. And statistically speaking I do legitimately bring everyone down, I am but a stain. I add absolutely zero positive elements to anyone's lives.
