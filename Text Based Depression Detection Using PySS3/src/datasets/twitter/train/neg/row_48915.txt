Never endingLast night bugs were crawling all over my body. But they werenâ€™t. My husband assured me they werenâ€™t there. I could hear rats in the wall. He could not. The sirens gave me a headache. I know none of this was real. At the time it was. Havenâ€™t hallucinated that bad in a while. 

A few times a year I become deeply suicidal. Is this my life forever? I know it has to be. Thereâ€™s no guarantee my kids would have a better mother after I leave. Chances are good, but can I risk it? Could she be any worse than my occasionally psychotic self? Iâ€™ve never hurt them. Iâ€™ve been afraid I was going to. But I havenâ€™t. Quarantine with two small children is not helping my illness. I love them. My husband is amazing. I know he could find an amazing woman. Itâ€™s making more sense. 

But then... dealing with a dead body takes paperwork and a lot of time. First responders/medical personnel have their hands full as it is. I canâ€™t add to that. 

Itâ€™s a moot point anyway. Because I canâ€™t kill myself. I canâ€™t risk hurting my kids. I know my husband loves me, but his resilience is incredible. I hate that I have brought children into this worldâ€”not only with all the shit going on, but having a predisposition for mental illness as well. Now that they are here I have to take care of them. I am trying so hard. I love them. I am so tired.
