Why not die?I know this it's mentioned many times a day on this sub but I'm bringing it up again. Why not die? Like it's my life and I get to do what I want. And I want to die. The only person who somewhat cares it's my mother and she will get over it. My mother it's not a reason for me to live. I understand there are good parts of life, but there are many more bad parts and for me it's not really worth it. Imo there is not a good reason someone shouldnt die by suicide
