I've lost it allIm just gonna list all my problems because I don't wanna make someone sit around all day reading 
here it is:
my neck is injured
my knee is injured
I'm addicted to drugs
my friends all hate me and left me
nobody wants to be friends with me because it's not cool
my mom is abusive
everyone thinks I'm autistic
people tell me to kill myself
my friends have let me almost drink bleach
my room is a mess
my grades were terrible and I'm surprised I wasn't held back
I'm a suicidal pussy
I don't love anymore
Im sick all the time
I can't feel normal
I can't get therapy
I can't afford the drugs I use to cope with my life
nobody in my grade/school knows I exist
they wouldn't care if I died
so I figure I may as well what have I got to gain from just being I'm going to end up insane and homeless I have a noose I made from some crappy items and It just feels kinda good to know if it gets too bad I can just do it.
