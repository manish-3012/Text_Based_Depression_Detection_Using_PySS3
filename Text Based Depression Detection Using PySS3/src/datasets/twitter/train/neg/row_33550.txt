I'm going to kill myself on SundayI stopped going to college about 10 weeks ago due to my depression and didn't tell anyone. My mum found out and gave me a shit for it. I'm a failure and fuck everything up that I do.

So I've decided to kill myself by jumping off a bridge, this is something that I've always wanted to and have came close to doing it multiple times but always back out.
