Kill meI donâ€™t really know how to put this into words but like I-I kinda just wanna stop existing and like I just wanna die and be forgotten about. I have been battling with my mental health for over a year now (severe anxiety and depression) and I just donâ€™t wanna fight no more I have been put on sertraline for my anxiety my anxiety is social anxiety so I find myself being indoors a lot and I donâ€™t rlly go outside to be social the only time Iâ€™m social is when Iâ€™m at school and I still feel like shit I could be surrounded by a million people and still feel lonely and depressed like nothing helps anymore man and I really donâ€™t know what to do with myself like I feel like Iâ€™m just dragging everyone down with me because of my mental health and itâ€™s killing me ): like I just donâ€™t wanna be here anymore I fucking hate it ): Iâ€™m sorry
