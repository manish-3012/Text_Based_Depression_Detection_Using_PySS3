I dont know how long i can keep fight against it anymoreIts since october 2016 that i got that enourmous spikes of suicide thoughts and i dont know how long i can handle them anymore. They are getting worse + stronger and lasting longer every time. I posted already a few times here. Had some nice tipps but they keep coming and getting stronger and stronger. I even made a suggested roadtrip but it didnt help. Now i even feel my chest hurting. 

Now they are really strong they last long . I am already close to tears while i am writing this. I already got my finished plans to end my life but i still to scared to execute them and i dont know how long this will keep me from doing it. If there is one more thing i dont know if that is my final push over the edge. 

Everything seems so senseless to me. My whole life makes no sense to me and i caught always in the same fucking loop of my problems and i work so hard on them there will always be a backlash and i cant fix them 100%. It makes me so sad that i cant fix these problems and i keep thinking about the one final solution without return.

I even had some soft attempts of doing it. First i went on the 23th november into the hospital with alcohol poisoning. Running around like mad in the streets with the chance getting overrun by a car. I was picked up by the emergency and police. 

On 31 december i was again so drunk and nearly passing out and picked up by friends.

I dont know what to do anymore or how long i can handle them before they finaly encourage me to do the last and final step.
