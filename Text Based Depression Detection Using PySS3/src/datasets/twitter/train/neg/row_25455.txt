Number of days I felt like killing myself and number of days I was glad to be aliveNot thinking straight at the moment, so I cannot clearly say why I chose to write this or why I chose to post this here specifically.

Number of days I felt like killing myself: about 200 over the past 3 years

Number of days I was glad to be alive: about 60 over the past 3 years

If you are reading this and see some value in this post, great, otherwise sorry for wasting 60 seconds of your life.
