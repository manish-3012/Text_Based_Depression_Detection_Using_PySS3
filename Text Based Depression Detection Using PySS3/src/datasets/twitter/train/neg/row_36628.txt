I don't want to live anymore.I feel worthless.  The person who I loved more than anything suddenly rejected me and continues to hurt me over and over and now I feel completely alone.  I can't talk to anyone.  My little brother is getting ready to have open heart surgery and I'm terrified that he isn't going to make it.  He's the only reason that I'm not dead already, I love him and I don't want to hurt him.  His surgery is a week from Monday and if he doesn't make it I'm going to run a garden hose from the exhaust pipe of a vehicle in through the window, shut the garage doors and start the car.  I'm not doing anything with my life, nothing would really change if I were to die.  My parents would miss me, they would be really sad, but they would be okay.  I'm 21 years old and I don't know what else to do.  I can't live with myself anymore.  I can't drive a vehicle without wanting to run it off the side of the road.  I want to be dead.
