Iâ€™m suicidal, just found out about Redditâ€™s big suicidal group of peopleIâ€™m 14 years old. Iâ€™m kinda fucked in the head. Been thru shit, sometimes I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s  reality or not. Kinda thought I was a pathological liar, but I genuinely thought some things actually happened to me. I get flashbacks to things. But they might have Never happened. Itâ€™s like if I overdosed or something and this whole time Iâ€™ve been in coma.
