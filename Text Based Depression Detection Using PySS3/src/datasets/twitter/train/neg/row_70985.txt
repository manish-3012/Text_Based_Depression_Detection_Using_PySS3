Iâ€™m angry that I canâ€™t kill myself without ruining the lives of the people I loveI donâ€™t want to exist anymore. Itâ€™s not worth it to me personally. I wish I could just be at peace, in a calm nothingness. But I canâ€™t. Iâ€™m stuck here, because I canâ€™t fathom the thought of destroying my parentsâ€™ lives. Theyâ€™d never get over my suicide. Neither would my sister, my girlfriend. My grandparents. It makes me bitter. I donâ€™t want to suffer anymore. But Iâ€™d never actually kill myself, just for their sakes.
