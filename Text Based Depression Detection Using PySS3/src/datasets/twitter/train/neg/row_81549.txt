Not happy with lifeI'm sorry if my grammar and punctuations are bad as English is not my native language. 

Hope that I can somehow express myself here as it is the only way I can. I havent spoked to anyone about what I'm going through right now. 

I used to be a happy, optimistic and easy going...

Can't meet people's expectations. I just feel like I'm such a failure. I'm not happy with my work, with my relationship, my grand ma is sick. 

 I want to quit my job but i need to pay the bills. I pay shit ton of bills that everytime I get my paycheck I'm only left with Php2000(about $50 US semi monthly). That's just enough for my fare.

 I pity myself sometimes and wanted to get this over. For the past few weeks I've been having suicidal thoughts. I kept on thinking about dying. These thoughts kept me awake at nights. 

Idk what to do anymore.
