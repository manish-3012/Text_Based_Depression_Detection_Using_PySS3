WhyI don't understand why she didn't reach out?
I did you ignored my texts.

Why didn't she stop by?
You never invited me.

Why didn't she come hang out with us?
I was never invited. But saw all your adventures on FB

Why didn't she get help?
I did.  But cost and COVID prevented that

I asked you to hang out and you said no you were busy but another time and never called back.  

I did a mass invite on FB and not one person responded.

Now that I am gone you have the nerve grieve someone you never paid attention too and now have the nerve to pretend like you cared all along.

Please don't string people along.  Be honest. So they can accept the truth and move on.
