Too afraid to commit suicide yet I want too, and no one cares if I contemplate and/or actually commit itI have tried posting in a bunch of different subreddits about my problems, in hopes of someone actually bothering with me, and all I get is zero comments and my posts get zero attention.  I'm sick of living, yet I'm scared to death of dying. When I see people having a good time together, I get angry and sad, because I have nobody, I never had friends at all, no real relationships. I'm always tired too. I am a below average person with a dead end future of crap, can't remember the last time I actually enjoyed living.

 I probably sound whiny, but I never have anyone to talk to. I'm sick of being ignored IRL and on the damn internet. Where's the people who actually care? Nowhere. I feel as if I opened up to people, they'd laugh at me or be condescending.

This post will be buried under more important suicidal posts, but I just wanted to write my thoughts.
