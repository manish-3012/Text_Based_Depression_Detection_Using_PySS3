Incompetence the novelThe first job I had in quite a while's orientation was today, and not only did I miss the bus, I did so staring the driver in the face, completely unaware the whole time it was the bus. So for getting a future job I'm a bit fucked. I don't have a driver's license and I'm 21. I can't safely send over what I owe my former roommates so I'm not letting them send me my deposit check in some kind of dumb anti-payback. And then there's credit card debt, yay. I don't wanna be in my mommy's house (or have to show her my real self) right now so I'm hiding away in a library. There are ~15 hydrocodone/ancetomenaphen or however you say it pills in my pocket but I refuse to use them alone because they'll probably fail (oh bonus the weak opioids are actually touching my passport, no problems there lol). If I could find something reliable right now I'd probably go for it. Oh yeah, and because of dumb bureaucracy, I don't even know if my academics will have me suspended a year.
