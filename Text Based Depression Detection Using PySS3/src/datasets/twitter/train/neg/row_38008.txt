Killing myself for ChristmasI hate this time of year. Iâ€™ve always hated it and donâ€™t care to experience this time of year ever again. My gf recently left me and I donâ€™t know what to do with myself. We had talked about marriage and now itâ€™s completely over and sheâ€™s gone. I have suffered from extreme depression my whole life and this makes me feel so low. I cut myself the other week and I just want to end my life. I donâ€™t know how much longer I can do this.
