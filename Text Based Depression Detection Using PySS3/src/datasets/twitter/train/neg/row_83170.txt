Achieving goals has left me unfulfilled time and againI'm in my late 20s Graduated with a degree in graphic design got a good salary job in the industry in a major city that I set my sights on in high school, developed a ton of  skill in illustration, (digital and traditional), graphic design, guitar, Piano, photography, Card Games, and many others. With every goal I set I've proven to myself I can achieve it, but I get no sense of satisfaction, Last year I achieved a major lifetime goal of having my art hanging in galleries in a major US city. (on top of that I have smaller pieces I've sold overseas) I've achieved more than I thought I would when I was young, but it doesn't feel like anything. like there is little reason to keep working at anything. This year I've fallen down the distraction hole, got a Gaming PC and have been mastering my skills at various games again with no feeling of fulfillment, but at leas those worlds suck me in and keep my mind busy. 

recently I had a dream of moving out to the country and seeing if a slower life would help but at this point i'm afraid of setting any kind of goals since none have brought me true happiness yet. Trying to enjoy things as they are isn't helping either. I feel locked up with nowhere to go to find happiness.
