I think that there's no way possible that being alive is worth a trywhat difference does it even make? I don't care about what people would feel if I die. it does not make sense. For me, when people say that is important that I stay alive its bollocks

like for real, which life am I supposed to live when I fucking struggle since the day I was born? I enjoy NOTHING
and for what? minimum wage, rent, pandemics and violence. ans FUCKING jeff bezos

Im so done I cant even cry anymore
