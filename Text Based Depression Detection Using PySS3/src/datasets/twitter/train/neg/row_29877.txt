I donâ€™t care about living. I just want out of this world.Whenever I feel like someone might like me I always have to remind myself that I am not worth it. There is always someone out there who is better. I am unlovable. Iâ€™m just in the way.  Not even my parents love me.

Whenever I feel like I did well on something like an exam I always have to remind myself that I am not intelligent. That I will never achieve what I want. I am pathetic and lazy and I deserve to fail.

Whenever i feel like a friend cares about me I always have to remind myself that I am insignificant. That no cares about me. I am boring to be around. I am forgettable, which is why no one messages me.

Whenever I feel like I should stay alive I realise that there is nothing to live for. My life is going no where. I donâ€™t have any dreams or wants, I am just here for the sake of beinghere, so please just let me leave.
