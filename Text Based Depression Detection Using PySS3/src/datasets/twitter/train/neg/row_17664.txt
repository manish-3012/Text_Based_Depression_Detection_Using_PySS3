I tried, but I just don't belong here.This world is just not made for me. I'm the shy loner in the corner who sits and observes the rest of the world. I've never, ever wanted to be a part of it. I'm a 90's kid and my generation honestly embarrasses me with its self obsession and greed. I figure my behaviour is mostly because my father abandoned me before I was born and my mother didn't even want me in the first place. I really don't want to kill myself, but I feel I have no choice.


I did try though. Within the last two years (in no particular order) I've managed to get a job after 3 months of unemployment, graduated from university with a first class honours degree, went from obese to normal BMI with a diet and exercise regime, joined social clubs and made friends, travelled independently, learned a new language. I even improved basic things like personal hygiene. All of those things brought temporary joy but ultimately resulted in me feeling even more distant to everyone and everything else than I had even imagined before. What more is there even left to try?


There is absolutely nothing keeping me tied to this earth anymore. Even my hobbies no longer interest me. Waking up and dragging myself around everyday is crippling. I only wrote this in case anyone else feels the same. Surely I'm not the only one. One day I will find the courage to finally end the misery.
