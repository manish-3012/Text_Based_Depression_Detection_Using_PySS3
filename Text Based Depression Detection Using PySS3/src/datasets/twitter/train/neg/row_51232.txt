Attempted, stopped midway throughYesterday I attempted suicide but stopped midway through (you could say chickened out?). Anyhow, I felt really drowsy immedietely after and went to sleep. Woke up this morning with terrible headache, nausea and cold sweats. I've thrown up twice in the past couple of hours. Had to miss class because of this and honestly I'm really worried about failing. I can't eat anything without throwing up. So I am just lying in bed munching on gummies because that's all I can stomach right now.
