LifeI've been struggling alot recently, I moved to a new country a year ago and I'm still trying to make it good I left my entire life and friends for a better life but it only made things worse, the drugs I take don't work at all and my doctors just lower/increase the dosage, they never tried to make a therapy session after 1, my girlfriend who just said she wants to break up with me has no idea how to help and neither do I, she says I should treat her better and I know I should but she doesn't want to try anymore, I just had to kick housemates out and they cried saying Im making them homeless, I've been struggling to make everything right but I take one step and I'm always 10 steps back, I can't reach out anymore without people feeling bad and I can't help to relapse or drink it away, ig I just needed to say it all in one and find some clear sense because I can't speak out and say there isn't a day that goes by that makes me think about yknow (le fin) I swear i can't say anything without making others sad, I've tried and I can't anymore
