Want to die but not willing to kill myselfI'm just waiting until my boyfriend takes me to the craven country jamboree and then I'm going to drink myself to death. I might die, I might live. I don't know. What I do know is that after this jamboree I'm gonna be taken away in an ambulance, dead or alive. I can't just purposely kill my self by hanging or overdosing, I just feel like it would be too dramatic, too horrifying. I just want it to look like a simple party accident. Then no one will know of my hidden pain. No one will know of my deep gut wrenching hatred for life and living. 

Life is too unfair. I'm almost out of money and my boyfriend and I have been unemployed for over a year now. No one seems to want to hire us even though we have great resumes and no criminal records or piercings or tattoos. We just have no hope and I think he's going to break up with me because both of us being jobless and hopeless isn't going to make it. Our relationship is already too strained.
