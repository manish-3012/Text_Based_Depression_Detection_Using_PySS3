my feelings in wordsmy feelings
 completely giving up on my life, on myself 
not wanting to live anymore in this cruel world 
crying so hard, struggling to breathe 
with a fucking rope around my neck 
begging for my brain to stop screaming at me 
begging for something to kill me 
begging for the courage to go through with the pain  just so that I won't hurt anymore...
please....
