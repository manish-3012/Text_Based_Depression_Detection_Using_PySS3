22 and feel like a major burden and just going down hill.I over think things and feel the worst pain in my chest when I get depressed. I have become more depressed over the past few months and have decided to just end my life.
I'm afraid to, but I feel like it's the best thing to do. I'm unsure when. I want to do it within a week, but I'm just afraid to.
I have writen down reasons to live, how I feel, and a suicide note. I have these saved on something that no one will ever be able to access or know what todo.
I don't know why I'm saving them. Just to have them I guess.
I plan on going up to the mountains and speeding off the road. It's be best way to do it. It will look like an accident and my family won't think it was suicide.
