My friendMy friend and I both know we love each other (romantically) have been through a lot. She was diagnosed with cancer and I was just barely able to convince her to not kill herself minutes ago. I love her and I donâ€™t want to lose her. She told me not to tell anyone but I canâ€™t lose her like this. What do I do?
And Iâ€™m not there with her in person, it was over the phone.
