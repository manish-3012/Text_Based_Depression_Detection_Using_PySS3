I still love youOur home isn't ours anymore. You moved out and left me without an explanation. You moved three weeks ago and I haven't seen you since. You already bought a new apartment and moved on. Meanwhile I'm sitting here, suicidal, again. You knew and still now how I feel, you've known since the day we started dating, it's been five years since.  All the times I've broken down in front of you, and all the times you've chosen to look the other way because things isn't as easy as you want them to be. 

You tell me you love me and that you want to spend the rest of your life with me, but still you walk out the door without even looking back, even when you know that I've hit rock bottom. You don't care. You can tell yourself that you do, but that's a lie. If you care and love someone, you fight together. 

What you don't know is that I'm not gonna bother you anymore. Not you, not my family, no one. I've sent a letter to your sister and your mother, explaining some of the things they need to know. How you've treated me in the last couple of years, how much money you've made which you've always kept for yourself, how I been taking care of everything at home just for you to be able to focus on other things. I've been your biggest fan and your biggest supporter, always. But when I need you, you run out the door and tell me that you have to focus on yourself. 

If things go as planned tonight, I hope that you'll live a happy life, and that the next woman you choose to live with, will be treated with the respect and love that I was never given. 

I'm 23 years old in two weeks. I never planned to turn older than 25, and I guess the depressed 13-year old me was right all along. It will be easier this way. Easier for all of us, but mostly for me. Because I cannot live with this anymore. I need to be free.
