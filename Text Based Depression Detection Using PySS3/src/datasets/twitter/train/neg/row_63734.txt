I think this is itI had hope that things were finally going to feel normal again, and they did, but only for a moment. I think that's why it hurts so bad this time around. I thought I could fix things again. I guess it really was too late. So many things have happened in the past year that have changed me. I just needed some time to deal with it all. I said I would wait for you. I don't think you can do the same for me anymore. I just want to go back. I was never all that happy, but I never hurt this bad. I think this is it. I don't want to hurt anymore.
