It's never quietI'm an emotional cripple too pathetic to live alone. Whenever I do live alone I end up not talking to people for months until I get so lonely I offer free sex to anyone who will talk to me for a few hours. It's gotten way worse

I moved back in with my very abusive mother because I couldn't take it anymore and was afraid I would snap. I have a very hard time even doing simple things like act normal in public, I shake all the time.  I can't drive. I struggle with hygiene and basic tasks. 

I'm trapped in a very rural community with no transportation. I don't even know anyone let alone have friends. My mom is very mean and never nice. She has borderline.

The past few weeks I've been struggling with suicide thoughts again but for the first time in my life having homicidal thoughts too. 

It's never quiet here. This is just a 3 room house and she has the t.v. on 24/7. It's been talking directly to me. I think the only peace I could get is in jail or death. One of those 2 things are inevitable.
