Is it worth it?Iâ€™m so tired of the constant stress, the emotional pain, feeling so lost in life, I tried to take a bottle of antidepressants a few days ago and Iâ€™m debating doing it again. Iâ€™ve been suicidal since I was 16 and nothing Iâ€™ve done in life has helped ease any of this pain, why should I keep going? The suicidal thoughts have only gotten worse and it sucks because I donâ€™t want to die but I want to kill Myself
