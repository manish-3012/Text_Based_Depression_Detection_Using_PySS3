Work and suicideSo I'm at work and making a fool of myself as usual cus I'm a fucking cretin abd I just randomly told my boss's boss that actually I don't really care if I die as I have nothing to live for. Obviously I really regret saying this as now it just gives my bitchy boss and fucking bitchy coworker more ammo against me and it was all pretty awkward in front of the whole office like that. They already don't even talk to me and I've been told there's no future here for me. Wtf do I do? Just go and get it over with?
