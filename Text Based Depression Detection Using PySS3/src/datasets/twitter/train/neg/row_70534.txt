Why can't I just do it?Why can't I just die?  I'm so sick of being alive and out of probability I should be daed by know.  I've tried to kill myself 8 or 9 times now and no matter what, I always wake up the next morning.  I have taken so many pills...if any other person took them, they would be dead...but not me.  For some messed up reason I am still her.  I held on for so long...I tried for so hard, but no matter what, I keep feeling like it's all caving in and no matter how hard I try I can't get out...I wish that I owned a gun...you can't fix a bullet to the brain...but hey, when you are as broke as me, you can't afford any luxuries in life...apparently you can't afford death...
