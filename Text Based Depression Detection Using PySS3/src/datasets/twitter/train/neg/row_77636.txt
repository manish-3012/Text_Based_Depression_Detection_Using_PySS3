I really don't see any reason not to kill myself anymoreLife just feels like a video game where I already explored all the content and there's no excitement left. I can't do any work in uni or hold a job because I see how other people who suffered through where I am right now live and I know for sure I'd still be as unhappy as I am right now if I was in their place. Even if I could get anything in this world that I wanted, I don't think that would help. The only thing that I want is to feel happy, but other than occasional forced happiness caused by drugs there's nothing in this world that manages to trigger this feeling for me anymore. And dying doesn't even sound that bad. I feel bad for my family but I feel like I mostly feel bad because I have to, I don't care how they'd feel after my death too much. This hurts to even type but I see no reason to lie to myself. And the only person in this world I truly care about will probably forget me in a month, maybe a year. Who cares. I can't force them to care about me as much just because they meant everything to me. I guess that's all I wanted to get off my chest, will probably just end it all the next time my family calls me lazy trash for being too tired and depressed to get out of bed.
