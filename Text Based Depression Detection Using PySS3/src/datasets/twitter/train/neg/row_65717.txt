Not Sure What To Do AnymoreI've been struggling with severe anxiety and depression for years now. I've been in and out of counseling and on and off antidepressants. I've been suicidal for a while and recently have hit a rough patch once again. I really want to end things but I'm also scared to do so. I'm just scared of the unknown and what happens after. 

I feel like such a horrible person, my life isn't totally awful. In so many ways I am such a fortunate person. I'm in college, I have supportive friends and family, and my parents are in the fortunate position to help me financially while I finish school (although I feel very guilty and like a mooch because of this). That's why it is really frustrating that I can't seem to get out of this rut. I feel like a complete loser because my severe social anxiety keeps me from getting a job even though it's something that I desperately need. The solution seems so easy, just get off your fucking ass and get a job, but for some reason it seems like such a large step that I am just too scared to take. My friends are moving on with their lives and I seem to be falling behind. I'm a very shy, awkward and unattractive person as well. I don't know how to dress fashionably, how to do my makeup, how to do my hair or really even how to start conversations without tripping on my words. I know those things may sound quite trivial but they unfortunately contribute to my lack of self-confidence and lack of self-worth tremendously. Some days I don't even want to leave the house out of fear that people will judge me. My life is unfulfilling and I feel that I am wasting away.

Thanks for letting me vent.
