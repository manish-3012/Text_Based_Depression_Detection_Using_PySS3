Canâ€™t dealWhat honestly is the point? Canâ€™t deal with this anymore. And why bother reaching out? Reach out, either get ignored or police called, hospital, psychs whole process begins again. Where honestly does it end. Therapy is good but often not intensive enough and back I go again. Thinking I should just stop the cycle end it all and be done with it.
