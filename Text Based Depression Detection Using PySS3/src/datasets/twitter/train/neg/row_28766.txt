Nothing will be the same againI need to accept it, there's no going back...

I need to accept that nothing will change it, that things won't be the same never again, and that I just need to accept my fate.

The only way is to change myself as much as I can, stop caring about what others think, and just focus on my life.

That's what everyone always tell me, so it must be true.

I fucked up, people will always treat me differently and I've lost a lot, and the sooner I accept it, the better.

I messed up, and if I keep moping about it, I will keep dragging myself to hell.

Some people just aren't meant to be happy, I guess, and I'm one of them...
