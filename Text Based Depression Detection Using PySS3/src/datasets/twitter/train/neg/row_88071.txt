You ever feel like you know one day that you're gonna take your own life.You have suicidal thoughts currently, but you still have some hope that life will get better so you push on, but you know it won't. You just tell yourself that to pretend to have a reason to live. You don't know when.....but you know you're gonna eat a bullet one of these days.
