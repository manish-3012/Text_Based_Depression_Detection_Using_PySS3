Maybe we're right...Maybe the fact that our existence is constrained to a life that's often just suffering makes existence a burden that's not worth bearing. Maybe those of us who have overridden our evolutionary reflex to continue living at any cost are the ones who've really discovered the fundamental truth behind life. Just something worth thinking over I suppose...
