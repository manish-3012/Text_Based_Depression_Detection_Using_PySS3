Dealing With LossHypotheticalâ„¢ situation: You're one of those people who never really liked being alive, but you muddled through because you didn't have the heart to inflict the alternative on your family. One day, through dumb luck, you meet someone. If you were the kind of asshole who believed in true love, you might think this was it. They make you happy, they make it worth waking up in the morning, you can see a future with them, not just that but for the first time in what feels like your entire life you can see a future where you're actually happy, and not just slogging through life wishing something would finally kill you. They feel the same way. You both want that same little cottage, and there's no real reason you can't have it.

One day, they need to run some errands. You get a terrible feeling about it, and ask them not to, to just stay home with you. They don't listen, they tell you it's just a quick train ride, that they'll be back soon, that they love you, and that you're kind of always with them.

Turns out you were right. Not long after they get off the train, they're struck by lightning. They're dead by the time they hit the ground. If you had a soul to sell to bring them back, you would. You can't bring them back, and nothing you can do, no amount of money, magic, or anything else will change that.

Now what? How do you keep going? Why do you keep going? I have no fucking idea, and I really wish I did.
