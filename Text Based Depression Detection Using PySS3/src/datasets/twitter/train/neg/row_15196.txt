I'm about to lose itWuss poppin boys it's me Sal, I was just checking on my school computer on some projects and it looks like I'm suddenly behind on a few, I can manage but Like fuck I wanna die. My friends barely pick up when I text them, they use the excuse my phone doesn't get notifications and I'm sick of it, my girlfriend broke up with me after These emotions got worse, Some guy on here contacted me and never again, he might be doing something which is understandable, but I want to feel like..I guess loved? Its faggity I know but I just want to be talked too, checked in etc.
