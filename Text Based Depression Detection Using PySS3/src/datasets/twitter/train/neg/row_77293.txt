I just want to know if it will get betterI'm a 20 year-old out-of-shape kissless virgin who's never been on a date with a girl before. I live with my parents and owe my friend money for food when we go out because I spend what I have on video games and nothing else. I'm trying to get a degree in performing arts but I feel like it's going nowhere. I'm trying to get my first job at a supermarket but every time I wake up its 2 in the afternoon and I can't push myself to make my life any better.

All I want to know is if I'm just being silly, if I'm only as bad as I feel, and if it fucking gets better. That's all I really want.

For shit to just please get better.
