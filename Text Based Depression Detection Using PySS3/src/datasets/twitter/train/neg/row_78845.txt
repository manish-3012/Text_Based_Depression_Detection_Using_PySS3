Tips on dealing with depressive realism?I've recently come across an article about depressive realism and wondered if this is actually a type of depression, because it pretty much sums up most of the reasons why I hate myself and this life.

If there are any others out there that think they have, or have been diagnosed with depressive realism, please tell me what drives you to go on? Because the way I see it, life isn't worth living. There's so many negative things about this world that makes it not worth living.
