been having suicidal thoughts for a while, not likely to act, but wanted to discusshello

so I've been having suicidal thoughts for three to four years now. i range from "being alive is okay, i guess" to "i wouldn't mind dying" to "kill me now please." and it's never been serious enough that i have made an attempt, but i have thought about how to do it quite a few times. 

but now i am going to be starting college this fall, and i know i have to either get myself together now or decide to end it here, because there are so many people who would want to be in my place and i don't know if i deserve it, or anything really. 

i think i may have depression, but the few times i have wanted help i will remember that as a minor, if they think i may harm myself, they'll tell my parents, and i really do not want them involved. we don't have a good relationship and it would just make it worse for me.

could someone ask me questions or talk to me as i try to figure if i really have any motivations in life, what i want, if i do want anything, and if and how to get help? thank you.
