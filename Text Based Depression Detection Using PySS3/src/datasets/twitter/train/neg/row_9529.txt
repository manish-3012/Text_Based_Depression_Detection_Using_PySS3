Wifeâ€™s options for debt after Iâ€™m gone.My death should pay out enough to pay off most of our debts, but after that what options would my wife have for debt relief? Are there programs that I can direct her too in my letter? Not interested in â€œdonâ€™t do itâ€s, itâ€™s going to happen. 32 years old constant pain and debts out the ass, the best I can do is get my family to a point where they can actually take a vacation.
