Honestly, im just readyIt would hurt everyone too much. Truly though, I am a burden. I am sick too often. I have used up all of my sick days at work. They must think I'm useless. I don't make much money, and finding a job or degree that could point me towards making more seems hopeless. I look at job listings every day. I can't do retail/food/manual labor and that's all there is here. My anxiety sucks. I'm hard of hearing, and my speech suffers from it. I've been bullied my entire life. Interviewers have turned me down upon hearing how I spoke. I contribute nothing and I'm afraid I never will. I have tried so hard. Exercised. Ate better. Therapy. Pills. The pills just made me fat and ruined my sex life. I don't know how much longer I can go, I just want it to be over. People might miss me, but they didn't want any part of helping me either. I know it could be worse. That makes me sadder. I am ungrateful. I know it. I just want to go to sleep and not wake up. Give my organs to people who would appreciate them more. Research my body and help heal someone who will live a wonderful life. This body wasn't made to live in, not for me.
