I'm just done, I just feel empty.I've been struggling with several mental health problems since secondary school(UK) so about 10-7 years now and now im just feeling worse and worse. For the longest time out of school i was out of work since i just cant bring myself to do things or even talk to people this also means i dropped out of college due to not being able to force myself out of bed most days, i was just too scared of the people.

now im unemployed living with my dad and my girlfriend of 5 years, she's watched me get worse and worse over the years to the point where its an accomplishment for me to put a shirt on or be awake for longer than 7 hours at a time.

the one thing i do that makes me happy is cooking but i cant deal with stress of professionally doing it and since i have no money coming in at all i cant do it often. all that coupled with having a rat move in recently that keeps getting into our pantry its all starting to just get too much and i just want everything to stop, i want to go to sleep and never wake up. I dont want to live my day to day life anymore i've had enough of it.

All i want is to be a normal person, i want to be able to get a job, work 9-5 move out with my girlfriend not a shut in who is only awake from the hours of 6pm to 1am. I'm just done.
