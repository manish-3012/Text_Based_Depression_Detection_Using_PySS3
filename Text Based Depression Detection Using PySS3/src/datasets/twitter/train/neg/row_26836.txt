My feelings have evolvedI've gone from "I don't want to die but I don't see myself ever getting better, I'm in so much pain and I want escape" to just "nah I just wanna die, plain and simple, I don't want anything else but to die" my brain is fucking broken I think about suicide NON. STOP. From the second I wake up.
