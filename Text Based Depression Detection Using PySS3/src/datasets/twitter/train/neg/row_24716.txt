I am feeling extremely suicidal, and I have to start taking antidepressants. I dont know what to doEveryone knows that antidepressants can make you feel suicidal the first weeks. The problem is that I am already feeling extremely suicidal and probably I will end up killing myself if I start now. What should I have to do?
