Things were abysmal. Now they're even worseI said I would never post here again but fuck I couldn't take it.

I already felt like shit for the longest time, then on my birthday my narcissistic mom decided to kick me out. I've been living with my dad but I just don't feel safe in his house, my anxiety has been really bad. Despite my bitch mother my home was my comfort zone, I felt safe and content there, here I feel terrible and scared to even leave my room. Just thinking about the immediate future and what's to come frightens me. I really wish I was dead now.
