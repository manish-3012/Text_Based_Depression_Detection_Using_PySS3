I don't understand why I hate myself so muchI just don't understand,  I've tried so hard with my family,  but I still feel like I don't matter.  I'm 42, I have one daughter.  I just don't think it matters if I'm here or not.  I sat in  30 degree temperature weather for a couple hours and I wish I froze. I don't know what to do.  I just want to not exist anymore.
