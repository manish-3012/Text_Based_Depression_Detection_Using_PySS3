Cutsthe pain is too much. one more time won't hurt anything. it's not an addiction. you can handle it this time. grab the blade. you'll be okay. it will help. you'll be able to control the pain this way. one cut. drip. drip. drip. ahhhh. the relief. maybe just one more. Drip. Drip. Drip. grab a towel so no one will know. you're making a mess. one more? DRIP. DRIP. DRIP. 

what did you do? no way of hiding this now.. cuts all up your wrist. you promised yourself no more. but the pain is so dull now. the relief is a fix you've been longing for. the buzz in you head. you're not addicted. stop thinking that. it was just this once. you can stop. 

this again. we just cut yesterday. GRAB THE BLADE. one cut. that's all you need. shit. one turned into 12. STOP the bleeding! you idiot what did you do. the feeling is so worth it though. finally. some sort of feeling. much better than the emptiness. 

oh no. people see your cuts. pull down your sleeve. theyre looking. you can't hide this. relaxing. nobodies looking. it's just in your head. pulls on sleeves anyways. 

showers sting on your cuts. wash away the dried blood. makes them heal. but that just makes you want the pain back. GRAB THE FUCKING BLADE. the shower water runs red. the stinging is so comforting. maybe a little too deep this time but it's okay. it will heal. it's just blood. 

you can't stop. you are addicted. you couldn't handle it. cuts everywhere. tender to the touch. everyone knows. but nobody says anything. you're on your own this time. you royally fucked up.
