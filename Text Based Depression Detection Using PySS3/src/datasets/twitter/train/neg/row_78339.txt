Feeling out of place with people who surround me(family, coworkers, peers). Canâ€™t make an emotional connection with anybody which is probably why Iâ€™ve been single for my entire life.Iâ€™m 27 years old, and have always felt like an outsider. I was the shy/weird kid who hung out in the background in high school who never hung out with any particular group. I manage to get through life by smiling all the time and being super passive. But along the way I internalize my true feelings: anger, sadness etc. I hate who I am and I hate that I canâ€™t connect with anybody. My communication skills are shit and I know if I had a way with words I would be much further along in life. Iâ€™ve recently noticed that I stutter when i get flustered, with the position I hold at work I canâ€™t afford to come off as a dumbass but I feel like I fail miserably at it everyday. Anytime any guy has shown interest in me it always fades as soon as i reciprocate feelings which in turn has given a nosedive to my self worth and self esteem. I feel if I were to end it tomorrow nobody would notice or care. The only reason my family would notice is because I make a decent wage and their â€œpiggy bankâ€ (i.e. ME) would be gone.
