Need help regarding friend.My friend has been suicidal for the last few months.  Today, he decided to withdraw from our friend group more, and told me he wishes he was dead.  His situation has suddenly gotten worse over the last few days, and his girlfriend and I both agree that he needs to get crisis help.

However, he has no one that would call it for him, as his mom brushes everything we tell her off, and we live in an entirely different country from him.  He doesn't have a phone, and he has barely any energy and gets socially anxious, so he is unable to.

We don't know what to do.  He needs help very soon, but he has no way to get it.
