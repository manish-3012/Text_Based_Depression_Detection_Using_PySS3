Thinking it might be a viable option... I'm just a tornado of destruction.I can't even describe what I'm going through without being judged. I know that I am a lowlife piece of shit and don't deserve to have this wonderful thing called life. I don't deserve anything in this life and I'm upset that I was given an opportunity. All I do is destroy and ruin lives. All I'm good for. It would be so much easier for everyone to be without me. I know it'd be like a lightning bolt. Everyone is in shock for a week and everyone can continue on with there lives, but they'd be happier knowing I wasn't there to ruin anything. I have no true friends (only ones that I hear from usually need something). My cell plan would be fine for 10 minutes a month, and I'd still have rollover. I do anything for anyone at the drop of a hat, second I need help with anything I get jack shit. I've ruined so many lives around me it's stupid. I know if I typed the true story I'd get judged thus confirming my suspicions so why bother.

It could even look accidental so I wouldn't even looked down upon for killing myself. I work a lot in the garage....forgot to shut the car off....
