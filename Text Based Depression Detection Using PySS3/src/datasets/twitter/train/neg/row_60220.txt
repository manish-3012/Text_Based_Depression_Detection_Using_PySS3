I'm just waiting for my brother to graduateAnd once he does that I'm out of here. Everything sucks. I'm a woman with 0 friends, super unusual. My one relationship has deteriorated. My family hates me. I'm stuck in a dead end job and no prospects to move out since I don't have any friends who could get me into other companies. That's my life.  

I'm waiting. I've been waiting for 3 years.  

12 more months until je graduates and then I'm out.
