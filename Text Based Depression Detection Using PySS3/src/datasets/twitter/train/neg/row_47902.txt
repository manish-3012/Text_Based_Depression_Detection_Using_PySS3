Another pathetic post.I truly want to kill my self, for the first time in my life I am sure. There is no end to this festering in my brain. I was born with it and it will be the death of me my fucking tumor. I never had a chance, I was sexually abused as a kid and born with clinical depression and anxiety. I am 19 years old and have always been a freak. The alienation is eating away at me, everyone around me is having the time of there life and I haven't left my house to really do anything in 6 months. The only time I feel happy is when I'm playing The Legend of Zelda and smoking weed.. it used to be my happy place but now it just makes me feel more alienated. The 2 people I could hold a conversation with are now complete strangers to me. I lost my ex of 4 years to this disease, I never deserved her anyway but she is so happy with out me I was holding her back, she never looks back and I can't stop thinking about her. My best friend basically just cut me out the last few months. Those are really the only 2 people I had a connection with, everyone else just thinks im a freak. I'm still trying to get my high school diploma, I can't talk to anyone, look anyone in the eye or hold a conversation, I can't look in the mirror. I hate myself so much. I feel so weak and small, to let something like this get to me when there's people who are born without sight or limbs. I've been on so many different medications Prozac, Mirtazapine, Zoloft, ability. None of them help, they just make me feel worse even after months. I can't afford therapy. I just want to be dead. I am literally a drunken mistake, my dad left and I was sexually abused, I've had no friends my whole life and I'm ugly and short as fuck with no talent or skills. Some people just aren't made for this world man.
