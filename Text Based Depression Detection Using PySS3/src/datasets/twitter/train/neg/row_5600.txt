Close yet so farSuicidal Ideation has run though my head almost daily for more than half a decade. I cannot seem to escape it for more than half a month at best. Some days are particularly bad such as yesterday and which push me from thought into minor action - buying pills, looking up the process to get a gun or the best methods of suicide (like I dont already know). I've come to a realization that even though I feel so close to doing it, I am actually quite far from it. All it would take to back me out of it is thinking what my parents would do without their only child, what my future self could accomplish, and how my problems really aren't that large to tackle. 

My biggest issue is my lack of sexual experiences. Sex sex sex is all that runs through most men's heads around my age but for me I stunted. I've always been behind the curve while simultaneously being surrounded by and hearing stories from the top of the top. Its even harder to deal with because on the surface it seems like I could be great at it yet I still flounder. I've generally been apathetic towards the whole thing in the past 2 years but then a day like yesterday will come and knock me out of it hard. Then I think about lost time, lost experience, compare myself to others, and imagine the day I blow my brains out. But today is not the day. Tomorrow is not the day. One day I'll get good with girls because if I dont I will definitely kill myself one of these days and it's sad because at the same time I know I'd regret it, logically.
