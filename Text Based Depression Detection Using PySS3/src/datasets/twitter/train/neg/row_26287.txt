I feel like there is no end in sight. (xpost from r/depression)I don't know what to do anymore. I have spent the last few years of my life trying my hardest to support and take care of my family........it just seems like nothing I do is ever good enough and I am destined to be a failure. I have fought my depression and anxiety for as long as I can remember but last year it caught up to me in a bad way. I ended up staying at a mental hospital twice for suicidal threats for about three weeks each time. Sadly each stay didn't do anything good for me, it did the exact opposite. I had to leave the military due to depression and moved back to my home town. Itwas three months of being unemployed with no income before I found a job. Now I am close to losing my car and home, I've had my water, power, and gas shut off more than once and I am so behind on everything it seems like a giant weight is pressing on my chest and making it impossible to breathe. I'm working two jobs and getting a little over a 90 hour work week, but it still isn't enough to catch up on my bills and still put food on the table for my kids. I've lost close to 40 lbs because I just can't afford to eat.......I am getting to the point where I don't know why I am even still trying. Everything is going wrong and it seems like there is no way that this will end well.
