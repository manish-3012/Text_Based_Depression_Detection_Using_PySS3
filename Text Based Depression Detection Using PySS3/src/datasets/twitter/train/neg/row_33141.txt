Tired of anxiety and paranoia fucking with me.So I've had paranoia for awhile, and it sucks, but I got a girlfriend a bit ago, and she makes me so happy when we are together, but when I'm alone my anxiety and paranoia start fucking with me. It's things like what if she finds someone better than me, what if she gets bored of me, what if she's cheating on me, or what if she doesn't really like me. I love her and don't want to lose her, but I've been cheated on before, and that really fucked me up. I'm honestly thinking of shooting myself now. Not because of her, but because I don't wanna live my life controlled by anxiety, and it seems like an easier solution to just die than worry that I'm gonna lose her, or some other bad shit.
