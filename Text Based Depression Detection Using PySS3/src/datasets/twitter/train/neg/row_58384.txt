Want to die but I can'tAnd I don't know how to get help. I'm not a human anymore. 

If I'm still this bad when it gets down to -40 I'll tell my partner I'm going to visit my family, get him to take care of my pets, and then go to the mountains, get blind drunk, eat all my pills and keep walking into the woods until I can't walk anymore.  
I wish I could disappear, like I never existed. I can't bear it.  I'm poison . 

It's only right. I've been dead for years, my body just hasn't caught up.
