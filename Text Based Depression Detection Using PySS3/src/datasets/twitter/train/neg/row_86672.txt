Rent's due, no money, no family, no feelings but depression.I don't know what to do. Everytime I think I'm okay, another wall builds up and it just keeps getting higher.

*1. Lost my family. I will not go into details. But there's nothing for me there.
*2. I don't have money. I only recently got a job and my paycheck is going to be in 2 weeks time and it's going to be small. Very small. It won't be able to cover anything.

My credit has hit the ceiling. That's 1k.
My student loan is at 10k. 
I'm currently stuck wearing braces which I pay for, so that's another 2k left. 

*3. Counselling and medication is not helping because of my stressors.

*4. Recently had my wallet stolen with ALL my government ID in there along with my bank cards and subscriptions. Obviously I've cancelled it but it's going to take months, maybe even years, to get all that back. I have to restart everything. I'm forced to. and I don't want to. 

*5. My landlord is a fucking asshole with no humane feelings, whatsoever. He is not lenient about the rent payment which is due TOMORROW and it's $1800. Trust me, after that, I'm moving out. But I can't pay $1800.
Someone help me, please.

I have no family, no line of credit, i can't get a loan from anywhere because of my new employment status and the fact that I don't have anyone to co-sign with. I don't have friends who are rich enough to lend me money, and I certainly don't have any distant family either who's willing to drop a couple thousand bucks.

Someone. Help.
I've ran into the biggest obstacle yet. 
I will be evicted and I'm contemplating on rather hanging myself instead of dealing with all this again. 
My depression keeps swallowing me. This stressor is way too much for a 19 year old student.
