Typing out my issuesI've been living off what little savings I have after my work contract expired. But I'm running out of money and I can't find a job. I can't pay rent soon, but the lease won't expire for another 7 months and I can't terminate it early.

I just don't know what to do. I hate talking about this shit. My problems are no where near as traumatic as what other people are enduring here, but I still can't shake the feeling that the sooner I kill myself, the more money I can give to my partner before I die. She deserves it more than I do and it's better than dragging her down into debt with me. 

Anyway, sorry. Maybe just typing out my thoughts is enough to help.
