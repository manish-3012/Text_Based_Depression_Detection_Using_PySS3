I'm just waiting for the lake to warm up...... and then I'm going to drown myself. I'm in so much physical pain and the doctors won't help. It's been over a year of pain and disability with no sign of recovery and things will likely get worse. I'm in my twenties and I can't imagine 40+ more years of suffering. I am done.

Suicide is more than "just" mental illness. Pain kills. Useless doctors who toss us aside kill.

Just wanted to tell someone that.
