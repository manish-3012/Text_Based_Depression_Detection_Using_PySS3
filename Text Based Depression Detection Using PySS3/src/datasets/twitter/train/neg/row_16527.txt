At the brink of a breakup and feel like I don't have any reason to continue livingAll I can think about is how it's gonna be like not having him by my side, not being able to hug him or hold his hand, or take care of him when he's sick, or have crazy adventures and amazing discussions again. And I can't bear to live in a world like that.

I also think that if it's hard for him to break up with me but he wants to, then isn't killing myself the best way? He'll be free from me forever and I don't have to deal with the pain of losing him.

I need help, I need someone to talk to. I'm so broken right now. All i wanna do is curl up in his arms and listen to his voice. But I can't because I need to give him space to think. Fuck.
