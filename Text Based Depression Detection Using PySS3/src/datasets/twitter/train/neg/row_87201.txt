Iâ€˜be been feeling extra suicidal lately.Its been really bad recently. Thereâ€™s a huge bridge not far from where Iâ€™m at (think Golden Gate Bridge) and no exaggeration, I envision jumping off it every night. Whether Iâ€™ll actually go and do it is another story.
But nothing seems to make me happy anymore. Itâ€™s like I see through everyone. Everyone is out there to maximise there individual gain and society is doomed. There are no genuine intentions in the world. Every man (and woman) for themselves.
I no longer enjoy:
Girls (I am straight)
Mindlessly browsing the Internet
My pets
Family 
Friends (have none)
Sex
Future children (I am a firm believer of being child free)
Itâ€™s funny but I somehow enjoy crying over sad videos on YouTube and how â€˜Iâ€™m nothingâ€™. I guess itâ€™s finally something I can relate to.
