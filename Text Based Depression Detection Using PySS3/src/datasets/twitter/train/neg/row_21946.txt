Innocence Became EvilLet me tell you all a secret.

Just listen real closely.

And promise me you'll  keep it.

I'll tell you how he broke me .

And left my soul torn into pieces.


And no its not a boy, whom I've fallen madly in love with. 

This is a monster who creeps in the night.

And this is someone that sadly im stuck with.

Thinking why did God give me this life ?

Into my room when moms away.

Daddy doesnt like having us kids around.

Locked in my closet is where i usually play

Especially when daddy makes that grunting sound.

Shh... stay quiet maybe he'll forget im here

Wait... whats that noise i hear?

Criss cross applesauce in the middle of the floor.

I think there's someone  tapping on the door.

Heartbeats racing im a nervous wreck.

Oh no the closet door swings open.

His hand around my neck.

He squeezes just enough to choke me 

While caressing my chest. 

And into my ear his says this: 

"Stay still, i wont be long i have things to take care of. 
I cant be doing this shit all day. 
And go ahead tell your mother you already know what she gone say."

But daddy please, i dont want to it always hurts

" i dont give a shit and if you fight it'll only get worse!"

 Now when i go to sleep at night all i hear are those words
 
They cut through me deeper than you could ever imagine

I trusted a man and this is what happened 

You used an innocent child for your own satisfaction 

If only you knew what you'd  just done

Broke every ounce of joy inside 

My dance with the devil has just begun

I hope you're all ready for a ride

Pain is now my new bestfriend 

I dont need nobody else

And when i come to face my end

I wont seek nobody's help.
