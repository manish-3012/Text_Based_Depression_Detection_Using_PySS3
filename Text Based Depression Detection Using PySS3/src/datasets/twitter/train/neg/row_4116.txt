I badly want to die, but I canâ€™t Iâ€™m in so much pain emotionally, but Iâ€™ve failed four times I wonâ€™t attempt again until Iâ€™m older and can be sure. To my shitty therapist just know, everyday I am here I am suffering and losing myself more and more and keeping me here is shit of you.Sometimes, people deserve the right to die. As morbid as that is. 

If you have tried countless times with 100% effort just to get knocked down 24/7 and have the aspect of â€˜lifeâ€™ actually sucked out of life to the point youâ€™re just aimlessly living with no greater meaning goal or enjoyment, yes you deserve and have the right to choose to end your life.
