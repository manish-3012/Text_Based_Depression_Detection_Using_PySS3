I don't know what to doI'm 20 years old and I should have my license, I should be living on my own, having my own money, and looking towards the future. Ha yeah none of that is true for me. I have no future, no motivation or even the courage to do anything. There is so much pressure on me to find a career **now** but I just don't want to! Listen... I don't have a "talent" or *any* skills what-so-ever! I couldn't find a job mostly because I am **very** shy. How the hell can I let go of my social anxiety just to find a damn minimum wage job that I will probably hate?? I feel like my future is bleak and fucking empty. I know I wont be successful.

Not only that but I have no one, I have a horrible time making friends. I don't have anyone to hang out with on weekends or to even text once in a while. No one likes me and I don't know what's wrong with me. This is gonna sound pathetic but I'm lonely because I don't have any friends.

I also have an eating disorder which I have no intention of ever recovering from. Who would take me seriously anyway? I'm not even that skinny. I know ED's are just mental disorders but I've heard so many people tell me that doctors wouldn't even look at you unless you're dangerously underweight. I could never go to inpatient or anything like that.

Yeah I just don't know what to do with my life. I can maybe just sit around and feel sorry for myself or I can take a butt load of sleeping pills right now. I don't really see myself getting better because I have too many problems as it is.
