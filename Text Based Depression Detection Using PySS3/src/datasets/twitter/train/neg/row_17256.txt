I told my therapist that I'm going to suicide and all he cared about was to give me medince.A therapist should get to know their patients and make them feel comfortable, as far as i know.
So today i went to this therapist my brother told me about, because of my issues and suicidal thoughts. I started talking from my highschool years up til now ( 7 years. ) There were 2 people in the waiting room so i knew i wouldn't take much time with my story because i kinda revised it to only tell him the important events. I started talking and talking and as i was going for the part i wanted to tell, he seemed bored and gave an indifferent irritated expression on his face and said : " I'm waiting for the part where you tell me how you're feeling now " i said : " i wanna kill myself and i feel super worthless " to which he replied " that's what i want to hear so i can give a medince " i told him i just wanted to talk and for someone to hear. As he was writing the prescription i continue to talk and all he replied was with  Aha, oh, okey.. Humm, i see. When he finished in the middle of my talking he went directly to the door and said to take this medicine seriously. I was perplexed and understand that my time was up (about 20 mints) and walked me to the secretary where he told me to see another doctor if I don't want medicine, and i went out. This doctor has reputation ngl, but all i wanted was for him to listen not just give me a prescription not like I'm some kind of a canned food in a factory and him the irritated worker. It tells you alot about society who cures symptoms and not the disease itself, it tells you so much how society doesn't give a flying F to the helpless. It's like we all have to e robots and take our "fuel" and work the next morning without a sense of being understood and belonged.
