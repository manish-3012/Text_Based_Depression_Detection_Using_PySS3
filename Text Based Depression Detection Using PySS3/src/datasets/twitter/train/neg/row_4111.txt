Looking for a new perspectiveThis is gonna sound pretentious (i think?) but I've heard it all, every argument, every catchphrase, every motivational speech to get me to not want to kill myself but none of it works, ive had to listen to it far too many times and for far too long to work on me, im out of options so i might aswell look for a fresh perspective to my problem.

The only reason i havent offed myself is that my greatest fear is that i get locked into a mental institution with no ability to leave of my own free will, this is why ive avoided stepping infront of a road vehicle, slitting my wrists or any other sub 80% chance to kill method, my city doesnt have any easy to access buildings high enough to ensure death from falling so im gonna have to get creative.

I guess my point is, its a race between me and myself to either find a reason to live or find a way of reliably killing myself and i thought you lot could help
