Fantasies of blowing my brains outI was thinking about blowing my brains out wheny father dies. I'm 32, unemployed, poor as fuck, and when he dies I'm going to be a homeless bum. I've worked many jobs, quit all of them, now no one wants to hire me. Strangely, I don't feel sad about it. I'm looking forward to the day where I don't feel small and insignificant. Death is a release, and today I realized I'm not afraid. The only regret I have is being born into this cesspool.
