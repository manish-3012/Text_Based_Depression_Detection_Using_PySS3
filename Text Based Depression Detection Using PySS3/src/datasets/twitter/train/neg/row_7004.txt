I canâ€™t deal with this anymore. I just want to leave this. All of itI donâ€™t know how this stupid Reddit thing goes but Iâ€™m rushing this down because i still have a shit ton of homework to do and several projects. Iâ€™m in the 10th grade, currently enrolled into a prestigious private college-prep lab school, taking exclusive honors classes and several AP classes which take up my whole schedule-including my free period and my electives. I thought I could handle this. I didnâ€™t just waltz in and just carelessly chooses rigorous classes on the fly. Iâ€™ve been planning and scheduling the majority of my high school life since middle school. Starting right at the Climax-my parents are in the middle of getting their things situated for a divorce and every single day they screaming and go for each otherâ€™s throat-hearing your name being dropped by your own dad whoâ€™s supposed to love you but hates your guts and your mother who hates you because you look like him. I thought I could keep up with my school life but I find it hard to concentrate these first few weeks of 2nd semester and now Iâ€™m failing every single class. Even though I force myself to sleep 8 hours I still wake up in the middle of the nights and still find myself extremely tired. Iâ€™m fucking done trying to overachieve  when everyone who should be caring about me and loving me-friends and family-are the ones who are hurting me. Not to mention my fucking teachers could care less or in their words,â€Suck it up, this is life. If you canâ€™t handle it then opt out of it.â€ At this point Iâ€™m honestly looking forward to end all of this. Suicide is the only thing that Iâ€™m working towards now. But hopefully I wait until my last volleyball season. Then Iâ€™ll execute my plan to leave this shithole
