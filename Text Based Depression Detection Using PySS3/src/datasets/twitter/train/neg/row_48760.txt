I can't live with what I didI hate myself! I feel like my father. 
How can she ever forgive me, why would she bother? 
Is this the day it happens? I wonder, buried by the saplings 
Dead by an accident 
life is not permanent
I deserve no less than the full extent of it
All I want her to know is I'm sorry
Everything I did was for her so let me do one last thing
