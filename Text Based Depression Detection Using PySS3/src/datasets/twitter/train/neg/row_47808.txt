My brother is depressed and tried killing himself but he failedHey guys, first time posting here. Im 17 and my brother is very depressed. He tried to kill himself but he failed and my mother and father flew to England to go get him (he is 22). We have gotten help from a therapist and he prescribed some pills that seem to be working, but sometimes he just has these panic attacks and canâ€™t control himself.I have tried everything to help him, from talking to trying to be a very good friend but nothing works .Im very worried what should i do to help him.
