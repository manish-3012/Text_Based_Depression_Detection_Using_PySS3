If you need therapy in the form of music, listen to THE SEARCH by NFNF has actually saved my life. Please just try listening to any of his music if you're having a hard time. I can't promise it will make you feel better but you'll feel a little less alone. 

For very rough days I recommend:

\- Trauma

\- Mansion

\- Paralysed

\- Can you hold me

\- Therapy Session

\- Breathe

\- How could you leave us

\- Dreams

\- If you want love

\- 10 Feet Down

\- My stress

\- Hate Myself

\-Only 

\- Like This

\- I miss the days

Enjoy :)

Today you're not ok and you might not be for a long time but you need to keep living in the hope that one day you will be.
