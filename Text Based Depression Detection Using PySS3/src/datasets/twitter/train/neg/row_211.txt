Had shotgun off safety, in my mouth today.I'm a targeted individual.  I've been tortured, followed (from city to city), slandered, attacked by every conceivable mental torture possible.  Hearing voices, seeing holograms, robbed of intellectual and physical property.  Too long to list.

Add to that my family always being assholes to me because they think I'm crazy.  I also bottle up all the things about them that hurt me and drink to feel better, then eventually tell them off.

My brother beat my face for a solid 3 minutes, twice within 15 minutes, for saying shot that was true but he didn't like.  That was the day before Thanksgiving 2017.  I spent the next three days in bed thinking of how I was going to kill myself.  Nobody checked on me.

Now my mother and niece physically attacked me the other day, stole my phone and hid my car key.  I lost my job.  They think I'm making up what happens to me and the only thing really wrong with me is the drinking.

My sister called the cops on me a few months ago for being suicidal and telling her off.  I got a felon with a gun charge.  They can give me 5 to 40 years in prison.  I'm not going back to fucking prison.  I've been before and can't stand being around convicts who actually belong there.

And nobody ever apologized or feels any remorse for the things they do to me.

So I was going to do it today but everyone was coming over tonight, I was trying to hurry but scared.  I heard a noise, looked out the window, and it was my mom coming home from church.

So I'm waiting until I know for sure one of my nieces or nephews won't be here when they find me.
