Feelings that my own family will betray meI keep fearing that they will have me thrown into prison. I can't stop thinking like this. I feel like they want me home from living at home with them. I came find a job because I have two misdemeanors on my record and I have been trying to get them expunged but I haven't been able because it's not clear whether I'm still on probation or not for my last conviction. I feel like the real solution for not being able to find a job sooner is to have me taken to prison, I feel like that's how they feel about my situation. It feels with so  much anxiety I just want to kill myself
