Really just noideaIt's going to be a throwaway account. 

Tbh feel pretty dwarfed at all the post's i've read on here. but need to just say it anyway, doesnt really matter if anybody reads it or not.

Since 5 years old onwards i changed moods really quickly. on birthdays i'd go from really happy to crying for no particular reason. it seems there are constant voices in my head, some are just saying your an idiot why are you down seriously you have nothing to be down about. seriously i want these voices to stop taken this far enough to knock myself out various times, i'm needing to know whats going on in my head. when im happy i'm top of the world nothing could get me down, then 10 mins later the world just seems like it's full of shit, tbh atm my mind is at what i call self help zone, im only 17 but i feel i shouldnt be changeing moods this drastically and i shouldnt have been like this since i was 5? 

I'm probably incredibly wrong and nothing will be the matter but i just don't give one anymore and wondering what the point in life is.

Edit: very much aware im at a young age many opportunities ect. but heard that a thousand times and saw it split my parents up as they believed the same bull. i want to push myself in life but so many pople seem wrapped up in there own bull, so many post on reddit and people on it have made me have some hope but then day to day i see so little kindness makes me just wonder why people live when they hate eachother so much
