16 year old in highschool and I want to dieHello Iâ€™m 15 year old boy turning 16 next month. I suffer from severe anxiety that makes me feel like Iâ€™m having a heart attack. I have no friends or family to support me and i have to go back to school next week where I get bullied every day physically and verbally because Iâ€™m super skinny, I weigh in around 90 pounds and Iâ€™m a 5â€™7 male. At school I get punched, threatened, and pushed around. People call me skinny twig because of my brown skin and my skinny arms and girls at school laugh at me like Iâ€™m a clown in a circus show and talk behind my back. I would work out but I barley have any energy to wake up everyday. I canâ€™t do anything right Iâ€™m very stupid in every subject at school, I find it almost impossible to study because my mind races so fast and I canâ€™t sit still. I also get bullied for my stupidity by my family and classmates starting from a young age, I didnâ€™t know my abcs till grade 3 and my 3rd grade teacher made me go to to this health place to check if I had autism or Down syndrome which I didnâ€™t. I took all normal classes but I have managed to barley pass through all of them by cheating and Iâ€™m now heading into grade 11. I also donâ€™t play any sports and Iâ€™m shit at all of them, and I donâ€™t have any hobbies or enjoy anything in life. My father is an alcoholic that cheats on my mom(btw she doesnâ€™t know only I do and I havenâ€™t said anything) and sometimes i take vodka from my dads cabinet and take multiple shots to make my anxiety go away but it doesnâ€™t. I also have a job at a fast food chain where I even get picked on by my coworkers and my manger calls me an idiot/retard because I canâ€™t remember how to do simple tasks at my job that Iâ€™ve been working at for months and I do things Like miscount change on the register because of my stupidity and my anxiety being under pressure. My severe social anxiety gets really bad at work sometimes so I go to the work bathroom and cry when I feel like Iâ€™m dying on the inside or if feels like Iâ€™m having a heart attack. Iâ€™ve been threatened to be fired many times but I surprisingly havenâ€™t. Every day I want to end my life because there is no point In living and I have no future. Iâ€™m also a loser addicted to porn, I jack off three times a day because it gives me dopamine for a couple seconds so I feel better. I will end it very soon I know Iâ€™m young but I donâ€™t care I donâ€™t want to live anymore. I heard Xanax stops depression and anxiety if I kill myself I know a drug dealer at my school that might sell Xanax bars I might od on those or I will shoot myself with my one of my dads three guns a sks, glock, or pump shotgun and go out quick.
