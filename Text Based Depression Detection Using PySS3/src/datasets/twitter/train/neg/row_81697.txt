I posted this in r/depression but I became aware that it belongs hereI'm so tired of life. I am heading down a dark road. I am unsure if I the only person I consider a friend shares the opinion, or are they just pretending to satisfy some feeling of accomplishment. I'm tired of the all the lies people say to make themselves feel better about themselves. I'm tired of the games people play, with no regard to the feelings of others. I'm tired of trying to make friends with someone and hear that person go on and on with misleading accounts and obviously fake stories about other people. Is there no one else in this world that doesn't want to partake in bullshit stories and exaggerations. I'm also tired of working off my ass to pay child support to a woman that I once loved. Now I can't afford to live. I'm just tired of trying. Everyday I wish that I don't wake up but I am disappointed by the alarm ringing every morning. I don't know how much more if this I can handle. I already don't want to handle anymore of it. I hate what I have became, I have had a poor life in the 3 plus decades I have been alive. I'm not equipped to have a decent life. I have bent over backwards for so called friends. I'm done trying, its way to tiring.
