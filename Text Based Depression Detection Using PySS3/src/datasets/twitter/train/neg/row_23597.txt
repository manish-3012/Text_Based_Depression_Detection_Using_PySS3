Last postI just took three pills of potassium cyanide.  Should be about a gram.   Now I sit here, outside my lawyers office, waiting to die, for the pill casing to dissolve, and for me to pass on into the great beyond.

I lost an important battle today, though it was one lost well after the war had ended.  There is nothing left for me here, and I should have died long ago.

Goodbye Patrick.  Even with the abuse you dished out, I still wanted to work things through.  We'd never be friends, and I knew that.  But I needed your help.

I'm sorry to all of you.  I've given up.
