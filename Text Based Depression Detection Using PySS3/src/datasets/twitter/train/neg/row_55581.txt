The one person I thought I could count on has left.I have had the same best friend for over 4 years. She's closer than a sister to me. When I was in a psych hospital last year, she and her family were the only non blood relatives who I talked to. 
She has stopped responding to my texts for like a week, and I'm starting to think she doesn't want to be my friend anymore. She's been there for me through everything. She was my rock. I don't understand why this is happening. If she's dropping me, who else will? I'm devastated. I just want to curl up and die. I hate this. For so long she gave me a reason to stay alive but now even she is gone. What else do I have left. I'm nothing.
