I feel so trappedThis is a throwaway acct cause my irl friends know my main one :/

Idk what happened, I was doing so well. Iâ€™m on my senior year of high school, have good grades, got a great scholarship to my dream school, have amazing friends, and a wonderful boyfriend who Iâ€™ve been with for almost 9 months. 

And i donâ€™t understand. I fucked it all up. My depression hit me harder than it ever has before about a week ago and i just feel so numb. I donâ€™t care about anyone or anything. I used to be such a kind and polite person, but Iâ€™m lashing out at everyone. My boyfriend is taking the worst of it. Itâ€™s like an out of body experience, like someone else has control. I watch myself from a third person perspective as I berate him and argue with him over the tiniest of issues. I feel like I donâ€™t love him anymore, but thatâ€™s because I donâ€™t love anything anymore.

I wanna stay with him, but I wanna leave at the same time because I feel like all Iâ€™m doing is hurting him. Iâ€™ve been pushing all my friends away by flat out ghosting them and I just want everyone to let me die in peace. Why canâ€™t they see this is what I want?

I just wanna fall asleep gently and never wake up, and I have no one even think about me ever again. Whatâ€™s wrong with me??? I have so much to be grateful for but I hate it all and I canâ€™t stop thinking of destroying my own life, then killing myself.
