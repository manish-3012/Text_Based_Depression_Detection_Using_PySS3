I dont know what to do anymoreEvery day I just want to fucking die. It hurts to wake up. I know that my sound ironic and edgy to most but that's how society is. I'm too scared to kill my self just yet, but whenever I try to go to someone for help- especially my friends they just laugh at me and nor do they care a single bit. Once I tried talking to one of them and he just said that I don't have a reason to be depressed, and it just hurt me so bad and I just can't stop thinking about it. And it makes me think like I'm going insane even though it's no big deal, but it just hurts and I don't know why. I wouldn't even dare to try speaking to a teacher or mentor at my school because it's fucking corrupt and they'd probably just isolate me from lessons like they usually do. I'm too scared to talk to my family because knowing them, they would think I'm attention seeking and not believe me and ironically theyre part of the reason why I hate my life. I just don't know what to do at this point
