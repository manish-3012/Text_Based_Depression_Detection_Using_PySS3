where exactly is "me"?where is me? the me that was so innocent and happy? where is the me that used to play with dolls and living in her head for so long? creating stories and getting so excited over new dolls
and new things? where is the me that lived with a balanced mind? where is the me that had control? where is the me that wasn't such a numb fat piece of shit? where is the me that felt normal with herself?
felt okay with herself
did i really feel okay with myself?
now that i think about it
i never felt okay or normal
i always had this deep feeling hidden in me 
feeling of worthlessness and like i'm just a waste
i never felt worthy....i never felt confident
i never felt safe ...in me nor in the outside 
i never had set goals or plans
i was just living aimlessly like a ship floating in the air
with no care for anything
with no power or motivation to even get anywhere
how am i supposed to live with the new me? im just getting worse and worse
i just take and never give back
