My cousin would have been 23 todayHe took his life when he was 15. 

Is it weird to still think about it? To wish I could have read the note, to wish he'd left me something to remember him by? To wish my last words to him weren't what they were? To wish I'd told him I loved him? That I still love him? To wonder what he'd be doing now if he were still alive, to feel completely and utterly alone because I'm not sure anyone else in my family cares? Am I the weird one?
