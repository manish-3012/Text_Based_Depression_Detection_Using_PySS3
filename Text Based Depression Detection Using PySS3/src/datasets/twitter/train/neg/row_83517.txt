Third time a charm?I only stop myself because my best pup is winding down to die (heâ€™s 17).

Once heâ€™s gone I am left with nothing.

My first try was wrists the long (proper way) but my golf buddy found me.

My 2nd was a 4 foot drop hanging. The anchor came out after 3 minutes.

This time I am going to cut my throat and be done. No coming back.

I didnâ€™t want to leave a big mess but Iâ€™m starting to think it doesnâ€™t matter.

I have guns but I donâ€™t want to leave a negative gun legacy to let people take them away from people.

My life has been shit, emotionally, for the last decade.

I have more than enough money but, contrary to belief, money is false security and fake friends.

I have no real people in my life, not even my wife ...she chews me out about making more money, smoking, watching â€œshittyâ€ movies ...then, oddly, not working enough.

Then she complains that I go to bed too early but if I stay up I get ripped on for not going to bed.

Iâ€™m done, kids.

Iâ€™ll wait until I have to put my boy down but then Iâ€™m gone via my drugs or I really think slicing my throat.
