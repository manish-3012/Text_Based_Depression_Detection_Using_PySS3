Can I have a... pen pal? I need someone I can talk to more regularly that I can relate to. Or maybe a small group?Hi. So, I I've been diagnosed with clinical depression with some signs of borderline personality disorder. I do therapy. I take my medicines. I try to live a functional life. I try to ignore my intrusive suicidal thoughts. But on some days...it's impossible. :/ I live with so much self loathing. And I feel annoying to talk about to my friends..or my partner. How much can he constantly reassure me. Small small things trigger me. And I can tell that it's not necessary for me to. But I can't help it. I ruminate so much about past mistakes. Mistakes that have been forgiven and forgotten by the people i had wronged. But I can't forgive myself for it. I am convinced that my end is near. And through suicide. 

But I wanna get better. A part of me does. I want to be happy. And normal. And enjoy day to day things. But I also need to get things out of my chest as and when. Don't worry. I don't intend for this to replace therapy in ANY way. 

I thought maybe we could have an anonymous group where we can just occasionally share how we're doing. Some basic info about me. I'm 27. Indian. Female. Working. I'd really love to connect with others from similar age groups and contexts. :)
