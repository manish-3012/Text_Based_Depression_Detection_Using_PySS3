Depressed because Iâ€™m an extremely dull individual.Iâ€™ve basically bored everyone out of my life.  I ended up getting depressed and taking meds.  But am I depressed because Iâ€™m a loser, or because of an imbalance.  I think itâ€™s the first.  I donâ€™t even have the supposedly human ability to be friendly even if I wanted to.
