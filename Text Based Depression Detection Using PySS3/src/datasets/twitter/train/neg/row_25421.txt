Can't shake this feeling.I'm miserable. I want so bad to be happy but I can't be happy. I love my kids. I love my wife. I love my family. But my wife doesn't love me. She said she's giving us 6 months to try to figure things out, but if nothing works, she wants a divorce. My heart hurts so much. I don't want to do this anymore. I'm in the bathroom at work crying right now and I don't see any other way to stop this feeling. I'm sorry.
