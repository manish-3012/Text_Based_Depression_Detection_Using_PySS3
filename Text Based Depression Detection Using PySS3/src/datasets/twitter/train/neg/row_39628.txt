Nothing ever gets better, thatâ€™s a lie people say to try to make you feel better, but donâ€™t get it twisted, it is a lieIâ€™m tired of existing and just taking up space and oxygen. Some of us are truly trash and donâ€™t deserve to be alive. I have nothing to offer the world, Iâ€™m not happy. My kids arenâ€™t enough to keep me going anymore. 
Iâ€™m at the pharmacy waiting for my anti-depressants, but only because thatâ€™s what youâ€™re supposed to do, right? Care? Itâ€™s just going to prolong this hopelessness and helplessness Iâ€™m feeling. 
I donâ€™t want to die, but Iâ€™m so tired of life. Nothing good ever happens. I miss drugs. Iâ€™m tired of feeling. I want to be numb. 
Iâ€™ve never tried hard drugs but today I was thinking maybe going to NA and asking someone for their dealerâ€™a number and OD on several things, hoping itâ€™ll be fast and painless. 
But Iâ€™m not there, at least not yet. Iâ€™m close though, thatâ€™s why I came for the meds. 
I hate myself. I hate my life. I donâ€™t have anyone besides my children and one is already an adult. 
Why bother? Itâ€™s all too much. 
Something happened and now im grappling with my faith - if God were real he wouldnâ€™t do what he did to my kid.
