Absolute end of the figurative ropeI've posted here before and didn't really find anything; baseless advice that never works, no responses and the like. Nothing that ever really helped.

No, I am posting here mainly just to ramble and in hopes of finding some form of help or of at least someone to talk to, even for a short period of time. I am not even sure how to begin, as per usual when I write, but that's the same for most people, though.

I am a failure, that is the best way to put it; so short and to the point, and a complete truth of reality. I have no problem accepting this reality, but in accepting the fact I have to live this reality;

Three years of tutoring, extra classes and two year-long classes and I still failed Algebra I; so much effort, so much wasted time.

One quarter of German; one quarter of sleepless nights, of social idolization for studying, studying during every single bit of free time that wasn't school, restrooms, eating or sleeping. So much extreme effort, so much work, only to end in failure and the absolute **destruction** of **every** single "dream" I have. All dreams were absolutely crushed when I had to drop the class mid-way through; so much hard work so much support. Even now I can't stop myself from getting chocked up and tearing up from the experience. 

Exercise they tell you, dieting they tell you, "Do these and you will loose weight!", I have never heard such a load of complete shit. Classes, biking, hiking, working out daily, dieting, and I only gain weight. I am ready fucking starve myself at this point just to loose some weight, dieting and exercise are only a waste of time that don't do anything. Same goes for trying to get "stronger".

It is due to the fact that I have such a horrible memory and that I am absolutely horrible at math that I cannot go to college in two years. Isn't that bloody perfect? I work for fifteen years for bum-fuckin' nothing!; It is due to my memory and that I will not learn a language and will be stuck in this god-forsaken piece of crap country. I am fucking willing to live poor, to live as a damned sanitation worker if I had to to be able to live in Germany or Norway; but no, I can't even learn basic German or Spanish or Norwegian or French.

Without a degree I can't even move to Canada; without a degree or learning the language, I cannot move to Germany or Norway, and that is if I even manage to get hired.

Food is either bland or disgusting, either way it is terrible. Nothing tastes "good" anymore.

Sleep is useless, I don't even find respite in my dreams. Why? Well what do you know I don't dream. No, it is just a brief period of darkness then back into being depressed.

Even masturbation isn't any good, it's more of a chore than for pleasure.

~~~~~

tl;dr: I'm a failure, my hard work has been for naught and have no reason to continue on.

I **highly** doubt anyone read this, but oh well.

Will edit if I find I've missed a point.

I also would like to apologize for the language.

**Edit**: I forgot to mention, I'm a homosexual.
