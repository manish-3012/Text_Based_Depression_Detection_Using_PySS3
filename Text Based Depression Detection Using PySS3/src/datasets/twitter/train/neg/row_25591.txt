Idk whatâ€™s wrong with meIâ€™m really depressed. I have no motivation. I have glimpse of happiness then itâ€™s back to feeling terrible. Words honestly canâ€™t explain how I feel tbh. I donâ€™t feel like I should live because living like  this isnâ€™t life. Ik other people feel the same way but that doesnâ€™t make me feel any better tbh. Honestly I only see myself commiting suicide or living the rest of my life like this and I really donâ€™t want to so.....  honestly Iâ€™m not looking for feedback cause Iâ€™ve made my mind up tbh I just wanted a to explain this lol
