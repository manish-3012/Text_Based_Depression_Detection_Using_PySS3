Give me a reason to continueI've been commited again. It's the fourth time and it seems like this life is just a hamster wheel where I keep running without getting anywhere. I just went through a breakup and some difficulties at work (I want so badly to function in a job and I felt like it was going well up until now). I do struggle with some things from the past as well, like incest and rape, and it feels like I'm doomed to live a life I don't handle very well because of this. I'm recieving good help in the health system but I always keep coming back to the conclusion that they are wrong, and the only rational thing is to leave this world.

I have tons of family and friends who love and support me, and they are the reason why I keep on living, as well as my dog. I know I am fortunate to have them but it also makes me feel trapped, because I have to live for them and not for myself. If it was up to me I'd free myself from this life. 

I don't know what I need you to say but if I'm going to stay alive I need some good reasons except doing it for other people's sake.
