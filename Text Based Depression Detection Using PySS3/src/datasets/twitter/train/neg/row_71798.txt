Apparently I even suck at trying to kill myselfSo...since I was ~15 I've tried to kill myself about 4 times. Apparently I'm either not very good at it or just simply have bad luck.

I'm now 26 and really don't know what to do. 

I usually get told things like "life is too precious", or "it'll get better at some point". Yeah, right. It hasn't gotten better,

Thinking about trying it one last time. Maybe I'll lock the door and hang myself. Maybe I'll just swallow a ton of tide pods. Those seem to be quite popular right now. I heard acid works. Maybe a shotgun.

I really can't go on like this any more. I've tried turning my life around. I've tried therapy. I've tried medical intervention. Nothing has helped. I still feel like a piece of shit pretty much every day.



Please help me.
