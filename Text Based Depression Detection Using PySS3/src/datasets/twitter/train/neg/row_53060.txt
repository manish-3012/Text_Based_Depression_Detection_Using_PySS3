I Donâ€™t have the energy to keep goingTodayâ€™s just not going well for me. I just fucking hate being alive and being in so much emotional pain. I know this feeling will never end or go away. Iâ€™m not meant to ever be happy or loved. so why not just die so I can at least stop feeling this way. Iâ€™m tired of trying. Waking up feeling like this everyday is fucking horrible. And to top it off itâ€™s a fucking holiday. I hate being around family gatherings. everyone acting happy around you and not communicating with you and yet Your supposed to sit there with a smile on my face. Iâ€™m just over it.
