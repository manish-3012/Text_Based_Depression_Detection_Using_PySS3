Im really trying not to harm myself right nowMy mom just called me an invalid for lying in bed all day. For some reason it hurt?? I deserve it and its true but it hurt. I should stop being lazy. But i cant bring myself to stand up. I hate myself so much. 
I want to die to put the weight off everybody's shoulders.
