The main thing stopping me [Vent]The main reason that Iâ€™m not dead already is, I really donâ€™t know how to, like I do know the different methods but I donâ€™t know how I would perform them, 

After I think of that I then think of the people around me, and I always feel that only my mother would really care, my â€˜friendsâ€™ all seem to be trying to avoid me recently and I havenâ€™t been able to connect to people as much anymore, Iâ€™ve basically stopped doing the things I love just to lay around and cry, whenever Iâ€™m at school my anxiety gets really bad and as soon as I can get to an empty closed space I just lay on the ground and cry and panic and I always fear for my life for some reason, 

I donâ€™t know, I just feel defeated all the time
