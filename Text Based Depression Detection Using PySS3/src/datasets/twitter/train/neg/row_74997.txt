Finally hit rock bottom and no one is here to help me.Iâ€™ve thought about suicide for a few years but itâ€™s always been a logical option for me. I never understood what people meant by not feeling safe until now really. I hit rock bottom a few days ago, the doctor sent me to the crisis team and for the first time ever I was honest that I go through flits of either wanting to kill my self or being scared that Iâ€™m going to ...

They sent me away with a number to call and a few diazepam pills. The doctor was nice but the nurse he was brash and having a go at me because he couldnâ€™t understand me between my sobs and I couldnâ€™t understand him through his brash Nigerian accent. 

Today I find myself in the forestry about ready for this all to be over, I have everything I need but the part of me that wants to make it reached out one last time and called that number, only to get the same guy tell me that I just need to deal with it basically. I tried to tell him I tried and cannot but he doesnâ€™t give 2 shits and told me to call the doctors to get an emergency appointment for some zopiclone. So I try that and they have no appointments until tomorrow which Iâ€™m not sure I am gonna make.

So now here I am, feels like I have no option now. Iâ€™m just gutted because all the times I was stern in that I wouldnâ€™t reach out and would just do it, and then I actually did and it was pointless because in reality they donâ€™t really give a shit.
