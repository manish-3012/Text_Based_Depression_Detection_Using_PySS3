It's going to be an accident...You know, I've always been prone to depression.   I've learned to deal with it. I've realized that depression is usually just a symptom.  When it happens, you exercise, you adjust the diet, you take some b vitamins and sam-e and usually you get through it.   

But You never do answer that question though..."are you right?" "Are you right to want to die?"

By many standards I have a great life. 

I live in an amazing place. I have an apartment that is to die for (har har) 
I have a wife that people refer to (often gay men) as being "one of the most beautiful women in the world"

But I just can't hold my head high. I'm a broken man and I just don't know if I can fix myself this time.
