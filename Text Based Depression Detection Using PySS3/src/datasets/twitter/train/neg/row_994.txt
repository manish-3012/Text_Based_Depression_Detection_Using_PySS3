2 years ago I posted here and now I'm back.I posted here 2 years ago when it was almost my bday and I was freaking out. I think I also called the suicide hot line. Well 2 years of trying by ass off to be better at life and it's got worse. 
Now I'm almost 30. In April I will be. Since then I have had 2 jobs thinking that was the problem. Nope. Maybe it was, maybe it wasn't but I think it's me. Went from one gob to the same one different company, same shit happened. So I switch it up and go to a different job entirely. Kinda. Gas station manager to manager of a beauty store. 
Same shit. Under paid for all the work I do with no help and then I get in trouble for things that are literally NOTHING to do with me. Super long stories that I'm not going to get into. Each time I left because I put my mental health before a shirt retail job. 
Any way now I'm lost and don't know what to do. Earlier I tried to post on financial help sub and got bombarded with so many horrible things that now I'm super right back into holy shit just kill you self mode. 
I've been told every thing I could possibly to do improve my life and career and I have tried everything thing. 
Right now I just want to hear about the good that can happen in life. I just need some hope I guess. If I could drink I would just drink and pass out and wake up and do it all over again like a zombie that I was for years and years in my early 20s. Now I have an ulcer and can't drink, and can't afford any of the drugs that I want to do to get me through this. 
I'm hoping maybe I can just read something to make me smile and give a little hope that maybe, just maybe something good will happen to me that will give me a reason to live.
