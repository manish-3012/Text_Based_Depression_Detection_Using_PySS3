Working through my issues I want to talk about my shit but I have an issue with being so self sacrificing that I don't want to make everyone feel sorry for me.

Long story short, I need to learn to stop putting myself out for people, especially my  best friend. She is unknowingly taking advantage of me and kinda friendzoning me. 

Also  does anyone know a good game I can distract myself with? 


I think I need help letting go...
