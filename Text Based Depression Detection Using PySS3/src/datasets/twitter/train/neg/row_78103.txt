I'm going to overdose tonight.im 16. I have been a drug user for a little over a year now. I ordered drugs online and my parents caught me doing it, this happened today. My mom has hated me for the last several months, I know she would be happier without me. Life is too boring without drugs, I am just going to end it tonight. It will probably make my mother happy. I have morphine, benzos, and alcohol. Reddit has been a great place to escape for me for the last year. I'm sorry to my friends and family that have to find me. Im sorry to anyone I've hurt. The world is a shitty place and I hope there's something better out there.
