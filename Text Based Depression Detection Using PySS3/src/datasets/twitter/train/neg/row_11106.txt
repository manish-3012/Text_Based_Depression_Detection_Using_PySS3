Iâ€™ve never considered myself capable of suicide, but lately itâ€™s been harder and harder to keep goingIâ€™ve been struggling with depression for much of my life but have gotten by with a positive attitude, even though thatâ€™s a bit contradictory. The last year and a half Iâ€™ve been dealing with a bad ankle injury that has me in chronic pain and discomfort every waking second of the day, and making it difficult to sleep every night. I sacrifice my wellbeing for my job and passion, which is teaching math in schools and running and coaching a youth ultimate league, and have devoted everything to that lately. Itâ€™s the only thing keeping me going, as being 24 and anti social and depressed in my free time, my evenings are spent alone and in pain. 

Today though I dislocated my shoulder, for the third time. I know what lies ahead of me in this recovery, I know Iâ€™ll probably have to get surgery (I recently had surgery done on my ankle, but it only seems to keep getting worse). All I can see in my future is more pain, discomfort, loneliness, emptyness. I have people that care about me and support me, but I canâ€™t bring myself to be honest with them as to how bad I am actually doing. I am starting to lose hope my ankle will ever get better, and now with the shoulder injury it is just all too much. It seems like all I will ever know is pain and discomfort. The shoulder on top of the ankle is just so crushing to the tiny bit of fighting spirit I have left, and now I am in double the pain and discomfort and there is no position, movement or anything I can do without it flaring up. I am terrified of trying to sleep tonight, that it wonâ€™t be possible or if I manage, that my shoulder will pop out. Iâ€™m also getting to the point where I canâ€™t work or coach anymore, the pain is too much, and without that work keeping me up..

The only thing thatâ€™s always prevented myself from attempting suicide is what that would do to my family and the students Iâ€™ve taught and mentored. I donâ€™t think I could ever bring myself to do that to them. But I just feel trapped and without hope. Iâ€™m not sure if this is the place to post this, or what I want from posting this. Iâ€™ve never had anyone in my life Iâ€™ve been open and talked honestly with about whatâ€™s truly going on, I always try to put on a positive and cheerful attitude so people donâ€™t have to worry over me. I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™ll respond to any of you, just writing this itself is a bit helpful. But thank you for reading, and thank you in advance if you feel inclined to reply with your support. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m posting this to seek peopleâ€™s love and support, more to just get it out.
