Iâ€™m not sure..Sorry for the click-baity title.. I just wasnâ€™t sure what would be appropriate. 

To be honest, I am not sure why Iâ€™m even writing this. I just hope getting some of this off of my shoulders will help. For the last two years, I have been struggling. I break down and cry almost every other night and I can barely find the motivation to get out of bed.  

I donâ€™t want to die. That much is so clear to me. As true as that is, I donâ€™t want to live either, and the turmoil inside my head as I get to reconcile these two facts is pushing me closer and closer to the edge. I almost did it, you know? 
Laying alone in my apartment. I put a gun to my head, and my finger touched that trigger.. I couldnâ€™t do it. I was disgusted with myself. I cried for hours, thinking about what my actions would do to my mother and father. My friends. My poor roommate, who would have found the mess. Itâ€™s such a horrible and selfish thing for me to do, at least thatâ€™s what I told myself. I havenâ€™t been the same since and they know it. I sit here tonight and think, is what Iâ€™m doing now more of a burden on them than the pain from my loss? When they see me I know they know. They worry. Iâ€™m probably stressing my poor mother out more being a shell of myself than if I had just pulled that trigger. 

I donâ€™t know how much longer I can put this off. I canâ€™t remember the light. I know it isnâ€™t coming back. 


Sorry to waste your time.
