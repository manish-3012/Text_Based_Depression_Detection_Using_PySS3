Car crash at 100mph with no seat belt23 year old female... In 2018 I was raped while unconscious. I moved cities a few months after that to  run away and start over. In 2019 I became a bottle girl, sugar baby (aka prostitute), and cam girl because I clearly love to self sabotage and didnâ€™t know how to get myself professional help. Each â€œjobâ€ was traumatizing enough but the cam girl part has introduced me to a level of darkness I didnâ€™t know existed. And thatâ€™s saying a lot... Ive been severely depressed and anxious since I can remember (physically and emotionally abusive father). Anyways, I found out Iâ€™m all over the internet with the new and improved facial recognition search engines. (I search them like every month and was fine up until last week). I truly want to be dead but canâ€™t kill myself because of my mother. Would police be able to tell the difference between losing control of my car and purposely steering into a tree? Chances of survival at 100mph are next to nothing. Im so selfish that I purposely go 85-100mph on the highway everyday hoping and praying I lose control. I always get too scared to turn the wheel. I donâ€™t even feel real. I donâ€™t even know where my soul went... When I think of myself as a little girl with a tiny ounce of hope in her.... I realize sheâ€™s completely gone. The amount of shame and guilt I feel must be what people feel when they murder someone. I canâ€™t even express what this dark cloud on my soul feels life. There is no point anymore.
