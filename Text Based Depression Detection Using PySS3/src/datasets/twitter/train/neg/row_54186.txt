I want my friends to know I'm sufferingIs that selfish? I know I shouldn't burden them with my mental health, but I'd like them to recognise that I am hurting.
Sometimes I think about hospitalising myself just so they can see that I'm suffering. 
Life doesnt feel like it can fer much better, or progress. I'd give anything to stop existing. - not die, but just stop existing until things change, if they change.
