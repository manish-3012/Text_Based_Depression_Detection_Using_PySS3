I feel suicidal, but not going to do it, and just really need to talkI'm late on my period. The guy I knew on and off again for 2 years politely told me to fuck off. I'm a legal adult, but my mom won't talk to me if I told her this. She once stopped talking to me because I wanted to get on foodstamps. We weren't even fighting and she just clammed up.

I feel like a really hormonal wreck for some reason right now. I have never felt this low before, even when sad and crying. On the way home from work all I could think about was getting a gun and blowing my brains out, but then I remembered that I could have a kid on the way.

The first test had a faint line appear after the control time. The others came back negative, but I still haven't had a period. I always get my period on time and can track it to the exact day. I am one week late now and have a doctor's appointment in a day or so.

I can't do an abortion. I would feel awful. If I give it up that means telling my family about it. I have food cravings and I have gained 4 pounds.

I don't know what to do and just need to talk.
