If this is all I am living for....If this is all I am living for then why am I doing it? All I do everyday is go through the motions totally detached emotionally and physically from everything and everyone. 
I No longer recognize my reflection in the mirror its, funny how things change.  This will be my last Christmas, and I won't see the new year. Its better for everyone.
