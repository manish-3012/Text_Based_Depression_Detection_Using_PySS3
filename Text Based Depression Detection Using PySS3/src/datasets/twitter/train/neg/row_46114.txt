Nature has made it clear to me that Iâ€™m not supposed to be hereYeah well Iâ€™m have a deadly illness at 15, I break every time I touch something, i was born the wrong gender, I catch an illness constantly, Iâ€™m always in surgery, Iâ€™m always rejected. Nature is trying to make it clear to me that I donâ€™t fucking belong. I should just up and die thereâ€™s nothing here for me, Iâ€™m clearly never destined for happiness. Itâ€™s fucking bullshit to think in ten years Iâ€™m gonna be happy and healthy because thatâ€™s not fucking possible. Iâ€™ll probably be dead by then and itâ€™s better to let myself handle that than nature
