Iâ€™ll stop I swearCan I just die? Please let me Iâ€™m so paranoid about everything but I truly believe everyone around me will eventually leave. In my mind itâ€™s inevitable. I really want to die and thatâ€™s gotten worse ever since I promised to stop self harming. Itâ€™s so fucking hard and it hasnâ€™t even been that long. I hate it. I thought it would be easy I didnâ€™t realize how much I relied on it to keep me sane. I didnâ€™t think I ever got addicted to it despite the fact that Iâ€™ve been doing it for two years. I thought I could stop but itâ€™s so hard. My friends have all slowly left me one by one. Iâ€™m doing something wrong with my friendships but I donâ€™t know what. I treat everyone nicely and I smile and pretend Iâ€™m happy so they donâ€™t worry I try to keep it all to myself so no one worries. What am I doing wrong? I keep to myself to avoid hurting others or bothering them in general. I allow people to step all over me even though Iâ€™m aware of it. I let them, Iâ€™m nice, Iâ€™ve never spread a rumor, never cried in public. Iâ€™ve never tried to hurt anyone and yet I hurt everyone. Itâ€™s my personality isnâ€™t it? Itâ€™s just me Iâ€™m a terrible person to be around I should just kill myself. Iâ€™m hurting the ones I love most and I see them leave all of my friends left and I donâ€™t have the heart to make new ones so kill me please kill me
