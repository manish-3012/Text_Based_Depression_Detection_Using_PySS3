I've been thinking about killing myself again.It seems like whenever things are starting to turn up, I get punched in the gut. My friends haven't been talking to me, I can't concentrate on anything and I can't shake this feeling of dread and despair. Every day I get closer and closer to just ending it. I wish I could be what everyone needs me to be. I wish I could be enough. But I never will be.
