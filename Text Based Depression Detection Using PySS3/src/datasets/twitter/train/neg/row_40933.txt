Me againLol at me posting here all of the time. How sad. Just want to kill myself because all i do is sit in my apartment being all stressed out, lonely, and single. Fucking hate this shit man. Dating makes me want to hang myself. Anyone else just ruminate constantly? No matter what there's just so many frustrations. I hate being so tiny.
