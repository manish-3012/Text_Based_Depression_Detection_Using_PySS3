chronic pain and suicideI have had chronic pain for about 15 years. I have thought about suicide for about 5 years mostly passively. in the last 6 to 12 months I've been thinking of it seriously especially after I almost died of repiratory failure (9 days  hospital 4 days I scu had tubes and coma for 3 days) four months ago. my doctor dropped my opoids by 75% due to cdc guidelines we're trying other things but not helping much. my doctor got wind of it all you have to say is you're safe and they'll wait. Ican't take it anymore had a plan but had to change it has to look like an accident so wife can collect ins. but I don' want to look like goop afterwards. once I figure this out it's bye bye (suggestion) anybody else with chronic pain thinking of suicide
