I feel like Iâ€™m afraid of everything, I canâ€™t make connectionsI could have tried harder, but I have tried to make friends in college. Iâ€™ve joined clubs and activities, and I do know a good amount of people. Itâ€™s just that these people all have their own friend groups, and weâ€™re too deep in for me to sit down with a random person in the dining hall. This past year has been the worst year of my life. No matter what I do I just canâ€™t connect with these people, and Iâ€™ve given up at this point, I always feel like Iâ€™m coming off as too desperate

I just donâ€™t want to be alone. It seems like everyone has it together. Maybe they were faking it first semester, but now everyoneâ€™s fine. I never got over that first hump, and itâ€™s killing me. Iâ€™m tired of being scared of going to the dining hall because itâ€™s crowded and people I know will see me eating alone. Iâ€™m tired of all this shit, and I feel like I donâ€™t know how to fix it
