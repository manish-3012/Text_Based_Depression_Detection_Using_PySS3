Motivate me to cutCome on, you're all human, you all want to hurt people
Motivate me to cut myself, I'll take pictures and show you
Why? Because I hate this fucking world. All the shit I thought counselling and meds had solved, as soon as you lose that lifeline, it comes flooding back. And I can't fucking take it.

Kill me. That's the kind of shit you people get karma for
