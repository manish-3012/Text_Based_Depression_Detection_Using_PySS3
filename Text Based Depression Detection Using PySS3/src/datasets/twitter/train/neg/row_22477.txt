I'm sorry to take time away from the people who need itHello all

I'm meant to be filling out a seas application for special consideration for VCE (victorian year 12 in case you have no idea what that it) Its basically to show universities that I had a really bad year and my grades don't reflect my ability due to my circumstances. 

I don't wanna take up every ones times with things that don't really matter but my abuse was physical and emotional. I intrinsically dealt with things and never saw support which led to it all compounding and coming out in extreme bouts of depression and suicidal thoughts as well as toxic masculinity where I just didn't talk about my feelings and hated myself for feeling that way. But, I  continuously throughout year 11 and 12 I would break down after being the happiest I'd been and end up finding myself on ledges of buildings or train stations. 

Fast forward to mid September it's been my darkest time and my I could finally see things from another view I didn't hate myself. I didn't think it was all my fault. I thought I was worth it I didn't deserve what happened to me. And so I've been the happiest ever for the past 2 years. Now that the due date for the application has come round. I don't want to admit that I was a victim of the things because I've "gotten past it" and therefore "it didn't happen". 

I'm asking if you guys think it would be worth it to fill out the form and express my struggles or not. Because it goes against every thought of mine atm too.

P.s I know this isn't really related but DELETING SOCIAL MEDIA AND CONNECTING PEOPLE IN REAL LIFE as hard as it was at the start REALLY HELPED my depression and social anxiety
