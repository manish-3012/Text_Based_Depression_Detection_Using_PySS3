I am so jadedI don't wanna make this post long, but where should I start...

first let me assure you that I don't think I'll commit a suicide, I tried once before, few years ago but don't think I'll do it..

I am married to someone who I don't like, she's abusive, greedy, materialistic, liar, and insecure, the only reason I am not walking away is that she loves me, and I feel sorry for her every time I try to walk out.

that's not it, I lost my daughter 6 months ago, she was only few weeks old, while the few days I lived with her were the best of my life, and gave me a big hope in life and got me motivated for a while, her death wasn't only disastrous on emotional level, but also on financial level, because of incubators, surgery for the wife, the burial, that got the best of me, and made me broke, but I tried to get up..

needless to say that affected my performance at work, also with the many promises I got from my boss about my promotion and my position in the company I work for, and he didn't fulfill any of them, so my performance went even lower, and I didn't care, because I lost all the motivation at work, and started looking for another job, didn't find any good ones.

So I stayed at work but again I lost all motivation, hope is just my dreams at night, waking up has became the worst thing that happens to me every morning...

Now I am getting fired (although I wanted to quit anyway) I am still broke, can't even get myself to go to job interviews, nor I am mentally able to even get myself to go to meetings to get funding for a startup...

I have committed a mental suicide,I am numb and lost, I've always been optimistic, I want to be optimistic and happy again.. but I don't know what to do..
