I'm finally emotionally in a better place, I'm still here and I want to stay. But still may commit suicide - please read to understand.I work for the restaurant industry as a graphic designer. I wasnâ€™t able to get recent samples of my work before the poo hit the rotating oscillator. 

Iâ€™m not sure the restaurant business isnâ€™t going to rebound as fast as everyone thinks. Too many people think this is going to go away and things go back to normal. I'm not so sure - I think the damage has been done.

I'm not sure of my future there, even things do bounce back, I'm not so sure I'll be getting the call to come back. I have severe emotional issues - ADHD, Bipolar 2, ASD.

I did a couple of Facebook/Instigram posts mentiong about needing samples of my work  - may have screwed myself with that. I've no idea, I wanted samples to get some work on the side while this goes on. I'm told this make me look like I'm not coming back. I've since deleted them.

I'm scared I'll end up shelving groceries at a Walmart, HEB or Kroger Or Homeless, both of those mean no medication. I'd be making minimum wage, that's enough money to eat on the cheap, maybe pay a bill. I'd still be sleeping on the street, again no medication.

Mentally I've been preparing for the fact I may have to walk out on everything I own, and live on the street. No medication, no help.

I'd rather die than go back. I'm mentally prepared to do that to. I don't want to do it, if push comes to shove, I can and will. 

I was the living dead before treatment. I actually have feelings now. I'm not going back. Ever.

Again thank you for reading.
