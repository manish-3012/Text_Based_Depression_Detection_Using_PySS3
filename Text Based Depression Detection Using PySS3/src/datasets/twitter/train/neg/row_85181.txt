Quarantine sucks when you're living with shit familyI dunno. I'd like to think that nobody cares about me in life

2 people I thought were good online friends turned around and abused me

My family abuses me 

It isn't fair but, not all of us can have a good life I guess

I'm, sure when I do die, people will start "crying" and saying "I didn't know" and "I always cared" but if they did they wouldn't have hurt me

So its all a lie
