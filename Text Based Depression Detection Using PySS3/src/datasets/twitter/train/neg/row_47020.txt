Gonna be homeless in a week. This is the end of the road for me- goodbye.When I first hit depression, my family/friends... well everyone.. was so supportive. They said they'd never leave my side and help me through everything. People really do love to spit out empty platitudes. 

Three years on, at 25, I'm completely alone. I've tried to die twice and failed. Because I failed I felt like there was some heavenly sign telling me to give life another go, that maybe I'm wrong, so I did try. Got a job, got a little studio apartment... felt a little better. 

Now I've been made redundant and shit's hit the fan, like God wanted to give me false hope just to take it all away and laugh in my face. I've been served an eviction notice. I haven't eaten in three days and strangely enough, I don't feel hungry. I can't afford my meds, not that I thought they were helping much, and I definitely can't afford to see my psych (who was helping even less). 

I'd much rather die than live on the streets, so now this is the divine calling, the sign from the heavens. I'm going to spend tomorrow going to a few sentimental places in my city where I have happy memories. Then, I'm going to take the bottle of wine that my deceased father gave to me when I turned 18 and head to the peer where we used to fish. 

I'm gonna drink half, listen to some of my favourite music and just think (for one last time). Then I'm gonna swallow my whole bottom of valium (50 pills have gotta do the trick), drink the other half, and when I start feeling drowsy I (hope I am of sound enough mind to) just fall into the ocean. 

Sounds like a nice way to go. I've had a few accounts over the years and I came to this sub often so farewell old friends. I hope you all find your way.
