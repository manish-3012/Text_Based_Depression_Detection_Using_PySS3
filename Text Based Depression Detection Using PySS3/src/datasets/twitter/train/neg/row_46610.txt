Iâ€™m not sure where else to goThe Suicide Prevention chat line is busy. 

My boyfriend of four years wants to complete suicide. For the past two months his mental health has been on a steady decline. Heâ€™s always struggled with manic depression and has ups and downs like anyone but this time he canâ€™t seem to pull through this funk. 

I feel guilty because I should have noticed the early signs when he started selling some stuff because â€œI donâ€™t need it anymore.â€ He also started drinking more and tries to hide it from me.

This week was the week that really confirmed where his head is at though. On Monday we got in a argument over something stupid initially but then he said he couldnâ€™t take it anymore. He claims that heâ€™s holding me back and Iâ€™m not reaching my full potential. He says heâ€™ll never be able to get a good job or support me in the ways that he thinks I deserve. (If it helps I just got my first ever job outside of retail at 27 and he just turned 29.) 

Every conversation since Monday is about how I deserve better and how I need to go and I need to leave him alone. He keeps pushing me away and I have this horrible feeling that one day heâ€™s not going to be there. 

He has told that he does plan on completing the act and thatâ€™s one of the reasons why he keeps pushing me away. Iâ€™m so scared. This is their person that I want to marry and have a family with but he only seeâ€™s himself holding me back instead of what a bright future we have. I donâ€™t know what to do and I donâ€™t want to lose him. 

He doesnâ€™t know that Iâ€™m asking for advice and I donâ€™t know what to do about getting him to seek help because his job doesnâ€™t provide health insurance and Iâ€™m still fairly new at my job to have insurance. I want him to get help more than anything. 

What should I do?
