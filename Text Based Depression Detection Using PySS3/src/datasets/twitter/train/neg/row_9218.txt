I really need help.I'm on my way to work as I'm typing this to force myself, I've been struggling with balding all my life and I'm at the point where I can't take it anymore. I've tried to convince myself that I look good but I can't get it off my chest. I was not going to go into work today because I need the money but I feel broken, I've been grinding and working out to give the illusion that I'm fine but I'm dying. I wake and wonder what is the point every fucking morning why do I get up and work 60 hour weeks and act happy when I have no free time. I feel trapped where I am and just want to escape somehow, I obsess over my head all the time how it looks how people will treat me. I can't quit another job because of depression but I can't keep putting in a fake face I feel like that commercial where the women applies her face every morning. I simply don't know what to do anymore and it's holding back my life because I have no drive or passion for anything anymore. Really I don't know how to look at myself anymore because I just look terrible and sad and I'm surrounded by all these people all the time that are happy. Everyone tells me that it's all in my head and not to stop worrying. I have a wedding coming up and I'm looking for anyway to get out of it.
My. mother and brother suffer from bipolar and depression and anxiety and I just need help, I'm not begging for compliments I just don't know what to do anymore. Here is some pictures of me I'm sorry for ranting but ive kept everything bottled so long that this feels so good to even type and post this, if you read through the whole thing thank you.
