The world just keeps screwing me overLetâ€™s see, where do I start. 
First I was born to a loving father and absolute bitch of a mother
Mother doesnâ€™t allow me to make any connections with my fathers side of the family
Mother thinks itâ€™s funny to lock me in my room, in the dark as punishment
Mother cheats on my father, they divorce
Mother doesnâ€™t allow me to make friends because itâ€™s too much work for her to drive me to a friends house
Mother finds a shithead for a boyfriend 
They constantly fight and show me what a terrible relationship is
Mother makes me scared of father because she constantly used him as a threat
I grow up alone until sophomore year of high school 
Start to make a few friends, they stab me in the back 
Next year, start a relationship with someone I loved
Have a nice relationship for a few years
Start to treat them like how my mother treated me so I pushed them away and hurt them
I constantly live with the guilt
We share the same friends, initially everythingâ€™s okay.
A nasty rumor spreads among our friends about me insulting my ex
Everyone starts sending me messages on how much they hate me and now doesnâ€™t want to be friends
I canâ€™t deal with this shit anymore
And now weâ€™re here. It may not seem like a lot to you but it weighs heavily on me. Iâ€™ve lost feelings of love with my mother, father, ex SO, and friends. I donâ€™t have anyone left and because of that I see no reason to stay.
