I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. Itâ€™s knowing you are worthless that gets you. I know being where we are is partly my own fault.
 I'm 24 years old. I have Asperger's syndrome.I live with my mother, a retired nurse. the last three years have been borrowed time  I can't drive, nor do I believe I could hold a job. It got too hard in high school, so I gave up and dropped out. When we had money to fight for and get me on disability, we didn't. Now we scrape by.  Most times we lose, we never come out on top

We are losing the fight, and soon weâ€™ll incur too much debt and be cut off. 

So many times in the last three years, especially the last five months or so, I've planned my suicide. I can't get us out of the hole. Most nights, when I'm alone in my room I can't get away from all the wrong choices, all the fear. Most nights I cry.  Last Tuesday I wrote out my last letter to my mom. Iâ€™m ready. I donâ€™t know why I havenâ€™t ended it yet. 

Maybe if I died, Mom would get help?  I drag her down.

I used to want to live until I hit 26. I assumed mom would live until then, and itâ€™s a good number. 
Iâ€™ll turn 25 next Sunday. But it means nothing to me anymore. 
I no longer have perfect days.
I canâ€™t do this another year. Iâ€™ve lost too much. Itâ€™s not worth it anymore. 
I know who I am, and I can't save us. 

Iâ€™m tired of fighting.

so Iâ€™m still here, but I donâ€™t know why.
