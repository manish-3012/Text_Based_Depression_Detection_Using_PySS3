Itâ€™s harder each minuteI feel so trapped and it hurts. I feel alone and that I donâ€™t deserve anything I have. I canâ€™t hardly take it. 
I have therapy tomorrow. I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™d do without that, but even there I feel like a bother.
I donâ€™t know if I can do another year like this. This time of year is terrible.
