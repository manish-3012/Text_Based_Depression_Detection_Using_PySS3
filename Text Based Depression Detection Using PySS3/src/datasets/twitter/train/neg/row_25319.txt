This is my suicide note.This is the last thing I'll ever write. It's funny, because at one point in my life I wanted to be a professional writer. It never happened.

Instead, I've spent my whole life thinking about killing myself. Seriously, I'm 44 years old and I've been contemplating suicide since I was eight. It's long overdue.

I love my wife, and I know this is going to hurt her, but I also know that the pain will pass. She's spent the last several years afraid that I'll kill myself, so she's prepared herself for it. I love her so much and I hate that this will hurt her, but it's better it happens now. She's still fairly young, so she'll be able to start over with someone else, and maybe spend the rest of her life with someone stronger who isn't an emotional and financial drain on her. The sooner I do this, the sooner she can start getting out of the debt I have caused her.

I have nothing to look forward to. I have nothing to retire on. I have no career. I've been unemployed for more than five years and I got turned down for disability because I live in a state that doesn't believe mental illness is a real thing. I'm trapped here and there's only one way out now.

I really, really wish my parents had decided not to become parents. It's really obvious now that my father never wanted kids and my mother only wanted them because she was desperately alone because she married a man who has always been emotionally dead on the inside.

There are others who will be sad, but they'll get over it. None of them are part of my day to day life, so for them, nothing will change at all.

I have to take care of some stuff before I can go and do this, but this is it. I'm really done now.

Goodbye, world. I'm sorry that we were never really meant for each other.
