6-7 years agoI remember my mind telling me to kill myself or that I was going to die very soon. I died inside shortly after, so maybe thats what it was refering too. I should have killed myself then. It would have been a better ending to my life. Maybe something was calling to me to tell me my journey was over. It certainly feels that way.
