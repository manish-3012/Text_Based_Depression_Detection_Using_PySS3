I feel worthlessI feel so empty and worthless. Im unloveable, worthless, useless and I cant help but blame myself for everything. I cant stand myself. All I do is hurt and burden the people around me. I fuck up every relationship ever. It was probably my own fault that my mom and I never had a good relationship. Suicide is always in the back of my mind. Im just so tired. I dont have the energy to do anything. Im slowly wasting away because I cant eat or sleep. I want to sleep for years and never wake up. I ruin everything
