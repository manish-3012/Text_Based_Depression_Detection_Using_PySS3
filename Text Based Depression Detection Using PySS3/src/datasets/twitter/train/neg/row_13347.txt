I hate thinking about the futureNo, I don't want to fucking talk about the future, I don't get why family won't just let me live in the present for once. I don't know what the fuck I want to "do with my life" and I'm not ready to make that decision right now, but they won't respect that. It's to the point where I can't have a normal conservation with them or they'll bring it up. I promised that I'd start looking for work once the corona lockdowns are finally over  but that's not good enough for them. They don't "want me to have a job", they "want me to have a career." 

I'll be honest, whenever they bring up that shit up, I just feel this "dread" wash over me. As it seems like no matter what I decide to do, I'll just be fucking miserable, so what's the point? It's not like that shit has any meaning in the grand scheme of things. Often, I think about just tying a fucking noose and being done with it. This morning, after an argument, my mom finally asked "you don't really want to do anything, do you?" 

I said "no, I'm just not sure right now" but that was a fucking lie. She was right, I don't want to do anything "with my life."  It's not like I asked for this life, it was forced on me. Now, after our little argument, I can't stop thinking about suicide

I know I'll never go through with it, I'm too much of a pussy, but I really don't want to see the future.
