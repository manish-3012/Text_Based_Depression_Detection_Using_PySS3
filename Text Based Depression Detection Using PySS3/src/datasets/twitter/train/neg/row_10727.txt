i just have no energy all the time i cant be productive at school its like everytime i went there the teacher is talking to a wall and not me, because when the day its over i completely forget everything the teacher said in class, and this been pretty common for me recently, my head has no energy for nothing these days, i can't even enjoy video games anymore and it used to be my favorite hobbie, all i seam to enjoy now is watching dumb videos on youtube and sleeping, can anyone here relate?
