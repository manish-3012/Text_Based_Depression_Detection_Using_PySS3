Going tonight.I can't deal with myself any longer. I hate myself so much and I'm so lonely. I only talked to another person out loud twice in the past week, and both times were when I called Samaritans. No one I know wants to be around me anymore. I have everything in place and a plan that should work. Thank you to everyone on this sub who tried to help me and I'm sorry that I let you all down. 

Edit: Thanks for all the comments people, you're all so beautiful. But remember, sort by new and there are people below me who also need help.
