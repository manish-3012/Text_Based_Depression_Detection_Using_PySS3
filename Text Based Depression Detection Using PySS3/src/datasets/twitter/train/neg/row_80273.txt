I don't mean to be a bother, I just need some help...Like I said, I don't want to bother anyone, but I've been feeling increasingly suicidal for a while now. I think of death and smile, I hope I get into car accidents, die I'm my sleep, etc... But I never have the conviction to do it. Occasionally, I make plans to slowly starve myself. Previously, I self-harmed, but that had given way to suicidal plans/thoughts. My boyfriend describes me as a hardcore perfectionist with extremely low esteem, if that helps any.

Please, like I said, I dont want to bother, but I feel so hopeless, I just need some reassurance/help, I'm running out of options and reasons to stay alive.
