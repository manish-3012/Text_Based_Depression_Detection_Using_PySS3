I don't know what to doI went through a very difficult period in my life, cliche bad. And it left me feeling broken. I made a serious attempt on my life about half a year ago, but wasn't successful. After that, things started to 'go my way' and I started to enjoy life again. Now things are going pretty well for me. I have a girlfriend who loves me. A family who supports me (to an extent). And friends who all like me. I have no reason to feel bad, but I feel worse than I ever have before. 

The sounds in my head wont shut up and no matter how hard I try I cant shut it all out. Its all too much to deal with. Physically, and in the 'real' world, I am fine. But mentally I am being worn thin.

I am way worse off than I was when I made an attempt on my life, but at that point, I had no one that cared about me, so it didn't matter.

Now, when I feel like I need to kill myself the most, I have people around me that I couldn't put through that emotional trauma. But at the same time I don't care, if that makes sense?

I am just in a constant battle with myself, and in a state of confusion.

I have professional help, but its so shit. They shovel me medication that doesn't do anything, and have stuck me on a waiting list for counselling list, that I have been on for almost half a year.

I just want to end it, and if I didn't have people that relied on me for there own 'survival', I would have tried again by now.
