I'm spiralling today. I want the end . I want peaceI'm really tired and want to end it . Today is going to be at work and personally issues I have to deal with . 
Let's say I don't see any alternative I. Want peace I just want that moment  I never have to wake up again. I'm such a empty space torn and tired. 
I have a difficult job I need to feed myself. Humiliation there. I have a back spondylitis problem that has let me unable to sleep for more than a few hours with medication. My psychotherapy is going nowhere

I would like this to be over
