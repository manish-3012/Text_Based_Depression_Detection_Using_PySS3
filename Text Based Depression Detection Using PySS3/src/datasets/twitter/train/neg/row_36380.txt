Venting I guessIt's really weird and amazing how a human can change. How his mind can change. From a young, innocent children to a grown up, depressed, guilty teen. What was once a fear, is now a remedy. We used to fear dark places, and now, we seek them because there no one can see our tears. We used to fear the unknown and yet, here we are, waiting for something new, hoping that it will give us motivation. We used to be full of motivation and energy, always with a smile on our faces. But time...time is a merciless monster. It transformed some of us into pieces of dirt without any use. After all, thats where we all end up, 6 feet under, just pieces of dirt, but I think we all should have the right to live LIFE and not a painful torture. Ostracized by social communities, betrayed by "friends", forced to fit in but the fake smile just won't do anymore.

"Society has a plan for all.
For me, that plan is to fall..."
