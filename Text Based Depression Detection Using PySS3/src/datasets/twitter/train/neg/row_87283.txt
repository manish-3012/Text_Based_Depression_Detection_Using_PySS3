I was a crazy mistakeLife's been flushed like shit down the toilet.  It's crazy how fast it happens.  My few friends want nothing to do with me.  I was laughed at for being a "crazy motherfucker" for trying to reach out to them.  I came out to one of them I was molested when I was 11 by my brother and then they wanted nothing to do with me.  The person that used to stare into my eyes and tell me I was the only one they loved is somewhere in another state far away, with a new phone and life.  Maybe i'm just destined not to know what it means to love and be loved.  Maybe i'm just a terrible person that deserves all they can get.  

Now I'm in the company of a new dependable set of friends, cheapass vodka, and best friend oxy.  True friends to the end
