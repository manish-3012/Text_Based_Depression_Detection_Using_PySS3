turning 18 this year and i already want to dieIâ€™ve been living alone for the past 2 years, my mother moved out and my brother is in university. Tbh iâ€™ve coped with the loneliness through music, and only music. And since graduating, iâ€™ve got a part time job. 

Never really had a proper friend, high school friends never lasted too. I really lack the motivation to move on, and I donâ€™t think anything is worth it anymore.
