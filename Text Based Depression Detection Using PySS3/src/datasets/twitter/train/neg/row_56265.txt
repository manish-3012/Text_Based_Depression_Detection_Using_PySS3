If I fail out of grad school, I might kill myself out of shame.I threw away a year of my life waiting for grad school to begin, and now I might flunk out after one semester. All that time wasted, delaying the start of my "real life" for nothing.

This sucks, and all because of one stupid class. I hate myself, I hate feeling like I'm so much lesser than my peers. I wish I were smarter, more hard working. I wish I had more time to prove myself.

I know not everyone is meant for grad school (and I know many grad programs aren't worth the time and money) but I thought I had a good here. Dammit :(
