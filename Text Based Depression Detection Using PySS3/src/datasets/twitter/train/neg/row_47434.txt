No one knows how suicidal I truly amIâ€™ve never been able to express my to what friends and family I have about my suicidal thoughts.  Iâ€™ve been going through a super bad period at the moment and have been close to committing suicide several times.  The temptation to swallow a lot of pills is a constant challenge.  So far Iâ€™ve yet to be successful though.  

However Iâ€™ve kept my depression a secret from most of my family/friends as most of them wouldnâ€™t understand. I think most of them would be shocked as Iâ€™m great at faking an act of being happy around them.
