Why Do I Keep Feeling Suicidal?I have so much to live for. I love my family (husband, child, dog, etc), but there a time when I wish I could just take a pill or drink wine laced with arsenic and die. 

I was diagnosed bipolar, I take my meds religiously, I do everything Iâ€™m told, and somehow I keep going. I donâ€™t let it show that Iâ€™m wondering if this is the day I go...I donâ€™t want to kill myself, but why do I sometimes feel suicidal? And what can I do to make that feeling go down to 0 (a.k.a never happens)?
