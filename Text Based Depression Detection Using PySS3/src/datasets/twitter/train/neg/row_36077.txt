F! it allHere is my letter. Maybe someone will figure out who I am one day and why I did it. I'm ruining another person's life because I was completely fucked up in an accident 6 years ago now. I already put a huge damper on my life to begin with due to not being diagnosed bipolar until I was 23 and got into legal trouble. Wound up spending my entire 20s in prison. I am in recovery and I think that's what I'll use to take me out of this world. The same thing that's ruined my life to begin with so tomorrow night I'm going to take enough benzos and Diesel and that should do the trick especially since all the shit where I live is laced with fentynol. Going buddy bye bye I'll see you all later at some point.
