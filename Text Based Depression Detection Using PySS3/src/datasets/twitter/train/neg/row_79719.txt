Suicidal thoughts: need private messaging suppoetHello,

I am weaning off of meds and a side effect is suicidal thoughts. My mind is racing with memories of people criticizing me. I want to die and overdose. 

I was talking to a few people last week but deleted my account. 

I am a woman and would prefer a male to talk too. Someone open-minded and comfortable with discussing cultural clashes. The two topics I am suicidal about may offend some people.
