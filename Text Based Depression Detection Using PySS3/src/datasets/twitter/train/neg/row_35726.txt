I feel Like I already mentally checked out. I am scared of this new feeling.I am scared I feel like I already mentally checked out. When you mentally check out that's when things get scary. It would be harder to re check back in. Not saying it can't be done but I am already not here anymore. It's scary. I didn't want to go down this path but the path just chose me. People like to follow the path of easier resistance. At this point it's easier to stay checked out. This feeling sucks. I already had suicide thoughts more and more frequently. It seems like my mind already made up it's mind. I don't even feel anything while I write this. No anger, no happiness nothing. I can't keep pretending everything is ok when it's not.
