I cant keep on going on like thisI'm 20 now and have been just wanting to end it since I was 10. Stuck in a shitty living situation with no way out in the foreseeable future, grew up poor as fuck so I'm still behind, the only thing i've felt like I was good at was sports when I was younger but stopped because I hated it, and not very smart, I tried my hardest in school and barely passed anything. I'm going any where in life. Pretty fucking easy to see.

While all that might be able to be solved I'm also a fucking tranny, that can't be fixed and statistically I have about a 45% chance of attempting suicide. I'm slowly becoming a alcoholic and the urge to just end it all is increasing daily.
