I'm scaredHi guys, I don't really know what I need but I'm feeling kind of scared right now. I'm in a very, very bad place, I'm so tired I feel like my body is practically shutting down. I can't sleep, I get maybe 4 hours if I'm very lucky over the last month or 2. I've been trying to go to bed early \(like midnight, early for me\) but morning is hell. I'm up between 3 and 4 every day, listening to my brain remind me of all the stupid shit I've done and how much of a worthless failure I am. I feel like I'm a car out of gas, coasting down a hill towards the bottom, and I won't have anything left to make it up the next hill. I'm also a grad student, and I am just a fucking disaster right now \- can't focus at all at work, go to the bathroom 10 or 15 times a day to cry, messing up all of my experiments and everything's going wrong. I feel completely alone but there are people that I could reach out to, I just don't know how. I was even texting a friend yesterday evening and said something dark and she asked if I was OK or needed to talk, but I just say "I'm good thanks" as always \- I feel like my mask is glued on at this point.  This all makes me feel even worse. I've reached out for help after dealing with depression for a decade or so as it has gotten so much worse recently, but I'm stuck waiting for my appointment with the counselor that's not until next Friday. I'm really scared because I don't want to die, but I seem to be getting more and more resigned to the idea that it's the inevitable end for me soon. I just don't know what to do.
