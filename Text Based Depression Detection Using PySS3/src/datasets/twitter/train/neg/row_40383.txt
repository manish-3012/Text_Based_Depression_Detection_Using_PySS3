The sun canâ€™t shine forever.Iâ€™m 26 years old. Iâ€™ve made it through abuse. 4 years sober from opiate addiction after selling opiates for years after I got kicked out the week after high school graduation. Was homeless for a while then. My papaw, who I looked up to, shot himself when I was 16. My drug addicted biological father drove into a tree and died the same year. Been fighting depression my whole life &amp; trauma/ptsd. This past year I was finally on the path I wanted to be. I have a girlfriend who loves me and has for almost 5 years now. She pulled me out of addiction &amp; has never messed with drugs. She got her masters degree and is now a therapist who has been trying to help me deal with my trauma. I forgave my adoptive dad for what he put me through and we have a good relationship as well as the rest of my family now. 
I was finally feeling happy the past few years even with depression...if that makes sense. Iâ€™m in Barber school and one of the top 25 my teacher said heâ€™d ever had, which spoke volumes to me since heâ€™s owned and ran the college for 30+ years, I was even the one teaching my classmates. Only a few months of school left for me to graduate. I work the job I love at a vape shop, building coils, to make people healthier. I hadnâ€™t thought of suicide in years now. I never thought I was worth a shit but I slowly was being shown I was. As my girlfriend would tell me, I survived my struggles &amp; now I can be happy. But as I found out...the sun can only shine for so long. 
June 5th of this year, a Tuesday, I woke up late for class so I hurried to get showered and ready. I donâ€™t remember much of that day now but I do remember some. Tuesday was our Monday so I had worked late the night before and overslept. By the time I was heading to my car it was 7:30. Class starts at 8:00 and goes till 4:30 p.m. &amp; is a 45 minute drive from my town to a bigger city. I had to get gas also so I was in a rush. The gas station was only 2 miles away. I drove down the parkway towards the gas station at 70mph (speed limit is 65mph) without my seatbelt on cause I was in a hurry. It was sunny and warm, the fresh air smelled great and I knew it had to be a good day. I got a mile down the parkway in the fast lane...then the next thing I remember was someone saying â€œIâ€™ve called 911, the ambulance is coming. Who can I call for you?â€ 
Immediately I remembered my moms phone number (I lived with her and my adoptive dad &amp; little sister so I could get back on my feet) So I gave him her number and asked what happened. The next memory of that morning I have is the helicopter noises. The next memory is 3 days later in pain I have never felt, on my way to my second set of surgeries. 20 hours of surgery total, lots of blood transfusions and 5 days until I can remember anything more. 
A Semi truck wasnâ€™t looking that morning and pulled straight into the fast lane in front of me. I hit them at  70mph. Nobody understands how I didnâ€™t die. My engine was pushed through the dash causing me to be stuck. My right hip &amp; pelvis was shattered, my left hip &amp; pelvis severely broke. My dominant hand, the right one, broken along with my right wrist and thumb. A broken nose, my right knee bashed open exposing my knee cap &amp; a lot of glass in my face. 
Itâ€™s been 2 months now &amp; im still in a hospital bed in my parents front room. I canâ€™t walk or bear weight but can sit up in my wheelchair for a half hour or so. I have to learn to walk again when the time comes but itâ€™s all seemed so far away. Last month my X-rays showed my hip muscles are turning to bone which may require more surgery if I canâ€™t get it stopped. Iâ€™m in constant pain &amp; supposed to take pain medication &amp; muscle relaxers 3 times a day along with a lot more medications. I fought to get away from opiates and now Iâ€™m forced back on them. I will more than likely not recover enough to be a barber now because of needing full motion of my right hand &amp; needing to stand all day. I have hated myself for waking up late that morning everyday now. My struggle didnâ€™t end like I thought, it became harder and worse. I am forced to lay here watching life move on for everyone else but stand still for me. I wish I didnâ€™t survive now &amp; I want to end it all now. Today was all I could take and I donâ€™t know if I can struggle anymore. I tried to be positive &amp; strong but Iâ€™m tired of having to be strong. The shoes that I have walked miles of my life in have no more soles from the weight Iâ€™ve had to carry &amp; the road feels like itâ€™s at an end. I donâ€™t know how to start again. I donâ€™t know how to smile. I donâ€™t know how to want to live when this isnâ€™t living. Iâ€™m crying out for help and I feel like no one has listened. 
My other traumas have come back, most that I made myself forget. The night terrors are killing me &amp; im terrified to sleep for I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™ll see in my dreams. Iâ€™ve always told myself that Iâ€™m needed on this planet &amp; I might not know why yet but Iâ€™ll find out one day, that Iâ€™m strong enough to stay and fight another day. But what if Iâ€™ve just prolonged the inevitable. The sad truth that the sun will shine brighter for everyone who knows me if I go. Because everybody has had to take care of me through this and Iâ€™m wearing them thin, drowning them with me. 

I donâ€™t think I can make it through this.
