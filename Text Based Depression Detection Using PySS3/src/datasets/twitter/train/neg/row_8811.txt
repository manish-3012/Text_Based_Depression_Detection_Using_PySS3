MeaninglessFrom a withered flower the petals fall, 
And I hear the distant wintry winds call. 
I long for death's sweet embrace, 
Can't wait till I leave this place. 

What lies beyond one knows not; for that I shan't care, 
As life's burdens are no longer for me to bear.
For what at all do we hope to gain, 
But old age and dis-ease and pain.
Our feats no matter how grand, 
In the end equal we stand. 
Though Mother Mother Nature's laws are just and fair,
With revelation one must despair?

Thus with life I will wage war,
Until I kick down Heaven's door.
