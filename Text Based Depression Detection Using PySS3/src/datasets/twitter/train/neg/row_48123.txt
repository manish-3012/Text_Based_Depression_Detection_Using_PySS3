I'm 11lb overweight and my dreams are impossibleI have no friends and my job sucks. I just want to go to sleep and never wake up.

I was 160lb for most of my life until last October when I ballooned up to 185. Overweight is 174 for my height. I feel every extra piece of fat hanging off my body and crushing my lungs. I never want to be seen in public, yet I can't help myself with food because it's my only source of excitement.

My parents are abusive and controlling. They neglected me as a child. Yet, I'm living with them. I've never had a family member I really got along with. In fact, I was terrorized by two sociopath thief brothers, and my parents fueled their hate for me by constantly telling them I was way smarter than them.

I wish I had the sort of people I could confide in. My relationships have been with guys who raped and abused me. One committed suicide because his dad wanted to kill him. I always go back in my memory and wonder how I could have helped him.

It's the end for me.
