I want to talk about suicide without it being a jokeRecently my MDD has kicked in again. Around Easter is always a shit time of year. I'm graduating college soon and I actually have my life mostly planned out, just not implemented yet. I still can't help but feel hopeless and like there's no point. I'm the kind of person that jokes about killing myself or wanting to die. Partially because I mean it and partially because I don't want to be some downer to people around me. My friends who know I've struggled with depression get a little worried about me, but not enough to do much, though I don't know what the hell they could do. 

The last time I openly admitted to wanting to kill myself, my psychiatrist (not counselor) had me admitted to a mental hospital, twice. My closest friend, who I also have a crush on (gay) is the person I want to talk to about this stuff the most, but I feel like he's tired of me. He's the RA of my residence hall and if I'm honest with him about suicide, without just joking, he'd mandated to report it and it's back to the hospital with me. Which I can't do right now because I need to finish my degree and it doesn't help that much anyway. 

Don't know why I decided to post on here. Just did. I'm meeting with my psychiatrist tomorrow to talk about switching up meds, but I feel like I can't be honest with her about how I feel.
