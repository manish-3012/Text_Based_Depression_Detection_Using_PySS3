If anyone can talk to me?Hello everyone, Iâ€™ve dealt with many things the past few years Iâ€™ve been dealing with depression, nightmares anger issues, Iâ€™ve attempted suicide several times and doing it again is all that I think about I canâ€™t afford to see a psychiatrist or psychologist or anything like that, Iâ€™m also not trying to seek attention or anything I was just hoping I could find a friend on here that I could talk to, someone who understands what Iâ€™m going through if I could just get one person I would be very grateful
