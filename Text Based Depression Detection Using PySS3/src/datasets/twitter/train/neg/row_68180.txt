I'm stressedI feel like a burden to everyone I talk to. I honestly just want to die. college is tough and I don't want to burden anyone I talk to. I have a test in a few hours from now and I just don't know anything. I'm broke, I'm going to have to withdraw from a class that costed me 700 dollars. I just don't want to do this anymore. all these feelings have been gradually increasing for the past months, but failing  a class really is a major blow. I dont want to talk to a therapist because they might put me in the hospital for thinking like this. I have suicide idealation almost everyday. I just want to end it
