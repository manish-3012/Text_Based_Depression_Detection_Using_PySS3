Another sad post hereHi!
I'm a boy from Spain (so my english isn't perfect at all), i'm 16 y.o. and last two years from me were the worst of my life. Two years ago i met a girl and i fell in love hard. We broke up months later and I was so sad and suicidal for a few months. During this, i had a friend who helped me unreservedly and it was really pretty from her. When I get over this relationship i was so happy, the girl who I loved was now my best friend again and i had lots of friends... But it was just an illusion. In this summer i lost almost all my "friends" (including the one that helped me when I was suicidal, she is upset since she punched me one day being drunk, i don't know why) and the rest only because all my friends go out in summer for getting drunk with no reason, and I don't like that, I prefer staying on home, but nobody understand me. Only the girl who caused me tons of damage is there but i'm alone at all. I'm now a solitary guy who is not agree with the heterodoxy of the society.
