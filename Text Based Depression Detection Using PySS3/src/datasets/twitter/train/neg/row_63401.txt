I am so sick of being called a liarI'll try and condense this story as much as possible:

I fell out with two people I considered good friends two years ago. It was already an extremely difficult time in my life and they made it so much fucking worse. If my mother hadn't have been undergoing medical problems that required me to move home for a bit, I would've killed myself. One of them wrote up a truly horrible Tumblr post about what a mean, toxic person I was and I better apologise and kiss their feet over it. The other, cowardly one (who I actually suspect was the driving force behind all this) has basically stalked me ever since. 

I won't claim my behaviour during all that was good, but I absolutely did not deserve that public tearing down. They knew I was horribly depressed and suicidal - they both accused me of lying and just saying that to manipulate them. 

Anyway, the stalker is still calling me a liar and mocking me and I've just had enough. I've had my problems minimised and mocked my entire life. There's always someone like this bitch. I'm not going to step in front of a train anytime soon, but it made me realise how fucking tired I am of life.
