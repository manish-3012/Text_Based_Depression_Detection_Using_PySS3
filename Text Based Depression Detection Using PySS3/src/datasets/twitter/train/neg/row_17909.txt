Everything's NOT going to be okayNo one reads these but I don't really care.

I know I'm not going to be okay, even after all the things I do that supposedly give my life meaning and purpose. Even through laughter, I'm so full of despair. The misery people are forced into makes me too sad and all I can do is cry about it.

Life just gets harder and it's honestly not worth all the work and effort. All I can do is pretend I'm happy with the way things are with the people around. I feel like I'm going nowhere, and I just want to move on and go somewhere where things are okay with the ones I truly belong with. I miss them so much. I don't know why I have to be here instead. I'd rather go home.
