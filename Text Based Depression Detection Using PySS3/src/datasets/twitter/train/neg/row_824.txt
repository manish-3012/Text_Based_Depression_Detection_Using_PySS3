I'm dying insideLast week I tied a rope around my neck, and decided I would end my life that way. The week keeps going on and I keep making family members angry because I refuse to leave the house or do something, and I just want to scream at them to leave me alone. I put on a really great face most of the time, but my anxiety is killing me, I can't function, and no one in my life cares or would understand. I don't have friends anymore. I'm dead weight in this world.
