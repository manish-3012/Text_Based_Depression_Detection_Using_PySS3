My friend just informed he's suicidal, I'm lost.He and I met last year and have gotten increasingly closer as friends, through bio class and mutual frees. He's a great guy, quiet, but really means a lot to me as a friend, and I would feel destroyed if he took his own life. Back in September he was in the hospital for a 'heart problem' because of some medication, but told me today that this was an attempt at suicide, and I fear he's going to do it again because he's become more quiet and generally less enthusiastic about all of things he, my friends, and I usually do together. On one hand, he's my friend and told me this in confidence, so I feel bad betraying his trust. But I love him and can't see him do this, so I need to do something. I don't know what. We're both 16 if that means anything. Thanks for your time.
