Everything's so bleak...Now that I have started taking a ton of medication I stopped having the desire to end it as soon as possible. But I still don't have anything that gives me a little purpose in life. Without medication I at least had something to work towards (even if it was my own death) but now I am numb to everything. The pain I felt is gone but it isn't replaced with anything else. 
I don't know how to start feeling better. At least now I'll probably be able to wait until my mother is dead until I off myself.
