I just want to finally give up but i cantI dont know what's going on in my classes and i have absolutely no motivation to do anything. I work part-time and the only reason I can is because I try to convince myself that I maybe make some of the older customers feel happy because im really warm to them and it gives me some kind of purpose, but it makes me feel tired and overwhelmed. 

I just want to disappear. I live with my parents right now and i dont know if ill be able to survive on my own someday. I feel so incompetent and apathetic and tired. I'm only 23 so I have a fair amount of decades left, and I just dont know why im alive. Why do i have to keep struggling like this? Everyday is so hard and I feel like I try so hard just to end up looking like a failure. Do I have to stay alive just for the sake of being alive? When I think about the future it feels so bleak. 

I try so so hard. Making lists of things I want to get better at, trying to better myself, only to end up at square one. And it's so fucking hard to get help. I was on medication that is controlled and Im having trouble with getting it refilled and honestly that's probably why im feeling pretty suicidal right now, but ive always felt like shit. Always felt like it was never enough. Like I was on a treadmill and always on the verge of falling off, and i just think, isnt it enough? havent i tried hard enough? dont i deserve to rest?

I can't kill myself because it would destroy my family. My poor mother is already worried out of her mind and freaks the fuck out if she sees me crying. But I've just never felt this apathetic and just ...tired in my life. I just feel like there's nothing out there for me. And everytime I feel like I want something it depresses me even more because i know I cant have it
