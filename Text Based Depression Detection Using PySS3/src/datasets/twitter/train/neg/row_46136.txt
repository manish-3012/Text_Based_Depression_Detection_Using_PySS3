The last strawHow fucking embarrassing that my last fucking straw is hearing my boyfriend telling me he doesnâ€™t want me when i have been nothing but a loving girlfriend. i do mistakes like everyone does but itâ€™s not that big of a deal. You know what im not going to sit here list all the reasons why i should end myself im seriously tired i am drained i am so done with everything but how fucking embarrassing now that when i kill myself my family, my friends, people who know me will say shit like oh she killed herself over a relationship??? Yeah fuck of janette I donâ€™t know!!!! Literally didnâ€™t say shit to him and for once i felt so hopeless that i turned to god and said you know me you fucking know me take me with you i cannot handle it!!!!! Still nothing itâ€™s just him screaming me on the phone UR BAD TO MEEEE I DONTTT WANT YOUUU I WILL BE SO MUCH BETTER WITHOUT YOU ILL GET OVER U SO FAST, then go. But i guess neither if us have the courage to end it. But i am ending it today. Like do you know how bad it is to hear shit like that and worse from someone you call family??? Like i gave you my whole heart what are you doing??? Then calls me again and apologises and tells me how he can never leave me and knows how much i love him and no one will love him like i do but crazy how literally he made me end myself. Will he even feel anything after Iâ€™m gone????!?
