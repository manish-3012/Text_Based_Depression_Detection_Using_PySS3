No one caresI asked a friend in advance if I could vent because I didnâ€™t wanna be a burden. She said yes, I vented, then she started venting about her own stuff. After it was done she said she wasnâ€™t in a bad mood until I started venting. I asked if it was my fault and she said yes. So I stopped responding. Then told another friend what happened with the first friend and she called us both toxic. And the one who called me toxic, it was especially hurtful because Iâ€™ve been working really hard on growing out of bad habits and sheâ€™s even noticed and commended me on it so to call me toxic like it was nothing, especially after feeling like shit from the first friend, just makes me feel like no one fucking cares and whatâ€™s the point of being here. People always want to beg you to stay (not kill yourself) but treat you like shit anyway so what does it matter??? I hate it here so much
