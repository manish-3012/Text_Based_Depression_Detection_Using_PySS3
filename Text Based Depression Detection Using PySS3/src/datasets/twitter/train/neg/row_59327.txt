Some mental wards just seem like strange acts more than help?I mean I went in to the hospital delusional over some messiah complex bullshit, but something still seemed off about the place in the â€œsaneâ€ part of my brain. Seemed like a big act of some sort. Something about it just didnâ€™t feel like it was all happening naturally, but a lot of it was being manipulated to invoke certain reactions or see if certain reactions would occur if provoked correctly; plus when provoked correctly a staff member taking notes would say out loud the exact note they were taking. Example: something happened to someone and instead of the staff member quietly taking his notes as Iâ€™d assume would be more protocol, heâ€™d say out loud, â€œpatient showing signs of paranoiaâ€, then just continue sitting there in his seat in the silence he had been in before taking such note. It felt more like a scripted act than what youâ€™d see in a movie. I think I felt more like a test subject then someone getting help and it felt like much of the staff and possibly a few patients were kinda just like actors to be quite frank. ///

Iâ€™ve heard similar stories from people who went in for problems and felt more like a test subject than just a patient at a hospital receiving help.
