Woke up today after birthday yesterday making plans for suicideUsually spend birthdays and holidays alone yesterday I wish I spent it alone. Family though hijacked it and it's complicated a lot of people in my family are just terrible people. I am too tired to go into detail. They are the reason why I grew up in a different city in a completely different state. After 22 years when I was 27 I moved back to the city I was born in, but then just two months later after encountering these people again I had to move to a different city although in the same state. It was a horrible day yesterday.


I made other posts going into detail. But then it's like you look at my recent post history no one's responded to my sos messages my cries for help. Making me feel that much worse. The few who did respond or sent messages they always end up ghosting me. It's like salt in the wound you know.


I was just in a crisis unit. It didn't help. I don't know what else to do. This post will probably be ignored also. I'm not getting my hopes up. 


I hate it when people say they understand me they know what I'm going through they've felt loneliness also. They understand nothing they don't know what I'm going through or have felt the way that I've felt because they don't know isolation like me. I don't think anyone does.


In tears. I'm so alone.
