Women don't give a flying fuck about me.I never get any sort of attention from women, I can chat up a woman and she'll be uninterested or if there was a shred of interest she loses it and becomes bored.  

I've only had one girlfriend and it was long ago and only for 2 months.  

Online dating is the fucking worst for a guy.  I send out polite messages that relate to something on their profile showing I took the time to read it and they don't give a fuck.  No response ever.  

I don't know how to ask out a girl in person.  They're always bored and uninterested so I just drop it and get the fuck out of there. 

It fucking sucks being a dude in his 20's when it comes to dating.  Women have that shit so fucking easy.  Just keep yourself at an average weight, know how to use make up and say yes to the best guy out of the long ass line of guys hitting on you.
