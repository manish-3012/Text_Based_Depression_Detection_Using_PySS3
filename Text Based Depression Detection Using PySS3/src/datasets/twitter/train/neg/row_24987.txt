depressed for 3 months, happy for 3, but it was all for nothingit felt great coming out of 3 months, but what does it matter now, i'm just back to where i started and there's less options then i had before. all of my life just comes down to fighting against myself to live. i'd love to rationalize and get over myself, but that's really hard to do when the problem physically exists. i really don't have much else to do but wait and see what happens.
