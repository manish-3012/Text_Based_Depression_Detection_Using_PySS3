Freedom in JulyI want to drive up north and dip my toes into the lake for the last time. Then I'll return to a moldy hotel room, cradle rope and sadness into my lap before doing what I know needs to be done. This is more than depression. This is more than sickness. This is destination. This is what's right. It's not sad fleeting emotions, this is intolerable pain and knowledge that I will never find healing. 

I'm scared but I'm trying to be ready.
