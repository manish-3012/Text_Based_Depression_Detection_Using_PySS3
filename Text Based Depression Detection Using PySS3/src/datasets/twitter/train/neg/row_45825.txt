Suicidal friend won't get help.We've been friends our whole life, I'm so stressed. She absolutely refuses help from anyone. I've offered to get her a therapist, have our family drive her there, have her stay with us like she said she wanted to a while back, but she won't do any of it and she keeps saying she doesn't want to live. Please help. What do I do?
