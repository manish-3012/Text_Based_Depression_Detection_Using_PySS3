Not being taken seriouslyI have been self harming since a young age as a way of coping at my lowest, quieting my thoughts, and punishing myself and although I am 22 now, I still do it. My partner knows this but it only makes him angry, he doesn't care about pushing me to the point where I can't cope. I am so depressed that I can't bring myself to get out of bed or shower or take care of myself or anything, but no matter how much I try to communicate with my partner he just calls me lazy and resents me. I have told him I'm suicidal and want to end my life, but it's clear he doesn't take me seriously and won't until I do it. Yesterday he got angry at me over something fairly small and told me to kill myself. I've been crying out for help for so long and no one is listening. I'm  scared to die and I have responsibilities which is why I haven't done it yet, but I'm getting closer every day and no one will take me seriously. I just want someone to listen and show me that life is worth living again instead of looking at me and just seeing the worst and resenting and hating me. I just want someone, anyone to reach out to me and be nice to me but clearly I'm not deserving of that
