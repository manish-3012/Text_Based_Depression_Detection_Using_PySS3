This idea that I've "played" with for years is now closer to becoming a reality than ever.I'm a student, albeit a lazy one, set to graduate next year with a BA that I have very little interest in at the age of 24. I've never held down any real interests or hobbies. In high school I assumed this would change as I matured, but turns out it did not. The hobbies I took up included drinking and drugs. Around sophmore year of college, I found an affinity for opiate painkillers, and very slowly became a pitiful addict. This last year has been the worst. I stole hundreds from my parents in a banking scheme (I'm not stupid, just a fucking asshole). It was all to fund my $100+ a day habit. Even after discovering what I did, they have offered me nothing but support, but my behavior hasn't changed (I'm sure I'm a full on addict at this point). 
I have only hurt those around me, I suffer from a sickening anxiety/OCD problem (which existed before the addiction), and I lack any post-grad goals.. I don't even know if I will graduate on time.. I really let myself go these last few months. The thought of suicide was always playful, like "I wonder how it would go" type of thing. Now, I drink, do cocaine, and hold my .45 caliber handgun and imagine how easy would be. My family and a select number of friends would be devastated. I just find myself considering it more and more lately. I cannot function without god damn painkillers. It makes me sick to even think I became such a person (from a loving and supporting home), yet here I am. I came as close as putting it loaded to my head the other night and playing with the trigger. I know this is sick behavior, but I guess I'm a sick person right now. I just needed to share. I don't want to die, but more and more it seems really appealing to escape what I've done to myself.
