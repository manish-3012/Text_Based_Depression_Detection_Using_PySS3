I'm finding it difficult to stay alive.I feel lame and uninteresting. I don't feel valuable or fulfilled at work.

I don't feel like I really matter to anyone. If anyone refutes, I don't believe them.

I'm tired of feeling inadequate.

I'm tired of pretending that I'm not a mess. I'm tired of acting like I have my shit together. 

Why can I not have my feelings and know that I'll be accepted anyway?

I'm ready to just quit. Work. Life. Everything.

I'm tired.
