What is the point of living?I feel like there is no reason to live. We all die eventually anyways. Its not like i am an important person who will positively effect this world so in reality im just taking up space on this world. I have a privileged life but i constantly annoy and piss off my friends and family. School was horrible and has just made me more certain that i'm trash. I have no motivations for the future at all, nothing interests me. I don't care anymore. I rather just die than continue to suffer. I have no purpose and i should be allowed to off myself.
