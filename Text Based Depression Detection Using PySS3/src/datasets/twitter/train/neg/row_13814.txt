Need help.I don't even know what to write here.  I guess I just hope writing it out and discussing it will make me realize how stupid wanting to die is.   

I'm 31 and bipolar.  My doc has been giving me lithium for only the past 3 years to treat it.  It has helped TREMENDOUSLY with being able to hold on to a job and a relationship.  I'm poised to finish and sell a start up website.  We are in a very nice niche market and have a celebrity endorsing it.  Basically, there is no reason I shouldn't be rich, or at least well off, fairly soon because of my efforts.  I have been with the same girl for 3 years and we are getting married in my home town this spring.  Yet here I am, thinking almost everyday for the past 10 months, that I want to die.  I think about this more then anything else.


I think my main problem is definitely stemming from the bi-polar.  It's not the ups and downs that get me now, it's the consistency that literally bores the life out of me.  Before I learned about my condition everyday was an adventure, for better or worse.  Work was exciting, creative, inconsistent, and sometimes volatile.  My women were very numerous.  Now everyday is the same and the is no adventure to life anymore.  The more committed I become to the people and and projects in my life the more I know what to expect everyday.  This makes me to die.

Now the ups and downs of undedicated life wasn't exactly a picnic either.  I'm 100% self destructive and ruin the life of anyone that cares to be part of my life.  

So i'm left with the choices:
a) Take the drugs and be bored for the rest of my life.
b) Not take the drugs and destroy my life but sometimes happy.
c) Die.

Anyone out there have any ideas?
