Three weeks so far.I have stopped reaching out to anyone.  Deleted all my social media and basically have isolated myself from the world.  Besides work I have not spoken to a single person.  Not a single person has noticed.  Yeah I am safe to do it now.  This was my way of making sure no one would miss me.  It worked better than I thought and I am comforted by the fact I will not cause anyone pain.
