The thoughts are backI was on cupralex for 3 months and i was doing so well. I asked my doc to go off it gradually. Now I am having suicidal thoughts, my panic attacks are creeping in...pretty much square one.

I've recently told my mom about my depression and in my foolishness, I thought she would understand. But when I snapped at her she stopped speaking to me.

The only thing keeping me form suicide is the thought of getting it wrong and ending up disabled instead of dead.

I'm seeing my therapist today but honestly I am tired of fighting all the time for a life I dont want..
