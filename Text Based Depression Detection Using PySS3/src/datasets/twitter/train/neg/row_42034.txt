No one will actually help me. The only â€œhelpâ€ is to make it harder for me to suicide and leave me to suffer, or worse, abuse me. Your words cost you nothing and donâ€™t help.If you want actually help me then send me a DM, say specifically what you will do for me, and make yourself vulnerable in a way that will allow me to hold you accountable if you donâ€™t follow through with your promises. Everyone who doesnâ€™t do that is proving that Iâ€™m accurately describing how the world works.
