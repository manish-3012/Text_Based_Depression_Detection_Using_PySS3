I don't know what to do.I feel like killing myself, but I'm too afraid to do it.
And the fact that I feel like killing myself makes me feel worse than I already do, because I keep thinking that my feelings have gotten so bad that I just want to end it all and not have to worry about it anymore. and that makes me feel so much worse.

I need some sort of help. I'm already in therapy and on medication, but I have no friends anymore. And my parents aren't emotionally equipped to help me. I don't know what to do...
