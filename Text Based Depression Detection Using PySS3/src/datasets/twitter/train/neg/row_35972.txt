Canâ€™t do it anymoreIâ€™m going to kill myself. I canâ€™t do it anymore. Iâ€™m going to freak out. I canâ€™t do it. I hate myself. I feel like Iâ€™m in a fucking prison. I hate myself so much. It doesnâ€™t take long to kill myself so why canâ€™t I do it. I could just do it already but Iâ€™m fucking weak. I can barely get out of bed.
