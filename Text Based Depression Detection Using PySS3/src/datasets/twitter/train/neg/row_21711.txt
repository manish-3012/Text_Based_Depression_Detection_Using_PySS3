Not sure what to sayNot sure if this is the right place to post this but Iâ€™m not really sure what to do. I have been suicidal for a while but lately I feel as if there is no way to stop feeling this way, I feel like I hurt more now than I used to and I need to talk someone but have no one to talk to. I donâ€™t know what to say really other than I wish I had someone to talk to who cares but Iâ€™m not sure if I do. Iâ€™m sorry for the rambling but I just needed to say something, I guess I will go to sleep now
