I'm scared to live but I'm too scared to dieI'm twelve years old rn and I want to tell you guys something

When I started high school last year (yr7 - I'm in yr8 now, Corona sucks wby guys?), I started to be bullied even more in high school than I was in primary schoolit started to get thisical (I don't remember how to spell it, grammar police help me ðŸ˜­) I asked my parents to let me move to another school, but to no avail, they refused. I felt embarrassed to show my emotions in public (it's been like that for awhile, it happens even now, I am trying to get over it but I just hide my bad emotions) eg. Sad) and I don't know what to do, I still feel feel like killing myself a year later (it's not that bad now) and my dad is going to get me a kitten so, wish me luck to get over this FaZe
