Why does this happen to me?I've been feeling down and bad about myself for the last 2 years atleast it's getting worse i don't know what to do with those emotions I have like these rage episodes or depressive episodes and I'm scared I don't know what is happening to me, I tried to talk to my parents about it but they said it's my fault and it's all cause of those damn videogames and my friends and of course cause of the fact that I'm a teenager. I honestly don't know if I am overreacting and this is normal but I'm scared and I don't know what to do can someone explain what is happening and why is it happening. The emotional pain is not backing down it only increases with time and I honestly do not know what is all this and when and why did this happen I just want to get rid of all this pain.
