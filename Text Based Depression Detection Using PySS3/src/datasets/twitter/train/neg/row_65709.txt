Sometimes I think the only reason I didn't kill myself yet is because my mum would be devastated I'm not seeking attention or anyone to talk to me I just want to share this 
I don't usually talk about this but I wanna share this. 
I've made a list 
-I recently lost all my friends

-I'm a very quiet person that bottles it all inside sometimes the pressure is just too much 
-I love my ex 

-I moved from  my country when i was 10 which makes me an immigrant. 

-I can't stop smoking and my lungs start to hurt

-I can't find a job 

-Anyone I ever trusted always turn my back on me 

-My friends are the most 2 faced people I've ever met 

-I suffer from a rare disease that doesn't allow the brain to send hormones to the rest of my body and therefore no matter what I do I can never be strong or big I will always be skinny
 
-I'm a massive fail at school 

-I'm starting to doubt my religion  

-Sometimes I just sit in my room and cry for no apparent reason 

-I'm afraid of meeting new people 

-My step-dad is a compulsive drinker and sometimes i'm scared of him 

-My real dad is back in my home country and the only reason he works is because he wants us to have the money 

-I have suicidal thoughts every other hour

I'm 19 and I honestly don't see it going any better. I'm afraid that if I start thinking about it more often I'm just going to end up doing it
