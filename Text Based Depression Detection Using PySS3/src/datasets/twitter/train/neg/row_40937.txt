Does anyone else know that theyâ€™re not going to make it through this year, let alone next year? Itâ€™s almost like I see nothingness because I know Iâ€™m going to kill myself eventually.Yeah, Iâ€™m still here. However, when I look at the â€œfutureâ€ I see absolutely nothing. I see black. I donâ€™t see a future. Iâ€™m numb. Iâ€™m completely numb. I feel confused, because I donâ€™t know what I want anymore besides death. 

I donâ€™t know what will make me happy, because anytime I try to think of it, my mind just goes black. Nothing else. It feels like Iâ€™m a ghost. As if Iâ€™m watching my body with no control over it as I go out my day in a snap of a finger. 

Nobody notices me, I have nobody in my life but immediate family, who have their own problems to worry about. So who else cares about me? Who else cares about me committing suicide? Nobody. Because I have nobody, after all. 

When someone asks me where I see myself in 10 years, I see nothing. I just see a void. 

I no longer worry about my suicidal thoughts, but at peace with it. Iâ€™m at peace with the fact that I no longer fear it, because Iâ€™ve become one with it. Without my suicidal thoughts or tendencies to self-harm, I am no longer myself.
