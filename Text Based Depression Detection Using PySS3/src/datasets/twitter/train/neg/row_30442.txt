No Jobs, No Cash, No Hope!Recently, I lost all hope! I'm 22 and live with my parents and I'm married. I got no job and work is too much for me (chef job) I have no money and I have a little kid. I want to fucking kill myself, I feel hopeless and homeless. I'll never be able to hold a job, because it's physically too demanding. After a 6 hour shift, I've never felt so tired in my life. I felt like I haven't slept for 6 days., what the fuck? How do you guys do it?
