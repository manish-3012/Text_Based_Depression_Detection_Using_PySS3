I've been calling the Hotlines every day at this point and One day I was calling it too much then got hanged up by the Operators and telling me "We are not counselors."https://imgur.com/vA32ign

I CAN'T AFFORD THERAPY.
I'M WORTHLESS.
EVEN THE HOTLINES DON'T LIKE ME.
NOBODY CARES.
I'M SO TIRED...

PLEASE... PLEASE... MAKE IT STOP
