my family hates me, even on christmasI can never motivate myself to do anything anymore. Itâ€™s hard for me to take care of myself, especially with showering. My family wouldnâ€™t care if I starved myself out of self-hate, but if my hair is greasy, that sends them over the edge. I just wanted to have a good Christmas. I greeted my mother with a smile, I was kind. And what do I get back? â€œYour hair is SO greasy.â€ On repeat. All day. And then â€œWhatâ€™s that on your nose? Oh itâ€™s a PIMPLE!â€ which she laughed about for everyone to hear. I know this is all so minor, but it really fucking gets to me. I feel so humiliated and disrespected. Itâ€™s like even when Iâ€™m trying my hardest, I canâ€™t get it right. At the end of the night I hear my mother and grandmother talking about me and how Iâ€™m miserable to be around. When I confront them they tell me I think Iâ€™m better than them, too sensitive, etc. I feel like people are constantly assuming shit about me without wanting to know who I really am. I try to do the right thing, try to be kind, put differences aside, not pick fights. I do a pretty damn good job, but I guess thatâ€™s only if you ask me. 
Nowadays l just feel like my family would be happier if I was gone. My friends, SO, too. I just canâ€™t imagine not being replaceable. I canâ€™t imagine being present in this world and truly happy. Every day I walk around on autopilot, and I canâ€™t fix it. Isnâ€™t it better to be dead than be alive and not experiencing life?
