Gave up, cant deal with these feelings. Im done, im sorryI can't do this anymore, i can't continue suffering the way that i have, im done. All i do is hurt people, i deserve to be alone, but im done being alone and lonely. I guess i'm writing this to hear people tell me my life is worth living, but it wouldn't be coming from the ones i wish it would. I just hope she knows i love her and that im sorry.
