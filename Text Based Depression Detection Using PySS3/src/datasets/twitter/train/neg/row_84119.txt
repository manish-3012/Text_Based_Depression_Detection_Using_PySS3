I feel absolutely pathetic and wish I could just fade awayToday I thought I'd text a mental health hotline and got nothing but automated responses. I'm tired of it, I'm tired of everything. Everyone around me has something or someone that makes them special, happy. I have nothing, no talents, no hobbies, and the only significant other I ever had abused me mentally. I would never consider good with women, even if I've had a few exes. Too bad all of them either treated me like shit or I rushed everything and made a fool out of myself. I'm stuck working a shitty part time job until I have to leave all of my friends and loved ones in August. In the meantime I get to hold back from putting a belt around my neck and trying to end it all, but I'm too much of a bitch when it comes to pain and I'm scared of what awaits me on the other side, whether it be eternal damnation or my consciousness ceasing to exist. I just need someone to help stop me from abusing myself.
