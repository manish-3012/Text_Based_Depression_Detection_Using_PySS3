How do start caring for yourself again?**Whoops, I made a typo on the title. I apologize if that bothers anyone.**

I'm 23 years old. I was around 14 when I dropped all my hopes and dreams. 
I've slowly stopped caring about a lot of things.

**I just failed college.** 

* I've been at it for 5 or 6 years now? It was the last chance before I was to be kicked out.

* I always hated school but my parents pressure it onto me a lot so now that I can't do that I've started preparing a few paths to a permanent departure.

**I don't work.** 

* Why do I want money? I would just spend it on video games anyway.

* I know, I know, I really should find a job or else I'll never get anywhere. I just cannot socialize though, so my choices are limited.

**I don't go out.**

* I just haven't met very many people who I enjoy being around. I'm just an anime/video game nerd but I don't enjoy conventions or school clubs of that type so I don't get to meet people at all. In fact I haven't met anyone new in several years.

*  I don't even like hanging out with my family, they're all extremely extroverted, loud, and we have jarringly different interests. I just don't enjoy being around them at all.


**I don't exercise**

* I played football and ran track all throughout high school and then some after that. 6 years of being very, very fit for most of the year and then I got bored of working out.

* I never really bonded with that type of crowd and I don't care much about how I looked.

* I like being skinny and I mostly saw work outs as an excuse to put myself through a bit of suffering and punishment


**I did pick up drawing recently**

* I guess I do enjoy it a bit but it takes me 4-5 hours of sketching to get something I'm okay with so it's really draining

* other than drawing, video games, and anime/manga I don't have any other hobbies I find enjoyable.


So yeah I'm pretty limited on skills but had high expectations for myself so when depression hit I let go of all my cares as a defense mechanism for losing the one thing I actually valued. At least that's what I think happened to my mind.

**My self-worth has been sitting on the ocean floor for years, I have had absolutely no support to salvage my morale, and my aspirations are lacking.** The only thing that really makes me feel alive and happy is playing video games, which is unfortunate since I can't make a living out of it. I would say that I'm making good progress to finding myself on a noose or taking a dive into the water beneath a bridge at this rate.

I've thought about this a lot and I think there are two things that would improve my state of mind. Accomplish something great, and finding friends. I don't think I'm worthy of anything great, so doing something great would challenge that. Though I've tried and failed at a lot of things already. Setting easier goals feels pathetic and insulting. And I'm so picky with my company that I learned to just enjoy solitude. But it would be nice if there actually was someone I could be happy to see.

My sliver of hope to have a good life feels like it's almost all gone. I feel like an hourglass running out of time. I know I'm still very young but I feel very empty and I just keep thinking to myself "It's alright, I tried best and that's fine. Just let it be."
