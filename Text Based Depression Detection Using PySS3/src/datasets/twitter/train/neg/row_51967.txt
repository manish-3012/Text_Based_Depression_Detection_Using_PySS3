Is anyone else passively suicidal (is that a thing)? Is it just a lazy cop out to hope a freak accident will kill you rather than you screwing it up yourself and ending up half brain damaged because you werenâ€™t â€œaccurateâ€ enough to do it right?I found the formula a few years back. Got pretty damn closeâ€” woke up in ICU coming off a ventilator. My fault for dialing drunk instead of breaking my phone first..



I havenâ€™t been lucky enough to get my hands on that solution again since that last time. 



Every morning is sort of like, â€œI wonder if the tractor trailer in the middle lane doesnâ€™t see me and crushes me into the side rail at 70mph in my coupe with no airbagsâ€. Sometimes I contemplate getting out of the car and jumping but thatâ€™d be traumatizing someone else.



Or if some crazy thing happened and I was threatened at gunpoint, I think I might just be a total asshole to get myself shot in the face. 



â€œPassivelyâ€ suicidal. I do not feel itâ€™s the same as ideation, because I donâ€™t have a feasible plan. 



Very many reasons for these feelings. Stems back over 10 years. Used to feel worthless. I donâ€™t anymore. Just too much shit on top of months of lows and those few blissful weeks of â€œhighâ€. Wish I had more of those.
