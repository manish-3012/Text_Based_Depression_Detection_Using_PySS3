Help Me Out Please....I tried my best. I started to wake up early in the mornings and jog and go to my classes and Study Well getting to get good marks in tears and I deleted Instagram or Snap chat and I tried to focus on making friends, but here we are. Back to the old ways,  where I am feeling extremely unsatisfied and unhealthy and uncomfortable and just worst. I am feeling like the world is going to end and then,  I actually want it too. I used to Self Harm and even though I tried and tried to stop, but it's like the whole Universe is like just wanting me to revert back to my old ways- Unproductive, mean and anxious, always agitated and crying Me. And I don't wanna. I'd rather die than do this and I just don't know what to do. I didn't eat lunch today and because of me, my mom did not and I am just feeling like the worst person in the world and I don't know why this is happening but from the week, I have been getting episodes where I just cry without any reasons and then all of the existential crisis questions head on to me. And none of my School Friends are even trying to contact me after I have gone aloof on social media. I just left school last year and am now in Junior College but I am not that good at making friends so it is like hell In Here. 

But I just once again don't know what to do.
