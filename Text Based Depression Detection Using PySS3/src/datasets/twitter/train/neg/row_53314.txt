I feel like a failure.Whenever I try to voice my hopelessness to people around me they remind me of my failures. I can't and won't do anything to better myself. When I do strive to achieve something I get ridiculed and it's used against me in arguments. I've had a job since I was 16. I stopped working when my second child was born because I still get depressed about leaving the others in childcare. The very people who supported my decision now call me lazy, useless, worthless, unaccomplished. I don't forgive those who have hurt me and that is also a fault of mine. I'm pathetic and have a dark soul for begrudging the happiness of those who hated to see me content. 

I'm so tired. It sounds ridiculous but my entire life people have been mean to me. My husband who I thought was my ally mocks that by telling me I have a complex of Me vs the world and the world can't be wrong. 

I've attempted suicide before and I honestly love my children but I can't catch a break. I'm just a garbage person. I can't get away.
