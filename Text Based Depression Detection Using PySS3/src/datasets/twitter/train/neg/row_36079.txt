My life is so messed up it feels like its beyond repairTime and time again iâ€™ve made the wrong choice by going back to drugs and tonight I paid the ultimate price. I just donâ€™t believe iâ€™ll ever be able to live normally again. My life is shit, my home life is shit, my relationships are shit, and everything about my life is just shit. I canâ€™t even trust myself anymore, I just give up. I feel like theres no way out.
