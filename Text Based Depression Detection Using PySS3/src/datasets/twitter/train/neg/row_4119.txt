I'm honestly in awe of how much of a mess I've become7am, and I'm freaking curled up naked in a sheet on our bathroom floor. We ran out of rum so I can't taper my drinking like I planned. I never realized how much of a bitch withdrawals were, probably because once I started drinking, it was a chain of drunken days and nights. I never stayed sober long enough to feel this. The occasional hand tremor or headache, but I'm struggling to even type this. It's like losing complete control of your body.

I'm either sick with a fucking killer cold, respiratory infection, or my all time favorite, alcohol abuse related heart disease. Haven't slept in over 24 hours because I can't breathe when I'm lying down. I legit fell asleep INTO the toilet. That one actually got a chuckle out of me.

I don't know what the purpose in posting this was. Venting? I have been having suicidal thoughts for months but kicking the booze, lack of sleep have just seemed to push those thoughts to the forefront.
