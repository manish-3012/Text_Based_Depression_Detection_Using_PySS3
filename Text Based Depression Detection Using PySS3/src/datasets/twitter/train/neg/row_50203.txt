I can feel myself slippingI've been suicidal since I was 11. For a few years, I was numb to it but I'm 19 now and I just can't find a reason to live anymore.

Things have been falling apart for a long time and I'm just waiting for the end.

I used to only want a pain free death, but it's gotten to a point where I wouldn't mind my body swinging from the rafters or overdosing on all the pills I can find. 

My last attempt was on my birthday, I don't remember doing it but I made the mistake of telling someone I was going to "take a shit tonne of pills" before I did it and they contacted my father, who was out getting drunk, to check on me and he did after a few hours, but all he did was wake me up and then leave. 

I don't have the energy to get up and eat or clean my clothes anymore, I barely ever get dressed and I'm constantly on the edge of self harm. I relapsed a few months ago and I tried again a week ago. I didn't have the energy to hurt myself. I'm pathetic. 

I have one friend who lives on a different continent and whom I find I have nothing to talk about to anymore and I have a boyfriend who lives at the other side of the world. Our relationship is failing and it seems like he's going to break up with me soon because we don't talk anymore and he's never enjoyed spending time together. 

I'm losing everything and I think I'm going to kill myself soon.
