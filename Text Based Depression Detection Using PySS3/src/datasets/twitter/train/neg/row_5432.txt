close to giving up.its my first post here. 
im in my last year of high school, and im in a class filled with bad people. the environment is energy-draining, its been like that last year too. i have a person ( someone close to me) whom i am extremely attached to and love, in the same class, but they disappoint me. they tell me they love me. they tell me they want me in their life. but words are words. i hate that i love them so much. it hurts me. i hate that i am obsessed with them. all i ever hear are words.being the unconfident low-self esteemed guy that i am, i give off too much energy trying to talk to them, going up to them, texting them, calling them (the relationship is one-sided); and wondering day by day for countless hours if what they tell me is true. or just a lie. i am constantly confused. i always get jealous and upset when they speak to other people. wishing that was me. wondering if i ever lacked something, or if they had lost interest in me. they tell me i make them happy. they tell me they'd choose me over and before anyone. constantly latching onto their words. desperately trying to believe them. even when they disappoint me, i remember their words. i am not scared of death. i do not flinch at its call. i find death relieving. like a dear friend who makes you forget about your problems. but this time its permanently. im tired. i just feel like i lost myself over someone. i rarely find happiness or joy. and i loathe myself whenever i feel this way. because i feel like i never deserve it.   everyday is the same. everyday is just me restlessly waiting for the school day to finish so i could go home and sleep. and await the next day. and the next. and the next. im tired. i want to escape. and i feel like death could help me.
