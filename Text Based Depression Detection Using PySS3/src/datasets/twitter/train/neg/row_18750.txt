I don't want to be found.What makes me want to hurl is imagining a funeral with people pretending they cared. Some of them have even seen my suicidal posts and never said shit to me. When some has found out I was raped, they run away. They literally run.

I want to die, but in a forest or a ditch or just... somewhere I can be hidden from sight until a million years later when someone finds remains of a person but it's been so long they can't identify it. I want it to be like I was never here.
