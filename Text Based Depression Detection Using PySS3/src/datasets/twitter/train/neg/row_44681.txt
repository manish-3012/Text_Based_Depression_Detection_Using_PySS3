Just tired.Hi there, it's been awhile. I am falling apart and I feel like no one in my life cares. I have had an especially rough go of things the past six or seven years and it is all catching up at once.  I tried reaching out to the people who are supposed to be closest to me and gotten responses ranging from "You're fine." to "I can't listen to your self loathing, it literally makes me feel sick." I spend so much energy trying to not be a shaking ball of anxiety that other things fall by the side and cause people to be mad at me. I had to give up a job that I loved for a job that is not what I was told it was in order to make a living wage. I get yelled at all day on a phone now... and by the end of my shift it is a fight to get to my car before I burst into tears. Tears that I have to get out before I get home because weakness is not tolerable. I barely sleep. I have lost ten pounds because I am too stressed to eat more than snacks. I was supposed to be getting a place with my boyfriend but now we are fighting and so last night was spent not sleeping and doing rental research on my own and considering ways that I could be less of a burden to those around me. 

I am trying to push through... But I just don't really see a point anymore.
