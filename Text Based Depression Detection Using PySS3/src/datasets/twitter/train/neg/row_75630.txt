How can I commit suicide without passing on the pain to my family?I understand itâ€™s human nature to reach out in a situation like this. But please I am just asking for legitimate answers or ideas that people may have.   

I love my family but the simple fact is I do not want to be alive anymore. I would hate for my family to have to endure any sort of pain from my actions, so I was hoping someone would have suggestions.  

Thank you.
