Do any of you have an age set in mind?Iâ€™m 27 now and I was thinking about doing it at 30. I maybe have another year or two left in me. Iâ€™ll see 2020 out but I know I wonâ€™t make it to 2030 or to â€œoldâ€ age. My entire life has been bleak and I canâ€™t keep being strong. I am tired all the time.

Hope this question makes sense
