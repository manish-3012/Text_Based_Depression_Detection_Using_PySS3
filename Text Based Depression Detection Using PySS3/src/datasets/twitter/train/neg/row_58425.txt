It just seems pointlessAt 22 Iâ€™m doing significantly better than many of my friends at least according to societal standards.
Iâ€™m regularly told Iâ€™m talented at work, I live on my own, Iâ€™m financially stable, and from a career perspective Iâ€™m on a fast track to advancement.
Yet Iâ€™m still depressed, both my parents have a drinks problem in fact itâ€™s why I barely talk to my mother. My father is in AA and when I started to notice I was binge drinking at 15 I stopped yet Iâ€™ve been drinking these last few weeks very heavily.
Iâ€™ve been depressed my whole life but over the last few years Iâ€™ve been dealing with my emotions fairly healthily meditation, poetry, and exercise they give me a way to force myself to deal with my emotions and my drinking was replaced with smoking weed on the weekends.
But recently Iâ€™ve been wondering â€œdoes it matter?â€ and having read Buddhist texts I found the answer was â€œnoâ€ and I was ok with that. We grind forward day after day and in all truth all the little things we worry about donâ€™t really matter. I know that, none of my small issues with work or my struggles with my personal life or lack there of are of any importance yet recently itâ€™s all been tearing at me as if itâ€™s all life or death.
The slightest issues at work now ruin my week feelings of constant loneliness tear me down every day and the only escape from it is a particular affectionate black cat who I love but doesnâ€™t seem like the strongest support network.
Iâ€™ve considered therapy yet I worry I canâ€™t afford it. Iâ€™ve thought perhaps itâ€™s time to look at dating more seriously but being dependent on another person for my happiness doesnâ€™t strike me as a good idea.
Perhaps I already know the answer to my problems but honestly I canâ€™t even tell you the question. Iâ€™m not sure why I wrote this I doubt Iâ€™ll actually commit suicide my father and friends would blame themselves I canâ€™t do that to them. I apologize for wasting your time
