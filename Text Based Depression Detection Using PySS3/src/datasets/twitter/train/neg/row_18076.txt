Im so tired of feeling like this.I should be happy, I live in a good country and have a great family, but everyday i wake up and just want it all to end, if it wasnt for the pain it would cause my family i would have done it by now. Even when i'm with friends or the people i love, the thoughts are always in the back of my mind; 'no body gives a f*ck about you, just kill yourself already' I feel so useless all the time, i just want to be happy..
