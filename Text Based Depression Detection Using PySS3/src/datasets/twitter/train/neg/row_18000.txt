Itâ€™s been a whileItâ€™s been a while since I last wrote in here. But since then Iâ€™ve graduated college and while I thought that would be the best thing. Itâ€™s not. Because finding a job even â€œessential workerâ€ job is hard to get. Iâ€™m broke Iâ€™m on 80mg of Prozac and drinking every other day. Iâ€™m just miserable and I donâ€™t know how to fix it or fix myself. I feel lost and under appreciated. I feel worthless because I canâ€™t even nail a job at target I just get rejections left and right. 
These days are starting to look darker and darker feeling colder days going slower. Iâ€™m starting to feel like Iâ€™m back at the beginning of my depression battle. I donâ€™t know what to do to be honest. Deep down Iâ€™m hoping something will just happen because Iâ€™m mindlessly applying, interviewing and trying even if I donâ€™t want to. I just feel so miserable.
