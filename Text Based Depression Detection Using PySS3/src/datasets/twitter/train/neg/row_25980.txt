I'm a failureSo I failed my midterm exam for this one elective. The results are 40% of the final grade and I'm not confident I could rely on the other requirements (reports and quizzes) to pull my grades up to get a passing score. And since I'm not doing too well on my other subjects this sem either, my chances of graduating with honors will be compromised if I fail this elective.

My Mom assures me it's fine if I don't graduate with honors, that she's proud of me regardless, but she's just saying that. I know *she* wants me to graduate with honors more than *I* want to graduate with honors. I know that even though she's never strict with me, never tries to pressure me, and is always the first person to tell me to take it easy, me not graduating with honors would break her heart.

I don't think I could live with seeing the disappointment on her face when she finds out. Even worse, I don't think I could live with seeing her *try* to hide the disappointment on her face. Just thinking about it makes my stomach churn and my chest constrict. It makes me wanna grab the sharpest object within reach. 

Of course I know killing myself would break her heart too. But if I'm gonna end up breaking her heart either way, I'd rather not live to actually see it.
