when do you know to get helpIâ€™m afraid Iâ€™m going to kill myself. I see a therapist regularly and have confessed these feelings to her, but I feel them so intensely now that Iâ€™m afraid for myself especially in the coming days. Iâ€™m afraid what a hospitalization would do to my family, but I feel like I need help. I already deal with self harm and relapsed today. Iâ€™m 17, please help.
