Maybe soon, maybe next week or after that i will end it, i'm stuck.Now for months i have had almost everyday some kind of thoughts to end it all. Because no one wants me, i soon have worthless masters degree, no real friends, no family, no job or probably never have. I have no real working skills. For 5 years i have been self learning and studying software engineering and recently got interested in hacking, but no one wants to hire me, even for making a coffee. Well how could they in this economy and stuff... Every week now i have made a "pact" for my self, that if i don't win lottery i will kill my self, never done it, but now my graduation is closer and closer and my options are getting fewer. It seems that i don't have anything to offer to anyone, for job or for other people. And it's true, i don't know shit or i'm not that social. 

I haven't been able to do anything in few weeks because i get "depressed", because i have to do something. Always when i'm visiting the student health center they sent me away, always saying that they don't have a time or room, and public health center says go to student center and "you are not our responsibility", so thanks a lot and fuck them. 

I feel that i really have to leave this city or even country to find something worth living, and i would, but again, no job, no money, no place where to go... so i'm really stuck in here. Whats the point keep living when no one cares or wants to care.

this doesn't make much sense since i'm hysterical, crying and i haven't slept much recently.
