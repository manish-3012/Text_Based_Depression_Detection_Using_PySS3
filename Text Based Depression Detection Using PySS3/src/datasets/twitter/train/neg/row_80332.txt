I donâ€™t have an interest in life, should I just leave?Iâ€™m 16 and I have absolutely no interest towards this world, itâ€™s boring, Iâ€™m going to spend the rest of my life in an office working towards nothing and the most â€œadventureâ€ or â€œfunâ€ I can ever have is walking through the woods or going to some foreign city which doesnâ€™t excite me at all, should I just kill myself?
