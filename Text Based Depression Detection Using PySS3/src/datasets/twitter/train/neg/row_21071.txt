A never ending slumber in the mountains; a suicide plan.I just turned 23, and things have never been easy. I really owe it to the nonchalant friends, the stubborn, stuck in the past family, and the unempathetic lovers. I have been reminded left and right that my wants and needs will never be put above anothers. That my mental illness is a plague, something that makes me so damaged, its irreparable. That I will never be anyone's priority; not my mother's, my father's, my sisters or brother. Not a partner, not a life long friend. No ones. I am just a burden. I belong to no one, and I'm starting to come to peace with that. And if you argue life is meant to be lived happily and contentedly without the intention of love and connections, that is bullshit. You cant live an amazing life "loving" your pathetic irreparable self... But before I go off on a tangent, I just wanted to state that I'll be disapearing. I will be going to the west coast. I'm going to stay in the mountains, where I will be consuming 28mg of Ativan, and a bottle of whiskey. It's quite pathetic, the life I lived. So I decided I will be using the upwards of $800 worth of gear i invested in to backpack in the mountains until I can't anymore. I have another $800 in cash that I will take with me. After my money runs out, I will find myself under the starts, in the cool winter breeze, and sleeping most peacefully.
