I feel lost.I kinda feel lost, I don't have any diagnoses, very few real friends and i guess a few not so good half-real ones and a few real, but no so good ones. I'm hopeless, I ditch classes and get shit for it, I try my hardest but never seem to do good or the right thing. I feel like i don't deserve to feel sorry for myself or having someone else feel sorry for me. Being overweight and a smoker doesn't help, don't really drink, maybe once a month. I have no idea what to do because as i said i don't feel like i deserve anything. I'm surrounded by people who have diagnoses and seem to struggle more than me, but I somehow feel like i need help and deserve something better? I don't know what to say because I feel like i don't deserve care or anything of the sort, but at the same time i feel like someone should care for me. I really want to figure out what is wrong with me, but the only therapist close to me is a straight up bad therapist; sources are all my friends with severe or mild mental illnesses. And i don't feel comfortable with a therapist from a big city, i have no idea why, if anyone can help me figure out why i think like this, and if something is wrong with me, I'd really appreciate it.
