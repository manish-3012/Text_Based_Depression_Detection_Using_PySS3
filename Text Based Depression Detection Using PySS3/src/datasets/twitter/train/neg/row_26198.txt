uk, desperate.i was 17, and i kissed a 14 year old girl more than once, this happened at our school.

it was a long time ago. we only ever hung out at school, and we were only "together" for a week.

im paranoid that one day, il get a nock on my door I will be prosecuted and my entire life will be ruined forever. i had no idea kissing could even slightly be considered a sexual act.

I don't want to live if thats the case. I'd rather be dead, and im thinking about killing myself right now. I honestly think that maybe I don't deserve life anymore.
