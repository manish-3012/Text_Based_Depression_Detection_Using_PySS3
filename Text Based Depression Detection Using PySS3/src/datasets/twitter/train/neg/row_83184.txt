I'm just delaying the inevitable.Everyone hates me. I've been told I'm worthless several times. No friends, no job. Nothing works, nothing gets better. Every time I try to reach out for help I either get ignored or yelled at. I'm pretty sure it'll happen on here too. It's a sign that there's no point in me being here and I just need to die because nobody cares and is just annoyed by me. I've tried to hold out but so far it's been pointless and I'm sure more pain awaits. I don't know why I'm delaying it there is nothing and nobody to hold out for.
