I feel like I want to die.I want to scream. I want to yell in everyone's faces, "I NEED HELP. I NEED LOVE."
I feel so useless. I feel like a burden. I add difficulty in everyone's life I know.
I try so hard to be there for people. I love so deeply. Maybe that's my fault. I'm too available, maybe? My love is has no boundaries, so maybe it's tsjeb advantage of? Or maybe I'm a piece of shit. Maybe I'm just that unlikable. Maybe I have nothing to offer.
If i died, would anyone care? Maybe for a little while, but I think in the end, it would be for the better.
I hate myself.
