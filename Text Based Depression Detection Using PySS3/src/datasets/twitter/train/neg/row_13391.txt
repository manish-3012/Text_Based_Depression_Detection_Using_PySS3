What are my options? I had a breakdown in the car this week because I realized that the only thing getting me through the day anymore is the thought that I might be able to save up enough money to buy a gun. I don't want to go through therapy and live, I want to die. But that would make my loved ones very upset. I don't have money to pay for proper treatment, but it's become increasingly clear to me that help from strangers can't really cut it. I need to know what my options are, because I physically can't continue like this anymore. Is there any way that I can seek out affordable psychiatric treatment in my area? I've tried researching it and haven't found anything useful. I live in Worcester, MA if that makes a difference.
