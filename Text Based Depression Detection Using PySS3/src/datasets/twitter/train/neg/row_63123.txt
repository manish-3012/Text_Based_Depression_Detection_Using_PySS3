I just want this to be overI've dealt with depression for 23 years (I'm in my 30's). I get close to ending it twice, but I move forward.  I drink alcohol to cope, and keep moving forward still drinking.  I FINALLY FIND THE CAUSE. Depression fades as i come to terms with being transgender.  I HAVE TO SUPPRESS my transition to support my wife's health recovery, and alcohol comes back along with depression. 

 Dysphoria is kicking my ass. I don't know what to do. I just want to rant in a safe space. If I rant in a transgender sub I'll just trigger others.   I just want to be myself. That's it. Why can't I let myself do that!  I look in the mirror and hate the person I see. Now I know why I always have. I want to tear myself down.

I'm tired of this struggle. I'm tired of people belittling me or supporting me and not caring about the details. I'm tired of the explanations.

 I'm sick and tired of all the fucking drinking. I don't need it anymore. I'm so close to getting past this bs. Just stop fucking drinking. 

Tonight is the night. I want, need this alcoholism to be over. Not one drink until Halloween. I need to do this. The alcohol goes away, and with it this guilt and depression. This needs to be over. Not my life. The alcohol.
