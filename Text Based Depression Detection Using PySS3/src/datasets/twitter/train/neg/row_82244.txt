Already hating my last semester of university. Why can't I just be happy and live on my own? I'm ready to end it all soon.So I've been attending university for the past three years now. I am not loving it. My parents chose my History major for me just so they can be happy that their retarded son can do something "useful" in life. I don't have a job, been searching around EVERYWHERE for one. All my friends have jobs and therefore are busy with both school and work leaving me no free time. I hate how people consider me socially awkward and not keeping up with the latest trends in life. The only thing I can do to stay sane is to stay in my room and play video games and go on Reddit. I feel that my life is over. I just want to end it all soon.
