I will kill myself because I am femaleYou have no idea how disgusted by this body I am. The lack of physical strength, can not compete with men in sports, not allowed to work in jobs that require physical strength, being expected to be nurturing and care about feminine things such as beauty, clothes, babies, other garbage, periods and body hair banning me from swimming in the pool, have to always know where all the public bathrooms are, men always viewing me as a sex object first and foremost and not a human being, the expectation to tear my body in half to bring a snotty bloody gross being into this world. The disgusting physical features I am constantly made aware of.

I am sick and tired of this. This is the last year I walk this Earth, then I am beating the shit out of the angel who assigned me to this humiliating body.
