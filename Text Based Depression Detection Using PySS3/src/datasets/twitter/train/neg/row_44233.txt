Vent...Fuck me. Why am I so stupid?!! I donâ€™t want this â€œself qurantineâ€ to end. I donâ€™t want it to last any longer either. I remembered my future again. Nothingâ€™s ruined. I just hate everything and everyone. I fucking hate myself. Thereâ€™s nothing I enjoy anymore, even though I am pretty good at everything I do. I find no joy doing anything. I have lost all enthusiasm for life. Iâ€™ve been like this for years.

&amp;#x200B;

I am about to finish high school. Everything about high school has been shitty, except for the first half of my senior year. Thatâ€™s when I got to actually feel good. I felt connected and I actually made some friends. Was that my lifetime share of joy? Because in my head everything seems to have gone to shit. There are people that hang onto me like thereâ€™s anything worth saving of me. Or anything recoverable at all. I canâ€™t even be bothered to answer their messages or calls. What the hell is wrong with me?! I keep whining that Iâ€™m lonely, yet I am the one ignoring everyone that is trying to reach out to me.

&amp;#x200B;

My arms are, yet again, aching to be cut. I wonâ€™t harm myself.

&amp;#x200B;

Why is everything so terrible? I canâ€™t even watch a movie or play a game. Today, I finally managed to get a particular game to run on my PC, after many attempts. I played it a couple of years ago and I really liked it, but I canâ€™t get myself to replay it now.

&amp;#x200B;

Nothing feels right. I canâ€™t study, I canâ€™t comprehend myself being happy going to college (what a fucking terrible statement. Though college is basically free in my country, I am so fucking priviledged to go to one). I fucking hate everything and I want everything and everyone and myself to not fucking exist I want to be fucking dead please I wish I

&amp;#x200B;

I wish I was dead. I wonâ€™t kill myself. Not after promising that I wouldnâ€™t try it again. But itâ€™s so tempting...

&amp;#x200B;

I wonâ€™t die this young, I can feel it.

&amp;#x200B;

But this pain is unbearable.

&amp;#x200B;

I need to cuddle.

fuck.

fucking rant. 

sorry.

and writing this feels like fishing for attention. Especially so, that everyone here seems to be going through much worse things.

I probably won't respond.
