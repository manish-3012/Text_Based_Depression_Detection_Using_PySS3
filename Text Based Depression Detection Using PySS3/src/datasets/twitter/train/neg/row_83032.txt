At times I feel like killing myself due to feeling like a failure to my parents.I never joined a club. I never joined a sport other than soccer in the 4th grade and all I got was a pity trophy since I was the worst on the team. I was never a popular kid in school so I never was invited to hang with people outside of school. Come highschool graduation, I was supposed to go live with my dad but I let my anger about my dad always being away due to being in the navy get to me and said no. My parents then agreed that I could take some time to "recharge" - they didn't want me to go straight into college without being certain about my future. During the 2 years I got comfortable. Sure I still looked for jobs (with no success of course though that's probably due to me having no experience as well as living near Chicago because who would want to hire someone like me right?) but other than that I did nothing but lay on my ass. Come to today. I'm wrapping up my first and last semester at a community college in Illinois before I go live with my dad wherever that may be. Sure they say they're proud of me but I always feel like they really aren't. I'm 20 years old doing what I should've done 2 years ago. My parents constantly brings up mistakes I made in the past for reasons why I should go live with my dad even though I honestly don't. I've done nothing to be worth bragging to their coworkers to. I'm a fat black worthless nerd with no friends who can't get a job or a girlfriend. They say "mom can't help raise a man" but for my parents it's even worse since I feel like such a failure. At times I feel like my my mistakes and who I am as a person, life will never get better and I'm better off dead. At least then my parents wouldn't have to deal with me anymore.
