Whatâ€™s the point of living like this?I feel like my life is in an infinite loop, I wake up each morning and lay in bed for a few hours, get up, go downstairs and watch tv until I go back upstairs. Itâ€™s no way to live. I canâ€™t even find it in myself to leave my house. I donâ€™t know how much longer I can keep living like this...
