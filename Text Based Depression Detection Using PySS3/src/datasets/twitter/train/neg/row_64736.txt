Hopeful for helpI understand this may be a lot to ask, but I was hoping there is someone out there on this sub who may understand my thoughts and could talk with me about how I am feeling. I have been depressed for a very long time, since the age of twelve. A result of a combination of life's miseries. I have periods where I feel relatively ok. Recently I had several months where I was truly happy. Prior to that it had been about 3 years since I had felt real, extended happiness and I honestly forgot what it was like. That has ended and I am now spiraling out of control. I recently was stopped from a suicide attempt, one that I was for the first time fully committed to. I was close. This was following an attempt in which I could not follow through only days earlier. 
If someone would be willing, PM me and I would be very grateful for the chance to talk with someone. I have tried the helplines but I have never had good experiences.
