Sleeping with a NooseI have a bed post that makes it easy for me to tie a soft noose to, and have enough slack for me to toss and turn in bed. I've only actually fallen asleep during a nap once, and the rest have just been me sat doing what I'm doing now. Tonight I'm going to try and sleep with it on all night. I know it will probably do nothing, but I can't justify an active suicide in my head.  Atleast fate is helping me with this, passive as it may seem.
