Life is painIt hurts to live. I'm worthless, always have been, always will be. I need to earn things to be happy. Nobody benefits from me. Best solution is death.

There are better people than me starving to death every day.

It hurts to live so much.

Please, somebody kill me, somebody track me down and kill the 16 year old male, the 16 year old piece of shit, please.
