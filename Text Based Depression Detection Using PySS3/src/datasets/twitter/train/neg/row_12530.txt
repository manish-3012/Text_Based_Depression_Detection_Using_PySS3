The thing that scares me the most is myselfDonâ€™t know if anyone else feels this but I am the biggest danger to myself. Iâ€™d describe myself as chill asf, generally happy, and I have one of those personalities that resonates with a lot of people. My personalities been gone for a while now and itâ€™s gonna be a really long road before I get it back. I guess you could say Iâ€™m improving very slowly. Thereâ€™s two sides to me, the side I let people see thatâ€™s â€œhappyâ€ and chill and the dark side. My moods change a lot bc I have a periodic form of depression. But this dark side scares me and it comes and goes. Scary movies donâ€™t even scare me anymore because Iâ€™ve seen worse shit in my head. Satan himself could be in front of me and I would not give a flying fuck. Ive imagined what itâ€™d be like to hang myself, dangling for a while until I pass out, then after a while my body starts convulsing and finally itâ€™s all silence while Iâ€™m slowly spinning and then my family finds me in the morning, my mom screaming in agony bc she sees her sons lifeless expression while the rope is tightly squeezed around my neck. Fucked up shit to think about, huh? I see shit like that all the time and honestly I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll ever stop seeing it because my depression is mental, like I canâ€™t control it. I could start to feel shitty as Iâ€™m typing this. People think of hell as a place we canâ€™t reach until we die but thatâ€™s not true because everyday I wake up is another day in hell. Iâ€™m not in search of help, I already know I got fucked up shit going on and Iâ€™ve already started taking steps to try and improve my quality of life, like getting a therapist and stuff, but i know at any moment, my mind could flip the switch and I could end up hanging from a rafter in my room. Thatâ€™s what scares me. I just didnâ€™t know if anyone else thinks of themselves as their own enemy? Like at any moment you could just be like fuck this shit Iâ€™m out.
