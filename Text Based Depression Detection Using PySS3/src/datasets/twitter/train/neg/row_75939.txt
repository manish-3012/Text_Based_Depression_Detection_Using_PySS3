I'm sick of being useless.I'm unemployed and worth nothing. I'm constantly anxious and have bouts of depression that can last for weeks. I have no one in my life I feel like I can talk to about anything.

I just want to be a missing persons case. I don't want to be found. I'm useless and lonely and always have been.
