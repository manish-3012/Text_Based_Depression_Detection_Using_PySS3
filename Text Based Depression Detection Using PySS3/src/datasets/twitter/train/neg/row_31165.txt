Cant go on anymoreIve lost the will to go on. I have no friends no family support. Im stuck in a job that i hate with toxic leadership. I have a lot of dreams but no feasible way to reach them. The things i used to enjoy dont bring me happiness anymore. I cant even remember a time when i was happy. I pray every night that i dont wake up.

Im not sure why i decided to post this. Maybe its to vent. Maybe its to tell my favorite website goodbye.
