An ambient desire to end life: one slowly becoming less so.I guess this is a long story, or perhaps a short one. I have no outstanding problems of my own, a loving family (if a little over religious), financial stability (ish), and many friends both online and off.

However, life simply has become an apathetic motion. I survive for my friends and for those around me. Partially because it stings to know I'd be hurting someone, partially because I haven't had a direct reason to plunge over the edge. This however has been chipped away of late as my life has become more and more distraught.

I live day to day just working, sleeping, and trying to escape the exhaustion of work. I've tried many jobs, from office work to call center work to customer service to currently just regular overnight stocking. However as of late my depression has only gotten worse. I'm tired of working day by day, struggling to make money just so I can enjoy the few moments I'm not working. Each day at work I contemplate suicide, I've done research on it, have a will planned out, and everything set. My friends would be hurt but I don't feel that is my responsibility to them.

I called off work today because I don't think I could survive another time, but I need to work to survive. It isn't the job, but moreso the... motions. Its so long, hours of doing the same thing with no thought or reason. Hours I'm trapped doing things I loath. Its the same feeling for every job, but I need to do it to survive. Its such a basic part of life that there isn't an avoiding it short of pure luck or simply not living. I'm not at a complete risk this second, but I'm not sure how much longer till I decide to lay down and just stop.

-On the offnote I have not gotten therapy. I currently take an anti depressant but I wont be able to afford a refill for awhile. My state does not have medicaid expansion (missouri) so I need to work longer if I'm to afford any type of therapy... therapy I'm not sure could ever help.
