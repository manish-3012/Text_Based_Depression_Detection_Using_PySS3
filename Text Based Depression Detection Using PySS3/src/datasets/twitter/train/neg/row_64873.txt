My Parents Are Killing MeI'm really not doing well right about now and I felt the need to vent before I go and take my life. I'm currently 16 and in high school and the amount of pressure from my parents is breaking me. Maybe I set the bar too high in middle school where I got straight A's and aced everything. I was good at piano and was steadily beginning to really enjoy playing. However, upon reaching high school everything changed. I was forced into taking almost all AP classes that I really wasn't ready for.  I tried telling them that I wasn't this fucking genius that they made me out to be but with that they just put me with tutors and extra classes to "make it easier". fuck you, it didn't make it easier. I come home and am pretty much cut off from everyone but my parents. If I don't "maintain" the grades they get mad. Last time, I got a B and my mother decided to take away my computer which I needed to do a project on purpose so I would be humiliated in class by the teacher because I didn't do any of the work. 

My dad is too fucking spineless and looks the other way and drinks. All. Day. Long. I can't remember the last time my parents wanted to do anything with me that included any "bonding" so I feel no love or connection whatsoever to them. 

I recently gave up though. I can't take it. I let my grades drop and I now constantly get berated about how I'm useless, and that I won't get anything from them when I'm "hungry on the streets begging for food". I have nowhere to go, when I told my friends my problems they brushed me off and called me a little pussy and told the whole school. So bye. Fuck this world. Fuck you school. Fuck you grades. Fuck you "friends". And most important fuck you mom and dad. You made every hour of these past three years hell and I hope that if there is a higher power, he fists ur fucking assholes in hell ;)
