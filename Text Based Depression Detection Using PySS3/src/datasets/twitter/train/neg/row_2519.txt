Why am I so afraid to kill myself?Iâ€™m so afraid that Iâ€™ll kill myself and thereâ€™s a slight 0.162727% chance that it might get better at some point even though it never does after all the other times I tried to commit suicide. 

Iâ€™m afraid that something will go wrong and Iâ€™ll wake up paralysed or severely brain damaged and then I wonâ€™t EVER be able to kill myself. 

Please help me. I need to know how to avoid that from happening.
