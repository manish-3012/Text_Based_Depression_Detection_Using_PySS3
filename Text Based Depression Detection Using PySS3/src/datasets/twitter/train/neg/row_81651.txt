I think about killing myself every nightI have for a long time now. I dont even remember how long ago it started.

I turn 20 in december and I have 2 classes in community college. Im a kissless virgin and don't have a job.

I haven't hung out with anybody in over a year. I cant get myself to do laundry or clean.

Im skinny and short and I dont exercise because I feel inferior and shitty about myself when I do.

I have an anxiety disorder and my therapist says I probably have aspergers.

I'm too afraid to actually try killing myself, but I cant stand being like this any longer.
