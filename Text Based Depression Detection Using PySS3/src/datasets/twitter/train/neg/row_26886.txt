meaninglessi was forced to move to a different country. my dad said we were â€œvisitingâ€, and then he says weâ€™re moving here. i didnâ€™t get to say bye to my friends, cats, or anything else. i couldnâ€™t bring my instruments, and i have to go to a different school in the middle of the year. my parents hate me, and i feel like a burden to everyone i know. i annoy everyone, and if i ever try to talk to someone they play it off as a joke, say â€œit be like that sometimesâ€, or â€œit will get better eventuallyâ€. well, news flash: it doesnâ€™t get better. everythingâ€™s getting worse, and iâ€™m tired of my struggles being fucking undermined and unreal because iâ€™m young and i have to be strong for my family. i feel so weak and useless. my whole life feels like some joke. my parents say they love me, but my mom was physically abusive, and my dad let her move back in after the court made her leave. my dad also said that if i went against the religion, he would disown me, and that he wouldnâ€™t love me if i did stuff he didnâ€™t like. my mom said that if i was gay or trans, she would send me to conversion therapy. i am bi and trans. i go to a school that has a uniform, and i have to wear the girls uniform. i hate it. iâ€™m not a girl, and it fucking sucks to be labeled as one over and over and over again. everything i do feels meaningless. i just go to school, come home, eat and shower, do homework if i have any, and just lay in bed on my phone for the rest of the day. iâ€™m so tired of living like this. itâ€™s so hard to get up in the mornings, because everything i do or say seems pointless. iâ€™m so tired of my struggles being constantly undermined because iâ€™m young, but obviously, iâ€™m just a teen, so itâ€™s just â€œteen angstâ€. iâ€™m so tired of everything, and it hurts so fucking much. itâ€™s becoming unbearable to even be awake. i wish i could just go to sleep forever. itâ€™s not like iâ€™d miss anything or that anyone would miss me.
