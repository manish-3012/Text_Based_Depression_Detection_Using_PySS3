Throwing in the toweli have tried so hard to survive this sad thing I call life but I really am losing the battle now. I live on my own and being quarantined alone in my apartment sucks. I lost my only companions that were my pet birds due to them being old. I am planning on overdosing tonight. I got no one and nothing giving me joy anymore. my mom told me she would rather have me dead because I look like my father that she hates. I have been mentally killed and I have no will to keep on going. my only friend  moved across Europe to another country and now I have no one I can meet to ease my pain. he never has time anymore to talk and I feel like I am all alone in this shitty room with white walls. I just want it all to end. I just want to find peace.
