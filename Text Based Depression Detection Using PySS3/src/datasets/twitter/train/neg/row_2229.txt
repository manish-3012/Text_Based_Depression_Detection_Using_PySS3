Turbulence before the descentI thought my last post here would be my last one for a while, but here I am again.

I feel so very lonely. I haven't heard from my best friend in a long time, and I don't know when he's coming home. My new friend has been, and will continue to be, out of reach for some time. I've honestly got no friends at home to speak of.

My existence is one within a dysfunctional family. Every day is a struggle to survive the onslaught of verbal and mental abuse that my sibling deals out to our parent and myself. It really wears us down.

I told myself when I come home from college that I was going to work hard to better myself, but that's not been the case. I haven't had the drive or willpower to work out and build a better body or study the subjects that I need to master. I just feel tired and numb everyday.

I miss feeling. I miss feeling a sense of belonging among others. I think I need that to keep going. I need appreciation and validation. Maybe it's time I look for someone to love. I know it's not the best time, I'd be lying to myself otherwise. The best time to look for someone would be when I'm stable, independent, and strong. But based on how everything's been going, I don't know when I'll get there. I might need to just let someone who could love me help.

I hope I don't make the same mistakes along the way that could bring me to a darker place. All I know is that I'm worn down. Everything I do is so that I can support my family and a future partner.

As long as I remember what I'm fighting for, maybe I'll better be able to fight the urge to end the pain of it all. But if it gets to be too much, I'll save the resources to go out on my own terms. I really hope it doesn't get there. Sorry for rambling.

May all of your days be better than the one before. &lt;3
