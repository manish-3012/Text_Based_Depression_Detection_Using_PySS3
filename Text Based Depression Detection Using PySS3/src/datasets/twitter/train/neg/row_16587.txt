My experience in the hospital is what keeps me from doing it.First time poster, but Iâ€™ve been depressed since about freshman year of high school. Suicidal since senior year started. Iâ€™m 18(M) now and just graduated in May. 

Iâ€™ve lived with my mom and her shitty bf since high school started. Her boyfriend was a mentally abusive alcoholic and has cheated on her at least 6 times. Maybe more because he sends d*ck pics to girls out of the country. Heâ€™d never do anything to me, so any hate he had for me was directed at my mom, who for whatever reason still loved him, even to this day. The day I turned 16, he wanted to charge me rent. Heâ€™d try to make my mom make me pay it even though I had no job. I couldnâ€™t move in with my dad because heâ€™s got a horrible heroin addiction. Her bf dropped it and it was never brought up until January 2019.

By then, he and my mom finally broke up and I needed to pick up whatever bills he left behind. The suicidal thoughts hit harder since I now had pressure on me to get a better paying job.

After a while, my mom began speaking to him again and forgave him for the 6th time because â€œhe loves herâ€. Sheâ€™s whined to everyone in the family about how horrible he is. Then she goes chasing him again? She only says heâ€™s her friend but sheâ€™s kicked me out of the house I pay rent in, just to spend the night with him.

I began to smoke marijuana to ease the pain, but it only made it worse. Then my mom took $300 from my car savings and it pushed me over the edge. I attempted to hang myself in March, but I was too fat and broke my belt. I called the hotline, and cried for an hour. They called the police and they showed up to my house. 

I was treated like a criminal. I was put in cuffs and they took my house keys, my phone, and my wallet. At the hospital, i was given clothes to change into as well as all my things. I had to put everything into a bag along with my clothes. 

When I got my new clothes, they gave me an XL shirt, XL pants and XL underwear. I wear 4XL. The clothes ripped apart at the seams and I looked like fat hulk. I was then told they had nothing bigger and that I couldnâ€™t have a gown because the drawstrings could be used to choke myself. I felt humiliated walking though the hospital to my small room. There all I could do was lay in bed and watch TV. No blankets or pillows. After 5 hours, they came in to talk to me. I had to lie and say I just got mad and Iâ€™m not interested in hurting myself. I was discharged and I Uberâ€™d home. 

I still struggle, but memories of the hospital are what keeps me from attempting.
