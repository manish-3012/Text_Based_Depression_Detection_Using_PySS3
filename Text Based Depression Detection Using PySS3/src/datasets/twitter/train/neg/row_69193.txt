What if I'm not me?I've always wondered what if I'm not me, would I be happy?

What if I don't look this and don't have this visible flaws, would society accept me and not call me ugly?
What if I'm not barely living and have the capacity to help others, would the people around me say that I'm finally useful? 
What if I can attend school without having a mental breakdown due to a lot of reasons? 
What if I'm not born in a third world country, will there be a huge difference in my happiness and mental health?
What if I don't have all these problems, will my mental health get better?

But.. I've seen people having everything that I dreamed of yet they still have suicidal thoughts. It does not make me feel happy at all. It kinda makes me feel that I'm... normal at some point. Having an unstable mental health is not based on your living situation nowadays and specially not on how you look. Suicidal thoughts.. ah not good.
