I give up I'm honestly tired of everything, if I fail getting into university this fall I will just end it all.

The sad thing is that even if I get in I know that I won't be happy, I have accepted the fact that I will be depressed my entire life. I have been meeting different psychiatrists for 4 years and I have even tried antidepressants, nothing works. I even opened up to my best friend because I keep hearing that it helps a lot, sure it did help a bit but it didn't change anything major.

I have runned out of options even if I don't kill myself this year, doesn't it change the fact that I will probably be depressed my whole life. I just want to be happy is that too much to ask? 

Why does nothing in my life ever goes my way!?

I'm saddens me to say this but I'm throwing in the towel, I give up, depression wins.
