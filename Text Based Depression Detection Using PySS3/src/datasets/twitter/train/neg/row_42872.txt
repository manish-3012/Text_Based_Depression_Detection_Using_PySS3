I'm reaching my limitI have no clue what's gonna happen to me. I feel like a disappointment and a failure despite everyone telling me otherwise. I hate myself, my flaws, and I feel like a dumbass. Maybe I'll feel better, but probably not. I just want to lay down and die. I want to die alone so no one will remember me. So far I feel like I'm on a roller-coaster cresting on its final drop. I don't deserve all the love I get and reject because of my sad and depressed ass. So as I end my year worse than ever, I hope you guys don't end up in the grave soon like me.
