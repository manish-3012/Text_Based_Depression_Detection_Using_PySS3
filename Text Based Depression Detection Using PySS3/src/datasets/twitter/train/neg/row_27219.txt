i am on a bus to san francisco. tomorrow, i jumpi'm sorry i couldn't handle the pain. this is to my parents in case they don't find the note (under my hamper in the closet). i am too sensitive for a world this cruel. i'm sorry i am unable to make you proud and unable to be accepted and happy. my entire adolescence was lonely and painful and i don't want to stay here for just more of the same.

/the bus gets in tomorrow and my plan is to jump off the bridge. at this point i know no one will convince me to change my mind. i might reply but will be in and out of service. i'm incredibly scared but even more scared to suffer longer here

edit: i am still here. i came very close but got scared because i guess i'm too much of a wimp. i wish i was more brave. believing you want to end it is one thing, but overriding survival instinct is another. as much as i wanted to i couldn't, though i came very, very close. to everyone who was kind to me, thank you. i'm not sure what's going to happen to me as i'm still very lonely and suffering.
