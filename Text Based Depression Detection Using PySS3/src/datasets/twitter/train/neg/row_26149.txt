Been clinically depressed for over half my life now.I've tried pretty much every prescription drug for clinical depression, bipolar syndromen... you name it. In all sorts of weird cocktail doses. I would just like to go peacefully listening to some good tracks. I know hanging isnt going to be comfortable but can someone please give me some tips, I find so much contrasting info on the web. Please go pm before this gets deleted. Thank you and wish you all a wonderful life. 3&gt;
