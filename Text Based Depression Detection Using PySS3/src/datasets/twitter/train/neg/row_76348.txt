Its going to end sometime, why not now?Im at what I feel is the end of the line. Since I was very young, I have been subjected to bullying and I was molested from age 9-11 which I think both may have caused me to have mental problems.  Now diagnosed with Aspergers (fml), I have a tendency to be extremely quiet in any social situation (including family events) and I can barely keep a friend.  I do not leave my apt unless its for work or for food.  Not by choice, but because my phone literally never rings.  I havent gotten a phone call from someone other than my mom in I dont know how long.  Over two months at least.  I havent been in a relationship in over 8 years and Im starting to doubt if I ever will be again.  I make decent money but I dont consider myself attractive, I have bad hygiene, I have 0 personality, Im rarely funny, I have no social life and Im not a college grad.  I dont foresee any of this changing and I dont see the point in continuing this any longer.  I feel like I am a drag on everyone I know and I would do the world better by leaving it.  The only person I could see this affecting is my mother and that is what concerns me the most.  But after I die, it will only be a matter of time before the memory of me fades.  So why should I want to continue living alone and in emotional pain daily?  I dont see the point of living in pain if it could be ended so easily.
