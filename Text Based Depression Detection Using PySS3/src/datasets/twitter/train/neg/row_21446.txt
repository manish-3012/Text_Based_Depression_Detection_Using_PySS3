What's it like being committed?I have an appointment with my councelor, and I'm thinking of asking for help. Like being committed to a place, maybe for a while. I'm destroying my life rn, and idk how to stop. I'm in so much pain I dont see the point in stopping. If I go to a place, will I be ok? Or will it be the same as just being home.
