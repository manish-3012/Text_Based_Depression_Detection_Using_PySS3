Need advice on getting through to a friendI have a very close friend who has been saying some very worrying things lately, on the order of â€œI know Iâ€™m going to kill myself, I just donâ€™t know when, I need to get my affairs in order...â€ etc.

Problem is, for a reason I canâ€™t determine, heâ€™s not saying any of these things to me, but to our mutual friends. Iâ€™ve been messaged excerpts of conversations from 3 of our friends, asking me to check on him, stuff like that. People are looking to me because Iâ€™m probably his oldest and closest friend, and therefore the most capable of helping him.

But, as I said, he hasnâ€™t confided in me, and Iâ€™m afraid of him figuring out that people have been talking. Next time he might keep it all to himself, which could be a disaster.

I love my friend, I would be absolutely devastated if he hurt himself. I would do anything for him. Please help!
