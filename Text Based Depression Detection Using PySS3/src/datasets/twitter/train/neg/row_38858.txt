I have a note.It's all been crashing down for months.  I never really knew happiness before, until about last June.  In late October, it all began to end.  I have never known how bad I could feel until the beginning of this year.  I know that if my dearest friend saw this, she would blame herself for that.  In the near zero percent chance you are reading this, you didn't do this to me.

But it is happening.  I really am this far gone.  All of my friends absolutely hate me.  I can't keep myself under control for a solid 24 hours in front of them.  I just want it to end.  I wrote a note a few minutes ago.  I can't drift away, tonight.  I love all of you so much.  I always did.  You had such an amazing impact on me.  I hate what the world does to people.

I don't have a set day, yet.  But I know of something coming soon that could let me go.  It would be a hard day, to end my life during a funeral, but I cannot do this.  I will never be loved like everyone tells me I will.  Like I so strongly desire.  My heart isn't worth fixing.  Please, let me go.
