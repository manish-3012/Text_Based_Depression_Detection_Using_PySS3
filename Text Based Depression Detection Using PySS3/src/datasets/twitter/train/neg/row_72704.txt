Suicidal thoughtsim ruminating. My OCD is eating me alive and my depression is spitting me back out and eating me again. Just when I think freedom is around the corner I get knocked down again. I really just wanna take a bunch of pills or put a pocket knife through my neck. I'm open to talking if anyone is up or even cares.
