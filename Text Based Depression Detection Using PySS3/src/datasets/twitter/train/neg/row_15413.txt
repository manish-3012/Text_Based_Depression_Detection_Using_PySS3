My life is fucking perfect. Why am I unhappy?This is a throwaway I'll probably never check again. So, my life is fucking amazing. I live with 2 parents and one sister, we don't struggle with money, I don't struggle (that much) with school. I've got plenty of friends, I'm happy with my religion, I'm not shy, I believe I'm actually a good person. I'm involved at my church, I'm involved at my school, I'm active in my goddamn community for god's sake. I play a lot of games, I'm in shape, and I don't even have a bad relationship with my parents. I'm fine for months, and suddenly out of nowhere i just suddenly dont feel happy anymore. i feel like i just lose all ability to feel happy. Usually it happens at normal times (when I start to struggle at school, when i hae a bad argument with my parents, etc.) but now it just seems to happen at random. I'll be happy and laughing with friends and life fuckin punches me in the gut. When the episodes hit I criticize each and every detail of myself, how cant even find the motivation to take a shower, that each and every person i talk to and interact with will wake up one dy and realize how horrible i am. I struggle with porn, how i want to stop but i know i wont. on the plus side i stopped worrying about my future because i know ill just end up being that homeless dude begging for cash, because ill never make it iin my career. I cant ever seem to find interest in anything besides playing videogames, and i dont think anyone would ever want to love a piece of shit like me. why do i say these things to myself? i dont want to feel sad and alone. so why do i always fall into the same routine over and over and over and over. i feel depressed, i get better, i get better, i finally start to feel hope, and it all crashes immediately. help
