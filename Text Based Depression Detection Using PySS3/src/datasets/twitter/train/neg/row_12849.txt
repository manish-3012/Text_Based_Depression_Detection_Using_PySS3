Iâ€™m getting nowhere in life so why keep trying.Iâ€™m 18 years old, I have depression, anxiety, and ADHD.  In the last year, if that, Iâ€™ve had 3 jobs and Iâ€™ve quit them all. Today I quit my 3rd job, and Iâ€™m starting to finally realize that Iâ€™m useless. Iâ€™m useless at everything that I try to do. I canâ€™t hold a job because I give up way to easily or I make one tiny mistake and quit. Iâ€™ll never be able to hold a job and make ends meet, so why try. Why even live anymore if I know I wonâ€™t amount to anything. Please just give me some kind of reason or motivation to go on because I canâ€™t see it.
