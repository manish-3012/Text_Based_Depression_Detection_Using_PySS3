I can't be loved because I don't love myself. I need love to survive. So I have to die.And before you say anything about "self-improvement," please recognise that I want to be loved for who I am right now, so that if I relapse I won't have to fear that the person I love will abandon me. Plus, I can't love myself because no one has ever loved me, so I don't even know that I deserve anything besides the hate I have gotten all my life. So I need to die.
