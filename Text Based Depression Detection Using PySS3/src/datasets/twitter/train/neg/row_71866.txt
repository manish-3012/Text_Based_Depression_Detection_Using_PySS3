Not enoughI'm never enough, and I'm always reminded of that whenever I hang out with our old friends. You don't love me the way that I love you, whatever I had to give was never enough for you. I was never enough. Now you can't stand me unless it's for sex. What did I do? I can't do this anymore. Two more days maybe. I hope I get out but at the same time I don't want to leave the darkness. It's the only one who seems to love me enough to stay.
