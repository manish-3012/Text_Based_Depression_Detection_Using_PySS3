Please be mindfulWhen someone is depressed you shouldnâ€™t try to â€œfix themâ€ you canâ€™t love someoneâ€™s depression away but you can love someone through depression when someone all of a sudden is really happy and maybe starts giving out gifts or just dismisses depression entirely, ask them whatâ€™s up because most of the time they arenâ€™t happy, theyâ€™re at peace with the decision theyâ€™ve made to kill themselves and finalized their decision, I donâ€™t think I have any real friends, they arenâ€™t phased when Iâ€™m noticeably sadder than normal and they just donâ€™t really care if Iâ€™m there or not in general but Iâ€™m friends with them because they put up with me at least, the second someone finds out about my mental health issues thatâ€™s all they know me as, the kid who wants to kill himself Iâ€™m doing shit in school too Iâ€™m a junior and this is my do or die year this decides if I graduate or not but I canâ€™t find motivation for anything I have an assignment due tomorrow but I just canâ€™t bring myself to do it, anyways if youâ€™re in this sub I assume youâ€™re a nicer person than most but still id like to say a simple compliment to someone can go a long way
