I went to a church asking for a miracle. Did the 7 day wait in between wanting to kill myself and actually doing it. Got COVIDOkay god i get the message.

Only thing stopping me is that u don't have a will yet and i don't really want my abusive ass family to inherit anything of mine.

Now i gotta wait to get better to visit a fucking notary without giving them covid19.

Fucking hell man. Can't i just die
