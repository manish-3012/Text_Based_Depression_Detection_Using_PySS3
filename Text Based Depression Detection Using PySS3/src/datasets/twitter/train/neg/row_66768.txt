a chance for a nameless bodyI've been on this sub for a while
I tried reading other people's stories and help them out.
I've written many texts that were meant to be posted but never did.
Telling my own stories felt meaningless, knowing it won't do any good or bad.
I was never a good listener.

For the past three years I've been contemplating this.
I found notes that were written years ago about his very decision.
I found myself standing on top of a bridge, hanging a rope, covered in bags, and walking around among strangers just to feel something.

In two weeks I have a chance to travel far away from where I am.
to a place where no one knows my name.
I'll have to make a decision if I want to come back form there or stay there forever.

maybe I'll see something over there and start a new life?
or maybe I'll end it all 

I have about a week left to decide.
