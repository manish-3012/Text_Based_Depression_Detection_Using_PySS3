How do you actually seek help?   This is going to be LONG. I really apologize for that...and mobile formatting. 

This is very embarrassing for me, but I know I have been mentally ill for a very long time now. Iâ€™m 25(f)

   Also, Iâ€™m about to be very honest because I feel I have nothing to lose! I really donâ€™t want to upset or burden anyone with my problems.
   
   Iâ€™ve been especially suicidal this past month and I feel as if Iâ€™m slowly going deeper into this...empty void. I canâ€™t even collect thoughts properly. Itâ€™s taking me forever to even type this. I feel very slow physically and intellectually.  As a result Iâ€™ve been calling out of work a lot, which is also adding to the shame. 

   Even worse, I work with my dad. I donâ€™t want to give away too many details but weâ€™re waiters, pretty much. My dad is one of those parents who mean well, but is a â€œpull up your bootstrapsâ€ kinda guy. Seeking help from him in the past has pretty much been a slap to the face. He once told me, â€œWell, if itâ€™s really so bad you could always kill yourselfâ€. 

   Oh man. That rings in my head every day. 

   So Iâ€™ve been very serious about finally working up the courage to end it. Iâ€™ve fantasized about it since I was like 14. Iâ€™m pretty well educated by now from years of google searching. Either the exit bag technique or short drop hanging.

    Long story short, I found out about the helium shortage, and needing 98-99% purity, blah blah blah. So, I was even more frustrated and upset that my options were narrowing; I just slung a belt and a robe tie over a door, attached it to the handle, and put as much pressure on my carotid artery as I could. 

   It totally was working, but as things became a bit fuzzy and numb I had this sudden thought of my boyfriend coming home. The image that flashed through my head of him in anguish over what Iâ€™d done roused me like an electric shock. Holy shit, I panicked. The haphazard noose I made was very effective at tightening and being difficult to undo. I was barely able to slip a finger in and get out.

   It left me pretty shaken, honestly. Iâ€™d almost done it. If Iâ€™d taken the time to tie my hands Iâ€™d be dead. It was literally the love I have for the guy is what saved me. Heâ€™s is in a really poor place mentally too and I didnâ€™t want to abandon him.

   I sort of decided that I need to try one last time to really truly seek help; try meds if I have to. I wanna try for him. 

   Now Iâ€™m at a complete impasse. I have insurance but it only covers ONE facility. It has TERRIBLE ratings and reviews and when I called, the lady was very cold and told me she could fit me in, in 4 months. WTF I canâ€™t wait 4 months. Iâ€™ve had a complete breakdown and I canâ€™t even go to work because of the unrelenting sobbing and headaches. 

  So I tried looking for something out of network but I have NO IDEA where to start. Crazy expensive too! I have an extreme fear of doctors in general too, so thereâ€™s an added layer of anxiety. 

   If I go to the hospital I will lose my job and will be left destitute and demoralized. I lose my insurance at 26 too so long-term treatments seem pointless. 

  What do I do? It seems impossible to get help and Iâ€™m getting discouraged that itâ€™s even possible to be fixed.


  

   Thank you to anyone who took the time to read. I have no friends because Iâ€™ve isolated myself very effectively and I donâ€™t have any family to turn to for help. I feel like a child that is confused, upset, and crying out for someoneâ€™s help.
