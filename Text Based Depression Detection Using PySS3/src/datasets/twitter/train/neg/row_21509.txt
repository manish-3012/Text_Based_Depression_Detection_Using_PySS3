So Sick of LifeI work a shit job that pays barely anything. Having to choose between having heat or food sucks. I noticed I have a hole in my pants today at work, and realized I need new clothes, which takes money I don't have. My heater doesn't work in my truck, and I paid $350 to have it fixed and it still doesn't work.  

I was always considered gifted in school, but I turned out to just be a huge pile of wasted potential. I have an associate's degree, but it means absolutely nothing. No one gives me any job opportunities or interviews when I apply. I've come to just accept that I'm meant to be poor and alone. No one in this world loves me or would notice if I was gone. I'm not exaggerating, I have no family and anyone that I try to form a relationship with just ghosts me. I don't know what it is about me that no one likes, but all I know is from birth even my own mother didn't want me.  

I want a normal life so bad. A job that pays enough that I could afford to eat healthy food, not worry about basic bills like electric and water, a wife that would love me for who I am, and eventually kids. I'm losing all motivation to continue trying at this point. After so many job applications leading to nothing, so many people pretending to care and then fucking me over in some way, I'm just done. Thinking back to how hopeful I used to be that things would get better makes me sad, because I'm exhausted and have no hope left in me. I'm not suicidal, but I sure as hell don't enjoy living.
