Last chance i guess....So i have no idea why im posting here again. Iv lost all hope of a future at this point due to anything iv ever wanted or to do being destroyed. The last i ever could ask for was a sexy nerdy girlfriend as bug of a nerd as me if not more(aka usually a cosplayer with a following) however i just never achieved my job, my friends have moved on, parents donâ€™t understand me, and i live the shittiest part of america which is jo Davis county. Small towns. Since it seems i cant even get ghe girl of my dreams. I plan to buy the gun and be done with it? Any advice or last words i guess before i do something ill regret...?
