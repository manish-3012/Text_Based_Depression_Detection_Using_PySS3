Canâ€™t do anything rightEverything I tell my parents it shoved right through my back and Iâ€™m forced to choke on regret. I try and try but I always make everyone mad. I havenâ€™t left or talked to my parents in roughly 3 days except to leave the house to apply to some jobs. Saw my dad earlier and said something and he said â€œyou shouldnâ€™t listen to yourself, this is why no one-â€œ and I walked away because I canâ€™t handle this. He follows me and keeps yelling and getting upset. Iâ€™ve been finding myself fantasizing about my death more and more. Itâ€™s one of the few things that relax me. Iâ€™ll probably post later Iâ€™m just so sick of myself rn.
