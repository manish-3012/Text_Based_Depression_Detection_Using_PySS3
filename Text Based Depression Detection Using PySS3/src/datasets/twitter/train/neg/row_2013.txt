Being a broken human...If you don't have any type of mental disorder, twitches,stutter, you'll never understand what it's like... I had to go to the lowest department in my company because i don't get along with any of these normal people... now i work on a side where every person has some sort of mental illness and i kind of feel at home.. like finally I'm not on the only weird one.. theres only 1 or 2 people on my side that seem normal but the rest of us have ticks,twitches,stutters,every mental illness you can imagine. It's nice because i feel less judged but its like how long can i do this for... I'm just unloading trailers at FedEx it's easy just a lot of manual labor..
