Whatâ€™s the point of waiting to die if Iâ€™m gonna die alone an old hag? 24 is too oldPlease donâ€™t downvote this to hell. But at age 24, I feel old and not good enough to even really be alive sometimes, let alone date. I had a rough start to life, with a really messed up childhood, and after trying really hard to get into college, I had to do the community college to real school thing from my parents house until I was 21. Iâ€™m so lost and miserable. I got my dream job at 22 and then lost it by 23. Spent all of 23 literally in therapy because of how suicidal I was. Now Iâ€™m not suicidal but Iâ€™m severely depressed. I donâ€™t sleep normally. I wake up at 6 am staring at the wall crying every day. I canâ€™t find another job. I missed out on having any friendships in life and donâ€™t have real friends. The superficial ones I DO have are all getting married now. Iâ€™ve never even dated someone, not even once. Iâ€™m a Virgin too. Iâ€™ve never even kissed anyone. I have truly nothing going for me. Iâ€™ve blown so many fucking opportunities at my dream job thatâ€™s dead now. Iâ€™m miserable. Iâ€™m so old at 24 Iâ€™d like to just die before Iâ€™m thirty cause Iâ€™m gonna be a huge fucking failure. I mean look at my track record, look at my life so far. How can you say things will turn around when theyâ€™ve NEVER done so, not even once, despite how hard I try?
