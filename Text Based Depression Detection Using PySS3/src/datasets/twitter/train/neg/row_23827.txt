.I've been planning my suicide since I was 3. Mt mom has always been a shit. My dad? Left when I was born. Friends? All either cured of their suicide by me or non-existent. I've cured so many of my friend's depression and it just made mine worse. My gf wants me to vent to her but I'm scared that she'll try to do something about my shitty life or try to save me. My mom threatens me, blames me for everything wrong in her life, says the house isn't clean WHEN A PERSON WITH OCD SAYS IT'S FUCKING CLEAN, ect. and I just want to fucking die because of her and my father, or lack thereof.

What's the easiest way to kill myself??
