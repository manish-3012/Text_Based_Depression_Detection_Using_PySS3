Anything for attentionIâ€™m a young guy thatâ€™s in high school who looks average Iâ€™m guess. 

For most of my life Iâ€™ve been a weird kid that always begged for attention. I didnâ€™t have any friends and people who I talked to at school werenâ€™t really my friends but more associates. I never hung out with anyone after school and spent my summers by myself. My parents never gave me any attention as a child (obviously) and they still donâ€™t. For most of that time Iâ€™ve always been happy, or maybe I wasnâ€™t I donâ€™t exactly remember. All my life I would get in trouble of doing dumb stuff, I would get suspended for making racist jokes, distracting the class, or people would accuse me of doing something when I didnâ€™t do it. 

(I would skip over this part, itâ€™s mostly a rant about my parents) My parents cared what I did, but Iâ€™m a way that they wonâ€™t get in trouble. Like they wouldnâ€™t let me go to parties (I know this contradicts my point, but Iâ€™ll explain later) they wouldnâ€™t get me anything for Christmas, they would punish me by taking my stuff away, or make me sit outside. And when I ask when I can get something back or go inside they would say â€œIâ€™ll think about itâ€ and would never tell me how long or give me a time If that makes sense. If I wanted to go somewhere and asked them while they were watching their show, they would yell at me to go away. I would say their abusive, but Iâ€™m sure some part of them cared a very little bit. 

My last year of middle schools rolls around, I get some popular friends, Iâ€™m still really weird at this point but I start learning from them on how to be normal. Iâ€™m still very attention seeking and  I still have problems controlling it to this day.

By this point, Iâ€™m starting to realize how much my life sucks. A lot of people still donâ€™t like me but these friends start defending me and it means a lot to me. My friends have girlfriends and theyâ€™re going out and smoking weed and skinny dipping and while Iâ€™m in my room, browsing YouTube and being jealous of what theyâ€™re doing. 

A few years go by and I loose all those friends because I fucked up bad and thereâ€™s no way of fixing it. Those people hate me and I donâ€™t have anyone left. Iâ€™ll stay in my room watching these people hanging out and doing fun stuff on their Snapchatâ€™s stories. Seeing people go to the beach on my instagram and while Iâ€™m in my room, doing nothing.

My grades are really bad, I donâ€™t have any friends, my parents are kicking me out of the house as soon as I turn 18. I canâ€™t control my attention seeking personality. And Iâ€™m super fucking retarded (by which you can tell by the spelling errors and stuff not making sense on this post) and I have no future.

I got a taste of what having friends feels like and that being stripped away from me feels horrible.  I have no future and I might as well end my life now and spare my pain that I would deal with in the future. And maybe get a lot of attention from my school that I killed my self, or maybe no one will care. Because Iâ€™ll do anything for attention.

If you have any questions or youâ€™re really confused (which you probably are) please ask and Iâ€™ll try my best to answer them.
