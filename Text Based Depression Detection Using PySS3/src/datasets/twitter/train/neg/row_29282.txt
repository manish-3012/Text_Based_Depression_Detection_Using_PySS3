I honestly don't know what "an interesting title" would be. So I'm just gonna go with this. Seems pretty interesting to me tho.I just don't know where to begin. I mean. My version of "the beginning" is most likely different than every one else's. But this is me over thinking. Yet again. Maybe this wasn't even a good idea. It seems like none of my decisions have been good lately. But here I am. 

My beginning begins about 20 years ago. 
My middle begins about 10 years ago. 
My end? I honestly have never really thought about it until now. But yeah. I honestly don't know what else to say now. So I'll just leave this here.
