I got even closer today.It seems I'm going to have to do this in steps, because the nerves always get to me. Last time I almost went into the garage to grab a rope. Today I went into the garage for a rope, but there was none. So I went to a store that sold rope. I stood there at the shelf looking at ropes for maybe five minutes. Couldn't do it today. I left the store without rope.

I'm guessing that sometime in the near future I'll actually buy the rope. I know where to get it and which one to get. I don't know how to tie a noose, I'll have to look it up. Then I'll go into the woods and find a sturdy branch to hang the rope from. I'm most likely going to walk away that day. I'll bring the rope with me so no one will take it. Then I'll go back to the same tree and try again. I'll try as many times at it takes until I swing from that rope. I've made my decision. I do not wish to continue any longer. I don't feel bad for anyone except my cats. I probably shouldn't, they'll forget quickly. Parents and relatives are gonna have a harder time, I admit that. Can't do much about that. Friends? Have none. No problems there. This turned into a ramble, sorry, just had to get it out.
