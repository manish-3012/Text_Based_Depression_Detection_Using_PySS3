There is nothing left for me but death1. I have been alive for 21 years. I do not want to live any longer. I do not want to see 22.
2. I will always be alone. I will always be unhappy. Things do not get better. This is true. I am lying to myself if I say it is not true. I have had time. I have paid attention. This is what I've learned.
3. It is worth remembering that some people are beyond help. This is inarguable.
4. I hate my body and I hate my mind. I hate my past, I hate the present, and I dread the future. There is nothing for me here.
5. I am on the outside of everything.
6. I don't believe in anything but death. I can not clearly conceptualize anything but death. I am doubtful of everything but death. Death is my faith.
7. I am repulsed by everything I experience. The only thing I am driven towards is death. Death is my dream.
8. When I was 6, I wanted to be a police officer. When I was 16, I wanted to be a drummer. The only clear dream I have had since then is to die.
9. I have never held a girl's hand.
10. I scored 36 on the ACT. I started college when I was 16. I graduated with a 3.9 GPA. These three facts are my only sources of pride and confidence, and they are nothing but numbers.
11. My life has been nothing but numbers. Some people have memories, stories, and experiences. I do not.
12. I can not cook. I can not sing. I can not draw. I can not dance.
13. I feel best when I am drunk. I feel good when I am high. Sometimes reading makes me happy, but this is rare.
14. I remember my brother showing me porn when I was a kid. He molested me several times. I have never told anyone this.
15. I remember a time when suicide was alien to me. I thought, "There's no reason to kill yourself. Then there's no chance things will improve. Once you die, it's over."
16. Now, suicide is with me, and it will not leave. Everything else is alien now.
17. There is one reason I have not killed myself already, in previous moments of weakness, and it is the knowledge of what it would do to my parents. It would destroy them. I am their greatest love in life.
18. But that alone is no reason to live. It is unfortunate. It is nothing but unfortunate.
19. Suicide is painless.
