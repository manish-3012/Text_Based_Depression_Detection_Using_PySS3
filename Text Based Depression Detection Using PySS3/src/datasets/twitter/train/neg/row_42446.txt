Lost my SO and now I realized I'm a horrible teacher.In a strange way, I dont feel sad or scared anymore. I accept that I lost in life- $36K in debt, Spouse cheated/left and now my class scores went down significantly than last year (I dont even blame covid). I am also having more and more behavioral issues as the year goes. My classroom management is downhill and I just... give up. 
 
It seems like all my hard work was for nothing. I'm deeply unhappy and I dont think I want to try anymore.
