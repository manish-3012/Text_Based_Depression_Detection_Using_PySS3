I feel horribleThis post is some what related to the last post I made. My mom called me like at around 10:40 this morning asking me to send me a copy of my grades to her. She wanted a copy of my grades to because she wanted to send them to the car insurance company for a discount if I had a good grades.


My grades last semester were horrible. I got C's and D's and I failed a class. This morning was the first time actually checking them. I figured that I did okay in all my classes. My mom called me after I sent her my grades and she was so upset. She was more upset that I didn't tell her my grades than the fact I failed a class. She started going about how I can't be trusted and that I was a disgrace. I am also studying for my final exams right now. I can't fail any of my finals because then I might fail the class which in turn will lower my GPA. Last semester was so much more difficult than my first semester in college. 


My mom just called me again yelling about how I am such a horrible person and that I can't be trusted. She was saying that she wish she never had me and stuff like that. She was just extremely angry and upset. I know I deserve it because I should have told her my grades.  I finish my final exams on Wednesday and I'm dreading the car ride home because I know she will be yelling at me. I just feel horrible and I want to die. My roommate is at work right now so I could do it now. I just feel really overwhelmed right now.
