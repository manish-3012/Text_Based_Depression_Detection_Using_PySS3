They stopped me yet they hate me.I posted gonna kill myself in 2 houres yesterday, Got pinned down by a passing person when i tried to jump a train, mother now says that i am too weak for this world and hates me, people say iâ€™m crazy so they dont wanna talk to me, my bf (iâ€™m bi, the suicide line said thats a sin and i dont deserve to live. I aint even religious) is the only one who wants to support me but i feel like iâ€™m like stopping him from progressing in his live, my only happiness used to be to play music but thats fading as well, i am in constant physical pain but mother says its something that will pass if we wait, i could go on for hours talking about whats wrong with life and i might be another just another guy dead (clichÃ© and sayibg cliche also a cliche and that probably as well) it feel like people want me to live to suffer
