Does anyone else hide things from their SO?Lately I've been talking less and less to my SO. I've had my waves and I'm getting pretty low lately... And even though my SO has repeatedly told me to tell him when I get bad.. I still keep quiet. I don't want to burden him or make him feel like he should do more. I feel like I'm always the one taking his time, like I never listen to him. I feel like I'm always telling him my problems. And lately I've been wondering if simply breaking up with him would be best. Let him date someone who doesn't have these thoughts..
