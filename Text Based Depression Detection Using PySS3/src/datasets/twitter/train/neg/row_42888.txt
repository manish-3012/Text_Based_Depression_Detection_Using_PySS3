I should be deadI feel like i should be dead right now. Ever since i was in middle school i knew i was going to die by suicide and I knew i wouldn't live to 18. I'm getting closer and closer to that age now and each breath I take feels wrong, i should've done it in 9th grade but i was too scared. I need to do it before 18 there's no other option for me.
