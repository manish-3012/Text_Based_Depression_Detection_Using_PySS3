Everything is going to go downhill from here.I'm in high school, which everyone says is the best time of my life.

If this is the happiest I'm going to be, the most fulfilled and safe and positive I'm going to feel, what's the point of continuing? I'm already low as fuck and using coping methods that aren't good for me - what will happen when I start getting worse and have access to worse shit?

I don't want to do this, i don't want any of this, i just want to stop
