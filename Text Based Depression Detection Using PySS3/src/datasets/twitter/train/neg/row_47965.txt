I Really Just Want It to EndDon't know what to do at this point.

I've been kicked out of my house, crashing at my friend's place for a while now. I'm a 90 student, turning my life around from getting 50s. I also lost 25 lbs and found a passion for bodybuilding. But seeing how I got kicked out, despite my turnaround, I just feel like life isn't worth living anymore.

I don't even know what I want to do at this point anymore. I feel like putting an end to this game is the easiest thing to do at this point.

I don't feel like I'm learning anything in school. I found my passion for fitness/bodybuilding, but I don't have the means to get a trainer/mentor to take my passion to the next level. Nothing feels real.

And I just can't ask for help. I'm fully functional, but whenever something tough comes my way, I feel like I use my "depression" as an excuse. I don't even know if I have depression, or if it's some kind of personality disorder. I know there are times when I feel like shit, but when my problems are lifted, I'm as happy as a person can be.

I feel like realistically, it would be best if I wasn't here anymore. I don't offer value to anyone.

The thing that sucks when you feel like this, no one can really help you. I feel like I can never articulate what my heart says, and I'm always "acting" on my sadness. Telling people you know about it is the worst thing you can do, as it just becomes a burden on them. I feel like the people I know would obviously say, on the surface, they wouldn't want me to die, but deep down, they're thinking just stop talking. I know they're busy as it is.

I apologize my writing style is extremely disorganized. My mind is extremely foggy right now and I'm just extremely frustrated.
