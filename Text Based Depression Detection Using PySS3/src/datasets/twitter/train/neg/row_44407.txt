I feel incredible depressed right now.I feel incredible depressed right now.

The emotional pain is so heavy right now, I want it to end.

 don't know how long I can go on like this.

To be honoust, I am really anxious before my birthday that is coming up in a few months.

I really don't want to be 28. I really hope to end it soon. 

To stop it for once and for all. That this year will be the last.

To not wake up anymore, I am done with it.
