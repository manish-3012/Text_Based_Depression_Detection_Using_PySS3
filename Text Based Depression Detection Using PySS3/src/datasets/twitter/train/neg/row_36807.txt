please help me.im struggling with this idea lately. would it really be 'bad' if i killed myself? I know that I ought to not do it because thats what all the anti-suicide propaganda says. But i have a hard time believing in it faithfully. 

If i were to die, i would miss out on things in life, but at the same time i would be dead and wouldn't be able to feel regret or be able to comprehend that i am missing things. So from my perspective it really would be the end. The world would go on turning without me. 

My family would be disappointed, but i know that i already disappoint them. It would be better for them to have to grieve once instead of putting up with constant disappointment and worry over me. I feel sad. 

The things I want in life, like a loving relationship, a career that i am skilled and feel accomplished in, a beautiful home where i'd feel safe and secure. I don't think I can ever achieve these things. i am stuck in my life. unable to accomplish anything. Im treading water, but getting further and further from the shore. i don't think i can ever get my life back on track. so whats the point in trying anymore? If i stop trying at least it will be my choice instead of having to face my failures yet again. 

I would give anything to have someone to cuddle with right now. I am crushingly lonely.
