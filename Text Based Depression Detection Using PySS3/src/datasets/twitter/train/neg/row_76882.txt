The ambulance didnâ€™t want to comeSo this weekend I was having a party and got really drunk and I tried to cut my wrist really deep, and a friend of mine walked into the room and called an ambulance because I was really suicidal and was bleeding alot. But they didnâ€™t want to come get us because this has happened one time earlier and they told her to just leave. Iâ€™m glad they didnâ€™t come, but I still think itâ€™s a bit weird
