I donâ€™t see the pointIâ€™m 32 years old. On paper Iâ€™m a well adjusted, smart, attractive girl. I work a well paying high stress job for a bunch of narcissists, every day I have to go in I cry. Iâ€™m scared of all of my bosses, to the point of panic attacks daily. I have bills to pay and I canâ€™t quit. Iâ€™ve got no support system financially.

I tried to kill myself on Sunday after a conversation with my addict parents, it didnâ€™t work. Now Iâ€™m on suicide watch at home with constant supervision and checkins from my therapist. 

I just donâ€™t care anymore, I didnâ€™t sign up to pay bills and die. Living was some kind of contract I was forced to sign, and I donâ€™t want any part of it. 

I donâ€™t know joy, I donâ€™t remember joy. I just want to be done.
