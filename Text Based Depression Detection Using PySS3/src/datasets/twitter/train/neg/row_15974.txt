I'm in so much painI remember getting out of school in 4th or 5th grade and walking up to my mom and telling her I felt sad even though nothing had happened that should have made me feel that way. Now close to a decade later I haven't felt happiness for more than an hour or two at a time since then and it's just too much. I've spent the majority of my life in constant emotional pain and I don't care if it might end at some point I know one way I can end it as soon as I want and that option looks more and more appealing with each passing day.
