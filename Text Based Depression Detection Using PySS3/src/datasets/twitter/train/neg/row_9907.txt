Dear Redditors 

I know that u tried the best but I couldnâ€™t do it so I will commit suicide . 
Thanks for the company and the familiar feeling u gave me in my last days it was a undescribable feeling.
But u donâ€™t have any fault in my death.
Iâ€™ve left instructions to my closest friend to contact a few people and then post this note one 22.10.2020 on Reddit in r/suicideWatch if my death was confirmed on Monday the 19.10

Pls forgive me 

Condolences are permitted
