Hmm, what should I do...I made a bit of progress toward my goald but nonetheless, I still know I have no more than 10 weeks of unemployment insurance left. So, it brings me lots of anxiety and stress. Last week, I began looking for job in an area I know I have a passion, after I received advice from a counselor but I still have that deadline in August and I'm really afraid. So far, I received one answer, I made a call on Friday and he told me he will soon need another employee, this summer. It would be a nice job as nightwatchman in a place housing people with mental health problem, but the trouble is I can't rely only on supposition. I need a clear answer soon. I don't really know how I would get back to work at a place, like in a restaurant, I know I won't have any other choices if I don't get that job as a nightwachman, but still I don't know how much time I'll be able to handle the pressure from it. I mean, I worked for years doing something I didn't really like and not doing anything interesting in the week end, but it can't imagine doing it again for months even years after years of boredom. Ughh, this is kind of a decisive moment, I should maybe call the doctor right away to find wether if I could get any other help related to my condition or anything before moving any further.
