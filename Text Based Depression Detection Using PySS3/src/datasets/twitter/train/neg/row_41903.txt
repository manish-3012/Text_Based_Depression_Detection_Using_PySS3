One good thing happens to me in a long time and it ends up being the thing to push me over.Context: 18 year old male, ex girlfriend's parents hate me to the point they would call the police for "harassment" if they even knew I was talking to her.    
    
So I was at the end of my rope. as my last act of calling out I sent my ex girlfriend a message, not expecting her to reply. She did and we started talking. We met up in a secret place (because we aren't allowed to be seen with one another or her parents would kill me) and just start to talk about how I've been feeling.    
    
    
Eventually things became intimate, and we ended up having sex. It was a mutual thing. I pulled out because it felt different and it turns out the condom broke. I know I didn't cum but it was still scary, but she's on birth control (patch) so we didn't think anything of it. She took the patch off on wednesday, it's now sunday and she still hasn't had her period.    
    
    
She could possibly be pregnant, which would ruin my life for multiple reasons, which is why I am done. She hates me now because I asked her to take a pregnancy test and she over reacted, etc etc. She never wants to speak to me again and may be pregnant with a child that is part mine.    
    
    
This sounded so stupid even typing this up. I'm sorry for wasting anyone's time.
