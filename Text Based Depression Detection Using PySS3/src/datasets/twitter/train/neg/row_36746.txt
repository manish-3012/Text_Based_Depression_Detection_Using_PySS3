No more writing these.Iâ€™ve really fucked up. 

Im in about Â£28k in debt and been stealing from my mother to survive. 
My mother has always been right about me. All Iâ€™ve done is hurt, lie, cheat and manipulate to get what I want. To get that next hit of anything to make the days bearable. 
Iâ€™ve failed as a human being in every possible metric at the age of 26. Iâ€™ve always blamed my heritage, stutter and learning difficulties on all my short comings but now I see the short coming was always me. 
I canâ€™t keep living with the shame and guilt any longer. All Iâ€™ve done is hurt and lie. I donâ€™t want to anymore. 

Mum was always right when she said I should kill myself of the shame Iâ€™ve bring. The shame to all her hard work, to know that her only child was me. A constant fuck up. I used to believe I could be more but now I realise all I was doing is lie. Like I always do. 

Iâ€™m sorry I was what you ended up with. You always deserved so much better than me. 

To my friends and loved one I thank you for all you ever did for me. You made the days a little bit brighter, not that I ever deserved it. 

To my mum Iâ€™m sorry. Iâ€™m so sorry. But after 10 years of saying that. I donâ€™t think it has much meaning to you anymore. I donâ€™t blame you and never will. 

Just know that you donâ€™t have to have me burden you anymore. I take comfort in that thought right now.
