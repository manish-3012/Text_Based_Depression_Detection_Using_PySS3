Being so accustomed to the idea of suicide for so many years have made the idea of it neutral to me.I've had this feeling for a really long time, since my earliest memory.  
Tried to jump in front of a car. The car managed to stop in time.  
It was probably just a child's curiosity and unrelated to my feeling of dread but it was an attempt whether I knew it at the time or not.  
  
I've lived my whole life with the feeling of ending it all, even attempting it twice throughout my life and now the idea of it is almost casual to me.  
  
If someone were to tell me that they've been feeling suicidal, I wouldn't react with shock, empathy or care. Its not much different if they told me they were happy or sad.  
  
I feel like I'm at the point of my life where I won't do it but I have been wrong before. The feeling is always there. Sometimes it feels like all it'll take is 1 bad day at the wrong time.  

That's all I wanted to say, really. That I've come to this revelation that the thought of suicide has become a casual part of my life as is laughter or anger. A dangerous casual part.
