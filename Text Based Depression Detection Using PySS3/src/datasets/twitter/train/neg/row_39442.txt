Suicidal, but not in a depressed way. I just kinda hate reality.Basically, as the title says. 

I'm 15 years old. From when I was 12-13, I dealt with depression, or something like it. Just about every day was cold and bitter soul-crushing sadness. Then I kinda... Got over it. Wasn't depressed anymore. Life got normal.

And nowadays, I find myself not really sad so much as empty. I can't bring myself to feel anything about reality. I don't dislike it, I don't like it, I don't hate it, it doesn't make me wanna cry or scream or anything. I just want to get away from it.

I'm finding it hard to put my feelings into words. I'm looking at my paths of life from here, and I don't find myself excited. Education, working, growing up, starting a family, travelling the world, becoming rich and famous, doing drugs, all that sorta shit everyone does. I don't wanna do it. Nothing about it excites me.

I mean, I don't wanna kill myself. I don't want my family and friends and shit to have to deal with that pain. I'm not a sadist or anything. 

But I still wanna die somehow. Maybe just in a freak accident. Or doing something noble like saving kids from a burning building or some shit idk. That'd probably be a little easier for everyone. I guess that makes me selfish, but whatever.

I do sort of hope for an Afterlife, I suppose. I'd like to think there's something more than this world I don't enjoy. But even if there is nothing, then, well... I won't care, cause I'll be nothing. 

Man, it's fucking 4 AM, I can't write when I'm this tired.
