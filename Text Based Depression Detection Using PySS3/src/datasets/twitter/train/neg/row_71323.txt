I don't know if I can last 900 days alone.(I'm not suicidal and I haven't been having suicidal thoughts, but I don't know where else to put this.)


Every moment of my life is spent thinking about how alone I am. I'd do anything to have someone to cuddle up with and just spend time with, but there's a few big obstacles in my way. I'm in high school, I have no social skills and am incredibly introverted, and I'm into BDSM. I can't be in a relationship with someone who isn't also kinky, but I'm not in much of a position to be picky. Even ignoring that, I still have no way to find a partner. 


I see a therapist every few weeks on my own dime during school to keep me from going crazy with loneliness, but the session+cab cost is getting to be too much to handle. It's damn good that I'm already taking Prozac for unrelated reasons, or else I can't imagine how depressed I'd be right now.


I won't be depressed in 900 days or so. I'm counting down the days until I'm 18, because I know that that's when I'll start to be happy again. When I'm 18 I can try meeting people on dating sites, I can go to BDSM munches (meetups), and I can fully explore my sexuality. But I don't know if I can last three years. At the very least, I know I can't last three years alone.
