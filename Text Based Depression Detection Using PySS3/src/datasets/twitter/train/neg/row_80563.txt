Reincarnation sounds amazing. The idea of a restart just by killing myself is too temptingI keep hearing stories that if you die and you get a restart. What I would give to restart my whole life knowing what's going to happen to me.

Even if it isn't true, death would better than my life now. I was bullied for 10 years where I was pushed around and called names and all the effort I put into my studies and club which resulted in average grades and a meaningless certificate. I lied to people that I had good grades before because it hurt admitting that there were nights I stayed up studying weeks before my major exams and it meant nothing.

I finally got out of that shit hole and I wasted my chances. People kept complimenting me and I got arrogant and my short temper got the best of me. My first friend I made in my new school was amazing. She was there whenever I felt down and there for me when people pushed me around. But she couldn't stand my attitude. Everyone kept warning me but only until I lost my friend did I realise what an asshole I am.

If I jump, the pain would end at worst and at best, I get another shot to make things right.
