I don't want to live anymore.Hello, first of all sorry for my English but I hope you will understand what I want to say. I don't even know where to start, first thing I want to say that for the past 5-6 years I had depressions and wanted to die (and I'm only 20 now and I'm suffering from clinical depression) and I don't even know why I want to post this here since I know there's no help for me anyway. I've been growing up in a poor family and since I was a child I was fat like all the time (it's a disease but I don't know it's name in English) I have really, really, really bad teeth and I'm an interovert with social anxiety and because of these things I was always bullied (like really badly, I got beat up almost every day) things started to get even worse when I failed 8th grade because I wasn't going to school since I was afraid of the bullies and the 2 friends I had started to hate me and insult me that I'm stupid because I failed and since then I've been studying from home so I don't have literally any friends, we are a poor family so I can't study IT because we can't afford a good computer and I tried to kill myself in 2012 after that I was hospitalized in psychiatric clinic (or whatever it's called in English) for 40 days and it didn't helped me at all. For the past 5 years I'm sitting at home every single day and I feel really empty, I can't even cry or laugh anymore all I can think of is death and I can't chnage my life because we don't have the fucking money so I cant eat healthy etc. (and believe me I tried to lose weight-no results) my mom makes about 380â‚¬ a month and we have to pay for everything + we have to buy food from that. The dentist said that the teeth would cost around 2500 Euros which is astronomical for me and I will never be able to afford it.. I wanted to study computer science and become a programmer but thats not going to happen :( also I have skin disease so I was bullied also because of that (they are like dark brown spots all over my body and it looks weird) and I AM REALLY FRUSTRATED because I have no friends, no girlfriend nothing to live for and to start my life all over again I would need like 5000â‚¬ and thats impossible for me to get and thats why I have a feeling like theres nothing I can do and all I want to do is die actually I'm thinking about killing myself right now... thank YOU for reading this meaningless post and have a nice day and I wish you all the best, hope you are going to have a good life (yes you, the good person reading this right now :) )
