My biggest regretIs not dying the first time I tried to kill myself. Or the second, or the third. 
Not only am I a failure in life, but also in death because I canâ€™t even kill myself. One of the times I called the cops too soon. 
I just didnâ€™t want a family member to have to find me like that. 

I am so so wrong for this world. I try so hard to get it right and to do right but instead Iâ€™m the anti-Midas and everything I touch turns to shit. 

I got a dog when I was coming out of the hole last time. Heâ€™s the best boy. But he has separation anxiety. I rescued another, as he usually is calmer in company. But no. Now I have two â€œproblemâ€ dogs that I love to the moon and back. Boyfriend thinks I should get rid of the rescue because she is aggressive when scared. 

I could never live with myself. I know they make my life busier, and more complicated. I know that itâ€™s not ideal. I know. I need to be working hard at my degree. I made a decision because I was so, so alone. I needed a reason to live. 

Giving these dogs up, will kill me. The guilt will. 

We went to therapy today. He called me a liar because I changed my mind about having children (to not wanting children. How can I subject them to me, and this world). And that having mental health issues doesnâ€™t excuse lying or being an asshole. 

And Iâ€™m so done. Iâ€™m done with being a piece of shit. Iâ€™m done with hurting people I love. I donâ€™t want any friends. Iâ€™m not interested in what life has to offer- Iâ€™m not impressed so far. I fail at everything I try and am a burden to everyone around me. 

I need some more time to get my affairs in order. To dump the boyfriend so he doesnâ€™t have to care. Finances, clean the apartment. 

Give my dogs a cheeseburger. Tell them Iâ€™m sorry for failing them.  

The world is hell, and everyone else was given a flameproof suit. And Iâ€™m naked. Everything hurts all the time and Iâ€™m angry because everything hurts and others just donâ€™t see it at all. 

Like he says â€œIâ€™m doing this for youâ€. 

They will be better off in the long run, without me holding them back.
