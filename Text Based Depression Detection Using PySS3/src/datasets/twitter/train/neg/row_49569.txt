A sure way to dieI'm ready to kill myself. For so long I wanted to do it. I just was not sure how I would do it. Now I have it. A belt around my neck and hang myself. I'm not afraid of dying. I am afraid of surviving an attempted suicide and being in a condition where I can't control body or being half brain dead or something. 

I almost did it last night. It's just hard taking the final step. Actually doing it. I don't want to survive my death. I want it to be a sure shot thing. I'm not posting this to have someone talk me out of it. I want the courage or push to just do it.
