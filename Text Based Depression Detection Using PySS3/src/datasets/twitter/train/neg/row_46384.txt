I don't have the strength for this anymore.Day 1

Iâ€™ve been feeling like this for what seems like a very long time. Almost every day, for the past year, I have contemplated about ending my own life. Iâ€™ve self-harmed. Somehow slitting my wrists open and watching the blood trickle out calmed me down. Iâ€™ve done everything I promised myself I wouldnâ€™t do each night before I went to sleep. Thereâ€™s something inherently wrong with that, wanting to kill myself, despite having everything that a kid of my age needs.


Around 7-8 months ago, I started slipping at college. I wouldnâ€™t attend for days at a stretch. Days turned to weeks. Weeks turned to months. I knew I wasnâ€™t in a good head space. Iâ€™d been hiding something from my parents for a while. They sent me for counselling, but I lied to that woman as well. I couldnâ€™t tell anyone. One night, however, my mother caught me crying myself to sleep and told me to be honest. She said she would support me no matter what it was. I told her about the time I was inappropriately touched by a grown man. That was almost two years ago, but ever since, I have been like this. I have felt depressed and wrong and disgusting. I always called my mother my best friend. There is literally nothing that I havenâ€™t shared with her. Everything that a sixteen year old girl in an Indian household remains silent about, I have been able to discuss freely with her. She is quite understanding, my mother. So much so that sheâ€™ll go to any lengths to defend me when I have an argument with my father. He still doesnâ€™t know. I doubt he would even understand.


Speaking of my fatherâ€¦ he has never hit me. He hurls abuses at me, but he has never physically hurt me. He reminds me every day that I am a failure. A wasted investment. Useless. Impure. Negative. Slacking. He reminds me that the best I can hope for in life is a job at a call centre where my boss will yell at me but Iâ€™ll suck it up because I am desperate for money. That Iâ€™ll have a husband who will berate me and Iâ€™ll be at his mercy. That I donâ€™t bring him any joy. That Iâ€™m not meant for anything good. That he regrets giving me the things he has. That I ruin everything I touch. That I am a complete, utter disappointment. And then, a few hours later, a few sweet words and the usual â€œI only want whatâ€™s best for youâ€. I know he does, but when the same person says those things to you every single dayâ€¦ you start to believe it. 


At first, his words pinched. I would cry and listen to him, too scared to explain why Iâ€™ve become the mess I am. Then I started screaming back, pretending I donâ€™t care. He calls me rude and shameless, but itâ€™s the only way I know how to block it out. I cry after he leaves the room.


All I can say to him is, if he ever finds this, Iâ€™m sorry. I know I am not what you expected. I promise I tried. 
	

I've thought about this for months. I know people have worse problems, and maybe I'm being selfish, but these are mine. I can't live like this. I don't have the strength anymore. I don't know why I'm writing this. I wanted to see if I could put my thoughts together.


Thereâ€™s a 3-day/1-week rule one must follow before committing suicide. This is day one. Weâ€™ll see what happens tomorrow.
