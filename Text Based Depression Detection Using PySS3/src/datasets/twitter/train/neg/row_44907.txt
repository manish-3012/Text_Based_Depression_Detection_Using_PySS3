Please help me. I don't think I can be a functioning adult.Did great in high school, some depression but never suicidal thoughts. Always thought that was kind of a stupid mindset. Well, high school ended and I couldn't cut it in college. Dropped out, twice, with a full ride. Couldn't live with a boyfriend, lost the job he got for me, now we're not together anymore and he basically ghosted me out of a long term and really intense and meaningful relationship. Won't answer me begging for him to talk to me now, which makes me feel like a loser. A lot of people ignore me. My family loves me and is trying to be there for me but I don't even know fi I want to get better. It just seems like so much work, and I hate not having a car to be able to drive myself around. I don't like school, I don't like working, no one seems to want to be around me. I just like getting high and drunk. I've gained tons of weight and lost tons of people. I'm not suited for being in the adult world. I hate waking up and disappointing everyone or bothering everyone like my ex. I cry too much. I hate it. Nothing makes me happy. Please, guys, what should I do? When does this pass?
