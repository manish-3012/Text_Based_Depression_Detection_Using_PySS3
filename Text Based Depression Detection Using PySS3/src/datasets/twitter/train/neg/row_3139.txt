venting my insecurities at 3am because i am a lonely 20 year old who donâ€™t see their own sadness as valid and thinks itâ€™s shallow. idk it must be bc growing up, my parents think mental health is a myth. anyway, enjoy.i have already come into terms
that there will be days when i wonâ€™t love myself, but i never would have anticipated that this time it would linger on for so long.
there was this quote that iâ€™ve heard over my teenage years. sadly, something i tell myself in the form of comfort.
â€œart isnâ€™t meant to be beautiful,
itâ€™s supposed to make you feel something.â€œ
and though, i agree.
i cannot shake the thought that depth and feelings do not capture the eyes, but beauty does as it always has a sense of familiarity to everyone. ugly, unpleasant things that donâ€™t have a place in the standards do not and for that, i have always been afraid to seem hideous to others.
not knowing that it is more frightening to seem hideous to yourself.
