I donâ€™t know what to doI hate myself. Iâ€™m mean to my mom and sister and I donâ€™t care about my friends. I just fought with my mom and I said things that I shouldnâ€™t and I know it wonâ€™t be the same anymore. I care too much about my apparence and money, and Iâ€™m always rejecting faults on others. Iâ€™m weak, even though sometimes I want to die I never could harm myself. Iâ€™m always afraid of everything. I took a cutter but I couldnâ€™t even do anything with it. I never met a single person who could understand me, itâ€™s frustrating each time I feel bad to not talk about it with anyone. I donâ€™t even know how to explain, I donâ€™t really want to die but I donâ€™t want to live either. I really wanted someone to care for me but I hurt the only people who care for me. I donâ€™t know what to do. Itâ€™s been a year now I sometimes think about that. I donâ€™t know how to explain how I feel rn and itâ€™s really frustrating. Last year I probably wrote something similar here but I feel like nothing changed except Iâ€™m less closer with my family since now months ago. Iâ€™m always the same person and even though sometimes Iâ€™m optimist and think things will go better and I know it wonâ€™t. I thought the exact same thing last year. I guess someone like me canâ€™t change. Before my dad died I was really mean with him and now I do the same with my mom. I really blamed people because I feel like on this world itâ€™s so hard to find good people but I think Iâ€™m just the only problem. Iâ€™m good to nothing, Iâ€™m lonely, socially awkward and donâ€™t have true friends, Iâ€™m really sad about that. People my age go out and have fun and Iâ€™m just staying home on my phone all the day. I donâ€™t have any interests like drawing reading or anything. I donâ€™t have any goal in life, Iâ€™m studying to find a job then make money. I just feel like a life is so empty and meaningless.
