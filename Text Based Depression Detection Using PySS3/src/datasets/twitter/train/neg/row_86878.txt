I want death.My girlfriend hates me. My friends hate me. My family hates me. And most of all, I hate me. I hate everything about me. Why can't I be good at anything? I suck at everything I attempt. I'm the scrawniest guy ever. 5'8" 135 lbs. I have tiny arms, no chest, minuscule calves. I have nothing for me in this world.
