I feel completely insaneSo I was just up for 6 days at EDC and had severe psychosis and just came back and slept for 10 hours but I still feel completely nuts. Like I don't even feel like I'm the same person anymore that I was. Have a history of mental health disorders including PTSD, Disassociation, Depression, Anxiety, ADHD, Insomnia, Chemical Dependance, and Idk I don't remember anymore. Am I fucked?
