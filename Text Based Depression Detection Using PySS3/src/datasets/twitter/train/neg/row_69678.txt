Getting a little worried...Hi,

I've been pretty low for the past few months now. Since Coronavirus hit my country I feel really disconnected from a lot of people... I can't really stand loneliness tbh.

I don't really know where to start.

I feel really disconnected from my friends especially. There was a little disagreement between me and one of my "friends". After that, my friends are started to avoid me a bit. They still invite me sometimes. Sometimes... 

When we group together to play online a bit, I tend to get tilted or hotheaded, I agree.   
I tried to change that behavior. I did change that behavior.   
One of the disagreements with him was in that goddamn game. He started mocking me which first I didn't really care about. Then he threw in some insults too and I got a little bit frustrated. I don't know what I did to him but he started acting like a jerk. I just told him to fuck off. That's all...

I tried to talk about this incident with my friends, but it was a waste of time. they were so incapable of this topic that I didn't even try to take it even further. So I tried to bury the hatchet and forget about everything. I don't really know if I'm disconnected from my friends or HE is disconnected from them(when I'm writing this). I worry too much.

So yeah. I'm sitting in my room at 2 AM. Thinking a lot. Listening to music. Sometimes crying :(. and this has been a daily routine for me. 

I'm pretty sure I have anxiety or something and I fear that it might get worse than that. I've been thinking about suicide a lot lately. That I would be better off dead.

Sooo yeah... the two things left to motivate me is my hobby(game dev) and my dog... :(
