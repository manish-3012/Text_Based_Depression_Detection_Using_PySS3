The world feels emptier every day... I donâ€™t want to be a part of it. I donâ€™t want to kill myself, because I truly do want to meet my goals, but I want to kill the part of me feeling empty and helpless. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore.Iâ€™m 19, alone, gay, tired, quarantined, trapped in my moms house in my own thoughts and stuck in a world that doesnâ€™t respect me. I have no motivation to do anything right now but sleep and meditate, or smoke weed. I donâ€™t want to be in my head. Iâ€™ve posted on here many atime before and I donâ€™t want to have to keep seeking help. I just want to know that Iâ€™m not alone right now.
