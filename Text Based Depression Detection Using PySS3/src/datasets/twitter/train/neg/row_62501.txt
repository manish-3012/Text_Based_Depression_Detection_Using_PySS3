Iâ€™ve Held Off So FarIâ€™ve been thinking about it for a while. Iâ€™m poor, can barely afford anything, and i slave away 10 hours a day, 6-7 days a week to afford this meh apartment, not to mention a few choice horrific experiences in my past as a child. I am Catholic, which has kept me from doing it, but tonight I may have drank too much and Iâ€™m honestly scared that I may make a decision Iâ€™m not consciously aware of when the alcohol hits, since Iâ€™m home alone tonight


Please help, I donâ€™t want to leave my beautiful family
