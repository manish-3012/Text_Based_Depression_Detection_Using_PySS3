Only person I thought would care doesn't, so neither do II've been pretty distant from the ones who haven't left me yet. My ex gf/bestie, my old roommate, old bandmates; they're all gone, they haven't reached out in months despite me messaging them. My junkie mom pretends to give a fuck, abusive father pretends he cares. Everyone else is in a grave or haven't spoken to me in over a year. Just talked to my sis, "probably wouldn't care" if I jumped in front of traffic. So here I am! It's kind of a relief tbh. Can't wait to post the letter on FB.
