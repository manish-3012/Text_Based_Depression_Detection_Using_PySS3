Here we go againHey look itâ€™s me, being suicidal... again. Iâ€™m a 6â€™4 overly depressed furry trans girl that has regular panic attacks and constantly obsesses over suicide. Iâ€™ve been trying to reach out as of late and just making my friends worry like hell about me. Iâ€™m constantly miserable, constantly in some sort of pain, usually completely alone, and seemingly unable to get any sort of professional help cuz my parents think Iâ€™m â€œoverreactingâ€. (I canâ€™t get it for myself, Iâ€™m only 16) I just want it to stop. Iâ€™ve been trying to come up with a method, canâ€™t think of anything yet cuz Iâ€™m fucking stupid I guess. I donâ€™t even know where to leave this off. Iâ€™m fucking tired.
