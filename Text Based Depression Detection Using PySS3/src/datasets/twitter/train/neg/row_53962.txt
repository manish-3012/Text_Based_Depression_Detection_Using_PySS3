I'm so isolated and lonely.I want to reach out and tell my friends how bad it is but I can't. I don't know how to approach the subject when I'm face to face with them. I hit a mental brick wall. They assume I'm happy, I don't want to let them down but telling them how bad things are.

I'm so isolated and lonely. My friends who I have told everything, they don't know how to take it and I feel like I've become such a burden for them. I make them sad when I tell them I've been binging, purging and cutting/burning to cope with the overwhelming feelings and distract me from attempting suicide.

I'm crying my eyes out. I've been rejected for desperately needed services, mental health services have lost my referrals and haven't returned my calls. I'm working so hard to get help but it's still a waiting game and I don't know how much longer I can wait.
