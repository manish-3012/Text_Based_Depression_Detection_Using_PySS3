Tips, I suppose?I have depression, anxiety, and almost bi-daily suicidal thoughts (although they don't usually get "too" bad). I'm just really down about my life in general (I don't feel like bumming anybody out with the details :P), and I think the only thing that really keeping me going is just wanting to see new and exciting things, such as new shows, games, etc. So I guess I'm asking for some tips, if the temptation of suicide gets too strong.
