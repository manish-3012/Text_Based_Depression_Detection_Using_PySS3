Kinda sorta maybe have it (don't)
Dealing with failure .... Help....TL;DR- How do I avoid failure and giving up (failure in academics, giving up on life)
I am one of those people who get a bad grade and freaks out. This week is midterms week and I studied as best as I could have, but I ran out of time. Between sports, religion, other extracurricular, and school, I don't have much time. People told me this is the way it's going to be for the rest of my life. I haven't gotten 9+ hours of sleep in 3 months

Anyway, any grade other than an 100 freaks me out. Usually I will do bad on maybe 1 midterm (95-88). But I did terrible on 2 of my midterms. I completely bombed and it was all of my fault. I feel so stupid and just feel that there is no reason for me to live. I am too much of a coward to call anybody, or even check out a book on this suicide. Thankfully it will be gone by next quarter when I study like crazy and get less than 8 hours of sleep haha.

Anyway, my teacher was saying how unlikely students rose while other students, brighter ones fell because they couldn't deal with the failure. I dismisses this thought at first, saying it was impossible for a bright student, like me, to ever become a failure. I realized then that she was talking about people like me. I was practically about to go home and torture myself (mentally, I'm mental emo?) to death.
How do I deal with failure? How do I pick myself up and keep going on?
PS- how ironic/sad/allthefeels is it, that if you log in during r/suicidewatch, there is a "remember me" button (get it?)
PSS- everyone teacher hates me. Even the ones that are neutral talk to me in a third person sort of way. I never give them disrespect, and I keep to myself.
