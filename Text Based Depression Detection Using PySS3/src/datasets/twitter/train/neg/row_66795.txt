I don't think I can go another minute.My husband flew to see his parents. I have agoraphobia, fear of flying, and stayed home. I have separation anxiety that I haven't experienced before. I feel guilty and I regret not going with him. I have been in a state of panic since. I'm afraid I will never see him again and can't bare it. I want to kill myself before I have to face it. I can't just wait for his plane to land. I can't do it. Im running out of time.
