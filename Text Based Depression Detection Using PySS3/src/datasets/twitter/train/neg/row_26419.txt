My head is telling me to kill myselfI'm not sure I can survive the night this voice in my voice in my head just keeps saying "kill yourself, you're useless, you're life is over, everything is fake, noone loves you" ect. I've never had any symptoms like this and i'm close to following through. Tomorrow i start anti-depressants but the psychologist told me not to drink or smoke tonight, which has never been an issue before. Its shouting and i can't get it to stop and i don't want to worry anybody what do I do???!!
