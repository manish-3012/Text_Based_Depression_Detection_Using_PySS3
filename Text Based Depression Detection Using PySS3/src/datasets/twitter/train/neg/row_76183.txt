I'm convinced I'm going to die by killing myself, it's just a matter of time.I have so many things that fucks me up recently, well tbh for a while now... The worst are loneliness, failure at relationship and the icing on the cake, I might have MS, I'm going to know in 2 or 3 weeks. Now I never felt that lonely in my life, I'm 28 and I feel that my time is running out, my job sucks and I wanted to restart university, but I have no clue how I could since my memory is already starting to be shit. Right now, my plan is to kill myself over the summer perhaps, if I can get to there, I can't handle the pain anymore and thinking about my future is too much for me. I will see a therapist on saturday, my hope are pretty high but I think I'm going be disapointed.
