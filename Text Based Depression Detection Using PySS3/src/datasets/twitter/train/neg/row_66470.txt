EhJust deleted the rest of my friends off social media. Haven't heard from them in years and I don't get replies when I reach out. I figure at this point there's no one left stopping me from just doing it. Still, I dont want them to feel sad when they hear the news. But then I remember, they never will. Maybe in a few years time they'll remember me and look me up only to see what happened. I doubt they'll care. Everyone moves one, right? At least thats what I'm counting on.
