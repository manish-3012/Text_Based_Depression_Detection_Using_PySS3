Depressed nursing studentI can't love myself like I used to because of the lack of love within my home. The older I've become, the more aware I've become. The more aware I've become, the more I self loathe.I don't have the means to finance my way out of this circumstantial depression and although I have nice grades, my thoughts go off on horrible horrible tangents knowing that I could be doing better in every aspect of my life. I don't have time to take up a hobby to keep my mind off of things. I don't have time to be with friends. Any thoughts on helping me reconstruct my frame of mind? Thanks.
