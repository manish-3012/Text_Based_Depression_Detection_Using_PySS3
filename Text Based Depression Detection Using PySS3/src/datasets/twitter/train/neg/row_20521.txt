What's the point of counselors?They're really expensive and why would I want to talk about my feelings to someone I don't even know? Yeah yeah, they're trained professionals, but still. I was forced to go to one last year and all it did was give me another reason to kill myself. All 3 of my attempts I either chickened out or didn't have the resources I needed. 

(I don't want to talk, I don't want any advice, I just needed to vent about my mom trying to "help" my suicidal thoughts.)
