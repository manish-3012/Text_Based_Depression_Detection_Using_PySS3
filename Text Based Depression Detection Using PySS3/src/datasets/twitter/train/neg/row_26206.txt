Someone please tell me what to do.I've been with him for over five years. We have a (almost) two year old son together. 

Through the course of our relationship, he has lied, cheated, physically and emotionally abused me. I know all this, and I know I'm stupid to have stayed.

But we're fighting again, because he was caught secretly texting the receptionist from work, but he swears they are just friends. This has happened before - it has never been just a "friend"

And again, he says I'm "psyco" he says he doesn't know why he's with me. I'm a burden to him because I'm crazy and insecure. I should get over all of it, I'm overreacting. 

He says I dont see him as a parent to our son because he wants to put baby in daycare, and I said I'm not comfortable with that yet.

I've thought for years that he- everyone-would be happier, and better off if I was dead. Now I think my son would be too. I shouldn't subject him to myself. He deserves to grow up without dealing with a crazy mother. I'm really trying. I love them both so much. But the more I think about it, the more I come to the conclusion that not killing myself is really the selfish act. Boyfriend would be unrestrained, not tied down, generally not have me as one of his problems anymore. And my son is young enough that if he did miss me, it won't be long for him to forget, and he'll be better off for it in the long run. 

I have no idea if anyone will see this. Maybe this is another crazy thing to do. I have no friends, and no close family. I'm all alone. It'd be okay if I wasn't here at all.
