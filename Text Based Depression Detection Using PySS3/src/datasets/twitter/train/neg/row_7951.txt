My boyfriend of 2 years ghosted me 3 months ago, and I canâ€™t deal with the pain anymoreI was in a relationship for 2 years, it ended back in October because he couldnâ€™t continue in a gay relationship. He didnâ€™t see a future fir himself in one. That came out of nowhere to me, we always talked about our future, he called me his soulmate. It was true love. 

When we broke up, we tried remaining as friends, but he started to act differently. Cold. He jumped back into a gay dating, and said it was because he thought itâ€™s what he wanted. I was obviously hurt, but I cared about him so I stuck by as a friend. I didnâ€™t want to abandon him as he was clearly going through an inner turmoil.

Cut to February of this year, we went to Florida together for a sports event, and it was fun. On the last day, he sort of changed again and said some hurtful things to me. When we got back, he apologized, and said he regrets being that way. We were friendly for a while, and then suddenly one night he messaged me on Instagram drunk after being out at a gay club, said some horrible things, and ghosted me. Blocked me from everything, no warning. Out of nowhere. Cut to now and Iâ€™m still blocked off. Iâ€™ve been so confused and hurt and depressed due to his actions. It made no sense to me to call me those things and disappear. I didnâ€™t hurt him, he just went off and left. 

Recently I saw him on a NY Mets promotional video about nurses and front-liners(he is one), he was the last face on it. And seeing him there just broke me. I feel so worthless and disgusting. Itâ€™s like he died, and I didnâ€™t get to say goodbye. But he didnâ€™t, I just disgusted him so much he thought Iâ€™d be better to just pretend I never existed. Everyday is hard, because my mind goes back to those thoughts, and the isolation and quarantine does not help.
