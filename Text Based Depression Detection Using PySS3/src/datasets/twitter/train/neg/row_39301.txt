There isn't always someone that cares about youAs much as people will deny it, as much as it's not true for everyone, and as sad as it really is - it's true. Not everyone has someone to reach out to when they feel like blowing their brains out. What if your friends all leave you? What if your family begins to reject you over it instead of trying to help you? What if the only single thread of comfort you get in this world is a stranger's nice words over the internet? Wanna know how that feels? It feels fucking shitty. It feels shitty knowing damn well if one of them were in my position, I would've gladly helped to the best of my ability. But they just decided to change the subject instead of acknowledging that I'm *very* close to killing myself. It took all the courage I could muster to go in front of them and admit that I need help. I was so venerable and they just ignored me and moved onto the next subject. What kind of family does that? I just wish they cared about me.
