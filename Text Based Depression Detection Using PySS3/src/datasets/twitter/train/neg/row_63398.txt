2 years ago my best friend killed 3 doctors and then himselfI think about it every day. I mourn how I wasnâ€™t there for him when he clearly needed me. I think about how he was the strongest guy I knew, and he was crushed by this world like an origami crane in the hands of a careless child. He destroyed person after person. His ability to kill was rewarded, he was given medals, and his lust was fed. He was a hound for a master that gave him a bloody steak on a silver platter every night for dinner. 

Then one day, the steak stopped coming. He was kicked to the curb, and he couldnâ€™t turn it off. 

I wish I could hold my best friend again and cry with him. I wish I could end the person who turned him into this monster. I know who it was. I know how he did it, because he tried to turn me too. I broke into a million pieces under the pressure. My best friend held us both together, and got us out of that hell alive. And then I just fucking abandoned him. I know he will never forgive me for being the coward I was. I want to fucking die.
