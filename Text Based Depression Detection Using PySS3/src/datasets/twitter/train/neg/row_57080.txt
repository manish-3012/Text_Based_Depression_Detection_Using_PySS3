Closer and closerEach day I get closer and closer to the end. 
Iâ€™m constantly battling my own mind. 
I canâ€™t keep living knowing that the people I cared about betrayed me. Sucked all joy out of the world. 
Iâ€™ve got a canister of nitrogen and ready to open it up and breathe it in. 
All I need to do is let my family know itâ€™s not their fault and at il be at peace.  Iâ€™m 28 and Iâ€™ve been broken to many times months and years or not belonging not having a purpose is to much now. For a time I had peace and actual thought I meant something. Then it betrayed me. Took the last bit of me that was holding me to this world. The last piece of me that could fight.
