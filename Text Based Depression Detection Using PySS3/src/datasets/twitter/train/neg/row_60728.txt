I've called a suicide prevention center for the first timeI feel stupid. The way she anwsered to what I said made me feel like a dramatic bitch. I heard from other people that they are empathetic but that was next level bullshit. I didn't jump, Obviously. But it's only because I had a shittyer day than most days. When I'm killing myself it's going to be  planned better, I guess the bitch succeeded in her job but next time when it's more serious I'll know to not call.
