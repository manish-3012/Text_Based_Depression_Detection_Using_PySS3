HeyHey my names josh. Im 16 from Australia and its currently 3:46 am. Im depressed as fuck. I have odd, adhd, post traumatic stress, fucked up anxiety and an addiction to pills. I take xanax, dexies and sleeping pills everyday before school just so i can get through the day without breaking down. Ive attempted suicide 4 times and i cut alot of the time because i reckon i deserve it. Idk why but an answer would be pretty nice. Met someone really nice on here not long ago and was just looking for a chat as i sit out on my front step and smoke the last of my smokes before i attempt to quit. If u message me (would be nice) dont pull the "it'll get better,u dont deserve the shit you've been through etc. Just looking for someone chill thats willing to keep me company for a bit. I can chat about anything. I just need a distraction right now. Cheers for reading
