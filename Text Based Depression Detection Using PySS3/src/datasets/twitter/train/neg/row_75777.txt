I feel alone and too depressed to even kill myself at this point.Im not sure what I want from here really, a few words of kindness? I keep getting told it gets better for two years now and it only seems to have gotten worse. I wish I was dead sometimes, I wish some days that I would just go to sleep and have a heart attack in my sleep or something just to stop me from waking up the next day. I just cant seem to bring myself to actually do it, although I've been super close a few times.
