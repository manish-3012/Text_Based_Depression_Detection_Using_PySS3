I've reached the end of a long line of mistakes and now I have nowhere to go.I just moved to a new city to go to college and it's kicking my ass. I think my choice of school was a mistake for me and being far away from anyone I know has been hard. I'm naturally shy and don't really tend to make friends very easily and that in conjunction with the covid situation has kept me from talking to a single sole since I've been here. I just sit in my dorm all day, working on shit that doesn't matter for classes I don't care about that I'm paying way too much to be in. No one cares about me out here and I'm completely alone and it's hard to find to way to keep going. My self harming is worse than it's ever been and I feel like I have the confidence up to finally end my life. Looking for hope or a reason not to I guess.
