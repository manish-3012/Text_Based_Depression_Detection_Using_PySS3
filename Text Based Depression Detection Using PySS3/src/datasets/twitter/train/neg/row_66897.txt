I feel like I'll never be taken seriously unless I attempt suicideThe title says it all. I've been in the system for 12 years. I've never had a formal diagnosis for some reason (guess I'm not worth it). I've been in therapy for two years and haven't made any progress. The therapist knows that I struggle with social anxiety, and that the issues surrounding that are what drive me to feel suicidal. He refuses to work on it with me. I saw a new psychiatrist today and told her the same thing. She prescribed zoloft even though I told her I have taken in before and it did not help. I didn't get anything for anxiety. I'll admit that I'm looking for a benzo because I've tried all the other anti-anxiety meds. The funny thing is that I know drug addicts who were able to get benzos, as well as people who don't even have anxiety. I'm not sure why I'm getting a "fuck you" but here I am.

I feel like I won't be taken seriously unless I do something drastic. I don't want to, but I have no other choice at this point.
