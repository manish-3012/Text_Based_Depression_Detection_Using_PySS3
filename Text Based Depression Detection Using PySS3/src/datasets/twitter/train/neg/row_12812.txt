I just tried to hang myself in my dorm closet but gave up...I really don't know how to feel right now because I've never been this bad before. I've been depressed for a few months but I never thought I'd consider suicide an option. I didn't think after my girlfriend of 8 months said she needed a break from me that I would cry for hours. I didn't know that even though I'm trying my hardest she still cries because of my depression and can't stand it anymore. I didn't know that she'd ever propose a break after we both agreed that breaks are just ways to prolong breakups. I didn't know that this would make me try to hang myself. I didn't know I would lose her and now I don't know what to do.
