NostalgiaWhenever I feel it, I just remember all the great memories i had at that place... i feel so happy -- so full. It's great, i go back to the times when I didnt have a care in the world, where I wasn't miserable. It makes me so happy, but then it's gone. It makes me feel so much more empty, just realizing how shitty my life is now. I feel like there isn't a point to living because i'll never feel that happy again. I just sit there, feeling terrible about myself.
