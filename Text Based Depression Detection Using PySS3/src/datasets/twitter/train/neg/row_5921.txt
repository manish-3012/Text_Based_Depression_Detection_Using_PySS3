Whenever i feel like Iâ€™ve finally gottwn my shit together...I feel like i get kicked back to reality. Idk how much more i can take of the same old BS. Iâ€™ve worked really hard to achieve a lot of my goals the past few years but it just doesnâ€™t feel like enough. And i feel empty from the inside. Iâ€™m honestly exhausted.
I donâ€™t even know what im talking about anymore
