How do you just keep hanging on?Ive been struggling with severe depression for years and tried a ton of different medications and nothing seems to be working. I cry at stupid happy Christmas movies or newspaper articles and I just feel horrible. Im so tempted to stop fighting it and just give in, it's like I'm battling myself everyday. How do you keep holding on when you're exhausted and ready to give up??
