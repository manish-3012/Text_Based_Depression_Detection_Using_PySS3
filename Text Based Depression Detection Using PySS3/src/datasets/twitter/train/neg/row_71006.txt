I feel stuck in a foreign countryOver a year ago, I moved to a small city in a country where I don't speak, for a partner who ended up completely betraying and destroying me. 

It has been a soul draining rollercoaster for the past 7 months. Continuously trying to salvage something with someone who couldn't stop lying or stay faithful, with one excuse after another. I felt like I have completely lost the last 15 months of my life since I moved here, as I gave up everything I had at home. 

The past 3 years of my life turned into a cruel mirage which contained nothing real at all.

Last week I admitted myself into a hospital here because I was feeling suicidal and didn't have anyone to turn to. The hospital didn't have the resources to deal with an English speaker, over the 6 days I spent there, I had merely 20 minutes to talk to a psychologist. I was released in the same state, with only a change to the medication I was on, which was blamed for my suicidal thoughts. 

I have been withdrawing myself from my friends around me. I haven't been back to work since I was released. I'm at my lowest weight and lost 1/6th of my body mass in the last 4 weeks, barely able to stomach a meal. 

I'm stuck in a vicious cycle. I'm stuck in a foreign country with no strength to catch a flight home and face what is next. Nothing more than an empty silhouette of who I once was.

The last time I felt this way as a teenager, I promised I would let it take me the next time it comes, because I was sure I wouldn't get this low again, but here I am. I've booked a hotel for the next few days and hoping I will kill myself there. Everything else is ready. 

I'm not exactly sure which part of me is writing this, but the intensity, dread and anxiety is mounting. I need a way out, one way or another.
