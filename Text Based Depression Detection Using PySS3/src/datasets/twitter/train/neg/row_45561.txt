Today might have been my final push offToday I was betrayed and lonely, vast feelings of helplessness and loneliness are taking me over.

Around noon my very close and only friend texted me asking if I wanted to come over that day after she finishes with school. I reply, telling her enthusiastically, that I would come by and hang out. I live quite far and don't own a car yet so I start busing there a few hours later. On the way over we talked about starting to watch a TV series together while i'm there, 10 minutes later she tells me there's a change of plans and we're going to go to her cousin's house to hangout instead. I was a little upset/frustrated because I had just spent $15 to bus over there and we literally just were at the cousins house yesterday so I started telling her why I'd rather just stay at her place instead. I tell her how i'm allergic to the cats the cousin owns and that I get anxious over being social with people I don't know well (the cousin and her friends), and also I say that her cousins house is a mess all the time. She gets very upset by this and tells me that i'm a selfish asshole for calling the house messy and I don't know what its like being poor (because god forbid I be a middle class person) claiming i'm a rich asshole etc etc.

Needless to say, she leaves me outside her house by myself and drives off to her cousins place. So here I am alone 3 towns over from my own with no money to get back (I had previously planned to get a ride back later in the night when my parents weren't busy) no food, nothing. This is where the major depression kicks in. I start listing all the bad things in my head that have happened to me recently. I just got dumped by my now ex girlfriend, lost my closest and only friend, am now completely alone with my terrible thoughts, struggling with school and trying to find work. I'm shaking and crying as I write this now, i'm planning on either suicide by cop, jumping into oncoming traffic, or stealing my parents car and driving into a solid concrete wall or something like that.

I know this reaction probably sounds over dramatic to most but i'm just being very honest with how I feel and I also suffer from MDD (Major depressive disorder) and BP2 (Bipolar-2) that could also cause the reaction.
