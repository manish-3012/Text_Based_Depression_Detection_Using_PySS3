Seriously, fuck everythingEverything about my life is total, unsalvagable shit. I'm a loser, I can't hold a job, my various mental health issues get in the way of school, blah blah blah blah. I'm so tired of hating every single facet of my existence every fucking day. It sucks waking up each morning (afternoon on the bad days) and *always* wishing I'd suffocated in my sleep. I hate not being able to talk to people for more than a minute without suddenly feeling ashamed of and embarrassed by myself. I hate living with the weight of failing to live up to anyone's expectations (including my own) on my shoulders.

I'm just so fucking angry and disappointed and miserable and exhausted **all the time.** It never stops because I keep screwing more stuff up when I try. I don't succeed at anything, anymore. It's like someone keeps hitting the refresh button on all the negativity in my life because I can't fucking get away from it.

And I'm just so full of hate. I hate everything, I hate being alive. I hate it like I never thought I *could* hate anything. I hate myself more than any other awful thing in the world because there's no removing me from my thoughts. I tried fixing things but they only got worse, and if you can't treat the symptoms, attack the source of your problems.

I only see one thing left to do, and I even know where and how I'm going to do it hahaha. It's been driving me crazy the last couple of weeks ever since I pieced a plan together, but it's so clear to me now. I'm so ready to finally get off this horrible, damned train wreck.
