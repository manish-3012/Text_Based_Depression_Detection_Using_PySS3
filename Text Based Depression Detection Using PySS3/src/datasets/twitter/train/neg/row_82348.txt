People fucking SUCK dudeI donâ€™t know how long I can keep doing this. I thought I was okay, but it seems like everyday is a new challenge and itâ€™s getting harder and harder. Iâ€™ve told my friends that I donâ€™t want to wake up sometimes and I donâ€™t think they understand how to support me when I say that.

People suck. Theyâ€™re rude, theyâ€™re ignorant, and unless you have some authority they refuse to follow what you say, even if itâ€™s for their own good. I hate people. I donâ€™t like them. It feels like I donâ€™t fit in sometimes because I donâ€™t like anyone. I donâ€™t know why. 

It angers me because a little while back I got into an argument with my dad. He thought I was on my phone all night and thatâ€™s why I didnâ€™t sleep/slept restlessly. He doesnâ€™t understand that my thoughts keep me up sometimes. He yelled at me for cursing at him because he made an assumption and then he cursed back. Heâ€™s such a hypocrite. I hate his guts and I hope he dies.

All *I* want to do right now is die. I canâ€™t wait till tomorrow so I can get away from him for a month. Maybe then I can look into it.
