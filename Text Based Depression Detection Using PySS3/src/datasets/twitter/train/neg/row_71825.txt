I feel I may not be able to connect with othersThe header says it all basically. I feel I'm unable to make a connection with others and evidently that bothers me. That fact doesn't really bother me but another thing is that I get pissed easily, so much so that if my dog even takes to long to do his business I find myself gritting my teeth. At this point I don't see why I ought to continue.
