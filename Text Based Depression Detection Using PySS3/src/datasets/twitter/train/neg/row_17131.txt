Feeling suicidal again it took all the energy in me not to postWell here i am again. I wanted to stop sharing my shit because it was useless. I stayed quiet and kept everything in but now i just can't take it anymore its too much i hold the knife on my wrist everyday but i never act on it i get urges and quick boosts of confidence to do it but never can...... idk what to do anymore its getting harder and im probably going to fail this school year
