LostThis shit is hard to write, I feel like Iâ€™m crazy. 3 weeks ago I had lost a lot but I was incredibly happy, but over the last week and a half, my girlfriend has slowly distanced herself from me to spend time with another guy. At some points ruining plans and outright ignoring me for him. I know Iâ€™m fucking retarded but it fucking hurts, I havenâ€™t felt this bad for years. Tomorrow Iâ€™m going to talk with her, if she leaves me Iâ€™ve got a note Iâ€™ve written. I still love her no matter what she is going to say tomorrow. she had an attempt a year ago and I donâ€™t want my leaving to make her go back to that place. Thatâ€™s my main fear, is that I make myself so horrible to her that Iâ€™m responsible for her second attempt or god forbid her death. Despite my fears, I've been obsessed with walking in front of a car, at some points I'm almost happy but it won't stop. This isn't my first rodeo with thoughts like this but this time I've felt incredibly irrational and downright fucking crazy, one hour im normal the next I'm so ready for it all to end. I've written a note to her and a note to everyone else, I've printed off my favorite picture of her so when I go I have her with me. Please don't be mean to me. I know im crazy and I don't know what's wrong with me. I'm just ready to end it and let everyone move on.
