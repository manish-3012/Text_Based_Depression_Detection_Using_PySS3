Just put 1 and 1 together and realised I was subjected to a lot of sexual pawing as a child and Itâ€™s the final straw, Iâ€™ve decided to end my life now, officially.On top of everything at the moment this is the last thing I need. 

Iâ€™m really done with life at this point. Iâ€™ve been extremely depressed for the last decade of my life (10 of 18) and have been wanting to kill myself for 3 of those 10 years. Itâ€™s been a slow, yet unrelenting downward slope over this time and Iâ€™m close to the edge. Iâ€™ve gone from an straight A student to getting 5% on tests. I feel like my mind is literally rotting away. 

Iâ€™ve done everything, tried different meds, been to therapy consistently, made lifestyle changes, pursued alternative treatment such as neural feedback and homeopathy, and been checked into a psychiatric hospital. Iâ€™ve had blood tests, eeg and ecgâ€™s done to see if itâ€™s something else contributing to how I feel. Iâ€™ve even had a fucking DNA test. At the end of the day all Iâ€™m left with is this same feeling. 

Everyone is always telling me what to do and what Iâ€™m doing wrong and Iâ€™ve had enough.
