I need helpI found a sub that seems to be geared towards encouraging others to commit suicide. People will offer easy ways to end their life rather than encouraging them to seek help. The real sick thing about this is kids will come to this sub for advice on easy ways to end it and people will just respond with all the ways they could go through with it. There is no offer for help in the sidebar and its quite clear people there arent trying to help. There was a post made just last night of a sixteen year old kid asking for ways to end it and people were seriously giving him advice on easy and painless ways to end it. I dont see how this fits the community guidelines of reddit. I dont know if I should link the sub directly to this post but if anyone in concerned about this please let me know. It'd be nice to get this sub removed. It isn't helping anyone. This isn't a satire sub either. People going there seem serious and are offered serious responses in return. Nobody there seems to understand that encouraging others to commit suicide is wrong. I'm being chastised for explaining that its actually illegal and if that person does follow through and the police happen to check their reddit account history those people can be held accountable. Its a sub practically glorifying suicide and I have no idea what else to do. I have reported it to the reddit mods but I dont think anything will come of it unless enough people report this sub. I'm sorry if this is not the right place to post this I just don't know who else to turn to. The sub is unhealthy for depressed impressionable individuals and if there is a better place to take my concerns please direct me to where I can go for help to resolve this matter.
