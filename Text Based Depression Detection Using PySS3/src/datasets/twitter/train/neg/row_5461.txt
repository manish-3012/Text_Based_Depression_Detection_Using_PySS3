Now what?Not sure if this is the place for this but here goes. I just had an attempt and I don't know what to do now. The hospital isn't really an option and amazingly I'm actually physically alright. 

I'm confused. Ive been having a rough time of it recently (fuck gender dysphoria) and Id been thinking about it for a while. Before this however I was actually having a good day for the first time in a while. What the fuck happened? And what do I do now?
