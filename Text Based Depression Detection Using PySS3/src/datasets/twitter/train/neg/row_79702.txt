sdfgshtrI guess I'm too dumb to find it but I can't find any pure sources of helium or nitrogen online. Even several darknet marketplaces had nothing. I'm gonna start looking at local suppliers now.

I guess everyone wants to be able to go to sleep at night knowing they didn't help someone kill themselves even if they person is justified in wanting to do so. Now I look up pressure regulators and get gas tanks and all this stuff I know nothing about. Can't even go peacefully without having to go through a mountain of shit first.
