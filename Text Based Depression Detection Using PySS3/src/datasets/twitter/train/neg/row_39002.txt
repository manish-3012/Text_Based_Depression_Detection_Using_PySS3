Reflection on my suicide attemptOn the 13th of November 2019, at the age of 14,I tried to kill myself.Itâ€™s been almost exactly a month since then and Iâ€™m grappled with these strange, conflicting feelings and emotions. On one hand, I still have trouble understanding that it happened. It doesnâ€™t feel real, in a strange way. Itâ€™s like Iâ€™m not sure how to handle the fact that what I did was incredibly serious and real. On the other hand, it also feels like nothing special, in a way. Like it was just another day in my sad life. Just another incident. A minor setback of no importance. These thoughts somehow manage to co exist in my mind with no real trouble. Itâ€™s quite odd.

In a way, even if I didnâ€™t die, I got what I wanted. As I sat there in my school bathroom with a blade to my arm, I knew that if I survived (which I knew was likely), things would still improve in a way. I would have to torture myself with my familyâ€™s reaction but they would realise just how bad things have gotten. So if my attempt failed, things would still change for the better.

I often wonder if I still want to die. If I found myself at the edge of a cliff with certain death at the bottom would I jump? The more i fantasise about it, the more I long for it. Staring at death in the face with open arms, the absoluteness of knowing youâ€™re about to die. Itâ€™s morbidly peaceful. Like thereâ€™s nothing in the world but you and only you. Despite this, I donâ€™t think I want to die at this point in time.
I will likely be put in inpatient soon but thatâ€™s what I always wanted. And of course, my mind wonâ€™t let me die till I figure out my autism situation to see if I have it or not. Iâ€™ve managed to cling onto hope for now. For the first time in a while, my destiny doesnâ€™t seem like suicide
