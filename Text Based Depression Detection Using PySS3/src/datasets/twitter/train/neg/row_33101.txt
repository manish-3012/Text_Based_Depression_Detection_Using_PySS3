I deserve to be suicidal.I am tired of people acting like my life is great and that I shouldn't feel the way I do. I am a fucking 21 M virgin, have never been loved, and have barely any friends or social experience. There is nothing about my life anyone else would want.

The fact that I have been a virgin for this wrong, and never wanted to be, is a sign that who I inherently am is unlovable. Any person, if put in my position would want to kill themselves. I am tired of people calling it mental illness or depression. It is the circumstances of my life that cause these emotions, and if I want to end those circumstances permanently, I have every right to do so. Fuck every self-righteous asshole that tried to help me.
