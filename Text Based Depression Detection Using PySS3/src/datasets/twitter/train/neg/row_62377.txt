not allowed to fuck up. r/SW, can i confide in you?

I should let my negative parameters kill myself through hanging. there is another in my head who hates me. i would let him do it, except it would destroy my 2 teenage sons lives.

i'm having a rough week. people turn on me quickly, i think. it seems like it to me. they have short memories.

i'm talking my in-laws, and friends of my in-laws, and mutual friends of "Christine"* and I. All type A (or trippple-typeA), many connected.

they come to me for help. and i deliver, because i love. i'm the one, they say, who "knows everything" who can "fix everything". 

okay. but i fucked up last saturday, and wasn't home when i should have been (my son was being dropped off by his coach and i got the times mixed up). the fucking fury i faced from the coach (mutual friend) &amp; Christine is still depressing me.
words like "selfish" "asshole" "self-centered" were used. 

what was i doing? i had my mind somewhere else, preparing for a 4-hour long interview at Fuse on mondayâ€¦ no slack is cut.

i haven't worked for pay in 2 weeks, although i AM busting my ass learning MAYA (10 hour days) and putting together new business pitches whenever a talent agent calls and asks me to. A new business pitch is unique and only for that client. they've ranged from iPhone App prototyping (learned that from 11pm to 3am, did it from 10am to 5pm the next day) to multimedia presentations. In the pursuit of new work.

i get SUCH a shitty attitude from Christine when there isn't a $2000 in the mail each week (i'm not bragging, just pointing out obsurdity of the situation.)

and when i'm not "working", i get debriefed by her family. whom have i called, what have i done, when will i be paid. and comments like this: i said to Christine's parents "happy anniversary mom and dad. wow 4 more years will be 50th anniversary, we should start planning." her brother: "how are you so sure you'll still be here in four more years, you may be out in Portland with your brother." 

i joke, saying "oh, i thought i'd just get whacked. i'm allowed to live?" Christine's brother, says "Yes, you're not "made". I'm still trying to go with the flow. I say "Yeah, but till death do we part." at which it got VERY uncomfortable.

Christine is ALWAYS reminding me of how people (her family)  "put up with my shit" because they love me but "they are tired of it." It's like the Led Zepplin song, "No Quarter", know what i mean?

My value to the family is money and being a father to the kids. However, through jokes from Christine and her family, it is heavily inferred that i am "replaceable". What a shitty feeling. Besides my brother and his wife in Portland, I have no family of my own. And it's been made clear, by  Christine,  that i need to just keep my mouth shut when i'm not feeling well. Cos she makes me feel like i'm having everything done for me and not contributing anything back.

Of course, confronting her on this leads straight to denial and "my family loves you."

thanks for listening. and yes, to be crystal clear, i **am** talking about the m-fia, which i married into 18 years ago when i was a dumb 22 year old.

and yes, i'm on meds, seeing a psychiatrist and a talk therapist, who are both working wonders. i have come a long way in the past few months.

tl;dr: feeling like people (wife's family, friends) are allowed to fuck up, but in my wife's eyes, i need to be perfect, robotic, emotionless.

**edit**: i think people on reddit know who i am in real life by this point, but posting here is helping ALOT.

so in the end, it doesn't matter, because i want to stay alive.
