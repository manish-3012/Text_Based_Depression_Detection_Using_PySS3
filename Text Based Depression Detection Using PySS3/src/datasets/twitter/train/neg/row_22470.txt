Am I suicidal??Okay so I haven't told anyone this and it kind of doesn't even feel like a big deal but it is actually quite fucked when I take a step back and think about it. So outside of my room there is a balcony and when I got to sleep at night I usually imagine myself tying a rope to the banister and then tying it around my neck, sitting on the edge and then just slipping off so I hang myself. I find this a relaxing thing to visualize when I am drifting off to sleep. Sometimes I will also imagine putting a handgun under my chin and blowing my brains out. I also find this a relaxing thing to visualize when I am trying to sleep.

Wtf is wrong with me? I don't really want to kill myself, not at all. I am worried because I feel like even though its not really a problem now there is no guarantee that if my life goes sour I won't try and act on these weird ideas.

Should I be worried about this??
