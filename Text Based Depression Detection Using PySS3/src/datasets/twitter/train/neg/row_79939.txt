On the business of being happyI am tired and interested in an eternal rest.  It is physically and emotionally exhausting being around so many people, and working extremely hard.  Luckily, in their eyes I look like a great worker,  a stand up person.  All I want to do is carry out my plans, but I am so invested in people's lives that I'd do more harm then good.  But it is so taxing on me.
