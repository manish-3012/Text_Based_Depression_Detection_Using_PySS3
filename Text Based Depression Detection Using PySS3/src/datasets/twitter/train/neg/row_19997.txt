sucks that i'll be dying at 16every day is a constant emotionally abusive fight with my parents. my last living grandparent has terminal cancer. my grades are slipping. my mental health is at an all time low. i hardly eat. most nights i get 3 hours of sleep max. 

i'm losing motivation in every aspect of my life. it seems so pointless nowadays. i don't have the strength to keep going. everyone tells me to stay strong. but i don't want to. i want to be weak. i want to give in. i can't handle it here. i hate it here. i didn't used to hate it. but i do now. there's too much pressure to be perfect. i'm not happy. 

i'm sorry to my cats, indigo and sally. i know you're going to be confused when i don't come home. 

i'm sorry to my parents, although we fight daily, i know my leaving would hurt you deeply.

i'm sorry to my cousins, i wanted to grow up together. i'm so sorry it won't happen.

i'm sorry to my grandfather, i know you didn't want to outlive me.

i'm sorry to my friends, we had so many things planned together.

i'm sorry to my therapist, it's not your fault. i can't be fixed and that's okay.

i'm sorry to my boyfriend, i wanted to see you one last time.
