I'm autistic and I want to fucking kill myself because of itI hate how I suck at conversation. I'm not funny. I don't fucking understand anything, like jokes or sarcasm. I feel like everyone else has a million inside jokes that I just don't fucking get. I get labeled as creepy because of my behavior. I don't know when I say inappropriate things while talking to someone. I don't have any friends or a relationship because of these things. 


I experienced a suicide attempt last year, and I'm really sad that I did not succeed. I overdosed on pills, and I know I have access to a lot of different pills, so I feel like either I'll try this method again soon or I'll find the closest bridge and jump off. I'm fucking done with this shit. I can't find anything positive about myself.
