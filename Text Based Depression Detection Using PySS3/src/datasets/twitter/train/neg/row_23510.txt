Im going to kill myself because of acne scarsI'm finished. I used to get angry about it, but I cant even be mad anymore. I'm just finished. Nothing left. I have no joy. Ever. There is a demon inside me caused by my acne scars and its made me a toxic person. I cant hold a job. Cant hold a relationship. My negativity rubs off on people to the point they dont want to be around me.

Ive tried it all. Ive been to so many doctors and tried so many treatments ive lost count. Ive spent tens of thousands of dollars.

I'm drained. I dont want to be around people, and I dont want to be alone. I cant focus on whats going on around me because all I can think about are acne scars and killing myself.

My face looks like two different people. In good lighting I look good. When the light reveals the scars, it shocking. Horrifying. People say thing like "your cheek is ruined." and "your skin is broken".

I have so many scars on my face its difficult to get an exact count. I would say there are easily over 200.
