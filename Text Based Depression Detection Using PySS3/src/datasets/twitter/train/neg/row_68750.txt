I need helpI am 13 years old, in the last year I have been having severely distressive thoughts, like horrible thoughts, thoughts about what would my funeral be like, horrible pictures in my head, feelings I'm not supposed to feel, especially of sinful sexual nature (if you think it's homosexuality no, it's even worse) constant panic attacks, a fast reply would be well appreciated, since I'm in full blown psychosis right now, I don't know what happened to me I was so innocent and happy back in 2017.
I feel as if I'm losing my sanity, please help.
