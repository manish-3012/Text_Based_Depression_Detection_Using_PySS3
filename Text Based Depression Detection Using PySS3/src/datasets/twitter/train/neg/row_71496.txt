What happens after a failed attempt? (Aus)I've been suicidal for a few years now, but thankfully haven't actually gone through with it yet. (I am getting professional help, and have very supportive friends so this isn't a call for help, though thanks)

From those who have attempted and failed, particularly those in Australia (South Australia ideally) where you were found and saved before you died, what happened? Hospital? Psych ward? what's the experience afterwards?
