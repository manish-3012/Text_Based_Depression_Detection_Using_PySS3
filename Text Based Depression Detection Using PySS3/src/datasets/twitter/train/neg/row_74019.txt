iâ€™m tiredhi, reddit. iâ€™ve only been lurking for a short while now but this is my first post on here. iâ€™m 18 and last year i moved from a southeast asian country all the way to western europe to start university in a subject iâ€™ve since been dispassionate about.
iâ€™ve been conflicted about everything since i started here, not that i havenâ€™t struggled with similar things in the past. i donâ€™t think iâ€™m equipped to live by myself at all.
iâ€™m all alone right now. it could be so easy to end it all right here.
