Am I suicidal or just indifferent?Background: Suicidal tendencies and depression run in my family. My uncle committed suicide, two of my siblings and my mom have depression. Plus, my sister attempted suicide before.  


Having said that, I would say I'm a happy person. I do experience worry, anxiety, sadness, etc. every now and then but I don't think it's an unnatural extreme. I like being me, I have an amazing support system of friends and family, and I'm not severely financially burdened. But for the past 6 months or so, I can't shake the feeling of being indifferent to death. I always think that it's okay for me to screw up cause there's always a way out for me by killing myself. I just care less and less about work. It's affecting my performance somewhat but I'm not in danger of losing my job or anything. Dying used to scare me but now it just feels so normal and okay. Like I could die tomorrow and everything would be fine. I think of it as just an easy way out for me in case things go south, which kinda makes me happy since I worry less about screwing up. Does this make me suicidal? Should I find myself a therapist?
