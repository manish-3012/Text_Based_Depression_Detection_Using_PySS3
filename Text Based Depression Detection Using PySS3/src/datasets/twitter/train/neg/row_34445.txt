I feel brokenI canâ€™t get away from negative thoughts of myself, embarrassed from past actions or interactions. They come flooding in when I ask myself why Iâ€™m struggling alone despite every effort to be a part of the lives of others. 

Saw the post on the front page  today about friends, something to the effect of not finding any if youâ€™re looking for them, but if youâ€™re just concerned with being one then youâ€™ll find many. The thing is my life is pretty much me setting myself on fire to keep others warm.

But nobody is inviting me out. Nobody has conversations where they mention something because they â€œthought of me.â€ Iâ€™m good for helping everyone else get what they want and need but Iâ€™m practically invisible in every other aspect of my life.

I feel this anger and sadness constantly. Medicine doesnâ€™t squelch the feeling that Iâ€™m broken or better off dead. I know it would hurt a few people but I am just so tired of feeling alone and unimportant.
