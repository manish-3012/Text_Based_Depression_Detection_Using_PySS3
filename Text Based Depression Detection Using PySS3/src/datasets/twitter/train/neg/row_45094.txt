Guys I'm in so much pain right nowI don't know what to do. I can't kill myself, but still feel like all will to live is drained from me. The reason - I just realized someone that I thought at least cared about me, actually never did. And the worst part is she never even said anything to at least make me realize I'm wasting my time. Eleven fucking years. What an idiot I am. Please someone tell me I'll get better.
