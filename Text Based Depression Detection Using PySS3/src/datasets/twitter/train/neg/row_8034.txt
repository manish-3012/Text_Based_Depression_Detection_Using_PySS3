Not really sure what to do with my life at this pointCurrently, Im a second year student in a Computer Science programme at my university and Im honestly considering dropping out. Im trying so hard with the coding aspects of it however I can never get it and even with help and my own personal research, I still cant get it. Other people get it while I have to spend double the time and I still dont fully get it. 
    Apart from that, Im contemplating withdrawing from the programme however Ive come to the realization that Im just not good at anything. If I withdraw, Im not sure what I would do. I just hate feeling so useless and like a failure all the time. Itry new things, practice but I still fail. I have no friends, no supportive family not to mention no talent whatsover. Ive always been suicidal since I was a kid however I feel this pushes me over the edge. I just dont know what to do anymore. I just wish I were dead.
