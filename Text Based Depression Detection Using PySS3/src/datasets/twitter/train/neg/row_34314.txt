[17m] Can't wait to roll over, pull up the covers, and go back to sleep. It looks more appealing all the time.It occurs to me that suicide is not a choice, but a hard reality that I will soon have to face. I wouldnâ€™t say that itâ€™s a necessity, as that is reserved for situations of life and death, but I would say that it is my best option, the other being to live for the next ten or more years with my parents, who coddle and belittle me. My two older brothers went mad from this, I will not be the third. If I could move out, I would, but that would be untenable on my income and, to be honest, I wouldnâ€™t have the stomach for living in poverty and isolation anyway. I have failed to graduate high school. I am not allowed out of the house save for work and school (there is a reason for this, but it does not matter). My anxiety is so crippling that I sleep with the light on to avoid my fear of the dark. But Iâ€™m not going to talk about mental issues. They seem so small when you consider that I have no future. So suicide is looking pretty good right now. I feel like going back to sleep. It would be like that. Comfortable forever. At least I got to make it this far, even if I have to stop just short of adulthood and look on as everyone else progresses.
