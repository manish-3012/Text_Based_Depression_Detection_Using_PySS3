Terrified of myselfThis is going to be long, I'm sorry. I'm 18 (19 in nineteen days), have a lot of chronic illnesses that put me in constant pain, weigh far more than I would ever want to, have less than supportive family, and my boyfriend is several hours away. I have a job that works me weird hours so I can't see my therapist and my anti-depressant isn't working anymore. I feel horrible about myself and like I don't deserve to live and I don't matter. I tried to get on an online chat to help me but they had me sitting indefinitely. I tried to commit suicide when I was in eighth grade, and obviously failed. I was never taken to a hospital (attempted OD) and was blamed for my feelings by my family. I don't know what to do. I'm afraid to get in my car or take the meds I need to function. I feel like crying but I can't form any tears. I feel like I'm numb on the outside and suffering inside. I don't know what to do.
