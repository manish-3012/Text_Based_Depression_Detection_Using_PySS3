I guess this is a goodbyeI don't deserve to live. I hurt the only person I loved, and... There's no reason for me to try to go on - I'll only bring more pain to those around me. I want to repay the kindness some people have shown me. In around ten months I'll settle my debts and say goodbyes to those who will still remember me by then. Then I'll die. I can't stand the pain I have brought to others and to myself. All these years of suffering... They didn't deserve it. I did.

Goobye.
