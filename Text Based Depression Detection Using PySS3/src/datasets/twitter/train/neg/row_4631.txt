I hate myselfI have tried and as you can see failed at suicide 5 times now 3 weeks ago yesterday my best freind killed herself and now I have to spend days in court with the kids that bullied her to killing herself she was the one person I could speak to about my mental health and my therapist told me to look to chat rooms if I didn't want to speak to anyone so hear I am. I just wanted to know if anyone sees little to no point in life even though they do well in school have freinds but still self harm fantasise about their death and feel like a let down well anyway help.
