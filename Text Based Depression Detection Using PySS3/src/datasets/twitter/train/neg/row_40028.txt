Done with it all, been suffering with OCD for months.Iâ€™ve been having mental and physical health issues since May, and recently got broken up with. I am extremely depressed and I want to end it.

In May, my OCD was exacerbated due to the isolation and it got so bad that I couldnâ€™t drive or do simple tasks such as the dishes. I was very close to either committing suicide or going to rehab. I ended up getting some help for it and it gave me hope. 

This past month and a half has been weird. I was diagnosed with physical health issues that caused me a lot of stress but I met a really great guy and spent a lot of time with him.

Last night, out of the blue, he ended it with me. After all the health issues, this just tops it off. I really thought I had a future with him, but I was completely wrong. Furthermore, it made me dislike myself even more because itâ€™s obvious that my OCD had a part in this breakup. He doesnâ€™t seem to be taking it as seriously as I am, but then again, Iâ€™m the one who was broken up with.

Iâ€™m tired. Iâ€™m exhausted. Iâ€™m not motivated to do anything. Iâ€™m going to grad school soon and Iâ€™m not even excited. Iâ€™m sick of this life and suffering. I feel so fucking alone. My mind is always wandering and living in pure fear. It reminds me of that Blade Runner quote, something like â€œto live in fear, thatâ€™s what being a slave is, right?â€ Thatâ€™s how I feel - a slave to my mind. I hate my OCD, I hate my health issues. I just want to end it and be free from all of this. I am so depressed about the breakup. 

I just want to sleep and not wake up. I want the pain to end.
