My company never makes a difference to anyoneI'm just there. No one actually wants me around. I just feel like a piece of furniture in the room that makes noise. It doesn't matter if I'm there or not. No one would ever seek out my presence on purpose. Why am I still here? I don't want to exist anymore.

I feel so pathetic and meaningless.
