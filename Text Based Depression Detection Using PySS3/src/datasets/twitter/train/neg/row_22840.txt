My only friend hates me..The only friend I've had in a long time was so sweet to me. She was gentle, caring, loving, and close. I don't know what happened but she started getting distant. She makes very mean jokes about me, wants to hang out less, ignores me, ect. I've tried talking to her about it on multiple occasions but she just denies that anything is wrong. Honestly it's probably just because I'm a genuinely unlikable person. Anyways, we haven't talked much for a while now, and I don't know if she'll ever be okay with being around me again. Now I'm going to be alone on my birthday again...

I really thought things would be different this time. If I don't off myself, maybe I should just not let people get close to me. It would make life so much easier.
