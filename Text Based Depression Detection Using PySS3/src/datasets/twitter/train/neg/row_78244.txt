Iâ€™m a weenieI got the rope. I had the time. Iâ€™m just, lazy. Iâ€™m worried it wonâ€™t work, Iâ€™m worried the rope I have is too thin (1/4â€?) I donâ€™t wanna become a vegetable if it messes up. 

I think Iâ€™m just lazy honestly. Thatâ€™s why I want to leave. I donâ€™t want to go to school, I hate art now, instead of improving Iâ€™ve only been degrading. I canâ€™t stay awake, I have Dâ€™s and Eâ€™s in classes, my memory is getting worse. I probably wonâ€™t remember I posted this by tomorrow.

I donâ€™t even know if I really want to die. I want to get out. But I bet Iâ€™d still be sad and lethargic even if I didnâ€™t have any responsibilities at all.

If you only live once, why canâ€™t I do what I want? Why do I have to go to school, why do I have to get a job? Why canâ€™t I just sleep? I wouldnâ€™t bother anyone, wouldnâ€™t even need money spent on me. I just want to be invisible, doing what I want, why is that a problem?
I say â€œitâ€™s fine, you donâ€™t have to waste anything on meâ€ and â€œitâ€™s fine, can I PLEASE just be left alone?!â€ But it doesnâ€™t happen! It pisses me off!

Maybe I will hang myself. Even if I become a vegetable, atleast Iâ€™ll be able to sleep. Iâ€™ll be able to do what I want, no responsibilities. I wonâ€™t be left alone, but hey, I wonâ€™t be aware on whatâ€™s going outside of my head anyways. Maybe Iâ€™ll be lucky and â€œtrapped in a shellâ€ so I can finally go to a world I want to be in (my imagination)

Tl:Dr; Iâ€™m a pussy and didnâ€™t go through. But maybe even if I fail, Iâ€™ll be a vegetable, and reach my goal anyways. If YOLO, why do you have responsibilities?
