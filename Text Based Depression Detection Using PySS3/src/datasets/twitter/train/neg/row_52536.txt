I Hate My Lifehttps://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/3oev5b/probably_gonna_off_myself_soon/

If you want, you can read this to see why I hate my life so much. I tried to post to a different subreddit, but it didn't work and I'm too annoyed and impatient to message a mod to make a post there that nobody will read anyway.
 Nothing's even enjoyable anymore. I barely have any motivation to do school work. My grades aren't going so well right now. I already know how I'm going to kill myself and I've already made my notes. I'm not killing myself like right now or anything, but if this online stuff doesn't work, I'm done...
