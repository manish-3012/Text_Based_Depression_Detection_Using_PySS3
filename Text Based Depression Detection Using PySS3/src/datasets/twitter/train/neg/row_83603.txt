Punching myself + intruding thoughts postpartumI felt okay emotionally after having my baby but now I'm feeling so overwhelmed. Basically, my husband works so much and I'm basically the carer for 100% of the baby's needs right now. I get no breaks. Lately I've been punching my leg and head when I feel overwhelmed with stress. Sometimes I get intruding thoughts about calling my mother in law to come pick up the baby, and then going into the backyard and shooting myself in the head.

I just needed to tell someone.
