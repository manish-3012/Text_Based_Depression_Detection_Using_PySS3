Want to delete my Facebook, but I don't really want the practice severing all my social connections.  What's the healthier choice (more inside).I do have some significant depressive and suicidal ideation tendencies, chronic (I'm older than your average redditor) and largely untreatable, but hey, I'm still here, so I guess I manage.  I'm in a rough spot right now, and trying to decide whether killing Facebook entirely is just going to magnify the issue through isolating me, or be a healthy thing by letting me focus on my (important to me) work instead of having something in my life that's a reminder of my SENSE of isolation, as I don't really wish to engage with most of these people in the polite happy-hippy way endemic to Facebook.

I just hovered over that delete button for a few minutes, and I have to admit my brain made the analogy of resting on a trigger. 

I know this resembles the typical sort of over-thought, hyperbolic negativity borne out of depression, but it's not.  I'm old enough, practiced enough, to keep my wits about me here.  But I could use some opinions, because honestly I can see it both ways.  Anyone else have a sense of what's the healthier choice?

Edit: thanks for the thoughts everyone.  My depression "cracked" last night (unusual for it to shift so quickly, but it happens, and I'm not complaining), and I'm on an upswing right now.  So I'm probably better off without having been so drastic.  Meanwhile, I got some interesting perspectives here, which is nice--feeling a bit of connection in another way.  So, I appreciate it.
