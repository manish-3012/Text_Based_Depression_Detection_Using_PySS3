Your thoughts on euthanasia?What are your thoughts on euthanasia?

Personally, I wish it was legal and available in many more places.

At the same time, I also wish it were available for not only people with physical health issues.
I mean it would be nice to know that there is an option for you to die peacefully without dangers of surviving a suicide attempt. It would also allow you to say proper goodbyes to your friends and family?

If it was possible for you to get euthanased, would you do it?
