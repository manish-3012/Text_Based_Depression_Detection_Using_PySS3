I donâ€™t know even know what I wanâ€™t anymore.I am 24 soon and I have never kept in touch with people Iâ€™ve met, I donâ€™t have any friends Iâ€™m the oldest of my two siblings, I never feel like I fit anywhere I work, I get along with everyone because Iâ€™m scared I might indirectly hurt them and Iâ€™m more reserved than most people but I always felt like the odd one out like I should not be here, the people I even talk regularly (if you can even call it something like that) which is only at partyâ€™s never anytime else.

I was always picked on from my younger school years to high school and college but I didnâ€™t let that bother me as long as my siblings were doing fine. I can only hold a conversation for more than a few minutes with either family or from my younger siblings who introduce me I still never talk to anyone I canâ€™t find the words to strike up a conversation with anyone I even feel safer and more relaxed if I can not talk to as little amount of people as possible, I am constantly getting a nudge from life to go out and do things.

Now Iâ€™ve grown up a bit more since I was younger I just want to be an ordinary guy but i donâ€™t know what that even means I think as I feel Iâ€™ve done all I wanâ€™t to do I donâ€™t feel like celebrating or attending birthdays weddings anything like that, I sit in my room with my door locked and just sleep I get so  sad and feel like such a stupid asshole that people are dying everyday and Iâ€™m just feeling like I wanna just die.

Iâ€™ve been close to doing it but I can never push my self all the way (Iâ€™m not sure if Iâ€™m allowed to list them here) I hate my self so much it hurts but I know that if I do I would leave my younger brother and sister without a brother and that tears at my heart that I could feel so selfish but I feel like Iâ€™ve done everything Iâ€™ve wanted to do.

I feel like thereâ€™s nothing there left to keep my life flowing down the river of time and itâ€™s now just a pointless struggle to exist everyday It might sound weird but feel so sad when I eat or drink anything or when I even walk or lay down I feel like Iâ€™ve killed something that my eyes cannot even see like Iâ€™m taking something away from the universe by even being alive.

Iâ€™ve seen others posts and feel like I can finally unbottle these feelings Iâ€™ve had for awhile I could never express, I always have had to have bottled up, feeling like I could explode and collapse in tears.

Iâ€™ve always tried to keep to myself afraid to hurt someoneâ€™s feelings by saying the wrong thing or inadvertently being the thing something that would lead to someone being hurt. Iâ€™m honestly not sure how long I can keep on day after day just drifting... before I try ending myself again. Iâ€™m not looking for friends or pity just needed to write this to see if it helps.
