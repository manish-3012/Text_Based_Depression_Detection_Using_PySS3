So close to hanging myself in the basement this morningI have a small window where nobody can discover me and pull me down.  Everything is ready including my noose.  The temptation to kill myself is unbearable.  I'm such a fucking loser and failure that only a handful of immediate family members would be affected.  It really seems like the right thing to do.  Better than being a fat slobby leech in his late 20s with no job, no friends.  All I do is sit on my computer, play video games, and read.  I have a bachelor's degree in computer science but I didn't apply myself and do terrible in interviews.  Haven't had a job for 6 years.  The majority of people would agree that I'm just a drain on society and maybe I should just make room for someone else.  Sorry about this poorly written rant but my thoughts are racing and the act of typing is cathartic.
