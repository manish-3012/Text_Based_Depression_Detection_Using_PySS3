On whims and chanceI am more or less suicidal on whims.  I don't particularly care to live or die.  When I am happy, living sounds like a good option.  When I am unhappy, dying sounds pretty okay to me.  I have nothing sustaining me, no firm anchor, no root.  I just live, but I have no reason to.

Why are you alive?  What are you living for?  What's the point?
