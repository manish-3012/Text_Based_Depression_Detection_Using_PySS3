Here I am againWhy. Why is it always like this. I know I used to be a bad person, I know I deserve pain, but like this? Every day getting worse and worse, I feel like I've gone insane. I've lost my mind, I can barely do human things anymore, I can't even talk right or walk right anymore, it feels like I've genuinely gone braindead. I wish it would end, everyday the pain gets worse and I find out something else new, something that hurts me even worse. I just wanna scream, I wanna jump, I wanna do anything just to escape, I can't handle this anymore I can't stop crying I can't stop panicking I can't live right anymore. I just wanna die, I wanna leave the earth, I hate being here it's so cold and lonely and full of people who just wanna hurt others and I can't handle it, this world's not for me and I just wanna get taken out of it more than anything
