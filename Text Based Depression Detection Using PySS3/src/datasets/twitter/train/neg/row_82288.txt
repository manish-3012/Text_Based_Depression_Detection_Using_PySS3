i donâ€™t want to be aliveLike many of us on this sub, iâ€™ve struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts from a young age of around 11 years old. iâ€™ve had a rough childhood and past and a fair amount of trauma thatâ€™s hard to deal with anymore. 

iâ€™ve sought help; had countless doctors appointments and have been prescribed a plethora of medication that doesnâ€™t seem to work. iâ€™ve been to regular therapy sessions, counseling, tried self care and meditation... basically iâ€™ve turned to anything and everything in attempts to lessen these feelings and to no avail. 
 
every day truly feels like a battle to get out of bed and keep going. i donâ€™t find joy in any of the things i once used to, lack appetite and energy, iâ€™m deeply saddened every day for no other reason than thatâ€™s just what depression does to me. every day the thought of suicide crosses my mind; how much easier it would be if the world were just to stop, to not have to deal with the pain anymore. 

iâ€™ve felt this way for so long that it just feels pointless to continue. thereâ€™s no point in waiting for a â€œnew dayâ€ when every new day turns out just the same as it always has. i donâ€™t want to wake up tomorrow, i donâ€™t want to keep breathing, and i donâ€™t want to wait and find out if â€œit gets betterâ€

itâ€™s like swimming but no matter how hard you kick, you just canâ€™t keep your head above water; so why not just sink?
