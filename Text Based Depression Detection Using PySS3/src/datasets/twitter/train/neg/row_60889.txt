Alone and confused.I want a relationship in my life, but I'm asocial. On top of that, I deal with things like depression and feeling suicidal. I think that a relationship could fix those things, but I can't get it in me to go for a relationship because I'm asocial. All the people I know who could potentially be a partner either don't talk to me, or something about them turns me off to them.

Every time I've tried an online LDR (Long Distance Relationship) it has failed, and it's made things even worse for me.

I don't know if I should focus on fixing myself, or just try harder to socialize and get over it. I don't have the resources for therapy or medicine, and I'm asocial to the point where I would refuse to vent to someone even if I had the chance.

I consider suicide because it permanently fixes my problems, and ends a life which is painful to live.
