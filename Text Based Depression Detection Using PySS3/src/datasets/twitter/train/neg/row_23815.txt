I donâ€™t get itSomedays I think about what itâ€™s line on the other side. Then I start to feel sorta impatient. Then I feel like my life isnâ€™t too important and I want to leave it. Sometimes I get really close to leaving it.

Sometimes I concern myself with how close I get but I donâ€™t really care to get help. Iâ€™m not depressed or anything... Sometimes I just want to stop.

Does anyone know what Iâ€™m talking about? Like I just want to go on to whatâ€™s next. I really donâ€™t get it, but I donâ€™t see a problem with just ending my life.
