Only one month leftIn April I've decided this is my last year. The closer the year got to an end the more I believe it. I'm not going to talk about why, no point. I guess I just needed to let someone know. I have what I need now it's just about where. Just know, I don't want this. I can't change this. I have tried getting help, been diagnosed with multiple things. It's just made it all worse knowing I'm stuck with this feeling until I die. There's no point in continuing.
