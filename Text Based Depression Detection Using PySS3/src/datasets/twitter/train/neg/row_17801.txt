Iâ€™m stuckI have studies that Iâ€™m failing because I see no point for them. Nobody is going to save me. Iâ€™m really considering killing myself but I know I wonâ€™t have the courage. My family would be sad. I donâ€™t understand why I live in this world if I am constantly reminded how flawed I am, how I canâ€™t connect with people. How Iâ€™m possibly a pedo. I think I deserve to die. I donâ€™t know what else to do now, itâ€™s reaching that decision that is the hardest part
