I cannot go on like this anymoreI used to have specific goals and always have the motivation to do my best in everything but not anymore. For half of this year, I do not see myself as normal anymore. I barely got out of bed, not cleaning myself properly, grew empathy towards everything, including my works at university (which was something super important for me in the past cause I have to keep my scholarship). Nothing seems to matter anymore, I feel like breathing but not living. I stopped talking to my friends for a while now cause all I can think of is how terrible I am right now and how it would be much better if I disappeared. I have an amazing family, which is so amazing that I feel so bad to let them put up with me for this half of the year. I have tried it once and ended up in the hospital for over a week. But even after that, the thoughts still exist in my head as it is the only way. I hate living as not having direction and purpose, motivation like this, I have never been like this before and it scared me that I cannot go back to myself anymore. Believe it or not, I used to be very optimistic and now I'm just a complete mess, my brain feels like mush and things are just so tired.
