My life doesnâ€™t suck that much anymore yet Iâ€™m still wishing to dieIâ€™m depressed and anxious. What? You too??? No way! Well, itâ€™s my time to shine sweetie so lemme tell u some kinda sad shit. 

I have this feeling that I canâ€™t complain bc I was a somewhat healthy kid with a roof over my head and plenty of toys. I shouldnâ€™t complain. But I also at some points have wished to have a much simpler life if that meant having the love of my parents. (Idk why, that was just my kid logic). 

Dad was never even present, leaving me with a single mum who was very toxic and had terrible coping mechanisms. Needless to say I was the punching bag for any of her frustrations. Quite literally too. 

I always blamed myself for having 2 emotionally absent parents, and an abusive mum. Thought it had to be my fault. Wanting their love so desperately (still do tbh) that I would overlook any bad words or behaviour that were thrown my way just in hopes that maybe one day I would get why she was acting that way (maybe out of love idk). Or they would understand that they were just hurting me.

We are always told that weâ€™ll understand things better when weâ€™re older. So I waited it out. Turns out that everything I thought was normal (all the name callings, the humiliations, the physical abuse even at 17, and straight up manipulation) was... not? I didnâ€™t quite get that youâ€™re supposed to feel safe at home. That youâ€™re parents are there to nurture and encourage you. 

I mean, I kinda did, but to an extent just didnâ€™t realise the situation I was in until recently. I still am rationalising most of what happened and bruh. 

But even tho Iâ€™m certain that these events happened and the extremely negative emotions and thoughts I had growing up were true, I constantly ask myself if Iâ€™m being fair to want to cut out my mother off my life. I ask myself if Iâ€™m not being to harsh, or dramatic (I always thought I felt anxiety and depression due to being a teen but really they were straight up anxiety and depression). 

I grew up with no safety net, I donâ€™t know how to truly trust people, even the ones that love me. I have friends, but I still feel so alone all the time. 

My studies are fails after fails because I canâ€™t seem to get my shit together so my future seems stagnant. 

It feels like Iâ€™m still that kid that is in so much pain all I wanna do is be in my room. I just donâ€™t know how to function. Iâ€™m super awkward and generally scared of people so that makes it hard to make friends too. 

I feel ungrateful as fuck for wanting to die even tho I know that there ARE people that care and that my life isnâ€™t â€œso badâ€. I feel selfish. 

Iâ€™m not going anywhere with this... just venting to the wall

I feel lost
