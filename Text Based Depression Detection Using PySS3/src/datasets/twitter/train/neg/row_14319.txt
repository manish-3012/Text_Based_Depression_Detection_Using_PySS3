I Don't Think It's Worth It to Try to Reach Such A Tiny Amount of Happiness.I can't do anything and I'm tired of trying to make it and failing. I'm not going to school and don't have a job. I can't do those things because my anxiety's too bad. I don't want to be supported by my mom my entire life. 

I'm so fucking useless and seeing everyone else be good and have fun makes me feel like shit. I wanna draw, and try to' and can't do it for shit. I can't do any of the things I want, I can't write, program, video edit or make music and I see all these people around me that can and it make me feel horrible. 

And on top of the success other people have that I can't, they have happiness I never will. Assuming I get over my anxiety and find sucess or something I'm good at, I can never enjoy things the way people do. Everyone has sex and does drugs and drink, and I'm not interested in those things. I wanna be interested in them 'cause all the people I've looked up to are into it seems like they've had so much with doing them. I don't want to be who I am. I want to be "bad" but I'm too scared and idealistic. I don't think I can reach the amount of happiness others can even if I do eventually get better. My potential is shit, and even reaching it I won't be happy.

I think most of all I want relationships. I want friends and a girlfriend. I haven't been able to talk to people for so long and I keep getting worse. Seeing other interact and have fun makes me feel and 'cause I can't have that, and then I feel worse 'cause I'm getting upset at people's happiness. I think I'm a bad person for thinking like this.

I don't see the point of trying to make it through life and get happiness if the amount of happiness I can reach is so little. Especially if I have to go through all this pain for so long and the little amount of happiness isn't garunteed.
