am I still suicidal?I used to be suicidal. 5\-6 years ago was at the peak.

Since then nothing changed, my life is still shit, but I dont think of killing myself anymore as I used to. 

I just work early morning to night all the time, my feet hurt me, my back is killing me, I am too tired to think of suicide.

I might occatinally think of the past how shitty my life is , how stupid I am and how everyone would be doing so well, and maybe suicide is an option that is always there very deep inside me that needs lure to come out.

Can someone say that I am not suicidal? do those thoughts ever leave completely ?
