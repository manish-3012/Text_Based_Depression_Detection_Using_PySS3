Please, somebody tell me not to throw myself out of my dorm window...I'm constantly surrounded by people and yet I feel as alone as when the depression first started.  I feel ignored and I feel like the only way to get people to notice me is if I do something drastic.

Please, somebody tell me not to do it.
