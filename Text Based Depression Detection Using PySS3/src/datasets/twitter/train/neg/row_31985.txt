I Want To DieSo I want to kill myself. I've had attempts in the past, along with years of self harm. I have a plan this time though, for tomorrow. I feel so useless. The only thing though is, I don't want to hurt others by dying. But I know that I will, so that leads me right back to hating myself. I hope I don't sound selfish, but, can someone help me or give me advice?
