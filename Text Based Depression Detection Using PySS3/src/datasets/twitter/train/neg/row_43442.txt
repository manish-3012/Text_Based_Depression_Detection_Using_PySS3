I think I'm doneEx is getting married and I just want to kill myself. I'm seriously just considering jumping off a bridge right now so I can be free from this. This pain too much for me right now. I should've killed myself when I was in high school/when I was brave enough to do it. Living and keep waiting for things to get better wasnt worth it.  Goodbye  .
