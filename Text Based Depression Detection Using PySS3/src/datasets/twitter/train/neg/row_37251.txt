Stuck with it for life.Ive been diagnosed with Tourettes officially for at least 4 years now. When I get anxious or sad, which I have since I was nine, my body fights myself.

My arms outstretched to hit myself, my neck whips around violently, often either connecting with an object or whiplash causing pain. I click loudly like a zombie from the last of us and cannot have conversations with new/intimidating people without slurred words. My memory also is slipping. A noticeable change in brain development ever since my two attempts at overdoses from strong painkillers and alcohol.

I know im stuck with this for life. I knew this back in high school, when I attempted to OD as to get away from the feeling and hope I'd never wake up.

I dont know how to look forward anymore. Living in a new state with my childhood friends didnt help. Meeting a girl I consider to love didnt help. The continued support of my family only burdens me with guilt.

Im not close. Im not in need of medical attention and my feelings seem to ebb and flow so im not concerned for my safety. But I do realise how quickly my mind seems to change.

How do you get over something that affects you every waking moment? How do you stop thinking of thoughts that are compulsions themselves?
