Iâ€™m sorry.Hey.

I donâ€™t ever talk about my feelings or what Iâ€™m going through because generally I am robotic and feel nothing and can handle everything.

I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m typing this out but I guess itâ€™s a step.

Iâ€™ve wanted to die since I was 13 years old. I donâ€™t understand this world and Iâ€™ve always felt like I was from somewhere else. People are awful and terrible.  Iâ€™m always alone even when Iâ€™m with people. Iâ€™m cripplingly depressed and I know it. I isolate myself which makes it all worse but I choose to because I canâ€™t stand any human interaction. It all seems forced and worthless and pointless. I hate everyone.

I want nothing more than to die but for some stupid reason I canâ€™t. There is a nagging feeling in my life that wonâ€™t let me go.

Iâ€™ve tried pills, and ended up forcing myself to puke.
Iâ€™ve tried cutting and ended up bandaging myself back up well enough to not die.
Iâ€™ve thought of hanging myself, jumping off of something. Running into traffic. Poison. Everything.

Iâ€™ve gotten my hands on lots of things.

But I just canâ€™t do it.

Iâ€™ve wanted to die for so long and because I canâ€™t, for some reason, I want to die even more.

I canâ€™t believe how miserable I am and I am so close to the edge.

Please let me go.
