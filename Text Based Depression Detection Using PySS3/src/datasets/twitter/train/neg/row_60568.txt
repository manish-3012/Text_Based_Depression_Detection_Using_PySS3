Why is it still happening5 straight years of dealing with depression and anxiety. Five.  Five years later and I still find that I have nights where i can't fall asleep because of the unbelievable weight on my chest

I'm so tired, you know? I've been doing so much better, I have resources, I've had better coping mechanisms; why is it that as soon as I finally feel like I have a grasp on thingsâ€”for real this timeâ€”it completely falls apart. And all due to my own head. 

I'm literally having an internal battle with myself every single day: one side saying that I am doing better and that things are changing, and my other side doing absolutely anything it can to tear me down. So far, the bad side keeps doing things that work without fail 

It's justâ€”it's been 5 years. And I'm in the same place. Despite the seeming progress, and the changes, and the growth, I'm in the exact same place. 

What the fuck now? My good side knows I'm supposed to hold on, knows that this is just another time I fall time and another time I'll have to get back up. But I'm so genuinely tired of getting back up. 

I really want to die. For the first time in a few months, I utterly and truly want to die. 

I never reach such a point because I know I have people who care for me and I know it would hurt the people I love. I never want to do that. I never ever want to do that. And I still don't, but god it fucking hurts and I just really really really want to die 

5 years. Despite the illusion of progress, I'm in the exact same spot. The same hurtâ€”maybe even worse, actuallyâ€”after 5 years of trying and feeling like I'm going somewhere. 

I've gone nowhere. What if I'm going nowhere? I want to die. I can't deal with another five years of this.
