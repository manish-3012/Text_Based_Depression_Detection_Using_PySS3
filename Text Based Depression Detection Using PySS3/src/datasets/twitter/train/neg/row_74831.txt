Anxiety rant fueled by self-loathing. Itâ€™s long but if anyone takes the time thank you. Iâ€™m really low right now.I donâ€™t like the person I am, I hate how my brain works. I try to be better for myself and for those around me, but I fail. Constantly drinking. Yes thatâ€™s a problem but even when I have sober stretches, I still say the wrong thing when trying to help, I donâ€™t know how to relate to people in a real way, Iâ€™m not compassionate enough like I should be, my emotions take control most of the time when they shouldnâ€™t. Grew up isolated in an abusive home so all my social â€œskillsâ€ are lacking and fake. Iâ€™m boring, I donâ€™t have any hobbies, Iâ€™m stuck in looping thoughts so often that I do t have social awareness when I am around people. 

Without alcohol I would choose to do nothing but watch tv. I dont maintain relationships well, here and there Iâ€™ll get a buzz and think to reach out to friends, but there isnâ€™t anyone truly close  to me and itâ€™s my fault. Thatâ€™s why I drink. 

Drinking allowed me to â€œfakeâ€ my way into friendships with loving, real people, which is why I have some beautiful people in my life, but at the end itâ€™s all fake. Iâ€™m fake. When it comes down to me and who I truly am I have no fucking idea. There is nothing in passionate about, Iâ€™m just an apathetic blob of self-hatred and falsehood. 

My whole life has been an act to get people to love me under the false pretense of alcohol, because then I become compassionate, thoughtful, caring, funny, motivated... until I end up back here, after losing emotional control while drinking, saying things I legitimately feel but they came out so poorly that my words carry no weight. My whole life feels like a broken fucking sham. 

Cool I recently got a job, a car, I picked that part of my life up so I was feeling good. But all my self-reflection just shows me that underneath it all I am a horribly selfish and fake person. I WANT to be better but I donâ€™t know how. I really donâ€™t. God Iâ€™ve tried so many times. I always fail the people around me, just by being me. 

I donâ€™t understand why Iâ€™m such a failure at caring for or relating to people the right way.I donâ€™t even know how to entertain myself sober, no hobbies or interests besides watching tv. Iâ€™ve always been like this, I just canâ€™t seem to give a fuck when I should, and I give too many fucks when I should accept things and let go. Iâ€™ve hurt so many people because I canâ€™t understand or control my fucking brain. Idk if I can live with all the guilt. Then sometimes, I literally just donâ€™t care. 

I just want to drink it all away right now, all the emotional pain just numb it out. Why was I born to hate my mind? 30 fucking years, so much therapy, medications, why canâ€™t I figure out how to calm this hell that I hear and live in every fucking day? When do you just stop fucking trying? I canâ€™t do that I know I will keep trying but god I hate my brain and myself.
