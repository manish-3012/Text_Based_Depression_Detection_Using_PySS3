I don't know why I'm posting.Just one more place to vent I guess.

I don't want to be talked out of it, no one's actually going to help fix anything wrong in my life, so this post is pointless. But fuck it, everything I post is pointless, everything I do is pointless. My life has never had much of a meaning, I've never had a passion, never had a goal, never had a close friend. I'm in my thirties and everyone I care about is already dead and I've given up on life.

No money, no love, no more opportunities. The last bit of hope I had smashed by some asshole on his cellphone. So fuck it, why keep living when there's nothing to live for?

Even before today my life sucked, I was miserable all the time, just was good at ignoring it. I can't ignore it now, I'm gonna be fucking homeless again and there's not a lot I can do about it except off myself before I end up back on the street.

All I can do is sit and see how fucked everything is. I'm burdened with perception and what I perceive is a world of scum. I hate almost anyone I ever see speak, and when EVERYONE is the problem...chances are I'm the problem. Hell maybe we're all the problem.
