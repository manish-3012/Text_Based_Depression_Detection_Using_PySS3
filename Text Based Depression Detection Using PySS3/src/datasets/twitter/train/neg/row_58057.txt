I don't know how to handle this.Every day I think about suicide. I think about how I'd do it. I fantasize about it. I want to escape this way I feel. This way I am. I don't feel strong enough to keep pressing on with this weight. I can't sleep. I barely eat. Every second is torture. But I can't ever seem to actually do it. I think the only thing keeping me here is the thought of everyone who expects me to stay being disappointed and heart broken. I don't want them to feel like they weren't enough for me to want to stay for. But nothing inside of me wants me to exist for my own benefit. It feels pointless. Idk what to do with this feeling. This pain...

I do start therapy next week. It's my only hope for feeling normal. But I know it won't immediately cure me...
