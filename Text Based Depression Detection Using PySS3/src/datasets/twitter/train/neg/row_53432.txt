I'm so angry and suicidalMy wife cheated on me and took my kids. I haven't seen them in half a year. She took all our money when she left. I was left with nothing but debt. I was homeless for 2 months. I tried to kill myself a few times. I just can't take this brutal heartless world anymore. I want to be dead. I'm tired of suffering.
