Giving upFirst time posting on anything like this. Some of this I won't even tell the doctors, maybe it's more comforting to know I won't get hospitalized for telling the truth. Just needed to vent for a bit. I don't know where to start. I had a shitty time back when I was in middle school (tweens are fucking cruel), in fact during that time I had my first suicide attempt (overdose miserably failed), though these past 3 years could possibly be the worst I've been. These days I worry about what comes after I leave school because I can't even handle school by itself. I hate hearing about my birthday because it's another year that I'm unfortunately alive. I've been wondering if anything really matters, the answer is always no. I don't care about school anymore, I only show up so they don't send my parents to court. My grades are undoubtedly shit and I'm definitely failing classes; I don't even think I'll finish school. I'll stop eating because I'm not worth wasting food on. I'll cut myself in class, in the bathroom, during lunch, and at home. On my way home I fantasize about getting run over by the schoolbus, maybe taking a detour to the bridge to hang myself on. I've tested the waters a bit by choking myself with a jump rope to see what it could feel like to hang myself. I know my family would be devastated but I've already gotten past that. The only reason I haven't killed myself already is because I don't want to leave my dog, although slowly I'm getting past that too. I've been wasting everyone's time and energy with my presence. My family tries very hard to help me and even sometimes I like to think about what it would be like to be older, but I know that even if I don't kill myself now it will happen some day. I've gotten a new fucked up way to cope meanwhile by looking at pictures of dead people and serious injuries; it makes me a bit jealous that I can't be in that position.
