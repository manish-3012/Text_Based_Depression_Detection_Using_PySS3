Being discharged from hospital, definitely want to kill myselfI understand it from their perspective. I've been here 2 weeks. The longer I'm here the harder it'll be to go back into the "real" world. But very little has improved during my stay and some things have gotten worse. The meds have given me more anxiety than when I came in and I think about suicide every day, have tried to do it twice while here. 

My life outside of this safe bubble is overwhelming at every angle and that's why I want to kill myself. I have no real safe place I can go once I leave. Its back to the same shit that got me in here. 

They keep saying if you can't cope you can attend the emergency room and come back but I know I won't even go home to my flat. I'm going to go straight to the bridge and jump. If I can't make it that far I'll walk into the traffic.

I feel like no matter what I say, they're not going to believe I'm serious. You're just telling us your suicidal because you've gotten comfy in hospital. It's not true. I don't want to be in hospital but I equally can't face my life again. I thought I had some hope of getting better here and despite engaging and doing all the activities my mind has gotten worse.

I'll be leaving the day after tomorrow. I don't have the energy to ask them to give me at least till Friday as the doctor was now set Wednesday in stone and it putting immense pressure on me to agree with this day. 

I just want to leave and go through with things once and for all. I tried.
