I hope I dieI hope I die on my way home from work. I hope the universe takes it out of my hands and I'm flattened by a semi. I don't have the will power to kill myself and I don't want to hurt anyone else. But I hope it happens. I hope I die. I am absolute trash. Mainly because it would be easier. I am weak and it hurts to see it on their face every time they realize what a piece of shit I am. I am not a good person and I hope I die. I want to die.  Please let me die. Anyway, have a wonderful evening.
