I feel so lonely and disorientedI am 16 and I feel lonely. I do not have friends and I find difficult to bound (and trust) with others. Maybe it is the social anxiety. I also have a (significant) speech problem that makes difficult to me to pronounce many letters, a deformed (or at least it seems so to me) face (I cry most of times I see photos of mine) and problematic, bankrupted parents. I feel that I am losing my teenage years not going out and not having any friends. I am afraid of the future; besides the problems already mentioned, I barely can go alone to the bakery without looking like I have Parkinson because of my shaky/trembling hands (they are always shaky, but they get shakier in those situations). A colleague once told me I walk like if I were afraid of the World and well that is just true. I guess the only advantage I have is that I am relatively bright \-at least people have been telling me so for long\-, but I feel like I am getting dumber and dumber. My memory has weakened, and very often I confuse dreams and things I have read with memories. I started having these crisis \-nausea, headache, shortness of breath, dizziness\-, but at least they have stopped for a while.

I am thinking of suicide quite a lot; it just seems like a good option. I mean, most of my problems are very difficult to fix, and I have not got the time or the disposition to do it. It seems fitting to just accept my fate of misery and I die.

p.s: sorry for any grammar mistakes, English is not my native language.
