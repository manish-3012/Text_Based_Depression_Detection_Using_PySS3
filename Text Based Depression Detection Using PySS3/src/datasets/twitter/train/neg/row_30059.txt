I am really leaning towards doing itIâ€™ve got scissors, I have a plan to pinch my neck and cut it. That should do it. I canâ€™t keep living like this. The schools have all these safety measures, they are going to keep them, and I donâ€™t like them. Iâ€™m so done. I canâ€™t keep â€œwaitingâ€ like everyone tells me to. I canâ€™t socialize normally anymore. Everyone always says â€œOh itâ€™ll get better,â€ or â€œPlease donâ€™t do it, it wonâ€™t last forever.â€ Iâ€™m so tired. I have to do something if life goes on like this. Just had to get this out. I have very little hope anymore.
