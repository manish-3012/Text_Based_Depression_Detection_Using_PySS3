All I could think about today was killing myselfIâ€™ve been feeling really suicidal lately and like really overwhelmed with assignments and life. But I donâ€™t want to die. I do but Iâ€™m scared so I canâ€™t build up the courage to do it. And now Iâ€™m at the point where I feel dead inside 24/7 and like being alive is just an inconvenience and there is so many things in my life rn that couldnâ€™t go any worse so there isnâ€™t really a reason to keep going. 
I guess this is a call for help or for someone to listen to me but even if someone reaches out Iâ€™ll end up shutting them out because I feel like Iâ€™m bothering them. So yeah I donâ€™t know anymore.
