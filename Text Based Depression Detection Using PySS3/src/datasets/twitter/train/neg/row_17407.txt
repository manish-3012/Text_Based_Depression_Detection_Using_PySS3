I donâ€™t know any moreI thought Iâ€™d never post on here but I was wrong. Iâ€™m 14 (m) and I just have no motivation and just want to die. I fuck up everything in my life I fuck up all my relationships with my friends and I donâ€™t know how to fix it. I have a family that cares but I feel guilty because of how I am and I just donâ€™t deserve them or anything I have. I have nothing to live for at this point and Iâ€™m on the edge but Iâ€™m trying to fix things but I just get stuck in more shit with more problems before now I thing the world would be better if with out Me. I donâ€™t know what I want to do anymore
