Screw me.I'm drinking alcohol tonight.
Lots of alcohol.
I know that is risking my life but. Do I care? No I don't
I'll probably end up the same I did before, texting ex, going on "a walk" late and this time it's very likely that I'll just jump.
I'm drinking more. I know what I'm risking but I don't care. As the titel says: screw me!
