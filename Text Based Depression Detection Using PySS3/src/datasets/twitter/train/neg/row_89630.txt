I just don't know anymore...It's been a rough year.  I got married during this time, and everything was good.. but not anymore... It's nothing but fight after fight now.  I fucked up and ruined any chances of us getting a house because I have no memory if I signed some loans or not for an ex many years ago.  I honestly do not think I did, but if I do an investigation into it and I'm wrong, I can go to jail for 6 years for perjury (I think that's what it said).  My wife is an amazing woman that truly deserves the best in life, and I've grown to realize that's not me.  I don't want to make her life harder than it already is because of me.  Does anybody know if any loans/student loans that were signed before we were married can be held against her?  I don't want her to hate me anymore than she already does.  I love her with all my heart and would do anything for her.  She's my best friend, but the last few weeks she's mentioned divorce.  Tonight she told me she's going to get the papers tomorrow.  I don't know what to do anymore.....I'm just a failure at everything.  I've thought about suicide for many years.  A few years ago tried it with 1/2 a bottle of jack and 24 darvocet...guess I can't even do that right, huh?
