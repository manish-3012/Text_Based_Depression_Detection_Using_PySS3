Every road is the same.This is hard for me I never open up and when I do breathing becomes difficult and I just want to push it down. I have never really had anybody in my life I could open up to my parents have never taken an interest in my life and having no-one has really taken a toll on me I have dealt with depression for a while now and it went away for a while but now it's back and suicide is a constant thought. I don't think I would do it but I do wonder will the world be better off without me. I'm never good enough for anyone. I can never do anything right nothing is good enough for anyone and I'm ready to just have peace and solace.
