Can anyone not cry anymore?been through a lot, my first girlfriend i actually really cared about broke up with me yesterday cause she was bored. I've lost all relationships with my family because of my drug use. I'm so so sad and I feel like i could cry a million tears but i just cant. 

i havent cried in years, even after shit that should make me, both my friends suicide attempts, my mums cancer diagnosis, losing all my friends after moving. All this and I can't cry, I can't let it out. It makes me feel really bad. 


I don't know what to do guys, shits tough. Holding off on suicide because I don't want my ex girlfriend feeling responsible, starting to get closer and closer.

thank you guys, i love you.
