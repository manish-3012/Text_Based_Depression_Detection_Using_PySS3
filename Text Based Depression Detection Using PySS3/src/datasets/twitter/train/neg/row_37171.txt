Thought anyone had my nude picture. Turns out i was wrongSo I accidentally uploaded a nude picture this summer. I wanted to send it to my ex, but I accidentally posted it. It was up for a couple minutes until a friend told me.
Time passes, nothing happens.
Today. I'm with a friend, talking about this embarrassing pictures like the ones your friends take when you don't notice and stuff. And she says "your nude should be also very embarrassing!". My blood freezes, I ask her about it. Someone screenshot my nude and all his friends have it. And their other friends. And the others...

I'm 16. I'm a fucking child. My life was getting so much better. Now this can make it all go nuts. It can destroy it. 

I got so anxious my friend got scared as fuck. She put in our class group chat a message like: you guys should delete Almu's nude because it can destroy her life.

Great. She had good intentions, but now even the people that didn't knew it does.

If my mother finds out. If this picture is leaked further, I'll do it. I'm not scared. I'm just sure. This can end fine. This can end in my death. Only two ways.
