If I went through with it, I'd become a serial killer beyond the grave.I'm pretty close to purchasing my preferred method, but right now the only thing stopping me is the fact that I'd be inadvertently causing more deaths.

I know my mother and best friend would kill themselves if I went through with it. My boyfriend just might, but he has a MASSIVE support system that will keep him hanging on long enough to forget about me.

At this point, I'm just alive to keep others content. But I'm ready to end it, despite what my best friend said to try and convince me otherwise.
