I canâ€™t stop thinking about jumping.Iâ€™ve been living the past couple months just waiting for the straw that breaks the camels back. Maybe years, who knows, but I do know that I have been living with this overwhelming feeling that nothing will get better and theres no use trying because regardless of what I do, Iâ€™ll never be happy.
I live near a watering hole that has a giant cliff that I keep imagining myself jumping from and plummeting into the water below.
Itâ€™s so tempting.
