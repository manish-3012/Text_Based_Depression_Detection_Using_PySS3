Everything is falling apart for me anyway.I'm in high school, and everything is terrible.  Crippling anxiety and paranoia about school, dropping out of my honors math class and doing worse in the new, slower class with no chance to get an A by the end of the semester, leading me to be subject to the scrutiny of my other mathy friends and my parents.  Girls manipulate and hurt me, boys throw stuff at me and laugh at me.  I try to be kind and positive everyday, and yet it's never returned.  Why should I even bother?
