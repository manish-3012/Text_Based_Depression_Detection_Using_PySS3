Sick of it allI'm 23 almost 24, no job, I've never had a girlfriend, suffer from depression, and I'm living on my brothers couch. I'm really getting bored of the severe ups and downs here. Every time I get my hopes up about anything I crash because they end up being unrealistic. I can't seem to function as a regular human being and I feel like my life has been a complete, uneventful waste of time up to this point. I can't even spend a week in a new place before giving up on searching for a job. I hate everything about myself. I hate the way I live, I hate the way I love, I hate being shy, I hate liking the things that I like, I hate not liking the things I don't like, I hate being constantly horny, I hate being useless, I hate being as stupid as I am, I hate being so pathetic, I hate feeling alone, I hate that I've missed out on so much already, I hate that it feels like it's too late for me to be loved, I hate that I'm so insecure that I feel judged by just existing, I hate that I feel so powerless. I just want it to be over. I just want it to get better or I want to die. I'm too fucking worthless to keep going and do anything about it. I'm so fragile at this point I feel like any obstacle shatters my self confidence and will to live. My existence was and continues to be a mistake.
