What's the use?I've never felt so alone, I wish I had the comfort of a friend but everyone's too busy to care. Depressions kicking in and I don't want it to ruin my life, I really don't.  I wish it were easier for me to approach people but I feel like I'll just bother, I feel like everyone already has their own group if friends and adding myself anywhere will be a bother.
