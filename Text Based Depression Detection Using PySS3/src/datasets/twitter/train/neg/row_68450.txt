What should I do ? (help ?)It's the weekend I can't call my therapist (I only have this work number) any else doctor is gonna be closed and I'm not sure I can make it to monday without hurting myself. I don't wanna go to any emergency hospital because I don't wanna worry my parents. I can't call any hotlines because I have social anxiety (I even tried an online chat where it's just anonyme texting but even THAT I thought I was gonna die.) How does one get through this ?
