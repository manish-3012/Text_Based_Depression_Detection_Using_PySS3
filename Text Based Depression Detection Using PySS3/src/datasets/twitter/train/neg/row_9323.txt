I spend all my effort and money avoiding peopleSince my dad died and i was left alone in this world i just dont want to interact. It's been a year, an eviction notice is imminent, i survived one attempt 6 months ago. It was the best and clearest i felt when i felt i was going to die. 

I feel like a solution that won't crystalize no matter the scratching on the side or tine to cool down. I had a financial upswing aftery dad died, moved away from whatever minimal support system i might have had. I can rememver some reasons why but i dont care to recall any of them. Now, what options do i have. Be evicted, go to a different city. Place I'm from is as unattainably expensive as where im now. It doesn't matter. When i had nothing i was an unapologetic beggar. I don't care for going back to that way of life.  I won't work for anytbing else either. I don't want to fix any problems i.have. i dont. It'll just feel like going back to survival mode and then itll never stop. I just want my control back and end my own life.
