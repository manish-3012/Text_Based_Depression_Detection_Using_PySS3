Can someone please, please help me?I'm having a very, very bad time. I have a chronic illness that will require treatment for the rest of my life and so I need a full-time job with benefits. But unfortunately I was incredibly stupid as a kid and I majored in a worthless subject, tv/film/communications and I just can't find full-time work. My job prospects seem to be zero at this point but I absolutely have to make a decent living and pay the bills.

Unfortunately I'm just not talented in my degree field. I don't have the tech skills necessary to succeed and I've lost any passion for the field I had as a kid. Quite simply, I don't want a career in this anymore. I've outgrown any enthusiasm for the field and I truly wish I had majored in something I would have some passion for and I would enjoy working towards. The jobs in my field require skills that are way over my head, the pay is shit for all of them, most require expensive equipment I could never afford, I can't make a living on freelance, and due to insane competition all the really good jobs go a small handful of people that are so much more talented and skilled than me. This is a field for the very rich or the almost-sociopathically dedicated and driven, and I am neither. Grad school isn't really an option.

What do I even do? What jobs am I even qualified for with no skills and a bachelor's degree? I truly feel I have no options at this point and I'm starting to become overwhelmed by suicidal thoughts. It's been two years since graduation and I still don't have full-time work. I hate what I studied and it's not a field I can make a decent living in. I've struggled with depression and overwhelming feelings of hopelessness and worthlessness all day every day for more than two years and unless something starts going my way soon, I'm very scared about my future and how much deeper into total despair I will sink. I need help. :(
