Rambling a bit here but here's what's on my mind about relationships that's got me depressedIf you ever find someone that you feel is surely with you no matter how much of a success or a failure you end up, treat that person right and stand by them. Do your best to love them unconditionally, because it's not something that's easy to do. While I don't enjoy admitting it, I too basically choose who to associate with based largely on their looks and their general level of success relative to my own.

Yeah, that means I pretty much am what I hate about people, so I should be the change I want to to see and start trying to care more about everyone I meet, but then I'd have to admit that I barely support myself anyway so it would be hard to ever feel strong enough to attract someone, because what can I offer them? Not much...not much. This is why generational wealth and success is so strong and helpful for those that have it, it gives you a huge advantage to building a happy life early and often.

And if you are born pretty attractive, there's that chance someone high on the ladder will pull you up to be with them, so yeah. Looks matter, money matters...and we are all doing it to provide a leg up for our family's genetic line. Nature made us but also doomed us from the beginning, but I know that some people really do feel more deeply about each other. I just wish I knew how to get such a deep connection going in my life. I know it won't be perfect or feel perfect either. I guess it just takes hard work...and in the end, that person could decide to stop loving you at any time before you die.
