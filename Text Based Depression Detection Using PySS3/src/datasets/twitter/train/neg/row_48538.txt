LostI am so alone. I have no one to talk to. I don't want to kill myself, I just want to die. I don't want people to suddenly feel as if it was their fault and to look for answers, I just want to be gone. I don't feel like living. I haven't felt like living for a long time. This is actually probably the wrong sub for this, since I wouldn't call myself suicidal. I just have nothing in my life. Nothing. It's so pointless, and there's too much pain for it to be worth it. I don't even know what I'm looking for, I just needed to get this off my chest. But I often beg to die. Every time before sleeping, I hope to not wake up again. I don't know how to live anymore. I don't know what to do. I'm lost.
