I want to die.I am 34.

I am a wreck due to depression and anxiety that stem from childhood abuse from my family.

I no longer speak to my family, and haven't done so in over a decade.

I am homeless.

I am tens of thousands of dollars in debt.

I am alone.

It's cold. 

I am hungry.

Anxiety and depression have made applying and holding jobs nearly impossible.

I have an ingrained sense of worthlessness due to my childhood abuse.

I want to die.

Living is pain and suffering.
