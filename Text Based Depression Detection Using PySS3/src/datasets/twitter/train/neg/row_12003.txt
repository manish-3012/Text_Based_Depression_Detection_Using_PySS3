THIS IS NOT A SHITPOST. I don't want to kill myself until the Leafs win the cup again.I've been suicidal for 11 years. Turning 21 this summer. You know how there are some things people decide they don't want to die until they see? For example, 

"I don't want to die until I see my grandaughter get married" or "I don't want to die until I see the first black president". Something like that?

Well, I'm currently lying in bed with a noose around my neck and I can give you 3 good reasons why I'm not going to kill myself. They are, in order 1) I don't want to make my mom sad, 2) I'm afraid to die, and 3) It would make me tremendously happy to see my favourite sports team break their 50 year championship drought and win a Stanley Cup in my lifetime. 


Now, obviously if I can get through the first two points then I'm not going to let the Leafs stop me from killing myself. But it's a little thing that's currently acting as a stopgap between me and my death.
