It's getting too muchMy parents disowned me at 15 for being gay. I lived with my grandmother for a little while, and then I ended up in a foster home because my grandmother was sick.

I got abused at the foster home. From there, after fracturing my ankle because of them, I ended up in a group home where I was again abused. 

I finally moved out on my own at about 17. I finally got a job at 18 and had it for a few months. Then I got fired after I ended up in a hospital from stress overload. I was during probationary period. I lost everything. I sold everything but my laptop. 

I ended up homeless, living on the streets. I did some odd jobs to keep eating and finding cheap motels to stay for a night for $20 if I could afford it. 

After talking to a friend he gave me $200. I used it for a plane ticket to another city in Canada. I've been here now since October. I've been looking for a job, and I can't find a damn thing. 

I was living with someone I met on reddit but it's been too much of a stressor for both of us. I have to be out of here soon. As in end of the month soon. I've got no money. I get $599 a month, and I owe someone $120. My rent here is $400 but who knows in the next place? I'm breaking the fuck down. I don't want to be homeless again and I'm terrified. I don't know what the hell I'm supposed to do.

Suicide is something I've always been staunch against, but now it's seeming like a damn good idea.
