Half of me wants to die so bad, the other half doesn't think I deserve the satisfaction of deathI've wanted to die for probably over 10 years now. I'm now 19 and wondering why I just don't do it already. "Weakling", I tell myself. "Everyone will be better off without you dragging them down." But death is too good for me. I don't deserve it. I've ruined the lives of everyone around me and killing myself wouldn't bring them any happiness. I want to let all the people I've wronged take a knife and just stab me individually until I bleed out. That's how I want to die. But that means I would have to force people to interact with me, which isn't going to happen. Nobody wants me around, and I can't blame them. I'm gutter trash. Actually, worse than that. I'm worse than sub-human. Worst of the worst. I deserve death, but I don't deserve the relief that comes with it. I deserve the worst hell you could possibly imagine.
