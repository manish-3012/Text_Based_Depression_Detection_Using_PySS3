I don't see the point anymore...My life has never been good it seems. I'm 23 years old guy. Since I was 6 yo I had to watch my brother have a drug addiction and break my mother's heart year after year. He has OD 3 times. I started self-harming at 8 years old. Between the ages of 6-14 years old I had literally 1 friend(my neighbor) because my mom is super controlling and never let me go over to other kid's houses. Everyone in school bullied me for being quite, shy, and bad at sports. When I was 15 years old I met a girl and she became my BFF. I also made friends with 2 other ppl! At 16 I told the girl I loved her. That ended up destroying our friendship and I had to transfer to a different school because I started cutting WAY to much and was suicidal. I lost my best friend and all friends I had made. I graduated alone.

Since starting college my mom is still super controlling and I struggle with my sexuality. Never dated much, but when I do they seem to end up being "bad girls". Except one. I meet her in 2015. She was perfect and wonderful. But she died from a stroke 5 months after we started dating. She had a disease called AVM. I still miss her and see her parents regularly. I am only happy when I am with them, but they live an hour away. Recently I started dating a girl. I never felt so connect to someone. She cheated on me with her boss. I ended up in the hospital over it. Its been 4 months and I still am cutting over it. I think about suicide constantly and never seem to be able to sleep. My life never seems to get better. When I have hope it's immediately taken from me. I don't like how I can't be in control. I don't like feeling like a ghost or robot. Just doing what I'm told and never being noticed. Never having anyone to share my pain with who has true empathy to know how I truly feel. I feel so alone. Sorry for ranting, but I keep thoughts in my head all day.
