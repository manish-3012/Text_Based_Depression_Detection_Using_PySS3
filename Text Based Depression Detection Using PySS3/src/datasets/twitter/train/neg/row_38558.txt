Life seems so minusculeI try really hard to keep my mind off of it. I try to convince myself that none of the thoughts are ever serious. But really, when all I can think about is making a dramatic life choice, I think that all my thoughts are serious. I can't help but detest every moment I spend here. I can't take these bipolar emotions. Feeling so alone, no matter who I'm with, only makes things worse. So I think about the one girl I didn't feel lonely with. And I know she doesn't want me. And all I think about is making my death dramatic. I don't care about anyone else's opinion of me. Not my family. Not my friends. Not anyone. So I go to therapy every two weeks or so and I talk about some things that aren't actually effecting me that much. I bottle it up and rot in my own mind. And I just try to find new distractions I don't have money for. I feel useless. I feel wasted. I feel that there is no purpose to me, just for me to get by until I just can't anymore.
