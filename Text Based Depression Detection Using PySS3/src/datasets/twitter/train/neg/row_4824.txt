T-20 Days and Counting...The past week or so I have had the recurring thought that I will not make it to next year. Now, I know why.

My ex and I have been living together for about a year out of financial necessity. She and the kids will be moving in with her mother for a little while in January.  I will be out of funds. I have no car. I know many will say I am selfish, but it's for the best. Both my kids are young. They will forget about me soon enough. My ex will surely get together with her boyfriend soon.

I haven't figured out yet how to exit this world. I must think of a way that will have the least amount of impact. Mainly, so my kids know as little as possible about my death. But also, because my life had little impact.

However, the guilt and sadness over possibly hurting my daughters is crushing my heart. 
I just had to write this, so I knew all I am feeling is real.

In the words of the awesome George Carlin, "Be Excellent to Each Other."
