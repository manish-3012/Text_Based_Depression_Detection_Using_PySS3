I officially have no reason to continue living anymoreI used to say I want to stay alive for my parents but im so out of it now not even they are enough for me to keep doing this, Im not close to them anymore and they fucked my childhood pretty bad. Anyways thats all I wanted to say, im just stuck in this limbo right now where im not doing anything meaningful with my life, or anything at all as a matter of fact.
