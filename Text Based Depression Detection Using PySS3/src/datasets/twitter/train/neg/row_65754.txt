I'm tired of lifeI tried to commit suicide two weeks ago from overdosing on my anxiety medication. I was in the hospital for 2-3 days and my heart rate was really low. I got out of the hospital and didn't feel any better. My mum died in November and my girlfriend of 4 months broke up with me. I don't have a job but I feel as though having that wouldn't make me any happier. Having money wouldn't change anything.

There was some stuff that I got from a film that kinda stuck out to me that was like "To love is to suffer.
To avoid suffering, one must not love.
But then one suffers from not loving.
Therefore, to love is to suffer.
Not to love is to suffer.
To suffer is to suffer.
To be happy is to love.
To be happy, then, is to suffer, but suffering makes one unhappy.". I thought that my one true dream is to have someone who truly loves me for who I am or when I'm depressed and whatever but it's not worth telling anyone how I feel because I wouldn't like to burden them with my problems. People tell me to go on dating sites or whatever to find someone but for true love, you won't have to search for it.

I want to sleep all the time, people think I'm lazy but I don't want to go through the monotony that is my life. I have friends who care about me and give a fuck but I push people away. My last girlfriend had crazy mood swings so I thought it wasn't worth it and it's hard being without my mum.

People in my family expect me to build a bridge and get the fuck over it but it's just not possible for me. I have some benzos and opiates and it should do the job but I just don't want people to give a fuck anymore. This isn't a cry for help or anything but I'm just tired of life, in general. I'm sorry.
