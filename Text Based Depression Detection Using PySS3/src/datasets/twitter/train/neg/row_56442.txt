What's the point of living? I have no reasonI'm just so alone.  Nothing ever goes right with me.  

Parents aren't all that close to me, brother isn't close either.  I just work and come home and waste time until I go to bed to repeat the cycle.  

No girlfriend, girls have never even been interested in me.  My coworkers all brag about girls they've had sex with and claim that they could call up a girl right now for sex if they wanted to.  I haven't even gotten a girl to give me her number in years.  And even then the conversation doesn't go anywhere and she always drops me.  

Tinder, okcupid, bumble, badoo, POF, you name it.  I'm on it and never get matches or replies.  It's like women don't even see me as a man.  

I have a college degree and nothing but debt to show for it.  I have been out for almost 2 years now and have sent out 100's of applications and haven't heard back from any.  

I'm just so tired these days.  I sleep for nearly 10 hours a night probably, more if I didn't have to wake up for work.  I have no drive to do anything anymore except barely get by at work.  I still live with my parents.  Have a ton of college debt.  Don't have a significant other to confide to.  No real skills or talents to speak of.  Ugly at best.  

Why go on?  Why suffer day after day to gain what?  There is nothing in life worth living for.  I just live to work and work to live.
