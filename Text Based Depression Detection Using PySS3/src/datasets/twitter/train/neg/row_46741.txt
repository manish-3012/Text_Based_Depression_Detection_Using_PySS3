Life is coolLife is cool. 

The ability for some forms of matter to come together and self-replicate in our universe is incredible.

Of most interest to me is the tendency of life to be in constant competition with itself. In this sense, the most reasonable thing that a lesser member of a species can do is remove themselves from the living. 

I am defective, incompetant, unable to contribute to the survival of the species. I'm better off as food or rotting fertilizer. 

Humans have a knack of turning instincts into abstract concepts (religion, civilization, family etc). Plenty will disagree with my reasoning. But at the end of the day we are all part of the same system and no one can escape it.

Bought a helium tank yesterday. Once I muster up the courage I'm gonna get the rest of the materials and go deep into the woods out of state. By the time they find me I'll have been picked clean by the beasts.
