Well, I had my first cry of 2018. Off to a great start.I live at home. Financially, it doesn't make sense for me to move out yet, so here I am. Generally I get along with my parents great, but they are obsessed with the organization of my bedroom. I shove my "mess" in my closet so it's out of the way and not an eyesore because according to them, my room isn't mine and it looks bad if guests come over. Fine, it's out of the way. Not their problem. My unorganized closet is my problem. I had a pile of clothes I was going to put away just shoved in there and today I come home and they're gone. They fucking threw them away. And they're shocked that I'm mad. They said they have every right to be upset because I'm "wrong" and I'm "living my life wrong" and I'm "never going to amount to anything" yeah cuz my fucking closet is messy.

I have a good job. I'm going to grad school soon. What the fuck.

I had a pretty good 2017. I had a great new year's eve. I come home to this bullshit and them criticizing me. I've been deeply depressed for more of my life and even though I have it almost completely in control, them calling me worthless and incompetent brings it all back.

It really makes me want it all to end. I know it sounds stupid, but my self worth is already so low that I don't care. It feels like they hate me and my existence is so bothersome to them they would throw my fucking clothes away. It's like they enjoy seeing me upset. I just don't want to exist anymore because to them it feels like I can't do anything right.
