Dishonored and Hopelessly Indebted - It's Time for Me to DieSo I'm an American medical student. Long story short, I failed an exam. I figured it was no big loss, and I would do better on the next upcoming one. I failed it too. And now I will either have to repeat the year, or face dismissal. Note that repeating the year will torpedo my residency chances anyways.

This will shock some European readers, but American students have to pay exorbitant sums of money to attend medical school. Thusfar, my debt total is about ~220K, including a (relatively) small sum of undergraduate debt.

I've sought help from tutors and psychiatrists, but it's never really helped. Word to any college students: Adderall is basically a sugar pill.

So yeah, it's time for me to die, I guess. I am hopelessly in debt and without a career in medicine, I have no means of servicing that debt. This is before I get to the point that I've pretty much dishonored myself and my family with my failure. People used to think of me as an intelligent and thoughtful guy, but let's be honest: after failing two exams, I don't think anyone can think of me as such.

I'm still working out the details, but even in the worst case scenario, I have a better chance at life in the next world, if it even exists. I had a good run on Earth, but it seems my luck's run out.
