The way the suicide hotline is advertised makes little senseItâ€™s almost comical how keywords/phrases are used to determine whether the suicide hotline pops up first in your google search or not. A search as simple and unthreatening as â€œI feel sadâ€ will yield the suicide prevention line as the automatic first result. Yet when I search â€œsuicide success rate of shotgun blast to the headâ€ it doesnâ€™t come up. I feel like thereâ€™s a fundamental misunderstanding there of who might be at higher risk for suicide.
