My stutter has ruined my life from young and i can't cope anymore, it ruined a chance i had with a girl.. :( &lt;/3Met a nice girl online even though she's in canada and i'm from UK, she really wanted to speak to me but i couldn't because of my stutter. Last wednesday we spoke for 20 seconds before there was an awkward silence because I couldn't speak anymore so she just hung up :(

We spoke on snapchat she removed me im wondering if you guys think I should re-add her and ask for another chance or something cuz if i knew she'd remove me i would've spoke to her man...

If I remove her on the account i typed to her with on snapchat then re-added her will our conversations still be there? i dont really want them to go tbh..

so ye this is just another thing that my stuttering has fucked up man and it's completely my fault she said my stuttering is cute and it doesn't bother her but i just couldn't do anything... i am pathetic... :'( it's not like she stopped talking to me because of the stutter, she stopped because i wouldn't talk to her... :/

what do i do how do i cope with this stutter constantly fucking me up?
