My friend is suicidal and I'm afraidMy friend has been depressed for years. I have tried to help them and always be there for them, but it just got too hard on me. After many scary encounters and messages from this person, I began to fear for my own well-being. 

Now my friend is showing all the signs of someone with mental illness. I don't want to be the person that has to intervene but nobody else seems to notice.

I don't know what to do.
