I'll probably be a hobo without any contribution to society.Title.

I'm an underachieving 18 year old with no desire to finish high school, go to college or get a job. Rather, I can't see myself jumping through the endless hoops and mountains of paperwork.

Doesn't help that I reject the idea of slaving away for some faceless higher-up, so that he or she can buy a new villa in Hollywood. I want to write books and make music, repair people's devices, offer counseling to troubled kids. Don't even want money. Just want to have enough to survive. But nothing is free, and for good reason.

Total academic failure. Used to be a straight-A student. Guess I got burned out. Most days, I want to be left alone to scavenge until I eventually pass away in my sleep. I know I'll never be anything.
