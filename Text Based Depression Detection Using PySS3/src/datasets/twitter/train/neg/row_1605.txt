i donâ€™t fit in anywhereive been thinking about how isolated and alone i feel. im a junior in high school rn. i have lots of acquaintances that Iâ€™ve never talked to outside of class/school, and i have a few â€œfriendsâ€ that i do hang out with every now and then, but im not close with any of them at all.

its a pretty mix-matched group, two of the kids are pretty popular and have lots of friends, the other two are kind of nerdy/geeky, but we still all have fun when we hangout despite our differences.

im somewhere in between. id consider myself pretty smart and love learning and stuff, but i guess i can come off as a cool or chill dude too. i crack jokes with popular kids, and can have â€œsmartâ€ conversations with the not so popular kids. im nice to everyone, i donâ€™t care where you lie in the social ranking, as long ass you arenâ€™t a dick to me.

for the most part tho, i tend not to be friends with popular kids as most of them are douchebags and im really shy anyway. i usually talk to this one group of stoners, as they arenâ€™t really popular, but definitely arenâ€™t nerdy either.

im kind of rambling at this point, but what im trying to say is pretty much that i feel like im too â€œcoolâ€ for the nerdy kids, they dislike me because i hangout with people that they donâ€™t like, and make the assumption that im douchy as well, and i donâ€™t fit in with the cool kids either, as im too awkward and nerdy and donâ€™t make fun of other kids with them. the way i see the groups at my school would be: the stick up rich kids who are just complete assholes to everyone for no reason, and the extremely overly nerdy/weird no-it-all kids (no offense to them, i donâ€™t dislike them BECAUSE they are nerdy, we just tend to not have compatible personalityâ€™s,  and canâ€™t bond over anything)

i just feel like i donâ€™t belong anywhere. im an outcast. no one has the same humor as me, besides my friend in California that ive known my whole life. heâ€™s the closest friend i have, and heâ€™s the only friend i have that i can just be my complete self too. but heâ€™s on the other side of the US, i moved to Florida a few years ago. we still communicate often by playing video games together. i wish i knew kids over here in Florida with the same type of personality and passions that we do.

its like im a jack of all trades, but not good enough in either group to stick around or make meaningful relationships.

TL;DR,  im an outcast at my school. i feel like Iâ€™m to cool for the nerdy kids, and too nerdy for the cool kids, i can fit in / blend in with either group, but we arenâ€™t similar enough to make, or WANT to make, any kind of meaningful relationship. its like no one at school interests me, and im not interesting to them either.
