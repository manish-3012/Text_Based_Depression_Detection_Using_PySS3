Ready to go - how to stop family from having funeralIt's time to give up.  My family have been such assholes, and I can't stand the thought of them using my death to garner a bunch of sympathies.  They've pushed me to this, know I'm there, and won't do anything to help.  I don't want them posting gofundme and making money off what they've done to me.  

Edit:  There has to be a way.  whether it's going out so gruesomely that they can't identify my body or maybe a lawyer or something.  I guess he'd do something to stop you, too.
