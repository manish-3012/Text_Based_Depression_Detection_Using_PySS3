Is suicide ok?Im not happy with life anymore and I've tried everything. There's so much unhappiness that it outweighs the good in life. I came really close today but I figured I should give reddit a try and see if someone experienced could help. Psychiatrists don't really help too much and I've tried everything but this. Any way to get these suicidal thoughts out of my head?
