I need helpI don't know how much more I can handle..i'm sick of feeling like i'm not worthy of anyones time its a horrible thing to think about every second of the day. I'm scared of death but its looking like a better option than the pain  I feel everyday. I'm starting to regret what I just did though. I don't want to die but applying so much pressure isn't helping i'm starting to get very woozy. I need help.
