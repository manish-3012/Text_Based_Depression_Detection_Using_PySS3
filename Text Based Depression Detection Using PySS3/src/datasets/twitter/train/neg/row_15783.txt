I Don't UnderstandI don't understand how after surviving years of abuse I could find people who love me. I don't understand how after finding these people, I've wanted nothing more than to kill myself. I don't understand how the pain and fear always wins out over love. I don't understand why I feel the way I do. I have a boyfriend who loves me and a family who cares yet I would throw it all away just so that I didn't have to wake up tomorrow feeling emptier than I did today. Everybody says that I'll get through it, that I'm strong and will make it but they don't know what it's like. I don't want to be strong. I don't want to get through it. I don't want to survive this. Every day I live is another day of unending pain and fear. And yet I'm too afraid to end it. My entire life is filled with fear and I don't want it anymore.
