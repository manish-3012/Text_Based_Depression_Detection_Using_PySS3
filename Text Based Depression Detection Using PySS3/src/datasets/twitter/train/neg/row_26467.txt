I hope this is the right place to post thisI'm not sure if I'm right here (I'm very drunk ngl) but I hope I am?

  


  


I just wanna knwow what the point of being alive is lmao

  


I've been suicidal since I was 11 years old. I've been to two

different mental hospitals twice each (four times admitted in total)

I've been to regukar therapy for 9yrs straight

  


And it didn't get better. It got *worse*

  


I haven't had a real life friend in six years

  


I've never had a date let alone a relationship

  


What's the point? What am I alive for?

  


I feel guilty bc I *do* get support but it's not what I need to make life feel worth it

  


I don't want people hanging out with me and talking to me because they're paid to. I might as well be alone

  


So I'm still as suicidal as I felt without it

  


What's the point if I can't ger a single person in six years to like me enough to even text me
