M/20My life isn't going anywhere, I recently resigned from a good job (my other alternative was being fired), have no college education, have no true discernible skills, and no true support. I've always been uncomfortable in my own skin. Ever since I was a little boy I remember hating things about myself. I'm not sure where I'm going with this. I guess I'm just not supposed to be here, it honestly doesn't make sense for me to be here anymore. Recently I've become more comfortable with the idea of suicide. I used to be afraid of it, but now it seems like the only true control I have left of my life is to end it. I'm not saying I'm going to but the thought is there, and it's strong.
