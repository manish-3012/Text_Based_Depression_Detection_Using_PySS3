Sick of the struggleSo, things are getting harder and harder, 3 years ago my brother hung himself, there has been other tragedies too but this is by far the biggest one, I have been in a+e 3 times in the last 4 months for cutting, I have tried so many medications over the years and never really had any professional help, I have lost several jobs due to my illness EUPD or BPD (as the Americans know it) i currently have daily visits at home from the hospital psych team, I actually get joy from cutting myself watching the blood flow it is I guess what I can only describe as obsession, I have a grand total of 1 friend, I dont really leave my house except work I cant even entertain the thought of going out alone im physically sick at the prospect, I am pretty sure I am being cheated on too, I just want to be with my brother, the only person who loves me us not even a person, it is my German Shepherd and as it stands he is the ONLY reason I'm here, I have supplies and have several different effective methods to use, I guess the only reason I am posting here because there is obviously something within that wants me to stay but can't for the life of me think what it is? I know I am a burden and my family don't speak to me because of my issues, just dont know what I'm supposed to do, help me please.
