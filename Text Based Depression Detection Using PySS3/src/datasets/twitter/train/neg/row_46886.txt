Asperger's and suicideIs there anyone who feels like dying because of loneliness caused by social stigma, or failed relationships?

Has anyone watched the TedTalks on youtube of Daniel Wendler?
Has it helped anyone? Especially the level up book for gamers on the improveyoursocialskills site?

If so, how long did it take to assimilate his teachings? Is it possible to do this without one on one?

Just asking...what has your experience been.
