RockbottomEver since being diagnosed with Bipolar 1 disorder I feel like my life has slowly caved in on itself: My crush blocked me â€” although to be fair thatâ€™s on me, my hobbies donâ€™t work without alcohol which I cannot have, my work which is my lifeâ€™s passion I cannot do for some indeterminate amount of time, and I cannot drive until Iâ€™ve adapted to my latest medication. That last bit robbed me of the last enjoyable thing Iâ€™ve had for the time being. Now itâ€™s just 16 hours a day of not wanting to do anything.
