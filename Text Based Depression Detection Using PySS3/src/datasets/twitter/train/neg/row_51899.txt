Feel like people just like to talk down to meI constantly feel like people are looking down on me. I feel like a lot of interactions I've had with people I feel like they were looking down on me and talking down to me. It drives me crazy thinning about it and I get really angry. I just keep having thoughts go through my head of people talking down to me.
