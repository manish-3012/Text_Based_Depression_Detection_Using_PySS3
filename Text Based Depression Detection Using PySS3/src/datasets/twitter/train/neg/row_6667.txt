I feel like itâ€™s the only solution but everytime I keep telling myself to go on and eventually things are gonna get better, but they donâ€™tSuicidal from when I was 11, 3 attempts in total at this day, and Iâ€™m scared the fourth would be the last, I grew up and now I know exactly how to do it with the least chance of surviving, whatâ€™s stopping me? Hope 

Hope that things will change someday, hope that at least something important will finally go well, but it never does, and just when I fell like I have nothing to do anymore, suddenly something appears, like an objective in life, family, relationships or literally anything that can keep me focused on living that could potentially go well, but they donâ€™t, even if I try the hardest I can because I WANT to live, I even want to live with compromises like not having a real family or just people who really care about me, even if I have to live with a neurodegenerative disease, even if I will find a poor job and just basically survive for the rest of my life, Iâ€™ve come to these compromises and more but it just goes worse and worse 

Iâ€™m wrote this only to vent a little bit, if you read all of this and want to ask me something like details do it, I feel better when confiding myself to someone I donâ€™t know
