Not much longer now.I came here on my main account and she got mad, I now have only one person in the world to talk to. But it isn't enough.

I tried NC and failed after 1 day. I tried being civil and emotionaly tortured her for three weeks. I am trying to be nice but I just want her back.

She is the one person in the world that I am unable to manipulate in to doing what i want. She is the one person in the world, apart from my mum, that I have ever cared for. She is the one person who was able to make me feel happy. I was the one person who was able to make her happy.

But now we aren't together and I spend most nights drunk. I don't go to uni, I don't go out, I don't give a shit about anything but her and she doesn't want me because of what I almost did to her. 

It's all my fault and I just want the pain to stop.

Please come back babe, please be mine again.

And if not, we both know what is going to happen.

I can't take the pain much longer.

It's almost time to turn off the lights and go to sleep.
