I want March to endI am gonna delete this post at the start of April as I am quite senstive. Writing this with shaky hands on a phone, apologies for a sloppy wall of shit.
I'm 15. Despite having extremely caring and loving parents, I am a fuckup. In 10 days I am about to have my 9th grade exams that will get me into college, I haven't been to school since 3 months, me, a first division topper out of more than 500 students - fuck it I guess. My dad's sides family is huge and they all have a nice history of school and college. They all treat me amazing and trust on me to get high marks, reminding of my fucking school and studies everytime on a gathering, considering the fact I havent touched any of my books in ages - it scares the shit out of me. I am so so trapped, I have sleepless nights of voices in my head and thoughts about the upcoming days. Its all dark and I cant go a single day without thinking of suicide. My brother curses on me, reminds me of the exams and gives me bad luck wishes, I am used to it so I dont care. Parents care a lot about me and have a lot of tension for me but, they kind of know how I feel. I dont have any friends to talk this out. I do have online bestfriends of 6 years but they themselves are fucked. Helped all of them get through their past tough times. being extremely thankful - 0 shits given to me. Unlucky I guess.

Its too late to study now, cannot recover within 10 days, no support, no nothing. I am quite religious and a strong believer, guess all I can do is go nights wihout sleep, praying and hope for the best. Not quite into girls for now, but I do have a crush... No marks, no crush. 

Please give me advice on how to go through this fucking month and the days before my result day (mid August). Its getting closer and I'm getting damaged to an extent I wont be alive, help. I am really scared
