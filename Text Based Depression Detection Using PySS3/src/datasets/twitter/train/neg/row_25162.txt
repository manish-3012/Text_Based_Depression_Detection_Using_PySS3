time to restart the dayI have had ptsd nightmares again two nights in a row, which can be normal depending on the week. I woke up to bugs all over the kitchen that were not there last night, and my roommate threw out trash in the recycling so I had to go through the bins and get my hands covered in trash because nobody apparently knows how to do anything. My glasses broke as I was getting dressed, the frame just completely snapped. I have a final paper due today in my summer class. These things are so fucking small, and they shouldn't upset me, but i'm sitting here in an empty disgusting house and I don't want to talk to anyone or be here. I am so alone. I am so tired of having to clean up everyone's messes. I feel like I am holding up the weight of the world and its not even noon yet. Just once i'd like things to be easy.

and i'm so sick of empty 'i'm sorrys" or "ok hope you feel better" when I verbalize to people what's going on. you know what would actually fucking help? something tangible like someone ELSE going through the trash or editing my paper or something. it's hard to deal with lifes bullshit when I can't even get peace in my sleep. I have nightmares all the fucking time and all that would help is therapy that I can't afford. how is any of this going to ever go away? i'm convinced i'll be this depressed forever.  


I'm tired of immediately wanting to hurt myself when I can't cope. I'm tired of wanting to die because nobody in the world actually knows how to "help" me. its not that fucking hard. Why is it like I'm talking to an empty void half the time and why is it that the world hates me. I work my ass off every day but I haven't found a purpose or a reason for me to push myself this hard. next time i'll let other people deal with it I guess. it's just not fair.
