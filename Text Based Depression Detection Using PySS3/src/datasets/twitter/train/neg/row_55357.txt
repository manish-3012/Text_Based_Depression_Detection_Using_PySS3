These thoughts won't go awaySince my high school years (about 3 years ago maybe?) I have always been this depressed. At the time it wasn't too much, it was just being sad for a very long time because I had not have any friends only at least 1.

Till about late December 2014 until now Iv'e had these ongoing thoughts of committing suicide, I can't stop thinking about it, every minute of the day, all I can think about is how I'm going to do it, I do have one in mind though. I don't think people notice what I'm about to do at some point.

I seem really nervous of when It will happen, I feel like I don't have long to live.

As a side note, I met someone during a co-op multi player online game about 2 years ago, since that day we met we've been talking on Skype together nearly every single day, we became best friends I guess you could say, he is around my age (im 19 btw). We talk about everything really. He was someone I could only trust.

At the point of December I discussed with him what I was going through, the depression, suicidal thoughts, family problems, because he is the only person I can tell who will listen to me. We chat on Skype a few times for a few nights to have a talk about what my situation was. He actually helped me through it after 2 weeks or so. But now it has come to me again, the suicidal thoughts, bad memories from the past, parents divorced.

All I'm saying is, if I keep living like this for the next few weeks I will end up committing suicide.

Btw I'm a Taylor Swift fan, I listen to her music when i'm feeling down.

Someone please respond.
