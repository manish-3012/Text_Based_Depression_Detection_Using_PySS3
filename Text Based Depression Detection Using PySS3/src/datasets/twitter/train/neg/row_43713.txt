I'm tried of living.I'm tired of having no community to belong to, being alone, watching everyone around me have friends and people who give a shit. I don't have any friends, I have a fiance an ocean away. I spend every waking moment alone besides typing back and fourth with him. I don't have any friends who care about how I feel. I dont belong anywhere. Even at my work on the 5 to 10 minutes a day where I talk to some one I'm disliked. I want to kill myself, I promised my partner I wouldn't till he visited me but honestly nothing will change its always been this way. I just want friends and a place I belong.
