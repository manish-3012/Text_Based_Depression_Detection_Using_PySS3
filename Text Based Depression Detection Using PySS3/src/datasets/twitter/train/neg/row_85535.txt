I seem to have it all but still donâ€™t want to liveI have been depressed and socially anxious since I was 13. I used to keep myself going by thinking things will get better when I reach the next stage of my life or when I accomplish this and that. Now Iâ€™m 23 and I realize Iâ€™ll always be depressed. 

I work in the most prestigious company in my field and Iâ€™m not happy at all. My coworkers are the nicest people in the world but Iâ€™m feeling anxious all the time. People tell me Iâ€™m pretty but they leave me after they find out I have the personality of a dry rock. I have friends but no ones seem to care enough. I have loving parents and they are the only reason keeping me from offing myself but still itâ€™s getting harder and harder everyday.

I cry myself to sleep everyday. I just canâ€™t take the rollercoaster anymore. Nothing brings me joy but even the slightest impatience in someoneâ€™s tone would put me on the downward spiral.

Today is the first time I searched for â€œeasiest way to dieâ€ in a long time. I wish all the pain will end soon.
