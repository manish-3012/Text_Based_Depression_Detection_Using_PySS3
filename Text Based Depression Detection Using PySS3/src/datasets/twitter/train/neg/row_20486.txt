â€œYouâ€™re 15, youâ€™re so young, why would you want to?â€ And to that I say the crushing dread of the futility of happiness has set in and I donâ€™t want to have to go through that. Let me be, itâ€™s my choice.The reason I wanted to do this was because of the hopeless world we live in. Iâ€™ve gotten an understanding of the misery that we live through for the slightest bits of happiness amidst an unforgiving world. Itâ€™s well hidden but sometimes when you have your head in the clouds you see the storm on the horizon.

A futile existence chasing happiness through an insurmountable heap of excruciating pain and zero gain. We are sold a lie at a young age that there is a good kind loving world where we arenâ€™t going to live day to day, hour to hour, Advil to Advil wondering if it gets better. It really doesnâ€™t.

Work until you die chasing money so we can support ourselves so we can live only long enough to die sad alone and with a total lack of reason to go on. Iâ€™m stranded in a sea of doubt and the waters are rising fast. Iâ€™m in a steep dive and the hard truth is coming ever closer. Iâ€™m not okay with how ready I am for death but I canâ€™t make it happen. 

I do a lot of things and I always seem to be so close to dying but it never happens. Failing aircraft landing gear, almost mauled by mountain lion, an explosive mishap on a military base tour, forest fire, tornado (6) and toxic fumes yet IM NOT DEAD. Fate is a cruel mistress.

The only reason I havenâ€™t done it yet is because I think â€œitâ€™s shit, lets just end itâ€ but then â€œwhat if it gets better soon?â€ Then â€œitâ€™s been so many years, it wonâ€™t get betterâ€ but I always settle on the thought that â€œitâ€™s been long enough, it has to get better soon!â€ And thatâ€™s the thing keeping me here today.

I donâ€™t know if I need help or if Iâ€™m ranting but I feel like the existential dread is setting in and I think I might be ready. The water is rising above my head, I canâ€™t pull out of the stall, I canâ€™t dodge the bullet, I canâ€™t get to shelter, I canâ€™t run and I canâ€™t hide.
