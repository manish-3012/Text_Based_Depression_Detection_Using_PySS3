Does it matter that I think about killing myself a lot if 
I know I would never act on it?I don't know if I should mention it to my psychiatrist or my counselor. I don't want to sound like I'm just looking for attention. 

It hurts when I think about wanting to die but I don't know if it's something I should bother to resolve if they're just thoughts. What am I going to say? That I wish I was dead but I won't do anything about it? It sounds so trivial, like it isn't even an issue, though I know that I would never say the same thing to someone else was having the same problem. I hate the idea of getting help for something that might not even be important to anyone else.
