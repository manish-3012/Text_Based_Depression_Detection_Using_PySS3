my alcoholic mother is relapsingim only 16 yet everyday i have to take care of her, her husband is 3000 miles away in a foreign job. all she has to do is sit down and watch the walking dead; no wonder she's relapsing. tonight i noticed something was odd and asked her, she obviously said she wasnt drinking. so i look where i found the last bottle, and find a spilled bottle of alcohol in the laundry basket. i immediately broke down and let her watch me yell and throw the bottle around. she showed no emotion and just wanted to sleep. i'm just in my room and have no idea what to do anymore. i feel as if i tried everything in my ability to help her. i don't know where i'm going with this but i just know it doesn't look good..
