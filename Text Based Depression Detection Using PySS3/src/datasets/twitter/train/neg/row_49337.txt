JelouI don't even know how to start this thing. My english isn't the best one so maybe you will find some things that just doesn't make sense (?) I don't know. 

First thing I want to explain: I dont't want to die and go to the next life just to find eternal peace/galactic pain and all of that, I just want to stop existing for a long ammount of time. 

If I'm gonna be honest with you, people that I have never know in my entire life, and with myself, person that I honestly don't know, I don't understand myself. There are so many things that makes me happy but there are these little things that makes me want to stop existing. Loss is the principal. I'm just a confused guy that don't know how to get over the bad things that have happend to me and how to embrace life, live the moment and just kiss and hug with a happiness that I know I should be able to give, not one that I crawl to recieve.

I want to say so many things but I really don't know how to say them in english and I just don't want to go and translate it all. I just want to expose the surface of what is happening in my mind.

Love you guys and I really hope that all of you who are going through bad moments in their life get over them and fuck them and be as happy as all of us know that people deserve to be. Goodnight.
