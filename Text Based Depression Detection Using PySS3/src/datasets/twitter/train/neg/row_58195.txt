If I don't end up in foster care I'm gonna kill myselfMy mother forced me and my brother to move to Finland from Norway half a year ago, and it's been absolutely he'll.  I hate it here and I've told her so many times that I wanna leave, and she just replies with "go move to your father then". Issue is I hate my father. He wasn't there for my early childhood and honestly he's a selfish prick. My mother decided for us to travel to Norway for christmas specifically the 20th and the return date is 4th of January. My friend told me before we moved that I should go into foster care and that his family will happily foster me, but I didn't listen. I'm now going to attempt to get into foster care in 2 weeks and if I don't manage for some reason I will kill myself. Probably some sort of OD. 
I won't set another step in finland with my mother, I hate it and I hate her, but most of all I hate myself.
