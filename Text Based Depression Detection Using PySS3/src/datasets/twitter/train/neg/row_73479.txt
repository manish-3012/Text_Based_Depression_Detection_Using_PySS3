I can't imagine a bigger piece of shit than myself.My family loves me and has done literally every single fucking thing they could possibly do to help me. These people are fucking angels to put up with my bullshit. Despite all this I've only managed to convert a fucking biomedical engineering degree from a renowned school into a fucking cashier job at a grocery store. I'm just wondering what I can do at this point to minimize the pain they will feel when I end up killing myself in the next few weeks?
