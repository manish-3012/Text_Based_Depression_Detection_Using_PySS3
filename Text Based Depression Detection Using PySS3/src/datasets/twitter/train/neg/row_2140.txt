The possibility of committing suicide is bigger than I thoughtI used to think I could never be capable of suicide, no matter how much I suffered. There were too many possibilities and steps I would need to take to even consider it. I feared I would wake up in a hospital and, everyone would know I tried to kill myself. I feared not succeeding and act as if nothing happened. I thought one suicide note wouldn't be enough to explain everything and provide closure for people. So I would write individual ones to the people who need it the most. By my standards, it was more trouble than it was worth. 

  But now, those don't seem to matter anymore. I can't cry on my own so, I write suicide notes to make me cry for a release. I become so overwhelmed by negative thoughts that I would do anything to make them stop. I stopped self-harming for 4 years and, I recently relapsed to lift some of my emotional burdens. Last time I made myself stop on my own but, I don't think I can do that again. My impulsivity is out of control. I constantly have the urge to hurt myself and, in those moments suicide doesn't seem so far out of reach. The thought of not waking up the next day seems like a blessing. I am terrified of myself and what I might do. I am hoping I can get through this again on my own, but I am so exhausted. 

 I know I should talk to someone, but I am ashamed of myself. I don't want anyone in my personal life, knowing how much I am struggling. I guess it is the fear of them seeing me differently or being brushed off for being dramatic. I was in clinical counselling at my university for a few weeks, but that was only supposed to be short term. I'm just trapped.
