Where does it lead?So I have reached a point in my life where nothing is certain, and I have no idea where I'm heading. I don't have goals or any aims to reach for, and don't see much difference between this day, the next, or the last. So where does it lead, what's the point? I love my friends and I love being around them, but once this year is up chances are I'll never see any of them again, or ever even talk to them again, and we will all just drift away. The thought of that is just appalling to me, and it's the sort of thing that I can't talk to anyone I know personally about since they won't take me seriously since I'm the one who's usually smiling around them. They don't see me as sad, because they've never seen me alone. I guess it all just boils down to me being afraid of ending up alone, and I just don't know where to go from here.
