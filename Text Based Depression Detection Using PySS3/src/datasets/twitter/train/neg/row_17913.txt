The PlanMom wants me to leave. Sister wonâ€™t return my texts. No friends. No job. No money. No future.

So, hereâ€™s the plan: Iâ€™m going to mix vodka with extra strength energy drinks tonight, maybe some 5-Hour Energy too, and get my heart going good and fast. Then Iâ€™m going to stumble out in the cold - itâ€™s only just above freezing here - and rain and hide in the woods where I will take a megadose of ephedrine. That should be enough to give myself a fatal heart attack or stroke. Hopefully, my body wonâ€™t be found and my family will be spared the expense of a funeral.

Goodbye all.
