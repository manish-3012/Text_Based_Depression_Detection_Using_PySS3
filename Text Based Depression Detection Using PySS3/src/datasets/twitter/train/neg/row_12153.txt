UpdateSo I tried to od on alcohol and xanax last night which didn't work, just wome up in a puddle of puke and feeling like shit. The only other thing I have that I could od on is Tylenol so I'm gonna take about 10 of the extra strength pills. That should do it, a long with a fifth of whiskey. I'm not stupid, I know its gonna hurt and be a long painful death but shit my only other option is jumping off of something, and there's a greater chance I would survive that/get caught on a roof so this is it guys. I'm grateful for all of you who've kept me alive this long. I'm not gonna go through my story again, I'll just link it. But yall keep fighting the good fight for me, and dont remember me as the guy who died a tragic death, but rather as someone who fought a war and lost. Thank you
