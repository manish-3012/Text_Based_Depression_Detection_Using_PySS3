I can't do it anymore, life is too hard and I am incapable of handling it and I don't want to. How to tell family it's not their fault before I leave?They tried and did so much for me,  and it's not their fault I don't want to work hard anymore and deal with this world.  I had always hoped I would be better then my grandfather who also gave up from stress and alcohol and put a gun to his head, but I have same problems and I have no point being here anymore and taking up space on this planet. I failed, someone more deserving should take my place.
