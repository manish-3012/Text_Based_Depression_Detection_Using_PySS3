I'm still alive.2 years ago I was in a really bad, dark place and posted to this group. I failed at taking my life after my last post here and while I still deal with depression and chronic illness today, I'm glad I didn't succeed at it. I don't use this profile anymore, but saw an old message from on here when I got on it tonight and thought I would let you guys know I was still around. Anyways, cheers.
