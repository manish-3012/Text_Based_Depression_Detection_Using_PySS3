â€œHopeâ€ and â€œpatienceâ€ how these words makes things worstHad a breakup 4 months ago and I realized that was pretty much the final nail in the coffin for me. I been struggling with disappointment after disappointment since my high school days (Iâ€™m 30 now) and clinging on to this word â€œhopeâ€ has made things drawn out for me. 

They say be patient and and rely on hope but man I canâ€™t do it anymore. Iâ€™m fed up of relationships/flings that are just bandages, hanging with friends cool but as soon as I get home the pain comes back. 

My ex tells me she wishes things ended differently but doesnâ€™t want to work it out. I try to get it to work. But I can tell from her responses and lack Therof sheâ€™s telling me â€œlol get over it manâ€ 

Seeing other women donâ€™t help either if anything it makes the pain worst. Regrets of past decisions. My last breakup. And just trying to tell myself things will get better for more than a decade is getting exhausting. Iâ€™m seriously over life 

TRIGGER WARNING
The thoughts of going to the local gun shop to buy a handgun is becoming more realistic for me. The idea of knowing I wonâ€™t have to hope or be patient anymore is making me feel more at peace. Iâ€™ve already got a plan written out and I swear one more disappointment and Iâ€™m done. I seriously donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll make it to next year
