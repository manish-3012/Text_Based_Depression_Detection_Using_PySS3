I no longer feel happinessI wanna starr this by saying my life hasn't been bad, of course i've been through different tragedies, but i've gotten through them fairly unscathed. I have a loving family, a wonderful girlfriend, and well i'm not doing the best financially, i'm also not gonna be homeless any time soon.....but for some reason, i am unhappy, i barely smile, some days i overear, others i don't eat at all...i sleep all day, sometimes not waking up until after 3 pm...i haven't cried...and i hardly even feel mad...just either emptiness or unending pain. I've tried therapy and that just made me feel worse, i'm on antidepressants, and i'm not sure if they're helping or not, but if i stop taking them i get sick...sometimes i feel like i don't even exist anymore...i've stopped talking to most of my friends except a few that refuse to leave me alone....the only thing that really brings me joy is the thought of my own death
