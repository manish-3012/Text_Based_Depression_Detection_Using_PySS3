How to deal with knowing everything you want is impossible?I donâ€™t want to live in part because of depression and in part because of defeat. Iâ€™m realistic about my life, I know the chances of me ever having friends or a romantic partner are zero. I wonâ€™t have a decent amount of money or the career I want. I just exist with nothing but pain and failure. Whatâ€™s the point of just sticking out misery when you know nothingâ€™s at the other end?
