Friends and family vs youHow is it fair that we, people who are already depressed, are forced to think about how other people will feel when we take our lives? Everyone always says â€œWhat about your parents or your best friend?â€ What about them? They live what looks like a healthy happy life, I am living each day by a thread with no direction and no more options to happiness? I have my own pain to look out for, but suicide prevention tells us to think about how other people will feel when we are gone.
