I just feel stuck.I only have a few people in my life who are really there for me and I'm quickly losing everyone. I just don't know what to do. It's so aggravating. I got on antidepressants and a dose that was working for me and I felt so great. Not perfect, but better than I had in a long time. A lot of people kept saying how I was still so unhappy and negative, but I ignored them because I knew they were wrong. I was being more positive than most and the happiest I had literally ever been. I didn't have insurance though and could no longer afford the birth control I was on. So my doctor prescribed me one that is VERY high estrogen (which was never good for me in the past), but it was the only one I could afford, so I decided to use it. I feel like I'm completely back to square one. I'm hormonal, becoming very unhappy with my body (which used to be the only thing I liked about myself), and I'm just as depressed as I was before I got on my antidepressants. I was hoping that it was just because I had pregnancy hormones in me, plus depression, plus my birth control, but my pregnancy hormones should be gone by now, so I know now it's not them.

Just not sure what to do. Not being on birth control is not an option, but this is all I can afford. I can't afford a counselor right now, but I'm working really hard on getting insurance through work. My boss is trying to give me enough hours to get it. Then I can get into talk therapy and get the birth control I used to be on. I feel like I have to deal with it until then. It's making all of my friends exasperated and I know they are getting sick of it. They care about me, but I don't want to be a burden on anyone anymore and all of this is ruining my relationship with everyone. I've been the best friend that I can be, but I feel like I still haven't given back to anyone and it would just be easier for everyone if I wasn't here. I just don't know what I'd do if I lost my best friends and boyfriend.
