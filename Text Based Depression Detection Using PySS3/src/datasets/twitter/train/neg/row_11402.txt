Give me one good reason to livehere are my problems:
1) I am chubby and have pear shaped even though no one in my family history has ever been fat.I workout so much but my weight doesn't seem to decrease.My thighs and hips are wide like that of a fat women and I feel embarrassed to go out or have any social interaction.
2) My father is 6ft tall and im only 5'10.Every male in my family circle is around 6ft tall except me.
3) I have tight penis skin and i have problem retracting my skin.I cant have sex with such penis.
4)I have pimples all over my face and they disappear when i take medicine but reappear as soon as i stop it.The medicine is very costly and i dont understand why i have pimples when no one in my family is having it.
5)I am shy of public speaking.I cant talk in front of an audience.I cant talk to girls,i get nervous in front of them.I never had any girlfriend and my cousins always taunt me and show me their girlfriends pictures.
6) I had gynecomastia but recently i took surgery for it so this problem is off my list but its worth mentioning that i had man boobs for almost 6 years.
7)Im jobless.
8)Im not good in studies. I forget very quickly.My percentage in college is below 60% and i cant sit for any good companies. Im fat so im also not good in sports.

I feel like a complete loser.I am no better than a completely paralytic person....useless. The reason i have not committed suicide is that i love my mother and i cant imagine what would happen to her if i die.
So i would like to ask you pundits what you think of my problems and what should i do.
