15 yo and close to the unimaginableHey, I'm 15 and I just joined this sub reddit, suicide is something that plagues my mind on a day to day basis and recently I have begun haveing homicidal thoughts towards my family, school, and loved ones. I have turned to a multitude of drugs to block the Pain including weed, LSD, meth, hydras, coke, adderal. I used to have dream of joining the marines but after years of my parents yelling at me that i will be nothing if I enlist I have basically given up on that dream. I am to afraid to ask my parents to seek help for my depression because my parents do not believe depression is real, they believe its a figment of our imagination. 

 I remember leaving a loaded gun under my pillow so that when I went to school I had security in knowing there's a way out. Being bipolar is even worse, I used to be happy in class and a sudden feeling of emptiness would come over me. I usually would just go to the corner, lay down, and blankly stair at the roof. I remember one day when a bunch of people started to notice what I was going through and they came over to talk to me. instead of finally getting help I told them all to fuck off, I didn't want to, I just did. None of those people ever came back, I think that was one of the biggest regrets I ever had. Slowly over the years I have back myself into a corner, pushing friends and family away, I have no close and meaningful friends left and have lost most of my social skills The only real friend I still have moves away in a couple of weeks and I'm afraid of what going to happen to me without him.
