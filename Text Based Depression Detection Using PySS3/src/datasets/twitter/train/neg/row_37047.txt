You all are so kind but it isn't enough anymore.I have wondered what was on the other side for a long time. My thoughts started off with just curiosity then it progressed into a mixture of curiosity and personal problems. I have said my goodbyes and I wanted to share my last thoughts so that people will know what was wrong. Reddit was like a home with loving,accepting,and selfless people. So I want to spend my last few minutes at home. At 9:04 am with a bottle of 10mg hydrocodone and a razor I finally end this hell.... Goodbye
