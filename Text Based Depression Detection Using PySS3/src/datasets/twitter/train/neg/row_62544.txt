Update. Today, I went to the hospital with a terrible migraine after being extremely depressed.I think my body is preparing itself. I can't sleep, my leg s are numb, my stomach is churning and burning and all I want to do is cry. My hands are cold and sweating, and my mouth is dry. The headaches are back too. I've taken 4 migraine pils and a lortab today and got no sleep. How do I stop this....i don't know if I'm going to finish this night...i don't know what is going on. I've never felt myself fall apart completely until now...for those of you wishing for death, find someway to get help. If youre at the beginning stages of depression talk to somebody. Do something. This is hell. You are all holding the potential to become amazing people in the future. Please get help, I hate knowing that I am not the only one laying in bed right now, feeling my body let go. Nobody should have to feel this way. Nobody. Ever. Im begging you, take your life seriously and find a helper. Get somebody to help you before it's too late. please...just talk to somebody, a stranger, a friend, somebody....please...

And just so you all know, r/suicidewatch is the sole reason I am not dead right now, reading all your stories, trying to help as many of you as I can, that kept me going. You are the reason that one more pathetic life is here. You have the most beautiful minds, the.most radiant should, and as I grow more delusional, I realize how beautiful the world is and how bad I don't want to leave this beautiful world. Thank you for listening to my last few thoughts...i can only pray to whatever god there is that I'll wake up soon...in a warm bed...next to him and realize this was a dream...if I live through the last few hours of the night, I'm going to get help.

EDIT: I survived...unfortunately...i'm making a plan to try again for my birthday which is next month.
