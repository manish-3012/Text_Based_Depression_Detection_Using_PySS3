I will never find loveI have ASD. Specifically Asperger's and more on the Autism spectrum. It affects me in serious ways, mostly in how I need prompting for basic hygene upkeep: brushing my teeth, taking my medications, laundry, and the like. If left to my own devices my autism causes me to basically self destruct. I was left alone last weekend and I ended up getting sick because I stayed up so long and didn't get enough sleep.

Then there's the social anxiety that results from this. Nobody wants anything to do with me, especially since my ASD hinders me from taking complete care of myself. Who the hell wants to be in a relationship with someone who needs to be reminded of basic life upkeep? I am gonna die alone. All of this makes me wonder why I don't end things here and now. And I have no answers for that.
