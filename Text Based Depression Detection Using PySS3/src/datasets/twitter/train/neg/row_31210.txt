Question About SuicideSuicide is constantly on my mind and has been for about the past year. I got help for my depression about a month ago. I realized I needed help when I had spent the whole day looking for my Mom's xanax to OD with. Apparently, my Mom is a better hider and more responsible than my dad because I found a gun before I found the medication. I took the gun out of the holster and put it up to my left temple and put my finger on the trigger. My head started racing with thoughts. I realized I was just a shell of a person and didn't wanna be alive, but I also realized that death is absolutely terrifying. I didn't pull the trigger because I was too scared and because couldn't handle imagining my mom walking into her room and seeing blood surrounding her dead son. I broke down and cried for the rest of the day, and got help the next morning. I have never told anyone this story, but I have told my therapist that I think about suicide. I just want to know if that experience is suicidal behavior. I never pulled the trigger, so it is not technically a suicide attempt, but if I told my therapist, could I get sent to a mental hospital or other scary forms of being locked up? Is being too afraid to commit suicide a valid excuse to not consider myself suicidal if my therapist asks? It is probably irrational, but I am terrified of what I have heard about mental hospitals.
