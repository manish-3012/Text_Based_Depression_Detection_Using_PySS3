Im tiredI used to be so good at pretending Iâ€™m okay. I had everyone fooled for years. Now it all seems to be catching up with me. I guess I donâ€™t really care any more if they think Im okay or not. Lately theyâ€™ve been asking, and I tell them all the same thing. Im tired. Iâ€™ve really been trying to give life a chance. Iâ€™ve started working out, trying to eat healthier, go out and do things. I stopped cutting myself. I tried talking about it with a close friend. Hell, I even took a vacation from work to go see my best friend in another state. All things that are, in theory, supposed to help one feel better about life. 
I was going to wait until the end of this year to make a decision. I still might, but itâ€™s getting harder. No matter how hard I try to feel better, I just donâ€™t. Every-time something in my life goes right, I have this sick feeling in my gut telling me it wonâ€™t last. I feel so pathetic and weak all the time. I know it would hurt my mom if I kill myself, but I really donâ€™t care anymore. I donâ€™t care who it hurts. Im just tired. 
I never really talk about this kind of stuff, so maybe posting my thoughts here will be helpful.
Iâ€™m not going to try anything soon, but I have a tentative date set. Maybe Iâ€™ll wait until the end of the year, or maybe I wont. Like I said, I donâ€™t really care any more.
