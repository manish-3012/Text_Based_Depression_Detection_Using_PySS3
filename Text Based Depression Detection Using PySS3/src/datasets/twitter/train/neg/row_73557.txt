Iâ€™m sitting on the edge of a black hole and ready to dive inI can see it all really clearly now. My boyfriend sobbing over my lifeless corpse, clutching it tightly. He doesnâ€™t let go when EMS arrives, his tear-stained face will scream and stubbornly grip my hollow body, spitting in the face of anyone who dare pry the corpse from his clutches. My roommates are frozen in place. After a few months, they move on. My best friend begins punching every wall and screaming. He blames himself, though he probably should. He will be in therapy for the rest of his life. 

Other close friends are alerted by some method. They are shocked. They are traumatized. Their minds race. They clock out of work immediately and sit staring at a wall for hours, wondering why. Why didnâ€™t she reach out. Itâ€™s okay, they couldnâ€™t have helped anyway.

My oldest brother hears, he doesnâ€™t say much about it. I hardly know him. Next older brother hears, cries for days. Youngest brother hears, heâ€™s sad and he doesnâ€™t understand. My sister says nothing. She may even make a second attempt on her own life. Sheâ€™s my spitting image.

My father, he is broken. He falls apart. For the rest of his life, he sits useless, drinking, waiting to die. My mother cries every day for years. She may attempt her own life as well. Like daughters, like mother.

The rest of the world goes on. They, too, must go on with it.

These are the painful thoughts that keep me from trying, but itâ€™s hard to tell anymore which pain is worse.
