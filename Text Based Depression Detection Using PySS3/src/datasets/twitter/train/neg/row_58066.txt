One of my old friend committed a suicide which was planned over 2 years, nobody solve reason behind.My school friend (i haven't seen him since 1+ year) committed suicide 5 days ago, jumped from 13th floor. 

I want to know if you have any idea why, or have heard about something similar to this.

He left notes, says that he don't want to life in this world where all we do is earning and spending money, and it's too boring for him. And also mentioning a girl in a 1 sentence. But the problem is:

  
1)Over 2 years, he was mentioning mm/dd in his Instagram pictures, posts, which we just realized that is the day and month he killed himself.

2)He has little tattoos on his chest and arm, mostly of sun, moon, Saturn and butterfly. Some people say he told them that he was talking about we will be go to Saturn after death, and  reincarnation

3)He mentioned that he is in a better place on letter

4)His family says he was talking someone in English for a long time on smartphone. He was Turkish.

5)Before hours of his suicide, he bough new clothes, put his all clothes and backpack orderly on the top floor and jumped

6) Finally, as i knew him, he was definitely now smart enough to plan something like this more than 2 years before. He didn't believe in god, but had no problem with living. Everyone says that even 1 day before his death he was acting just normal

So, does anyone heard anything like this before, especially about \*Saturn\*, could be a \*suicide game\* which is popular nowadays, encourage people to jump from building. This is a total mystery, he was't someone to commit suicide. Everyone is sure that someone made him.
