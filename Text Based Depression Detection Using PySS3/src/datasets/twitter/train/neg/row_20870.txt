Suicide feels like the only optionI've been depressed since I was a young kid. I'm now almost 30. So it's been nearly 3 decades of hell. I was just classified as "treatment resistant," which means, as I've known for years, that nothing is working. I've been on so many medications, so many combinations of medications, even some that were prescribed off label, I've been to dozens of therapists, and while I've made some improvements in certain areas, none have been able to help me get rid of the depression. It runs in my family; my mom's side has a few suicides, and there have been attempts by my siblings, as well as me.

I remember being really young, 7 or 8 maybe, and wanting to die. My first suicide attempt was at age 12. That isn't normal. There have been short periods where the depression has gotten a little better, but it's never gone away, and for the past 4 years it's been constant. Nearly daily thoughts of suicide, feeling like the most worthless pile of crap on the planet, no interest in anything, no pleasure gotten from anything. I've managed to push everyone away.

The only reason I'm still alive is because I don't want to hurt my family; my parents are still around and I don't want them to have to plan my funeral. But it's to the point now where I'm starting to convince myself that they don't need me, and they'll be okay without me. I've always felt like the black sheep anyway.

I can't keep living like this. It's barely living at all. I shut myself inside, only leave when I have to, I have no one to talk to except my therapist once a week, I'm alone and lonely and I don't feel I benefit anyone. I've tried to fix this, I've done everything you're supposed to do for depression, and here I am, wondering how many more days I can go before I can't take it anymore.
