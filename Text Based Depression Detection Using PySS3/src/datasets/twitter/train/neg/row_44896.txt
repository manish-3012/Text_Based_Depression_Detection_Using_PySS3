(M27)I am thinking about suicide. I found a cheap gun for under 200 dollars. I can go to the hospital and shoot myself in the head so they can harvest my organs.I dont believe I will ever find a job where I am not having panic attacks or where I am depressed. I get rejected from jobs so quick from jobs that seem good. I dont want to do sales or customer service. I am doing customer service now and its awful. I have a Master of Public Administration but it has not helped.  I was an outsider as a teen and now as an adult I am still an outsider but now I need money. I know this is cringy but my lack of success with women is part of this too. Only one relationship for three weeks. I need love, I need physical affection. I am in therapy and on meds.
