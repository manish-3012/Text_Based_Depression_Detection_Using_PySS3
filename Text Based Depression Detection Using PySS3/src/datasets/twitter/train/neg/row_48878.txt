The only time I feel like this, is when I am downI dont getit. The only time I think about sucide is when I have social shit todo. I cant seem to find any reason or logic. Why even put up with this fakeness.  Idont belong here. Yes I can fake it. No its not fun. THere's aboustely nothing thats making me truly happy. No1's giving a fuck. Even if I rise up to the level that people start giving a fuck, I feel like those people are pathetic for that. They don't seem to care. Dunno why I am really here. Shupid shit. I dont reallyt care. Not that I am gonna  coomit sucide. Iam just too sad. Nothing makes me feel like I truly belong. I'll just be having a drink and sleeping it over. But i Feel like SHIT

and thats the only persisitent thing in my life right now. Fucking shit, I'm missing spellings dude to being drunk and angry atm/
