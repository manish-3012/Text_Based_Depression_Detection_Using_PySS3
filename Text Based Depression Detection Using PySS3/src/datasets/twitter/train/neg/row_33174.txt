WaitingI didnâ€™t know that I was passively suicidal until someone pointed it out to me. That I have no reason to be here. And Iâ€™m just waiting for everything to be over with. Its frustrating waiting this long because itâ€™s taking too long for all of this to be over. I wish I was more courageous to end everything. But I would hate to leave the person I think I love because I canâ€™t get it together. But I know he deserves better.

I just want to be over already. Itâ€™s just taking too long.
