I think Iâ€™m coming to terms with letting go of life. It feels somewhat peaceful.My whole world changed last week and Iâ€™ve been feeling very suicidal. Iâ€™ve felt like this in the past, but it was more romanticising with the idea of death, and I could never really settle on how I wanted to go. The idea of going through with it terrified me and I always tried to take my mind off it. There was a night that I was taking drugs at a party, and I never had the intention to end it that way, but I also didnâ€™t really care about if I did, so I just kept on taking more and more. I apparently blacked out once that night. Didnâ€™t care when I was told about it... But one day part of me thought fuck, maybe there is something in the life worth living for, Iâ€™ll try get through this. Eventually I went to my GP and reached out for some help. 


The therapy I tried was awful, and didnâ€™t make any impact. I tried getting on with things on my own and I thought I was getting better, I set goals, ended a relationship that was dragging me down emotionally and mentally, I felt good. I was making progress. I was doing well. 


But then recently my best friend who I care more about than absolutely anything on this godforsaken planet used me as a rebound. He tore my world down with his lies, killed my dreams by leaving me numb and practically spat on my will to live. Iâ€™m done.

Iâ€™ve actually settled on how I want to go. Every day I wake up and my heart races at the knowledge Iâ€™m still alive, so every day I expose myself to how I want to go and slowly I feel more at ease knowing that itâ€™s all going to be over soon. 

Every time I think about how life might be like if I donâ€™t go through with it, but the thought makes me sick. I donâ€™t want to be here anymore. I donâ€™t even think I want to discuss it, Iâ€™m not really sure why Iâ€™m posting here. To vent I guess. 


Stupidest part of all this is that I still love him. Still care about him. Iâ€™d do almost anything for him... but I wonâ€™t carry on living for him. I wonâ€™t even do it for myself. 
I want to be angry at him, so help me god I do, but I canâ€™t. We have so much history. Heâ€™s not a bad person. Cutting him out of my life isnâ€™t an option, as that leads me back to wanting to end my life. 


Everything points back to one outcome, and I take some comfort in knowing that. Not every life has is precious. The only impact of me dying is loved ones having to clear out my possessions. I bring no value to anyone elseâ€™s existence unless Iâ€™m being used for something. 
I donâ€™t want to feel anymore.
