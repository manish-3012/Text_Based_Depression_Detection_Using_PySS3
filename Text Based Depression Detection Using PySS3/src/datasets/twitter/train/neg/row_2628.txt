IdkThis isnâ€™t anything suicidalish, but like I feel like Iâ€™ve peaked in my life. I am college educated,I have a family that loves me, I am single no kids, have experienced a lot of hardships and came out positive, Iâ€™ve mentored some teensand adults(whoâ€™ve acted like little kids). I donâ€™t think i have much more to offer. I feel like anything I do now is just wasting time and space. I love my friends and family but like idk I just feel like Iâ€™ve done what Iâ€™ve been put here to do. I donâ€™t really know how to explain it. This might sound stupid as fuck for a subreddit called suicidewatch but I feel comfortable dying right now, leave life on a high note. One thing that holds me back is that I wouldnâ€™t want my family to be sad or heartbroken, I donâ€™t think they would understand. I love them so much and seriously itâ€™s the fact that they would be hurt is the reason Iâ€™m still here

Idk, sorry if wrong sub
