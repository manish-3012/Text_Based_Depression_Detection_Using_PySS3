Love is the only thing that gave this struggle any meaning. Without love, there's no reason to endure. Even if it gets better, what's it for if there's no one to share it with?My mom really wants me to hold on. I imagine my dad and siblings would hurt for a while. My grandma might die (I have always been her favorite for some reason). But why should that matter? It's sick that they think they are happier keeping me alive, in misery. I want to check myself into a psych ward for 2 weeks, but other than staying alive cuz my mom keeps telling me to...I don't know why I should. My life as never been "good" or "easy" or "fun." I'm not waiting around for it to get "good" or "fun" because I'm beyond that now. I know all that is empty and meaningless. It seems like such a waist to put in all the effort it takes to overcome this, only to be able to live apathetically. Why go to work? why pay my bills? why eat? why shower? if I'm not having any fun? When the emotions and the thoughts pass, I still won't be having any fun because I either 1) can't appreciate me and my life on my own (i.e. without the partner who I thought was my soul mate), OR 2) there is no incentive to put up with this shitty world and the people in it on a daily basis. I don't want this world or this life--I have legit been trying to run away from it since I was 12...17 years later and I still want to run away, and now I don't have high school, lost virginity, drug experimentation, college, love, starting a family, professional career, or any of those milestones to look forward to. There's no reason to keep getting up with the sun.
