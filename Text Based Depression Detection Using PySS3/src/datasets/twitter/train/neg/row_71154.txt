Just want to talk to someone.Hey. Not that I think anyone is going to read this. But to sum up everything I am looking for someone to talk to about this maybe that feels the same way like I do so they understand and we can talk. I drove myself to the store today to by a rope, but the weight limit was 113, and I am 130 so I was to scared that it would break and not support my weight. I saw it as a sign for not tonight. I went home to cut myself to get the edge off, for the pain in my stomach to go away but not even the razor would cut. I am just so lost.
