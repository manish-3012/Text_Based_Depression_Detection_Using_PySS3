I lost herI've already posted in the depression forum, but it said I should post here. I am contemplating suicide, planning it. That's sort of easy, i'm on the 16th floor and there is concrete beneath. I was in China, moved there for a woman I am deeply in love with, things went wrong, it is possible she is pregnant with my child, and she left me, I left to Korea. I'm here frozen in time almost. But all I want to do is die. This feeling isn't new, two years ago I was in a mental ward for the same reason. Now knowing that I am pre-disposed to this level of pain, I would rather end my life than have these memories or ever going through this again. Of course I don't know if I can go through with it. Suicide is terrifying, but I hope I have the courage and ability.
