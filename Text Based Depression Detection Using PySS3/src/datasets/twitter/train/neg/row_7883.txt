Ya know most days I want to die but then something happensSo a little background 21 m no friends family hates me 
Now that that's out of the way I have been more so sucidal as of late then I've been in a while maybe it the effects of coming off of all the drugs both legal and otherwise but maybe it's just coming back into a situation where nobody wants me around 
But today I saw something that gave me a little bit of hope though it's small it's still something
Two of my best friend from my old town got married today. One of them was pretty much my bother though everything we destroyed ourselves together for a long while and she was a cutter and would go off and be gone for days or weeks sometimes not talking to us
I don't know why this but a bit of light out for me but it was nice to see someone I know have something nice even if I don't want to be here anymore 
It be nicer if anyone would talk to me or if I was there for them. 
Not that it matters no one tells me anything anyways 
I hope y'all are having a good night
