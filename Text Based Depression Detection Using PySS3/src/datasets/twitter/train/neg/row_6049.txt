YoungMy mom and dad were alcoholic 
I was depressed I would hide in my messy room 

I never showered 
I never slept 

Soon it got to the point where I just wanted die 

So I tried to hang myself 
I took a rope and hung it over a shelf in my closet 

But as soon as I realized what I was doing I started crying and yelled out for my sister she arrived there with her friend 

She too started crying so we got me down 

We agreed not to tell everyone about it 

But her friend told the school and they asked my parents if it was true of course I said no 

Itâ€™s been years since then my parents got cleared 

I got therapy
How old was I?

9 

Every one can be depressed 
Your age doesnâ€™t matter 

Get help 
Your worth so much more
