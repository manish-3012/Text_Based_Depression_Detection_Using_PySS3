Fuck a throwaway, I need help.I honestly have no clue what the hell to put on here. I don't know how to explain to you guys how im feeling, or any of that. I fucking hate myself, and i find myself thinking about suicide alittle too much. Before i would just shrug it off and think, hey, im just going alittle crazy. Recently, about for a year now these thoughts are just going through my head more and more, and im getting sick of it. Sometimes i feel like if i follow through with these thoughts, then everything will be okay, it sounds like freedom. I know its not, and i know ill let my parents down, my little brothers down, and my grandparents down, but i feel like im just living to be here for them while i just feel like complete shit on the inside. Even when im supposed to be having fun, and get my small amounts of "happiness" i always have a worry in the back of my mind that i just cant seem to get rid of and can never fully enjoy myself. I know that this life is pointless, we live to die, just like any other animal on this planet, so why? why the fuck do i want to take away something so meaningless and special away. sorry if im not making sense guys, i just have no fucking clue what to do and im close to my breaking point.
