im tired.i dont really know why i am writing here, ive never been on this site before, ive never really felt like this before. but i am tired. tired of living, tired of being. sometimes i just want to cease to exist. i dont want to be here anymore, but i dont really want to die either.i dont even know why im so sad, but lately it feels like the world is caving in. and somedays i feel so happy and sometimes i dont leave the house for four days. and i have a good life, really a good life, so i really dont know why im so sad. ive been reading a lot of books, watching a lot of movies that have the same themes of suicide and it just feels like it could be so easy to end everything now. i dont know if this post has a point, i dont know if writing this will make me feel better. but im really tired. thanks for listening
