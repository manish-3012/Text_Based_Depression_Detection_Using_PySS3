21, U.S male. Psychological damage, social isolation, intense suicidal thoughts.I just turned 21 and I'm pretty much ready to go. 

My entire life has just been torture. I was physically abused at school and at home. It was bad at home. I was neglected severely. I was hit so many times. So many broken phones. I have been strangled and stabbed. I was bullied relentlessly, even teachers did it. I spent my time playing video games. My mom got addicted to drugs and OD'd and died in front of me when I was 16. I stayed in an abusive relationship from 16-20. The girl destroyed me completely. I have never fit in. I am alienated. My mind is wildly distorted. I have no connection to anyone or anything. No friends. No interests or desires. Anxiety, anger, terror, flashbacks, insomnia, depression, nightmares, self-loathing. Daily suicidal thoughts.

I remember one time I did something very benign and my brother threw a basketball at my head while my dad watched and screamed "I hate my fucking life" and stormed off. That was Father's Day.

I am ready to go. No more of this. I don't want these thoughts. They will not go away. I will never be normal. I'm a robot.

I've literally written dozens of suicide notes and I just need to do it already... just wasting time. This is hell on Earth. I need to figure out how to just do it.
