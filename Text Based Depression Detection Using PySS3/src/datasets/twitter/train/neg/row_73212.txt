Why the fuck does no one careJust turned 15 and I finally fucking realize after years of this shit. No one is ever going to fucking care until you finally do it. Iâ€™ve been fucking alone for a long ass time. 2 people at my school committed suicide this year and Iâ€™m probably going to be the third next week. Iâ€™m giving life one last fucking chance before I grab the .45 and end all this shit. No oneâ€™s ever given a shit about me or my fucking problems. No oneâ€™s ever fucking loved me. Iâ€™m fucking retarded and probably going to summer school. No one cares about the weird fucking addict kid at school until he finally kills himself. Then all these people start making up bullshit about how others should talk to them. Or how much they â€œmissâ€ the kid who was brave enough to do it. Iâ€™m done I donâ€™t want to live on this planet anymore. Thereâ€™s nothing left in my life.
