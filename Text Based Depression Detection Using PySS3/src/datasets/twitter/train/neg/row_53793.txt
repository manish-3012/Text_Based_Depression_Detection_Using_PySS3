I am going to off myself at the end of DecemberItâ€™s been a awful life. Dear god, has it been bad. I thought things would improve once I graduated from uni but no. I am 25 years old kiss-less, hug-less virgin working as an unpaid intern. I barely have any friends. Thanks to rona, I have already been unemployed for a year. I am behind everyone went it comes to being successful. Fuck i hate it. No matter how hard i try things end badly for me. I lost 40 kg in a year, i was making a good progress and then they close down the gym. God is against me, the world is against me. I know itâ€™s not the case but it sure feels like it. I am just tired of thinking things will improve. Man, i hope people donâ€™t see me as a pathetic man who gave up. I am strong but i just canâ€™t keep this up. I am tired of looking at my sad eyes and telling myself that it will better: things will get better. I want to go out in style tho, I know there is a bunch drug dealers that hang around my neighbourhood, hopefully they have knives on them.
