I just want to healnobody cares. I want to die every day and she won't stop drinking. Then she has the gall to say that I'm on her side. you don't care. you never did. every time you said you'd stop and be a mother you never did. I know you'll never stop. I can't hurt myself again by believing that when you're sober for a month. its my fault isn't it i cant control it im sorry im never going to get to grow im going to be stuck taking care of you my whole life ill never go to college ill never get to live i just want to die so i can heal.
