Every time I have a pain in my heart I have hope I'll dieTo be intensely connected to someone for months, and then have it all go away, be taken away. Have the memories pierce your mind every fucking day. I can't handle it. So much pain, crying, pain in my mind from rejection, betrayal. I hate every single moment I'm alive.

I spent all my time with her, messaging, eating together, making plans, talking, fucking. We had a connection. We thought we would die together and turn into a butterfly. We went through so much: poverty,  heroin addiction, fights, happiness, love.

And now she no no longer talks to me. We broke up, then we were friends, then something happened. She left me drunk, took my heroin, I was found by some strangers. She doesn't respond to messages. She doesn't want to talk to me. Void. All is void in my heart. I'd rather have electricity of a thousands volts be snapped into my testicles than go through this. Pure emotional torture. How can reality be so cruel. 

I BEG GOD TO KILL ME PLEASE. Every time I have a pain in my heart I am happy because maybe, just maybe it's a heart attack that will kill me.

I don't have a plan yet, or a method, nor am I sure I should do it but you get the idea.
