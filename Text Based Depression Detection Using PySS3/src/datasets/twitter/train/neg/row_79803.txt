Fantasize about suicideI don't know what it is but for the longest time I fantasize about killing myself or just dying in general. I think of death every day and it has started taking a toll on me. Sometimes I want to kill myself because I am intrigued by the whole thing, other times something triggers it and I get sad and want to die. I really started having suicidal thoughts two years ago when my girlfriend broke up with me.

Does anyone know anything about this? There is a gun right in the other room from me and I could easily just grab it right now and kill myself. Thinking about it gives me a high.

When I first started having these thoughts I didn't take them too seriously, but now they occur all the time and I'm afraid of it progressing further and something bad happening.

I still have a lot of problems over my ex girlfriend and I know they don't help things but I would never kill myself over her. That is dumb to me. I feel like a freak thinking about death all the time. If I'm crossing the street I imagine a bus taking me out. If I'm driving I imagine getting in a bad wreck. When I snowboard I imagine falling down a cliff or hitting a tree. It never ends.

What is wrong with me? Is this normal? I like the idea of dying and thinking about people mourning my death. Fuck. I am so messed up I don't know how I even function.

Should I be concerned?
