I am not worth what I received.I received a liver transplant last year. Someone had to die for my life to continue; I feel I am not worth that life. Everyone was prepared for my death (myself included). My Wife, whom has stood by my side through everything, deserved a clean cut and someone worth more than I am. She had the support, but I had to go and pull through like a champ. I am not worth the life taken. I cannot provide for her, we cannot start a family, and I feel more like an anchor every day. I do realize a life ended for my extended time, but why? I am not worth it. Things are worse since I decided to shoot myself because I'm too scared to cut or hang myself, she stopped me. I am now thinking about taking the long road home with a knife tonight. 

Addition: I accepted death as I was wheeled into the OR, I was positive leading up to it but something told me I am not worth the life lost. I have not felt like myself since.
