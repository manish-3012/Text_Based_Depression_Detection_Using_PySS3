Just got out of hospital for trying to overdose, where do I go from here?I posted before over a week ago.  Decided to take an overdose the other night.  Woke up, told work I was going to be away for a few days.  Went to seek help for my depression, NHS advisor told me I needed to register which took 3 weeks to be seen.  Told him about taking the pills, he said I could overdose on what I took.  I walked to A&amp;E whilst taking more so I could just fall into a deep sleep.  

When I got there they admitted me and treated it as an overdose.  I felt lost walking to there.  Was ok when I got out but all day im feeling lost and I don't know the next step to take in becoming better.  Im registering with a doctor tomorrow but im having issues in deciding on what to do first.  I still think about suicide but not as suicide, just falling asleep and never waking up...
