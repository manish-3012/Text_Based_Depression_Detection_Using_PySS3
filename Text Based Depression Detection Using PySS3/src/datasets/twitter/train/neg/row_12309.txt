Abusive girlfriend made me lose the ability to love, trust people and to live life being happySorry for bad English and wording, I'm from Serbia. My girlfriend has been torturing me mentally for the last 2 out of 3  years of our relationship. She's become cold to me, she talks to other guys calling them daddies and shit and even though I told her to stop and its making me uncomfortable she keeps doing it, I even said I'm suicidal at some point in a phonecall she ignored it and laughed really hard at memes that some guy was sending her. She left me on seen on purpose and is ignoring my suicidal messages even though the last time this type of thing happened i actually tried to kill myself and she blamed me for guilt tripping which is kind of fucked up in my opinion. She and some guy have the same profile picture and said: "Oh well, I can't FORCE him to change it haha :)". This is just too much for me, I love her and I literally never had a girl like that who I liked a lot of things with and she has a very similar taste in stuff we both like; But I just can't take  this anymore, I'm not strong enough mentally to break up with her, it'll most likely result in me killing myself as I don't know what else to do. I have no one, not even my family likes me, I literally have no friends no matter how much i tried, no matter how chill and kick back I was, I was never even second choice.  I posted this on r/depression as I cannot take this mental torment any longer. Thanks if you read through this. Help.
