I did the whole wait a week thing and nothing has changedA week ago I woke up in a super good mood.  excited for the day and all that shit.  my boyfriend didn't work for once so we had all day to spend together!  he accidently triggered my eating disorder thoughts and I've been on a downward spiral since.

I tried setting small goals that would make me happy, the smallest just being to be able to play animal crossing for 10 minutes and the biggest being able to take a warm shower.  I wasn't able to achieve any of them.

I did the whole "if I still feel suicidal in a week, then that's it."

I woke up today happy.  I spent three hours laying in bed, playing animal crossing and looking at my boyfriend sleeping peacefully.  He doesn't work today and I was excited to spend all day with him and do homework.

He made a joke that hurt my feelings (I knew it was a a joke so I feel even worse letting it hurt my feelings), but no biggie! we still have homework and each other!

never mind, have to stop homework not once, twice, but three separate times.  Where it's note taking, me being able to keep my focus solely on it is important.  This was originally an in person class, switch to online.

So I can't do fucking anything and all I can think about is how nothing changed in a week, nothing will change next week, or the next week, and I'm close to taking his box cutter and fucking ending my life or downing his medicine and taking a bath.
