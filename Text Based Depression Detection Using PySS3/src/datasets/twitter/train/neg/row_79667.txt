I'm too much of a coward to kill myself...I want to die, I don't know how to become capable of doing it myself so I often envision either paying someone to do it for me, my life being threatened or being murdered in cold blood unexpectedly and how little I would care or how little I would fight it as the life left my body...I want it so much that it's sometimes all I can think about when I'm feeling lost, overwhelmed or alone...please help me.
