You are lovedI have a strange attraction to this place. I've met wonderful people and great conversations. I just want to let you all know I'm still here. You don't know me but I love you. You'll make it through this. There is a way out, and it does not have to be death. If you need to chat just post a comment and I'll get back to you. If no one else gives a shit about us, then we can give a shit about eachother.
