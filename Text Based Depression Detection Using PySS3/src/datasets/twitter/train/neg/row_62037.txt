Im going to lay in bed for a couple of hours then decide if I want to die.I'm hoping by midnight something will convince me to go to work tomorrow. My job is miserable, I have no marketable skills, and I'm isolated. My friends won't ever know the depth of pain I'm in. Even if they did they can't help. So there's really nothing left to do.
