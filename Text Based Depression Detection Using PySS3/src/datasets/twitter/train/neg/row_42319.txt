vicious hatred of society and my lifeHuman misery had been permanent  ever since the invention of society. Maybe not nearby, but somewhere, there is always a large group suffering to provide richer people with comforts. I constantly think of abused factory workers in India, children starving in some remote African village,  prisoners in China peeling garlic for hours straight. 

I have a cushy life in America and hate it. Hate living and hate this dense fog of depression dulling life. That coupled with the inability to ignore terrible global suffering has fueled two suicide attempts  and will fuel my third. I view human society as something not worth living in and impossible to perfect. At least I can keep attempted suicide until I finally escape this world.
