Iâ€™ve been being mean to my family for years so they wonâ€™t care when I kill myselfToday is probably the ugliest itâ€™s ever been. I got let go right before Xmas, lost a huge job opp, am being forced to go home for Xmas to see my mother and grandma even tho my mom is still married to the man that abused me, and I flipped the fuck out on the phone at her just now. I threw up after. I canâ€™t take this anymore. I said horrendous things but was also honest: I hate her so much because she stayed married to a man who abused me and refuses to hear my Side of the story. I am going home for Xmas just to see my grandma one last time and then when I go back after the break Iâ€™ll kill myself
