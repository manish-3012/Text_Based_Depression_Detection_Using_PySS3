My hope to live died years ago just a soulless body remainsIâ€™m a disgrace to my family my life. I donâ€™t want  to live anymore didnâ€™t score good marks in my 12th grade not good IELTS score. Been getting a mental torture by my parents. Iâ€™m having mental breakdown from last night. Societal pressure is living up to its job. Probably thinking after done with my mock test today. Will probably jump in a  lake from a bridge. What other options do i have. 
Go home take that guilt that mental breakdown every day every night in my sleep. I have been pretty depressed for a couple of days just because of this. I should myself in front of my parents thatâ€™ll make me feel better. Write a note take some poison. I just wanted to get that off my chest before doing something
