What pushes someone over the edge?I NEVER EVER THOUGHT I\*D POST HERE

I've had depressive episodes without suicidal thoughts before. 

Once when I was a teen and now as an adult in my late twenties. 

I've had to quit my dream education, lost a ton of friends and money due to being impulsive and not thinking because of my ADHD.  Could never keep a job... 

So I ended up depressed.

And now... 

I think I might have lost my husband??? He can't deal anymore with my shit. (both my literal mess and my adhd emotional dysregulation). 

And for what?

A fucking disorder I can't change

Our relationship has been on/off for years but now ... I think it might be the actual end???

And I can't deal

I have friends who love me 

but it seems to matter less 

the only thing that really keeps me going is that i couldn't ever do  this to my partner

because it would hurt him so much

and it would hurt my parents 

and my friends

And I'm scared. How did I end up here? I was never suicidal... A bit sad maybe...

But its like I'm losing hope the more time passes... 

All I have is my empathy but what if that stops mattering???

GOD I\*M SO FUCKING TIRED

i've not told anyone not my husband even about these thoughts...
