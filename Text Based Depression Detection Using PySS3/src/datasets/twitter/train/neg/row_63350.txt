im gonna do it after 1 hourWaiting for my planned time and I'll jump. It's over I'm seriously done this time, it will probably take 2 seconds to wipe and solve everything in my life.
I have way to many problem in my life, struggling with depression and anxiety, can't focus anymore in school and i repeated grade, that's just too much for a young guy to takes, I feel sorry for my parents for having a kid like me :( they really don't deserve me.
