I think he's goneThough we haven't known each other long, I feel like we've been friends forever. We were helping each other. We understood each other. He was a little more worse off, but we both struggle with suicidal tendencies and mental disorders. I'm never going to find someone like him again. I feel so sick, so empty. I don't know what to do anymore.
