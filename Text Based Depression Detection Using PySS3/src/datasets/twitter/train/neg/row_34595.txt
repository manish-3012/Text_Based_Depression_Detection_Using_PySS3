I want to kill myselfI put up a post on r/rate me because I felt insecure with my looks. After reading some positivity on there, I decided to go out tonight because itâ€™s Friday night.i went downtown and I swear to god, my anxiety is so bad I canâ€™t even look at people. It took me two hours to enter a bar. And when I finally got in, I became so overwhelmed with the crowds, that I burst out of there crying. 

Iâ€™m in my car, crying because I have no friends, no girlfriend, a family who judges me, and absolutely nothing. I am so fucking lonely. I just want someone to talk to that isnâ€™t my 11 year old brother. I want to laugh and have good conversations. I want to fall in love. I want to feel a girlâ€™s touch, as ridiculous as that sounds. I just want something. 

I used to be so confident and ever since I graduated college, I have fucked up. I hate my life because despite being objectively not ugly, I feel like it. I feel like trash. I feel unwanted in every way. And I feel like Iâ€™m really going to die alone. 

As I ran to my car crying, I swear to god I almost jumped in front of the train that was coming. But now I just want to go home and cut myself. 

I swear to god, I dream every night that I will find someone who can lay with me under the sunset in pure bliss, listening to some chill music like Mac DeMarco. 

But that dream will never become a reality. I will forever be alone. Devoid of not only a girl, but friends. Iâ€™m ugly, worthless, and am going to kill myself. There is no point.
