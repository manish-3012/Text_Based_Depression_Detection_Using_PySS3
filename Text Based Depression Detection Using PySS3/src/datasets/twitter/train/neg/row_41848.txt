Its going bad.26 and I'm honestly probably becoming an alcoholic and abusive.  It makes me wanna fuckin die.  I work a  dead end job, don't have a car and I live with my domineering mom. I'm still a virgin and it feels like time is completely running out.  Even more reason for me to wanna die. I'm I guess technically on numerous dating sites...every time, I blow it. Maybe on purpose, probably because I really don't like women, Like yeah sexually...but as people, NOPE. I think they are pretty much all sneaky and conniving... I don't think that there's much convincing otherwise.
 
I wish I was hot, it's never gonna happen. I have really horrible self esteem.  I wish I would catch covid 19
