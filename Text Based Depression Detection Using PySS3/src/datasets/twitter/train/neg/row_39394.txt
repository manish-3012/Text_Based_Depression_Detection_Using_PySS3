cant really summarize sorryIf I fail this one class my mom is gonna send me to a different school, and the only thing keeping me from killing myself is my friends. Look I've had depression for as long as I can remember, it runs in the family. On my dad side every recorded death was a suicide. I don't know if I can keep on like this it was my birthday yesterday and I just felt nothing. My friends threw a party for me but nobody said anything when I sat outside for most of it. And I didn't want them to, well I kinda did, I wanted to feel loved (which I didn't) and I just hate myself because I am such a bad influence on everybody I have one goal in life and thats to have kids but I really dont know if thats enough to keep me going anymore
