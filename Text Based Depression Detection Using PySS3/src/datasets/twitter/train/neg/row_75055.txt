I don't know what to do anymoreI feel like I'm a failure. I think I'm on the brink of being fired from my current job, which I only got through nepotism just like my previous few jobs before this one. This is only part of it though, every single relationship I've had seems to fizzle out, like I leave everyone feeling unhappy or unsatisfied with being with me. I think people keep me in there lives because they feel sorry for me or they make themselves feel better in comparison to my fucking failure of any existence. I think I'd be the most use to everyone by ending it, kind of a morbid juxtaposition of why they are a success at being a functional person. I probably don't make any sense right now, I'm pretty fucked up, alcohol is they only thing keeping me sane.
