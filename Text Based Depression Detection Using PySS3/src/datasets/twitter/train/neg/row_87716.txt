I'm sitting in the car at the bridge overpassIt's not going to get better. I'm bawling my eyes out and listening to sad music because I'm a pathetic whiny piece of shit. Look at me, I'm begging for attention on the internet.


I fucking wrecked him.  truly believe I ruined his life, he'll be better off without me. Everyone will. 


It's not going to get better. 


I owe so much money to so many people and so many companies. I'm perpetually broke. I can't provide for my family. 


She's going to be messed up just like me, and it's my fault.


I could shut off the car and walk to the bridge. It's a 60 foot drop. If this becomes another thing I fuck up, I further the burden I am to everyone. I could also stop my fucking crying and just pretend I'm not a fat fucking cunt who makes everything worse for everyone. Maybe I'll figure out what's strong enough to hold my weight so the shitty noose doesn't break and leave me brain dead, leaving them with the financial burden of medical bills. Maybe if I jump, they won't find my body and no one will have to pay for my burial or cremation. 

The parking area is filling up with cars and people walking by. I'm stuck, shaking here. I know I have to do this, and just waiting for the right moment feels like an axe to the head. 

I'll probably delete this.
