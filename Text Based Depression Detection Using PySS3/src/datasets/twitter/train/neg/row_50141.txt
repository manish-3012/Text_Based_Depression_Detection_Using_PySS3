i have to diethere are too many things wrong, none of which i can do anything about, i've just had enough. i dont even know what to write here because i cant tell what specifically is the problem, it's like fifty different things. i dont know where to start. my heart hurts anf ky stomach hurts, i'm only happy in my dreams but i've slept too much today already. i dont know how to kill myself so i doubt i could but i just really want to die. i wont because i never do so its ok. i just really want to kill myself more than usual right now. no one can help me, no ome can do anything because i dont want to kake any effort to help myself either. i just want to be dead now. so no one has to reach out to me here, i'm too far gone and i will just disappoint, i'm a lost cause. thanks for reading though. just needed to let someone know i think.
