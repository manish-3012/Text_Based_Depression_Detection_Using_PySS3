Broken beyond repairAlone, misunderstood, suffering from ptsd, ocd, mdd, bipolar, psychosis, insomnia, and off meds, just turned 30, and my entire family has died and left me, my sister, both brothers, and my mom, all very unexpected deaths and some not even a year a part, my mom's death hasn't even been a year yet and I am lost, my entire identity is lost.
