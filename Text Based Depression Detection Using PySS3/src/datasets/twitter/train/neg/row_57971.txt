I want to die Iâ€™m sorry : (I just canâ€™t take life anymore, Iâ€™m so sick of it! Iâ€™m trying my fucking hardest but Iâ€™m never good enough. I donâ€™t care about money, fame or any of that. I just want to live a happy life, have friends and maybe some love. I canâ€™t just get over it, im not choosing to be this way and I certainly didnâ€™t choose to be born into this hell, Iâ€™ve got every single thing against me ever since birth and it hurts so much. If it was as easy as getting over it, trying or growing some balls then I wouldnâ€™t be crying myself to sleep every single day. 

I just wish my parents would understand. Iâ€™m suffering from mental health issues and all my father says is "you have to get yourself out there and meet people, no one likes anyone whoâ€™s depressed all the time". I donâ€™t give a shit about growing muscles or trying to be "cool". I am who I am ok and if you donâ€™t like that then fuck off.
