Trying... falteringI've been trying so very hard to keep going. I've cried every day since April began. I'm sitting in a private restroom at work trying not to fall apart. I'm tired, scared and hurting. 

My best friend held me all Saturday night as I cried until I felt I was just empty then she broke down as well so I had to suck it up and help her. It's not fair to her that I lean so hard on her to keep going. She's been through enough and would be devestated to lose me but is also hurting so much because of me.

When i was a kid i would pray to god and wish on stars that i would wake up different/fixed. I'd later pray and wish that I'd wake up ok with who i am. Finally I started and continue to pray to whatever god might answer and wish on any light in the sky to please just let me rest.
