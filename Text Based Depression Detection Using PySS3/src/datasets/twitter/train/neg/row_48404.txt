I can't be trusted to live my own life.I have no drive, no goals. I don't know what I want any more.

I'm nothing but a drain on other people, that much is very clear.

I can't support myself, but living with my parents means getting the same lecture every day about how I need to pull my finger out and get a real job. I'm tired of being made to feel like I'm lazy and worthless, worst thing is, it's true.

It's debatable whether people would really be better off without me, but honestly, I don't care any more. I'm just tired of this.
