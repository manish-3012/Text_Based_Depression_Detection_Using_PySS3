Sleep Deprivation, Suicide, Divorce, Oh my!In June of 2020, my now ex wife left me. My mother had convinced her to leave me for a slew of inaccurate reasons.

The following six weeks immediately after the fact, I slept in my car, even though I still had the apartment to live in. After those six weeks, I slept in my bathtub for another months worth of time.

The thing that was a constant was the short amount of sleep I got. When I finally moved to sleeping in my bed, everything got significantly worse. I began to have dreams of my ex wife, pleasant dreams of going on dates, going with her to do things. The first night that it happened, I really enjoyed it, the missing part of my life, that was all squandered in the morning when I woke up to an empty bed. My heart shattered. Every day since then I have been avoiding sleep, whenever I do fall asleep, the cycle repeats itself.

In September, I attempted suicide, unsuccessfully. Reason? I am always able to stave off thoughts of her while I am awake, but the moment that I fall asleep, my subconscious takes over and tortures me.

What can I do to fix this. Therapy has only made it worse, making the dreams worse.
