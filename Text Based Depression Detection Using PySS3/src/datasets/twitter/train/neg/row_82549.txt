Why are emotions hardI keep thinking about going to kill myself and I donâ€™t completely understand why I have all these negative emotions. I can go from thinking Iâ€™m alright to thinking that everyone hates me because Iâ€™m so different from them. I donâ€™t understand why people say theyâ€™re my friends but always ignore my texts. These are honestly dumb reasons to be so upset, but I donâ€™t really see a reason to be alive even if people tell me Iâ€™m young and have so much to live for. Everything just feels so hard and no one seems to care how much I feel like Iâ€™m struggling...
