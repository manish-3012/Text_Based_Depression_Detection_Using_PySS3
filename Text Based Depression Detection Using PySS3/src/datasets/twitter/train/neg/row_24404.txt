Got completely screwed over by ex. He's been using me for money. I gave him way too much.. He ignores me, insults me to the point I have no confidence in myself.This has been going on for a year now almost every week. He will use me for money to buy groceries or other stuff bills etc.. He hasn't spoken a word to me since Friday and has had his phone off. Problem why i can't get over this is cuz in the beginning of the relationship he changed me in a good way and cared about me so much then he changed a year ago completely. I have no friends or anyone to reach out to. That's why I'm posting here. He took about 1200 from me over the year and he literally treats me lower than a piece of shit sometimes. Cuz everyone else in his life is more important and he just can't waste his time with me anymore. I'm mostly pissed off about the money because I also have no job at the moment. I'm doing my best to help him and he always does this to me. I have been getting taken advantage of my entire life. So I'm feeling hopeless right now and not sure what to do. I could try downing a bottle of pills with vodka bit I'll most likely fail since tried this last year and didn't wwork. This guy really fucked me up emotionally. He would flirt with girls in front of me. Then suggested I join reddit gone wild which I did and now he calls me a whore for it?? He is the first guy that took me out on a date and wanted something other than sex so I'm having a hard time letting go but he's not the same anymore. How do I even get thru the nights and days? He's all I got but I really don't have him anymore at all
