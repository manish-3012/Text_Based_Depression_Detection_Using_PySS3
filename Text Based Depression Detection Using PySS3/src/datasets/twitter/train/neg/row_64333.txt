Yesterday was a bad day, There's no point to life with days like thatHad work early in the morning, worked for 5 hours, came home, got my stuff for school and left after sitting for about an hour.  School didn't go so well, I misread what was due today and didn't have it to turn in.

Called up the woman who sold me her car last week, she still doesn't have the title transferred to her name so she can sign the title over to me.  I feel like the bitch is just fucking with me at this point.  "She was too sick to work or go to the DMV"

Parked in a handicap spot for no more than 10-15 minutes to see a friend and came out to a cop writing me a 100 dollar ticket.  I was even at my car before he stepped out of his.  The asshole wouldn't even give me a warning so I'll have to take it to appeals court. 

I was late for my soccer game at 9:45pm  

Yesterday was an abnormally shitty day.  Life has no good in it and I don't need shit like this kicking me while I'm down.  School is overwhelming me.  I'm working way too much but every time I ask to get my hours cut back they don't do it.  I'm still having problems trying to get a girlfriend.  22 years old and in college and I can't get a girl, pathetic isn't it?   I can't drown my sorrow in booze or weed.  They just don't agree with my body and I feel off/sick/sleepy.  Not a pleasant experience. 

When you're down, life likes to kick you.  Everyone is out there for their own greed.
