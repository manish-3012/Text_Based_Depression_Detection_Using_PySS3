Feels time to jumpBeen dealing with major depression for two decades(2/3 of my life).  I'm just done.  Was planning to jump from my favorite bridge this past Saturday(4th of July).  Ended up sleeping the day away instead.

Got two weeks off work, and was offered help through their EAP Program.  Today begins week 2, and I haven't been able to find any counselors available through their EAP program.  Either they are not taking new clients, or closed up for Covid 19.

Just tried to give online therapy another go.  They won't accept me.  I guess my honest answers on their questionnaire shows I'm too depressed/suicidal?

Whatever...  life is meaningless.  It'd be easier if someone just came by and killed me, so I don't have to do it myself.  The only thing keeping me here, is not hurting the ones I leave behind.  Which feels selfish on their part.  It's my life, I should be able to exit, when I wish.

Not really expecting anything out of this.  Just came here to rant, and get a little off my chest.  Thank you, if you took time to read this.  I appreciate it.
