Maybe you can help clearing my thoughts.I am fairly young, just 22 years. It started when I was 19 due to certain circumstances, I think. Since then it got worse with everyday. Now I see myself very close to the edge and am My mind tells me to do something to get better now! 1 Year ago I told my parents a little about it, but I think they didn't realize how serious it was. They live 400km from where I live. I feel like breaking away from where I am now, moving closer to them where nobody knows me, continue studying there and starting over is the last thing left for me.
I have lost all relationships here, spend weeks not seeing anybody but the clerk when I buy booze to get drunk (every evening for a year now). I am not sure what I expect from posting this. I typed likely texts very often but never posted them. Maybe I want somebody to encourage me to finally start getting help and start over. Maybe I need somebody to tell me my "little runaway plan" wont help. Maybe I just seek contact. I feel confused.
