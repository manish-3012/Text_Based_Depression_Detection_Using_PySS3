Is tomorrow really a new day?I've been fighting this for months now. I've got the plan all laid out. I've written my letters. Fuck, I even wrote an obituary. I know people love me, and will be sad, at least for a while, but they'll move on. Loss is part of life. I've just had too much of it far too early.

It will be easier if I just go. I'm a failure and a let down. And I know I'm hard to love. I can't inflict that on anyone any more.

People always say tomorrow is a new day, but when I feel like this all the time....is it?

It seems like the only time I feel free for a moment is when I stop breathing. When my chest starts to ache from lack of air, the world doesn't exist, just for a second. I want to feel that way forever.
