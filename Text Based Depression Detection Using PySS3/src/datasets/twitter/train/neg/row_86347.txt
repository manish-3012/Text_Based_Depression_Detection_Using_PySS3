Why is self harm addictingThe desire to die is to stop the pain, not endure it. Why is self harm addicting then? It started off as a cut or two, but now half my thoughts are how/when I can get back to it. 

Aside from that, drinking. Again, it feels fucking atrocious after you've done it but sober me seems to think it's a great idea the next day anyways. Knowingly making things worse than they already are. 

Several nights ago I drank what should have been enough to kill me on top of popping too many meds, but I woke up with little more than mild discomfort 12 hours later. Then I tried it again, same deal. Guess i dont know how to fuckin measure.
