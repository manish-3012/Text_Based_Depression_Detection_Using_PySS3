I'm too weakI'm starting to have serious thoughts about suicide. Dealt with depression all my life but this is the first time I've had serious suicidal thoughts. 

 I haven't had a recent traumatic event, my life isn't crashing down, I'm not crying. That's the scariest part for me, these thought are coming through as rational and clear. The sky is blue and I want to die. 

My entire life consists of convincing everyone else that I'm normal. That's it. I wish my family could forget about me to I could die without any guilt.
