Whatâ€™s the best way to off myself?Got horrible body acne, no insurance, no money to fix it. Mid twenties , been trying to trick myself into thinking it doesnâ€™t matter. It does , it effects me mentally , psychologically, I canâ€™t live a normal life. Iâ€™m going to try to exhaust every last resource I can get my hands on to get rid of literally the worst disease scientist donâ€™t give a fuck about to even figure out what causes or cures it. Accutane can cause croehns disease, other fucked up shit. I would literally do anything to get rid of my acne scars and cure my body acne. Godâ€™s not real and it he is heâ€™s a little bitch boy fuck face for letting this happen to me, ruined my life. 
   Iâ€™m going to try for maybe 2 years thatâ€™s probably how long Iâ€™ll last with this skin disease, by then Iâ€™ll probably freak the fuck out and surely off myself. Iâ€™m going to save up a few thousand and try cosmetic procedures and it that doesnâ€™t work fuck me. Also God damn God for letting me experience this , You suck and donâ€™t exist.
