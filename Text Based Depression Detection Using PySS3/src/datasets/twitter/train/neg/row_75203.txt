Do you ever feel like the support you have just isnâ€™t enough?My boyfriend knows Iâ€™m suicidal. He helps. Heâ€™s there. And he understands. But it doesnâ€™t help. I know who I am better than anyone else and I know for a fact that my life is meaningless. People who barely know me try to convince me that Iâ€™m silly and my thoughts are just self destructive for no reason but theyâ€™re not. Iâ€™m a bad person. Iâ€™m a worthless person. Why else would my life be like this? Do good peoples lives wind up like this? Maybe. But do they see things the way I do? I doubt it. Iâ€™ll never be able to change my point of view no matter what any kind hearted soul wants to tell me. I am worthless and so is my life. Why shouldnâ€™t I end it? My dad killed himself. So did my grandpa. Itâ€™s in my DNA to end my life. And I think I have to do it.
