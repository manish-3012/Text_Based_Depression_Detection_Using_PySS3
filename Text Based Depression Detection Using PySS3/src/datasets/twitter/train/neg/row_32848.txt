I know someone who just said they were going to kill themselves today.It's about 4:30 am and I just got off the phone with my girlfriend.  One of her acquaintinces from last year of college said she was going to kill herself today.  This was about 10 minutes ago.   

We are currently on the phone with that suicide prevention hotline.  Not sure what else to do.  Im not in the immediate vicinity of either of them, and she didnt say how she was going to kill herself.
