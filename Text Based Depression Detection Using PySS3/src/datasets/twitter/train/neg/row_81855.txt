I hate my self so much, I've gone crazy.I'm 25 years old. I'm fat and losing my hair, my teeth and my mind. I hate myself so much, I can't even look in the mirror. I don't have money and my job is part time and I can't find work. My family is poor and I've pushed away all my friends. I literally have nothing to live for. Honestly if I just has 25,000 dollars I could fix myself and start a life. But I have no credit and like I said my family is poor so I can't take out a loan. I going to end it tonight. 

EDIT: Someone reached out to me last night off here. I wasn't really expecting it but I'm here because of it. I'm not promising that I won't do it in the future or even tonight, but I'm here and I'm proud of that.
