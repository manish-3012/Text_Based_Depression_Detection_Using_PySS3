How crippling loneliness goesNo faith in getting better or reconnecting with humanity. Mental health steadily declined for years. General competence &amp; social life followed

I'm uninteresting, bitter, and jaded now, which is of course a great way to make friends.. so many despicable traits which only feel increasingly impossible to reverse.

Everyone has purpose, belonging, social life. I just wanna spare a tiny group some sadness. I have jackshit to offer and don't like the world or body I live in.

There's no place for ppl who stay this broken. My existence is laughable. The fuck am I still here?
