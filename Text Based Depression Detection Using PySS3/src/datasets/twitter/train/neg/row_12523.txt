I need some advice on dealing with my feelings.I'm not really suicidal, I'm sorry. I've been there on the edge a long time ago and I've made the choice to come back. But sometimes I'm just so tired with living. 

Sometimes I make dumb mistakes that ruin days or weeks or even entire months. These mistakes happened before and I don't know why I keep making them again and again. Calamities after calamities. They keep blindsiding me and I'm not strong enough to take them on all the time.

I become so disappointed with myself that I go to the lengths of questioning whether there is a point to even living when I don't learn anything out of life.

I get terribly anxious when I imagine being struck by the same frustrations and the same let-downs will recur until the day I die. 

It gets to the point where I can't even laugh at myself anymore. I just feel like something inside me has resigned itself and stopped bothering. I imagine being the same imbecile forever and I arrive at...

hey, why bother going on when nothing really changes and it doesn't really get better?

*TL;DR:* I need help dealing with these thoughts. I need a prayer or something to convince myself that this really isn't the case.

Thank you.
