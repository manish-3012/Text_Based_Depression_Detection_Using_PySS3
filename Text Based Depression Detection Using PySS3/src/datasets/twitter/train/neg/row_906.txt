Being ugly is going to take my lifeI am a 32 year old man.  My life is absolutely pathetic. I make 15 an hour working a job a hamster could do if they had vocal chords. Outside of work I have no life.  Sleep, and food are the only mild joys I get anymore. I will die a virgin as well,  outside of paying a few hookers to sleep with me. I cannot bear that I am unable to attract women due to something outside of my control,  an ugly face,  and horrible genetics overall. This weekend I am getting a motel, and overdosing on pills. I live with a few people,  and cannot bear to have them find me. I'm not looking for sympathy,  or even care if I get any response. Peace out cruel world
