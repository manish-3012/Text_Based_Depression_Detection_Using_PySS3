I cant do itI was just writing my suicide note and realized something. I cant do this. It would be wrong. After my mom has spent so long keeping me alive and healthy, i cant just throw away all her efforts. She is already clearly depressed yet she shows her best self to me and always keeps me happy. As much as i want to leave this world, i cant let her efforts go to waste and ill keep *at least* living for her
