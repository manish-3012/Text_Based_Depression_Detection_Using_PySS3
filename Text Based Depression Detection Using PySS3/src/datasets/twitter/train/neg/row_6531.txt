Why do I have suicidal thoughtsThis isn't my first time to have these last year I put a gun in my mouth and pulled the trigger but it didn't fire. I was put in a psychiatric ward for a month and have felt okay u ntill about three weeks ago. Everything just started to fall apart around me I haven't slept in about 4 days. The only reason that keeps from doing it. I dont want my fiance to be hurt but I just cant keep up this act I put on I dont have anyone to talk to I dont want to talk to anyone close to me because I dont want to go back to the hospital I just want this feeling to go away
