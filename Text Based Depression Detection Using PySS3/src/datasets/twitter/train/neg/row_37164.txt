I refuse to keep living anymoreSeriously I'm done. Nothing can make me change my mind. Family and friends? Fuck em. In a sense I want to die just to hurt them, the only thing I'll miss is their reactions to it. It'll be hilarious if I could see them crying their hearts out because they miss me so much.

I never cared about anyone but myself so this makes it all the more perfect. I don't plan on living past 25. All I need is a way to die. Maybe I'll get lucky and get run over by a train or speeding car or get cancer or something. Maybe I might even get murdered.

The possibilities are endless but they bring about an end! Ironic huh? Wow I am losing my sanity.
