We arenâ€™t all made to be.I am ready to go.

Short and simple. You think someone would get that if you told it to someone? Iâ€™ve told someone close to me how I was feeling. They sounded like they understood and cared. The next day it was like we never talked.

I am so ready to go. I canâ€™t bare the pain anymore. Everything I do is a joke. Everything I say is a joke. Everything I am is a joke. I simply canâ€™t bare my pain anymore.

Some say I have my whole life ahead of me. But I donâ€™t want to even imagine. Just knowing how long and hard I have struggled my life so far. I would not be able to handle any longer.

I am unhappy. But to everyone else itâ€™s a joke.
I simply cannot handle my life anymore.

Iâ€™ve been told it gets better. But it hasnâ€™t and it wonâ€™t.

Iâ€™m laying next to the person who I thought loved me.
Life is a god damn lie. 
I have been distancing myself and I am going to end my relationships tomorrow.

Tomorrow night Iâ€™ll be finally happy.

I have no one else to talk to in my life without them thinking nothing of it.

Tomorrow night Iâ€™ll FINALLY be happy.
