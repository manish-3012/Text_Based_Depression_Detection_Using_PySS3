Iâ€™m tired causing pain towards people who I care aboutEvery since I got into a temporary break all hell broke lose. I canâ€™t eat, think, be happy and etc. Iâ€™m planning my own death at the Jan 5. Today my best friend knew the situation and it make me feel such a scumbag for making him sad. And I hate myself for making well now my ex girlfriend feel pain because I keep talking about it. I donâ€™t want them to suffer anymore. However, I canâ€™t stop thinking how much trouble I cause them.  I donâ€™t even deserve to live anymore.
