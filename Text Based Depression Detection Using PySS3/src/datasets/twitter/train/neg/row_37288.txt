My friend tried to blow his brains out then a miracle happened.The gun misfired and he took that as some sign he should keep on living. He is also an avid gun enthusiast, so that pretty much rules out any problems with the gun. 

I don't know how many years ago this was. He is now a pretty happy guy and engaged to be married and my life would have been lesser for not meeting him. 

Just thought I would share this miracle (atheists don't get on me, I am one of you too, it's a figure of speech for situations like this)

[EDIT] Christians or other religious people please don't get on me either.
