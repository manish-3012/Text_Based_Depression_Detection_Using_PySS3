Sitting in the parkI'm not writing this in particular to get responses but more so to let others know, who are going through something similar, that we are all connected. Even if it's in this screwed up way.

I'm sitting in the park at 9 at night. I just ate my favorite frozen yogurt. It may be the last time. I don't know. 

I feel guilty for thinking that life went from pretty good, to feeling truly like a cruel joke. I feel guilty for not being strong or brave enough to care on. 

I'm not mad. I didn't piss people off. I don't hate myself. I'm broken from 6 months of one unbearable thing after another. If there is a God, he/she must want me up there. I'm sad more than anything. I'll miss this earth, these people, and beautiful moments like a quiet night at the park. Thank you for reading.
