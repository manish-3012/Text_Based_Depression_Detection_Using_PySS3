Even when I'm not depressed, I think about blowing my brains out with a gun all the time.When ever I'm at work and I close my eyes because I'm board or have a headache, that's what I think of. 

Nothing matters. Nothing can change. It's too late for me and no one cares. Men exist to be worked to death or die in a battlefield. There is no point in dreaming about anything else. It would be better to just kill myself now.
