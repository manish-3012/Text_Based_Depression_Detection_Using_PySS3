Because...This is how it feels. More understanding and less judgement, please.So what I made plans for tomorrow! So what, what I told you today?


Cuz damn I can't make up my mind, and maybe I just don't want to stay.


And fuck, where is the passion?Â  Jesus where is my fight?


Maybe I had hope for tomorrow, but right now I can't see the light.


I can't see the me of the future.Â  I can hardly hear myself cry.


The tomorrow I thought would be nearer, in my heart is only a lie.


I thought the sun would be brighter.Â  I thought it would all go away.


The further I reach for an answer, less is more and I'm starting to I fray.


The clouds in my head are just darker, and the banks of my heart overflow.


You act like you get it, but quit it.Â  Because I don't act like you actually know.


I'm errording apart at the seams, and nothing is ever the same.


Sleep, the sleep, it could come faster, and the sun it could set everyday.


A rainbow may shine in the darkess, but a dream is just a dream anyway.


My heart will always hurt harder, tears will fall in each frame.Â Â 


I rome free somewhere into nowhere, with emotions I just cannot take.Â Â 


I walk with a look in my eyes, if you even tried couldn't tell it was fake.


Come on, for the love of almighty. Why can't I just figure this out.


If I could I would just tell you. But I can't describe what this is even about.


Unhappy, unhappy is unhappy.Â  Change my "attitude" is all you can say.


Just step back and shut your face.Â  You're not helping me or anyone, so swallow that damn cliche.Â
