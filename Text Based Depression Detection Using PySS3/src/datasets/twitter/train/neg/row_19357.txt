I CAN'T HANDLE IT ANYMORE... I'M GONNA KILL MYSELF RIGHT NOW!The suicide hotline basically hanged up on me and told me that "We're not counselors."

My Suicide text line has been in limit because I was texting too much and I can't text for a week.

I opened up to My Parents and they told me "People have it worse than you do."

I don't have friends.

It's 5 AM in my place... AND I HAVE A SHOELACE AND A KNIFE... I WANT TO HANG AND STAB MYSELF.
