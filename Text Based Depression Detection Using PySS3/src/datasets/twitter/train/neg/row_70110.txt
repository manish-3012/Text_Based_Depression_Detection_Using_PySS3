Suicide thoughtsThis feeling of just commenting suicide has come up more than ever now to the point where I'm just like fuck it I want to kill myself mainly to that I have failed most things in life and no matter how hard I try the outcome never comes to my way. I'm an 18 yr old high school dropout who doesn't do anything with his life other than sit at home and eat even though I'm skinny, I just feel so depressed and just no energy to do anything productive it kills me on the inside. I don't have any friends most of the time I talk to myself which is messed up i don't know what to do.
