I wrote a note, why am I such a babyI wrote a goodbye note last night, and I have two plans figured out. But dying scares me. Not the dying part, but whatever the hell comes after. I just wanna die and see nothing, feel nothing...nothing. As a Christian I believe in heaven and hell, and obviously I wanna go to heaven, but I'd rather just die and go nowhere. Why am I such a baby that I cant just leave the note and follow through with it
