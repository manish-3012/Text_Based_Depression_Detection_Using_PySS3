going to miss the only real goal I set in 2019 about 7 months or so ago I told myself that if I am still unemployed and worthless human trash living under my parents roof that I would do myself a favor and kill myself. my birthday in about a week was the date I set to die by, but I as much as a try to plan out my death and however  many ideas I have, I cant seem to follow through. I don't even have the motivation to kill myself, I was thinking I could go out peacefully if I got my hands on some helium or nitrogen but I live with my parents I barely have a couple hours to myself when my parents are at work and I just use the time to lay around and be a sad worthless piece of shit so I can seem productive and not depressed when my parents come home. I hate being alive, I hate applying for jobs day in and day out knowing full well that I am human garbage that doesn't even deserve a peaceful death let alone a rejection letter written by a human. I need to die there is nothing left for me here. all my dreams of moving out having a decent job or transitioning to live as a woman are dead. I feel like a husk of a human I should die already, but I guess I am going to miss my expiration date I set for myself, so I exist to serve my parents eat food and shit. happiness was always an illusion anyway idk "I" need to exist like I wish there was some way to just turn me into a flesh robot so I can not exist but the people around me are satisfied, so they wont be ashamed and disappointed at me, their worthless 20 something stupid fucking child. if anybody can dm me tips on obtaining inert gasses to kill myself in nyc that would be nice.
