I ruined my relationship with my best friendI wrecked it all, I took her for granted.. and now sheâ€™s gone, Iâ€™m never going to see her again.. she was more than a best friend to me, she was all the family members I never had and sheâ€™s home, and it hurts so unimaginably fucking much.. if I could Iâ€™d do something to try and get this pain away, but I canâ€™t do anything. I canâ€™t drink, I canâ€™t cut, I canâ€™t fucking do anything.. I canâ€™t live with this and all Iâ€™ve been doing is lying here with thoughts of suicide swirling round my head.. but I canâ€™t even do that, I canâ€™t swallow the pills... Iâ€™ll never forgive myself, Iâ€™ll never find anyone like her again
