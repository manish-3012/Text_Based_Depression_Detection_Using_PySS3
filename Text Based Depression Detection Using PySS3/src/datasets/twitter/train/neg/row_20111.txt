AnnoyanceI'm right now 16 and gonna be 17 in few days. I'm usually happy in some days but now i'm starting to think my life is good anymore. 

I was bullied when i was young and over the time i had troubles keeping friends. I moved quite a lot too, so never got permanent friends. Usually in a lot of my new schools i had friends but over time they left me. i started eating less and less. I never got treatment since my parents saw me as a happy child (most of the times) and i didn't have money for any type of therapy. 

I was mostly alone. When i'm with my "friends" i would usually not talk at all or even ignore them - most of the times i would be in the library just trying to enjoy studying.

Now studying is useless to me after SAT came. 

SAT schools just let made me down currently. 

My parents are "lenient", but sometimes they do get in my way (hence the title - annoyance). Yes i love them, but i just feel most of the times they are bothering me - they just randomly talk about my square face, my height is too short apparently for this world (i'm 174 cm rn) and that if i don't get a good SAT Score, i would be practically useless and won't get into a good college.

(Also my parents are "lenient" asians)

I don't know. I had thoughts of suicide since i was little, and now it feels like everyday i'm hearing myself to suicide. 

I don't know but i just feel alone.
(Not feeling too suicidal, but getting thoughts more and more)
