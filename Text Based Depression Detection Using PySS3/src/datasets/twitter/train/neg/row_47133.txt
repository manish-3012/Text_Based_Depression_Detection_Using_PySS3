Desperate to DieI wish my parents had just let me die when I was born. I was a 24 week preemie. I wasn't supposed to live, and yet against my will and at the consequence of immense suffering, the doctors kept me alive. I'm 25 now, and I feel that my life is just beyond salvageable. I wasn't able to get my driver's license because of the health issues that have plagued me due to the circumstances of my birth. Not being able to drive has left me completely dependent on others for transportation, which has greatly limited my employment options. I went to college, but my degree is all but worthless. I'm enrolled in a different degree now, but I feel so woefully unprepared and inadequate compared to my classmates. I can't even afford to move out. Everything just feels beyond me, and I'm so behind in life. I intend to kill myself, but I'm not sure if I can wait until October. For once, I just need something to go right...
