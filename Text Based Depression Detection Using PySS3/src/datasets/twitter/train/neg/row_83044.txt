Hey, guys. I just have a question.(UK) if I attempt suicide while on probation &amp; fail, will I be recalled to prison? I want to die, but truthfully, I don't want to do it in prison. They make it a little more difficult &amp; when you tell the other guys you want to die, they make it as though it's their mission to make you do so.
