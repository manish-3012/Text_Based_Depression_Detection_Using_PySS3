ExpiredIt breaks my heart that I canâ€™t emotionally be with someone because of my illness. I donâ€™t know what it is in me that shuts down, but I do notice it. I canâ€™t let myself out for anyone and it hurts because Iâ€™m so big on strong connections. I want to be close with this person. I want to be near them. But I also donâ€™t. And I donâ€™t know how to stop. I try to end it and I try to make them go away but they just donâ€™t get it. They donâ€™t understand how hopeless I really I am. Theyâ€™re so optimistic and in reality Iâ€™m just getting worse. So much worse. Iâ€™m a fucking empty mess and Iâ€™m so tired of hurting and going through this cycle. My moods feel like Groundhog Day and I want it to be over already. I hurt so badly my insides are fucking aching. Being stuck in the house for weeks alone isnâ€™t helping either, I think Iâ€™m losing it. I miss my family that misses me and I wish the family that doesnâ€™t, would. I got a new prescription and I just want to down the whole fucking bottle. I hate myself.
