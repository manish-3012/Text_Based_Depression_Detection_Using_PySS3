Daily suicidal thoughts..F 28. I'm tired.

Tired of using the little amount of energy I have left to tackle my mental struggles.
Tired of desperately building up a mental barrier in my head against negative thoughts and images. My mental barrier is like a shitty, rickety old fence that's not strong enough to take the force ..it falls down most days.
Tired of the physical effects the stress is having on my body. The fatigue, the eczema, the scratching, the pounding heart, the poor appetite, The lack of motivation. The list goes on.
I'm tired of crying every day. It makes my makeup run. (Makeup, a safety blanket in a way to me). Smudged makeup from the tears leads to my Body Dsymorphia being triggered and like a domino effect, it makes me suicidal. I, however, am depressed and lack the motivation to do my makeup. In circles I go.

I am no longer able to deal with even the smallest problem or obstacle in my life. Drop my phone? Kill yourself. Paranoid I came across talking to someone too awkwardly in the street? Kill yourself. Left it too late to have dinner. What's the point anymore.

I obsess because of OCD. I can't let things go. I can't move on. I can't shrug it off. I can't just plug my playstation controller in to charge.. I must do it correctly, without breaking the USB in side. Let's just check it's not broken a third time yeah? Crazy. I know.

I'm going to worry about this post and feel guilty for whoever has to read it. 

This is mental torture. This isn't a life. I'm sorry for complaining.
