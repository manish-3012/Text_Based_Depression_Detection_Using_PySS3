i'm autistic; the girl i love doesn't love my back; i don't have any friends; i don't care for my family and they don't care for mei've wanted to kill myself for the last 5 years and i doubt i'll ever end up doing it but i really don't see a reason not to

life dealt me a shitty  fucking hand and i can never catch a god damn break

i thought tonight might be the night that things go in my favor, but life slapped me in the face and reminded me that will never happen

jesus fucking christ
