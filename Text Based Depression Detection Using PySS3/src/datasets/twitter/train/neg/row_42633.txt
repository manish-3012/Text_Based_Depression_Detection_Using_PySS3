I need to die right now. Right now.My best friend and the guy that I wanted to spend my life with is going to commit suicide. He really wants nothing to do with me now and only talks to me for my benefit. He's in a different country, so I can't see him. I've poored everything I have into trying to help this man over the past year. I've lost myself. I'm completely gone. I'm gone. I'm just a shell. I've cried and yelled to myself, had panic attacks, not been able to sleep, woken up in panics. I never know if he's alive or dead. I have trouble getting in contact with him. 

(PLEASE. do not tell me to call the authorities on him. Please just don't bother if you're going to respond with that. I'm sorry, but please. It's more complicated than that.) 

I can't make it through the night. 

In top of all of that, my future is bleak. 

I have no job prospects

I've dropped out of college at least 5 times. I have a lot of debt from it. I'm 22 and should have graduated this past spring. 

I don't want to work. I can't do it. I'm too mentally ill with 24/7  dissociation, head pressure, BPD, BDD, depression, and anxiety. I'm scared to leave the house. I don't qualify for disability and I doubt I'll get in SSI either. 

My unemployment insurance hasn't come for the past three weeks and I don't know why. 

I just realized I never dropped classes that I registered for and now I have to pay more money.

I'm completely dependent on my dad and I shouldn't be. It's not fair to him. I'm a burden. 

I blown through my money with reckless spending. 

I don't have anyone I can talk to. I'm alone. I'm so lonely. 

I don't have the strength to do anything to do these tasks or to do anything thing to better myself.  

I can't clean up after myself and hardly have the energy to feed my dog.  

I'm going to the drug store and getting zzquil with pain reliever and I'm going to chug it so maybe I can sleep. I hope I don't wake up.
