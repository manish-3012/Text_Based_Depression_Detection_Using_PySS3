One of those nights......where I wish I was dead.

I don't know why. I'm not REALLY depressed. Maybe a combo of chronic illness (Crohn's, ileosotomied, and having to deal with that as a gay dude), spontaneous illness, not creatively expressing myself enough, my best friend being an asshole to the point that screaming at him how much I wish he would care 10 minutes more to not view me as a disposable commodity and do something nice for me or say something nice to me, and not investing enough in myself, along with being high.

I just wish I was dead. Want it to be done.
