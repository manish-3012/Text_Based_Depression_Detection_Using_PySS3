I just noticed that my long distance vision in the right eye is blurredI recently noticed that when I close my left eye, I'm unable to see any long distant object. It all appears blurred. This shit is scaring me now, I'm panicking. Few months ago my vision was perfectly fine. I'm having fear of turning blind or not being able to see anything clearly
