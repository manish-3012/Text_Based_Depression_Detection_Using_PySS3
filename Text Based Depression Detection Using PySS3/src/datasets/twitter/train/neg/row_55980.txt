I had a dream a year ago about me killing myselfA year ago I dreamt that I shot myself it was so vivid. It was a lot like the scene in Fight Club with the narrator. Lately, I've been having the dream again and again. I remember the details, the sounds, everything. I've had some things happen lately where I just feel like giving up. I feel terrible, some days are better than others but I just don't want to be here anymore. I just don't want to feel like this anymore. I wish I could go back in time. I wont do it, but I keep having thoughts...
