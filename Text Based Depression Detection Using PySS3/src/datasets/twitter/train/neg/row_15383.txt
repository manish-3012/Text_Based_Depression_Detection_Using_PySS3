I am not going to make it to my next birthday. It's this Thursday.My life started off bad. I was born to drug addicted high school drop outs. My aunt adopted me only to get me out of that situation. She loved me in her own way. It wasn't the love I needed. I have always been a doormat for others. I give everyone everything they need in hopes that it would be reciprocated one day. That day has come and gone so many times and still no one is willing to help me. I have poured my self in to career, family, friends. What has set me off if that I have tried to makes something happen for my daughter. Not only for her benefit but, children around her. I was removed from the project from someone I thought was close. I was good at this. I am still good at this. No one cares enough about me or what I work hard for. I have always been someone's burden and when I finally find something I am good at, I a told I am no longer welcome....in a project I started. Few have reached out to me (mostly because they want some drama to talk about) and I don't think anyone is sincere. They are too busy with their own lives to worry about me and why should they?
