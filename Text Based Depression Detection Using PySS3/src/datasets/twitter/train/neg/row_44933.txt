Iâ€™m just so empty on the insideItâ€™s eating me from the inside out. That feeling of loneliness just adds onto the numerous regretful decisions Iâ€™ve made. I canâ€™t stand it anymore, or else I think Iâ€™m gonna go crazy. Iâ€™m planning on downing a few bottles of Advil PM or NyQuil. I cut my wrist earlier today, but I guess it was pretty shallow cuz it was stinging and hurting a lot. I tied a tea towel on the cut to stop the bleeding. But  Iâ€™m planning to OD instead. Lifeâ€™s not worth living anymore for me. Iâ€™m sorry.
