Iâ€™m going to commit soon because of the way I look. I genuinely wonâ€™t be happy ever looking how I look so thereâ€™s no point. Nothing happening &gt; Being unhappy, I think everyone would agree with that.I canâ€™t live my life with the face and body I have. Some people might just be able to accept it, but personally I canâ€™t. Itâ€™s not because of how other people think I look, or how others treat me, because I really donâ€™t care if people want to treat me bad. Itâ€™s just how I feel about myself.
Iâ€™ll not just saying it to be dramatic, but I donâ€™t respect myself because of the way I look.

Looks are extremely important to humans, itâ€™s in our nature. Iâ€™ll never like myself because I canâ€™t accept the way I look. 

It fucking pains me that it has come to this, because I know how good life can be if you like yourself and like the way you look. And I know I am definitely missing out on a whole lot of good shit, but Iâ€™ll never have that good shit, even if I continue living, so for me, itâ€™s better to just stop. 

I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m making any sense whatsoever at this point. My mind is just so frustrated, angry, confused and depressed that I feel like I canâ€™t even explain how Iâ€™m feeling.
