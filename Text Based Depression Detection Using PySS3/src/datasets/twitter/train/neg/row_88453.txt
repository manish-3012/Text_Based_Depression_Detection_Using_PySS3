kinda wanna neck myself but i donâ€™t have the energy or strength to, plus im just a fuckin pussy soi dunno i guess iâ€™ve just lost who i was, i donâ€™t eat, constantly vomit, self harm, panic. adhd medication doesnâ€™t help, just feel tired of being used by people who i think are friends. iâ€™ve got less than a year left of school before college but my grades are not where i want them, and my will to work is so far from my ability to follow through...

for now i just do the shit i need to and sit around wondering what the point is

i just want to reach out to who i was and give them the biggest hug before turning them in a different direction.
