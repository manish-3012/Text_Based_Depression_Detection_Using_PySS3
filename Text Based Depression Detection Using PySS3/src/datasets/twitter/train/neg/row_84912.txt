Suicidal from relationship anxiety please helpSuicidal because of relationship anxiety please help

Iâ€™m 21. Iâ€™m a university student. Iâ€™ve suffered from depression and anxiety since I was 14. Iâ€™ve attempted suicide once 2 years ago. 

Iâ€™ve been in 2 relationships; I had loads of problems with my ex and thatâ€™s when I first ended up in hospital for attempted suicide. The boyfriend who I have just broken up with I had been with for just over 2 years. We were perfect together and we had a lot of plans for the future but we already had some deep seated issues that pop up every now and then and now theyâ€™ve got so bad weâ€™ve broken up. 

I canâ€™t bear it. Every time something bad happens with a partner I have to end my life, I canâ€™t live without them. I have no friends, no support network. I feel like a failure. Iâ€™m broke. Iâ€™m an anxious mess every single day and thereâ€™s no hope of things getting better for me. Iâ€™ve been through many therapists, been on medication, tried meditation, yoga, taking each day as they come. I always told myself that things would get better but they never have. Iâ€™m so tired. Iâ€™m alone. Iâ€™m scared. 

I donâ€™t want to end my life but I feel as though Iâ€™m trapped and have no other choice. Please someone help me with my decision. I need an easy peaceful way to commit, preferably in my sleep. Iâ€™ve researched and most ways are out of my reach. I ODâ€™d last time and I survived.
