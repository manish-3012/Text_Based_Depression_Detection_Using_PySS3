And its back :[The feeling to die. I know it unrelated to my breakup because I am over it. I feel great. Just every night around 6 or 7 it hits. I want to die. I OD last night and lived and seem fine. I don't want to get to that point again. I know its slow for people to respond but I thought some potenital help might be helpful.
