Nobody KnowsNobody knows how bad off I am right now, and have been for the past several months. I have gotten really good at hiding the fact that I feel like I just can't do this anymore. 

I have screwed up my life to the point that I'll never be able to fix myself. I'm very overweight, I can't find a job after I got fired from the last one I had, and even though I got the chance to go back to school I failed three classes this semester. Plus, I'm in so much debt right now from medical stuff that's happened that I know there's no way I'll ever recover from this. 

What's the point in living if I can't take care of myself? I'm just a burden on everyone who knows me. I feel so guilty having to take from everybody all the time. 

I'll never have my life in order, and I'm too fat and ugly to ever have a relationship and fall in love. So what's the point?

I'm really reaching my breaking point, here. I'm almost at peace with my decision to end it. Almost.
