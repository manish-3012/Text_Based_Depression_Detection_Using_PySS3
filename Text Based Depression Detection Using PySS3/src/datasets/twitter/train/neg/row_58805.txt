If I get fired from my job I'm done.Throwaway because I think one of my coworkers may know my actual account.

After years of failing at everything, sucking at every job I've ever had, and feeling so hopeless in life, I got hired last month in a warehouse doing what has turned out to be an amazing job with amazing people.  I thought everything was going perfectly until last week when I got called into HR.  Some woman who's job isn't even in my section complained that I was walking around a bunch and implying that I'm not doing my job.

Firstly, my job is messy - the kind where I work with chemicals and have to wash my hands every hour because they get so dirty.  My area ran out of soap so I've had to run to the bathroom a bunch for the past week and a half to wash my hands.  Secondly, there's a water cooler on the other side of the warehouse that I use often because my mouth is always SUPER dry and I'm always thirsty.

Thirdly, the person who reported me doesn't even know my fucking name.  I was told that someone said ***verbatim*** *"New guy, I don't know his name, is walking around a lot".*

So anyway I get called into HR with a supervisor who tells me that I'm to be effectively micromanaged going forward.. which isn't necessary because I'm great at my job (literally everyone I work with is giving me positive feedback and I've had 0 complaints) and it just puts a target on my back and puts me on the chopping block.

1 month in.  1 month into a job I can see myself doing for 20+ years and I'm already on the chopping block.

I've met some amazing people and made some good friends here, and if I get fired I'm fucking finished.  There's nothing left for me if I don't have this job.  My living situation is shit, my money situation is shit, and I'm so angry and sad all the fucking time.  

If I get axed from this job, I'm writing a note, donating all of my belongings, and putting an end to all this.
