No idea how this us going to endSo basically me and my gf broke up, she acted like she still wanted to be friends but I said no, about a week goes but and she texts me a meme, I assume she meant to send it to someone else so I asked her but she said she doesn't make mistakes. A couple weeks pass and I have course start to worry about her because I pretty much worry about her all the time we're both pretty depressed suicidal people so I start texting her that I miss her and she doesn't respond at all so of course I just makes me worry more another weeks pasts I keep texting her on different things trying to make sure she's OK but I don't get anything back from her and then I get on Steam and I found out she unfriended me which is whatever but I texted her that I was worried about her and that I was going to start cutting myself because I'd rather be doing that stuff wearing if she's OK or not.
More time passes and I'm not sure if it's just to Courtney or she's dead or something and basically I can't take it anymore and I just left work I'm on my way to her house and I don't know how this conversation is going to go I'm not even sure what I just what I want to say I just want to be like why make me go through all the pain I've just ignore me like I rather you say that you hate me then just ignore me like that. So basically I'm on my way to her house and I know she lives 100 people so I don't even know if she'll be there or if they'll let me see here a while but I don't really have a reason to live right now.
And depending on what's gonna happen I'm just gonna find someway to end it all and just be done.

I need help. But I can't get it I know.

Sorry I know this post mess I'm on my way back I said so I'm just doing this with the speech to text thing on my phone so I'm sure it's a mess I'm sorry
