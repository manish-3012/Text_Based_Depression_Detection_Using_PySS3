There really isn't any pointI don't have a particularly bad life or anything but life is just pointless. I've got too many problems and I just can't be bothered to fix them, it would probably take a decade of therapy. 

Life is full of ups and downs and the ups are never worth the downs. And sure things could miraculously get better this year even though they haven't for the last 20 odd but why take that risk?

Ive been reading on minimum lethal dosages and I've nearly decided how exactly im going to go, and no medical assistance will save me so ill be good, I just need to figure out a way to make sure I don't vomit the meds up, and that I pass out before things start to hurt. 

My apathy towards life isn't something you can fix, and most things I have fixed in my personality are just me learning how to fake feeling that way, I still don't. Thanks for reading and goodnight
