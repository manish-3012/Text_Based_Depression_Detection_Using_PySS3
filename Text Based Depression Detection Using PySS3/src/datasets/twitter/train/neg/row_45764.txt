I really need helpI just want it all to stop but it always fucking stays in my head and I feel like every thingâ€™s crashing down on me.              I feel guilty because thereâ€™s millions of people in this world who struggle and have a rights to be sad but Iâ€™ve had everything in my 16 years and never struggled once! I just want someone to tell me itâ€™s gonna be okay but i see no future. Can someone just tell me what to do because I feel really fucking hopeless at the moment.
