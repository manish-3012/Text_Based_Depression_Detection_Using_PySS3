I just canâ€™t take it anymore.Itâ€™s hard for me to admit it but Iâ€™m a pathological liar.
Every relationship romantic or just friend Iâ€™ve ruined them. Itâ€™s hard to stop and people say I just do it because I want to. I donâ€™t. 
I know what I want but my emotions just make me say something or do something I donâ€™t want to. And just after I realise what Iâ€™ve done and it haunts me forever.
Iâ€™ve have looked into professional help and they say I might have bpd. Itâ€™s hard to cope with life at this point when u wake up hating what u did. Not getting to forgive urself. 
I go home I cry, go to bed cry, school, work anything I just cry. I seem to get no joy in anything anymore.
Iâ€™m afraid of being alone but I still make myself alone because of the lying. 
I fucking hate myself and I want to end it but Iâ€™m scared. Scared of death and if I even deserve it. Seems like an easy way out but i keep going towards it. Everyday I think of it and prepare for it.
Have enough medication pills and can get my hands on drugs that I could just od on.
I donâ€™t care how painful it would be. I just want it to be the end of me
