How do you open up to loved ones about suicidal thoughts?I don't know why I feel suicidal sometimes but I do. I don't want to die but lots of times I don't want to live my life. I have a steady job and am in a long-term relationship. My mother loves me dearly. I should be grateful for the life I have. Yet, ever since I was 20 I have more and more of these thoughts.


How can I talk with my loved ones about my feelings? I fear telling anyone in my family because my father and my uncle both committed suicide so it's a sensitive subject. I'm worried if I tell my friends they'll think I'm just seeking attention. I don't want to tell my girlfriend because, though she may take me seriously, I think she won't know how to help and it'll only make her feel helpless. I'm scared to seek professional help and others in my life may find out and I'd be judged.


I try to remain optimistic and hope the future will bring better days. But as time passes it seems less and less so. Even if nobody ever reads this, I'm glad to have an outlet for my feelings. Thank you if you did read this.
