I've tried the last two nightsToday my ex boyfriend was like, have you thought of the possible damage you've done internally that you may not know about for years? So that helped. He moved out 6 months ago while we worked on ourselves and worked toward getting back together. I've set us back so far in the last two days. I have BPD and I have meltdowns all the time where I scream a lot and cry a lot. Last week I started going to a DBT center, but I'm not going back until January because I'm going home for Christmas. I feel so unstable.

I mix gabapentin with alcohol so I'll go into a coma. It's really dumb.
