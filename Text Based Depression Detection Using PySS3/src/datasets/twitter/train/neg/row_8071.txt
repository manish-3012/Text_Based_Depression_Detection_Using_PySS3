There's no hope for meI can't do anything right or on time. I'm so depressed and anxious that it affects my ability to even feed myself. This is no life to keep living. I have no job, no money, all I can do is depend on others and I hate it so much. Nobody will hire because I have no experience. I've not even been given a chance. I've got medication but its an SSRI, and I'm already on the highest dose. Its expensive and I have to borrow money from others to get it. I've asked about being switched before but I've only ever gotten increases. There are no options left for me.
