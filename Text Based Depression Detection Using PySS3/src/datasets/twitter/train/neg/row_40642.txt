I don't want to be nice anymoreThe title looks shady, I get it. 


Hi I'm just another 17yo who had a break up yesterday (not gonna go into details here). I am a simple guy who just want simple things, but how's life going right now it doesnt even matter anymore. Working hard for physical fitness would directly be followed by an accident or two, working hard for love would be followed by misunderstandings, mistakes, other people getting in between my relationship, focusing on studies would directly be followed by my family forcing me to go on a 3 day trip. 

You see nothing ever goes my way even I so desperately try to make things right. My mental peace is scarred, and I still be nice to people without considering my own health. Ik it's easy to hurt yourself than to hurt others but sometimes I feel like a doormat who's letting people walk over him, again and again. I get that human's are not perfect, I get that people make mistakes, all I ask for is them to learn and change from their previous mistakes, but why would they? I only gave them a faint smile saying it's okay when they did it so they did it again and again.

I also understand you people have troubles of your own so I would conclude that I'm not suicidal and won't harm myself, but it would really mean alot if some of you took some time for me. Thankyou.
