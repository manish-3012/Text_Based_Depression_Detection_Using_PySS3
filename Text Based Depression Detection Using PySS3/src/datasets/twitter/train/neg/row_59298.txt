It will break my beloved parents hearts in two forever ðŸ’”They have been the most loving, supportive and understanding parents I could ever ask for.

They hug me, feed me, take me to treatment and I absolutely adorn them. 

But it's not enough. And it's not their fault. I suffer from an incurable physical condition and it has gotten to the point where my suffering has outstripped my will to love.  I have set a date. 

But I know it will break their hearts forever. I never ever intend for that to happen. I don't think I can forgive myself.
