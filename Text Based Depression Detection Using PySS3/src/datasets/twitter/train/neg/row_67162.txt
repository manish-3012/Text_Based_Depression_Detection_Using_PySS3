Does it sound live liver or kidney failure?So last friday I took around 35 ibuprofen, then sunday 40+ ibuprofen then Monday and Tuesday I took around 30 a mix of ibuprofen and paracetamol. Since then I have thrown up a few times, with blood but it's settled down but iv'e had bad stomach pain and it hurts if I make sudden movements, I found the gym hard today because of it. My back has started to hurt a lot and I'm bloated and my tummy is hard to the touch. I have been having hot and cold flushes and when I have cold ones I'm shivering. I can't really eat or even drink anything, even water is a struggle. My heart rate has been very high but my medication is helping as Iv'e finally been able to keep it down,any suggestions?
