Iâ€™m tired.I am so tired of saying Iâ€™m fine. I am so tired of being the happy funny person that people want me to be. Iâ€™m tired of constantly thinking about just disappearing. Iâ€™m tired of being scared. Iâ€™m tired of being treated like shit. Iâ€™m tired of being so alone. Iâ€™m tired of crying. Iâ€™m tired of feeling hopeless. Iâ€™m tired of feeling stuck. Iâ€™m tired of being scared to get help. Iâ€™m tired of being a disappointment to my daughter that Iâ€™m this way. Iâ€™m tired of having no one. Iâ€™m tired of the panic attacks. Iâ€™m tired of my chest hurting. Iâ€™m tired of the racing thoughts. I am just so damn tired. I am so tired of living.
