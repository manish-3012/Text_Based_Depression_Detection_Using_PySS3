I donâ€™t know what to do anymoreiâ€™m just a teenager and my life is not that bad. i go to a private school, and i live in an ok neighborhood. Tbh i have no clue why iâ€™m depressed. I finally worked up courage to tell my mom that i donâ€™t even want to live anymore and she seemed to care. I told her my plan. She has a lot of prescription drugs and i was gonna try to mix them and take way too many. They did what any parent would do. tell me they love me and they couldnâ€™t handle it if i died. Then immediately tried to get me on a pill.

i canâ€™t get anything done. i just have the urge to jump out of my window or slice my neck. now they just come in and ask me if iâ€™m ok. what am i supposed to say? during this whole corona virus the therapists have been closing. I have no way of getting help. My thoughts are just eating me up and i have no clue what to do. Itâ€™s all just so hopeless. 

I feel like my friends are gonna give up on me but i just donâ€™t have the energy to try. I am so exhausted and done. i donâ€™t feel like texting back and when i do itâ€™s dry. Depression is a lifelong battle and i donâ€™t know if i can do this my whole life. it would be so much better if i just end it now. 

also iâ€™m not trying to get attention i just feel like this is a safe place to talk. iâ€™ve been seeing a lot of people on here who have talked openly and i thought it would be nice to open up to people who would understand...
