I'm honestly suicidal, want to call out of work yet againI've called out numerous times in the past month I'd say. Almost once a week as well as yesterday. Small business store so not many people can really cover for me. I'm so fucking depressed and just simply do not want to go. I just don't. It sucks and I suck and I hate everything and it'd only make it worse
