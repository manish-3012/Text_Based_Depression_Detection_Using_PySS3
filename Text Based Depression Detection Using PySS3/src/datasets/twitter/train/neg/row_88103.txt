please lend me your ear (or don't)Some background: I have been going trough all kinds of hell ever since I was 10yo. Around that time, my grandmother killed herself after a life of being borderline/bipolar, and in the confusion that ensued, my parents got in to a deep marital crisis. This, combined with my already anxious personality, triggered my problems. (my parents are still togheter btw, they got over it)

I suffer from extreme attacks of anxiety, psycosis and depression, making my everyday life a challenge and, quite frankly, a big puddle of shit. This has all been growing and festering in me for 10 years (I am now 20yo). I only started to get help about a year ago, because my gf told me I needed it. I never told anybody, not even my parents, how I felt.

So, now I am in therapy, I got medication, and I try to tell more people what is going on inside my head. I know there is nothing that'll really keep people from killing themselves, I've been there. I attempted suicide once, and changed my mind last minute. I just want to point out that even though I cannot save any of you, I would like to talk to you if you need it. I know how much that helps, and I know how much it helped me.

Please, don't lose yourself and GET HELP. It doesn't matter what kind of help, talk to us here on reddit, call a doctor, find something you love and use it to help you keep sane. I am far from better now, but I feel the healing, and it is the best feeling ever.

Contact me if I can do anything, but mostly keep this in mind: if I, some dutch guy you never met, can do it, so can you.
