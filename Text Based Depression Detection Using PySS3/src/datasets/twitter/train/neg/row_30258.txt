Living with parents after job loss. Losing friends daily.Well, it's my first time here. 

It's surreal to have spent so much time working towards a better future, achieving, helping others achieve, helping others get work, but then suddenly be utterly useless to everyone around you.

I studied engineering, did very well. I managed to get into undergrad research, and excelled to the point when I was both a mentor for others as well as a paid member of a team.

I loved my work and I got along well with everyone, but last summer there was a fallout between myself and two others. Within five minutes, I went from measuring samples to being asked to leave for 'behavior'.

I'd like to say that I'm passed that day, but clearly it still weighs on me. If this were my only issue, I think I could lift myself out on my own. 

I started writing again a few months ago, as well as reading and other distractions. Finding a job is a high priority, but I can't help but be incredibly distrusting. The writing helped as a pass-time, but recently its overtaken my time and energy. 

So at this point I guess I'll go into the issues that make me post here:

* no gal

* no money

* no prospects

* no self-respect

* no visible future

The best I can hope for would be that I get a job, I pay off my loans, and I move out. But what then? I'll be on my own, still depressed, still five minutes away from losing said job. The best case scenario doesn't even motivate me, and that's the reason why I've had so few interviews in the past six months. 

What I would give to have enough success to retire off of dividends and never deal with people again.

Never deal with people again.
