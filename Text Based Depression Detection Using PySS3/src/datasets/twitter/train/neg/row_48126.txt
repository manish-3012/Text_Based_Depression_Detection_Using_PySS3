Trans woesIll never be able to transition. I feel like if i dont start soon its gonna be so difficult in my furture, especially health insurance wise. My mom wont even let me ask the doctors about it. And she wont listen to reason. She says hrt will makeme violent and depressed and its a phase and idk what i really want. Ive been wanting T for at LEAST three years now. Yeah my hair is short and i dress as andro as i can, but im misgendered constantly. Knowing that my mom knows and still wont make an effort to help me (even pronoun wise) feels awful. And the fact that my boyfriend says he'll always see me as more feminine bc we have sex makes me want to cut off my skin. (Otherwise hes *pretty* chill with me being trans). At least my therapist is trying to talk sense into my mom but i feel hopeless. Whats the point if i have to wait years and years to be able to really be myself? Whats the point in living if im constantly uncomfortable and want to curl up inside myself?
