Can anyone talk for a bit?I'm not sure if I should make this a post or not and if this is really how I should be doing it, but I really don't want to try and explain my situation to everyone out there, just have a conversation, and I don't want to go to another site because I feel much more comfortable on here with people I feel I can relate to. So if anyone has some time so I can talk, and listen if you have your own problems you want to tell someone, please message me.
