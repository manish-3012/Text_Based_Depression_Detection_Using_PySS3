At this point, I'm just delaying my deathI've always been kind of a depressed child, my family gave me a few traumas that led me to start hurting myself since I was 12 years old.

Ever since then everything had went downhill, I said to myself that I would kill myself when I turned 15, but since I'm a coward I never really went on with my plan. Then one night, after a particularly nasty fight with my mom, I got so tired of being here that I told her I was gonna kill myself right there and then, but when I went to grab the gun that my father keeps in their bedroom it wasn't there; my mom followed me there and she started mocking me, telling me that I was pathetic and whatnot. I guess that's the closest I've been to a suicide attempt.

My time during highschool was hell; it was sort of an 'elite' school, so it was very exhausting and demanding. My parents always expected me to bring home good grades, but they never really cared for my mental health. I planned to kill myself when I turned 18, just because my thesis was going so wrong I felt like a failure.

I finished my thesis and graduated, eventually, but since I've never planned to go this far I didn't know what I wanted to study in uni. I can't afford a tuition, and in my country, public university is really bad.

So right now I've been staying at home, trying to figure out what to do with my life and set up my future goals. But how can I do that when my mother keeps insulting me and telling me I will never accomplish anything in life? Everyday she says that I'm a good for nothing and I should at least provide for this house, and everyday I feel more and more numb. I can feel it, everything it's going to end very soon...
