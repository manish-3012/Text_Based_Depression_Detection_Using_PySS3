Today's my birthday , Life just keeps getting worse. I'm just sad , ashamed and disappointed.Two years ago , I decided to turn my life around and started working on building myself to be a better person . My Life went into a free fall, everything that could go wrong went wrong. 
My birthday last summer was one of the worst experiences of my life , my terrible decision making abilities left me without money and hungry for days. It was just so sad, it felt like I was watching someone else's experience.

I tried last summer to start figuring out ways to dig myself out of my mess, things just got worse. I just keep getting worse news every month. I had a very bad week and kept taking multiple bottles of sleeping pills hoping I don't wake up  but that did not work out. Instead I've had migraines for weeks, and feel sleepy all the time but can't sleep. Even today right before my birthday I get into another mess that I did not even cause.

I've also just declined as a person, I've become very much like my parents , practically a junkie  with a terrible personality. I have just destroyed so many things and never fix anything.  I'm literally running out of ideas of what my next step in life should be.

I  am going to spend the weekend in a motel and try to think but nothing ever works out, and I just keep thinking if I had just ended my life a while back , I won't have gone through this much pain.

Edit: And now I just started crying, my tears feel funny.
