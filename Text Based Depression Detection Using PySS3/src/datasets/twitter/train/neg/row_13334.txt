25 is a good run right?So somehow i've lived till now, but I think I'm going to withdraw all my cash from my chase bank account, drop it off at my brothers, see  my 4 month old niece, eat some sushi and then shoot myself halfway on the way home from where he lives.

Been a fun and not so fun ride, lots of stuff in my life that I can't remember for the life of me and also don't want to remember. The past is a blur. the present is bleak, and there will be no future. I used to think, "This too shall pass", but I don't think these past 15 years were really worth the experience. I hope you all have better night than I, and a better tommorow
