Im going insaneIm in year 8 and i feel like im going insane and wanna die. Theres 2 reasons. I've completely lost my innocence, theres so much messed up bull that im not supposed to know (pornography, drugs, just stuff a kid's not supposed to have any knowledge of). I constantly crave for moments where theres not any strippers, murders, drugs, abuse in my mind. I just want my childhood back. I act like an angel in front of my family and im scared how bad my parents would feel if they saw my dark side. I pull my hair and bang my head in the wall so i can stop thinking about this shit. Another reason i feel insane is because im so bored. I have no good friends that i can hang with and no good games to play. sometimes i'll catch myself playing with random shit like paper for hours on end. So this is my problem. Im sorry if this is childish (im a child). Is there anything I can do?
