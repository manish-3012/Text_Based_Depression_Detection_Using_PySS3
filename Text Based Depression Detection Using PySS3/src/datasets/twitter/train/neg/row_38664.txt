One death pleaseSorry, we can't do that.    
Why not?    
Because you're too scared.    
Oh. So I can't die?    
You can die. Just not right now.    
Oh.. so what am I supposed to do?    
How should I know? Live your life I guess...    
Live my life? How can I possibly do that?    
What do you mean?    
I mean, I can't seem to live my life. I'm constantly anxious and depressed.    
Oh.    
Oh indeed.    
So what do you want me to do about it?    
Give me death.    
I can't. As I said, you're too scared.    
So... do I just suffer?    
No, you could keep trying.    
I feel that's all I seem to be doing. It's exhausting.    
So what's worse? Trying and feeling exhausted, or being depressed and wishing you were dead?    
I don't know. It feels liberating to give up and wish for death...    
But that's not what you want is it?    
No.    
You'd prefer to try than give up really, right?    
Yeah.. but it's still exhausting.    
Then don't try too hard. Try a little bit at a time. You'll feel less exhausted, and less depressed surely?    
I suppose. Wouldn't that take longer?    
Longer than what?    
Longer than I'd like?    
Maybe, but I'm sure you'd also like to get where you want to be later than not at all.    
I suppose. Still makes me feel like a failure.    
Why?    
It feels like a race that I'm losing.    
Who are you racing against?    
Other people I guess.    
Who cares about other people?    
I do!    
Do you?    
Yes!    
Do you really?    
Yes... I think.    
Why does it matter to your life how fast they do something?    
I mean, it doesn't really...    
They're just doing their thing, and you should be doing yours. There is no race.    
Sure feels like it...    
That's probably because you see your old school friends on Facebook celebrating achievements and having fun.   
I do do that.    
No one puts on the mundane parts of their life. Only the best bits. You only see a glorified slice of their life.    
Really?    
Really. They're probably no different to you to be honest. We're all pretty much in the same boat.    
Oh. That helps to know actually.    
Just do you at your own pace and you'll be fine. You'll feel shitty sometimes, that's just part of the process.    
Is it?    
Yes. Do you always feel like you want to die every hour of every day? Or does it come and go like a wave?     
Comes and goes.    
These feelings aren't a true reflection of you. You're not a failure. You're just feeling down.    
Why though? Why can't i feel good?    
What, all the time?    
No, not ALL the time.    
What then, most of the time? Even that's a stretch.    
It is?    
Yup. Emotions are messy and fleeting. They don't sum up your life. They don't define you.    
So what do I do when I'm feeling like this?    
Just accept it. It feels bad, sure, but know that it'll pass. The time to achieve small goals is when I mood climbs again.    
Really?    
Yes. It's much harder in a bad state of mind. Take advantage of the good moods. Use them to improve yourself. You'll find you can do a lot if you put your mind to it.   
I guess I can try to do that.    
Even saying you're going to try is a small achievement and a great start. Keep climbing to the life you want, and don't give up when you feel down. It is temporary.    
What about setbacks?    
Setbacks?    
Yeah, like something big? Like losing your job, or someone close has died. That seems more that a simple mood swing.    
It's devastating yes, but those feelings pass too. If you can process what happened and learn to accept it, you'll find yourself climbing once more. It just takes longer than average. So, do you still want that death?    
Not as much.    
An improvement! Thats another small achievement. Keep noticing those and you'll be fine.    
Thanks.
