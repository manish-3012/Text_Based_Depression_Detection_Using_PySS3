Planning on killing myself in one hourI've just had enough of being stressed out and anxious. I just don't feel like living any more, I've really just had enough. I've felt this way for years, but not for a different reason. Previously it was just because I lacked the will, and much preferred the idea of death than life. Now it's due to stress and anxiety.

I'm only 17 years old and in highschool. I have a pile of work needing to be done, but I just procrastinate, I **hate** the work I need to do, and I avoid it. I'll end up being forced to slap something together the hour before and fail all my classes. It's either I end it here, or spend the rest of the year hating life, fail highschool then spend the rest of my life with a shitty job, hating life. 

I know my family will hate this, I understand, but they'll move on. I haven't even seen my mother in years, when she left me. I haven't spoken to my father in days, and even when we do talk, it's just generic things, and him making me attend school.

I don't really feel scared of death, I'm also fairly confident that my method will work. I plan on injecting 500+ units of rapid acting insulin - my father is a diabetic. 

In about an hour I'll inject the insulin, then lie down and die watching one of my favorite movies, fall asleep then never wake up, it actually sounds perfect to me.

Not really sure why I'm posting this, I guess I just want someone to talk to about it before I go through with it...
