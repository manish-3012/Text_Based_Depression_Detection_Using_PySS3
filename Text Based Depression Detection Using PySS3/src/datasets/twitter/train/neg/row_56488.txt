Just a stupid boy?Hi Reddit, this account is a throwaway account so there's not much to me on here.  I just don't know what to do. I've been suicidal before and have harmed myself before.  I thought I was past it and I was doing so well at moving forward but now I am not so sure.  My boyfriend and I of four years broke up (it was mutual) and I was doing really well until something happened completely unrelated.  I just had a bad day and then my emotions went wild and now I know it was all a mistake.  I don't see a point to living without him.  I don't want to sound like a cliche or a dumb girl but love is a strong feeling.  I am on Effexor 150 and I think it kinda helped me not feel things until today. I haven't seen things so clearly in so long and now I can't turn back time and fix things.  I don't know what to do and I'm sitting here at my computer figuring out if I should go on or not. I hate myself and I know people don't like me.  I hate my scars, I hate my body, I hate everything about me.  I think the fear of hell is holding me back.  I don't know what to do.  Help me please.
