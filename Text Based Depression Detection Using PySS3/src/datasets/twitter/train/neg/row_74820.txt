I though about hanging my selfI was washing the dishes earlier today because my mom asked me too when I came back from school. I was listening to some music and day dreaming about going to homr depot or something and buying a rope. From there I would go to a forest near by where I live and hanging myself there. While I was washing the dishes and day dreaming about my suicide attempt I was also thinking about how my suicide letter would go. 
I've been suicidal for months and the only way I've thought about ending it was through a drug overdose. I've never considered killing myself by hanging but im getting desperate and just want to die. It's quick and easy. I don't even know when I'll kill myself, probably next year. I just can't take school and life anymore. I can't find the motivation to do anything and I get made fun of that in my classes for not doing anything. My grades are shit now. I guess I'll just die young.
