What's the point?I've lived 28 years with social anxiety, hypochondria, General Anxiety Disorder, depression, and Asperger's Syndrome, and I'm just getting so tired of constantly having to fight against all of those different disorders. (Oh, and yes, I do see a therapist and take meds, but neither of those things are especially helpful for me anymore.)

Plus, my parents (who I live with) have anxiety disorders of their own, so we're all constantly triggering each other's anxiety without meaning to, which just causes a lot of underlying tension between us. 

And I can't just move out, because I live in a state with a very high cost of living (Massachusetts, to be specific), and I also haven't been able to get a full-time job after spending the past 5 years trying to do so, even though I have a college degree. (To be specific, I have a Bachelor of Science in English.)

So it really does seem like killing myself would be the best way out of this mess. I'm just goddamned motherfucking tired, and I need a break, but life doesn't seem to be willing to give me one.
