I want to be no one.I want to disappear. I donâ€™t know how but I do. Iâ€™ve never been good enough for anyone not even myself. This constant battle of trying to understand myself. I donâ€™t want to fight anymore. Iâ€™m $500 in debt and got no money. Iâ€™m tired of asking for help. Iâ€™m worthless. Iâ€™m weak minded. Iâ€™m pathetic. Iâ€™ve given up on almost everything in life. The things that once kept me wanting to live are barely holding on. I feel pathetic for even feeling this way. There is no way Iâ€™m going to be able to do this all by myself. Iâ€™m so far down the black hole with no one to pull me out. I canâ€™t do it by myself. Iâ€™m not strong as everyone makes me out to be. Iâ€™m so weak and no one can see it. I just want to disappear.
