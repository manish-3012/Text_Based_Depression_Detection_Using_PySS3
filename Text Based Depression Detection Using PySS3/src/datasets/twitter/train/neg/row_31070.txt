I've been thinking about suicide my whole life, now I'm not afraid to actually do it.I'm a black female.  My entire life I've dealt with racism, sexism, you name it.  I'm 25 years old and I've never dated anyone.  I've tried everything, but it's hopeless.  I'm lonely and I feel like no one will ever really know me.

I'm tired of feeling alone.  The only reason I haven't offed myself is because I don't want to hurt my family.  I really love them, and I don't want them to feel bad.  Still, it hurts to be so alone.  I just want a lover... I want what all the other girls get.  Why is that so much to ask for?  I'm a nice person, I work out and eat right, I'm pretty much open to dating anyone, but it never happens.

I feel like the world is a huge joke.  I'm just tired of waking up every day to the same punchline... What I see in the mirror.
