I am fucking doneI am going to drink and then try to kill myself. I am sick of living everyday with no hope, no love and no happiness. I am sick of ocd, anxiety, Aspergers and depression eating away at me like a disease. 22 is a long time on this shit rock, if you donâ€™t get the right genetics or get shit luck all the time life is fucking garbage.
