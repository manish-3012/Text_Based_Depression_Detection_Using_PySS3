I just want a way out of my bodyI canâ€™t stick to my weight loss goals 

I eat to much 

Iâ€™m repulsive to people because of my weight but especially men. They either ignore me or want to get away from me. 

I need to get out of this body and suicide is the only way. I just need to fucking commit but I canâ€™t fucking commit to anything if I could fucking commit to my diet I wouldnâ€™t even need to kill myself and I wouldnâ€™t be so ugly and lonely this is the only way Iâ€™m going to get out of here
