My low self-esteem is really starting to get to me.I'm losing all hope that I'll ever be happy with what I see in the mirror. Self-love was never something taught to me, and every single time I try to talk to my dad, he brushes everything off and makes it seem like I am overreacting. He just doesn't listen. My mom is dead so I can't go to her for support. I don't know...maybe I was just put on this earth for no good reason. When I look in the mirror, the only thing that comes to mind is "UGLY!!!" 

I have tried everything I can to make myself feel beautiful, but I just can't deal with it anymore.  I feel like all my effort was a waste of time, and I'm just so tired. Looks are so important to me, and  to still feel ugly kills me inside. Hundreds of dollars on makeup, hundreds of dollars on clothes, and thousands of dollars on hair, and I'm still ugly. 

At this point, the only things stopping me are the facts that I know  how badly it would affect my family/friends/and boyfriend, and I don't have the guts to do it.
