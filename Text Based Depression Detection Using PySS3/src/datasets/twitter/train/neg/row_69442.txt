Hope I'm strong enough to do it tonightI have to kill myself there is no hope for me. If you could see the way I live you would agree. I used to have it all. I built an amazing life for myself working in jobs that I loved. I had incredible friends and a wonderful social life.  I was a vibrant, enegergetic, positive and happy person. I was a lot of fun to be around, and I was funny and cute all the time. I brought so much joy into the world. Now I am rotting. I gave my youth away to a horrible person who didn't deserve an hour of my time, let alone an on and off two years.  I wish I could blame him,  but I can't. It's my fault. I chose to keep on going back until it drove me to literal insanity. I had a manic psychotic break down and went fucking mental for many months. I blocked and unfirended everyone that I loved. I was taking off interstate looking for profound spritual journeys,  which were really just me frolicking around with the homeless and drug addicted.  I got evicted from my beautiful home. When I finally came down from the high I realised everything I had lost.  Not only my safe and comfortable world around me but my future, friends and family. Unfortunately it wasn't a quick turn around and it only really settled in about five months ago that I had destroyed my life. I've been suicidal ever since. I was VERY beautiful and VERY lucky. I ruined things with my best friend and the man I loved. We should have been together all along but everybody understood we were both fickle people who would get there one day when the time was right.  I should have had a lovely life with my soulmate and a world of friends. I have seen what a long and lonely life looks like in my father and I do not want to live that. I am hideous, sad,  horribly unhealthy and disgusting.
