life is the cruelest joke ever madewhere to begin? maybe with the day I was born I have felt like God's greatest mistake. is it because my mother died when giving birth to me? or maybe the constant harresment and beatings from my father because 'I am the reason she is dead'. my brother always hit me, I thought it was normal until my 6th grade teacher questioned the bruises on my face. or maybe it twas the constant rejection from anyone and everyone to be my friend. I can't even say I sit alone during lunch, because I don't sit, I stand in the bathroom counting the seconds until lunch is over, which is roughly, 1800 gruelling seconds. or could it be that even now a freshman in highschool, can barley do addition, my dad just says it's my mental retardion kicking in. 

I have tried to cope with the pain. first by talking in suicide watch, trying to help other hopping my pain is also helped, but that stopped quickly

so instead

I help myself

good bye
