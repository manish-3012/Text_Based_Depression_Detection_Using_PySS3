Iâ€™m about ready to end itI (21M) have been struggling with depression, anxiety, panic attacks, etc from a very young age. I had my first full fledged panic attack at 8 years old, the depression set in when I was about 12, and it was just sort of a downward spiral. I struggled with drug addiction for most of my teen years, got sober at 16, then began drinking and got addicted to that when I was 19. I got control of my drinking problem, and now the only addiction I really have is nicotine. But anyways, I suppose I have been â€œsuicidalâ€ to some degree for a long time, like Iâ€™ve considered the possibility and thought about how I would do it, but it never seemed like the right idea, and I didnâ€™t think about it often. But over the past year or so it has become increasingly appealing. Im just so done with everything. I hate myself so much, because I feel like no matter how hard I try, Iâ€™ll never truly be a good person. And because it feels like my mental health is just getting worse and worse every day. Iâ€™ve already thought out, in detail, how I would do it. Iâ€™d clear all of my possessions out of my apartment and throw them all in the dumpster so that my friends and family donâ€™t have to sort through it or anything like that, Iâ€™d take my dog to the park for a few hours to run and play, and then Iâ€™d take him to my friends house so he can live with her and her kids, then Iâ€™d break up with my girlfriend, Iâ€™d just tell her itâ€™s because I need to focus on myself, or something else generic like that. Then Iâ€™d probably just take my gun, get dressed, walk off into the woods a few miles and just sit against a tree for a while and listen and watch the nature, and watch the world go by for a while. Then Iâ€™d shoot myself. I donâ€™t have any kids, so Iâ€™d probably just leave what little money I have to my girlfriend and my best friend. Iâ€™ve put my gun to my head a couple times in the past month or so. Not necessarily with the intention of doing it, just to kinda see how it felt. And honestly, it didnâ€™t scare me at all. Knowing I had a loaded gun pressed against my head, just felt like I was turning the knob on an exit door. I just feel like Iâ€™m ready to go.
