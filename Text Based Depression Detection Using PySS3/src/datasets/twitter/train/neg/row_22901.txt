I donâ€™t care what it does to my family and friendsI am suffering every day. I donâ€™t want to suffer anymore. Iâ€™m sorry to put my loved ones through something traumatic but I just hate being alive. Every relationship Iâ€™ve had has failed. Iâ€™m unattractive and boring. I am a fuck up of a person who canâ€™t do anything right. Everyone says â€œwhat will your dad/aunt/best friend thinkâ€ well I donâ€™t care. They should be happy if I donâ€™t have to suffer anymore.
