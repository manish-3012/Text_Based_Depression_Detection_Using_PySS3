What's the easiest way to kill myselfPlease don't put "don't kill yourself we need you!" Or anything in the comments, I'll do it with or without your help, but for my sake I hope you help me. I'm 15 I have 2 mentally abusive parents. I've been able to stop their abuse for a while by doing everything they want but now I'm failing school. It's started every thing back up so much worse. I get really full from my big school lunches but my mom forces me to eat when I come home, but then when I eat she asks why I'm being a pig. Im healthy but it's not enough. Im trying to juggle school and their chores for me but I can't. I'm sorry, I'm a coward and I know it. I can't run away because I don't want to be out there alone, I'm scared of what would happen to me since I'm a girl. I've tried looking into national runaway service but I would need a safe place to stay I really need y'all's help. I'm to much of a coward to cut or hang myself or anything violent but we don't have any pills that could do the job. What can I do? I can't last here 3 more years I just can't, I had a boyfriend that was helping me a while back but they texted him pretending to be me and started a huge fight with them and then they blocked him on my phone. He was so sweet and kind and it's been months since that happened so I'm sure he's so mad at me he wouldn't even consider helping me at this point. I have no one else. Please help me
