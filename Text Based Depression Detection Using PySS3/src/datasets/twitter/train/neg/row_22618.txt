I don't know how to go on, I have no friends anymore, I can't hold down a job and I don't think my girlfriend can take me for much longer. The thoughts are constant and hammering.I have had depression/anxiety as long as I can remember.

I finished school somehow, and now I have no friends anymore because I can't leave my house to keep up relationships with people, and all my close friends got tired of me being suicidal and depressed and don't talk to me anymore really. 

I have a great degree in compsci and I've had 3 great jobs since graduation that I either quit or got fired from within 6 months because I get too anxious to go in or too depressed to be careful and do my job properly. I'm on the last bit of my savings and i have 20k debt (including 2000 in credit card) still to pay off. 

My girlfriend seems to be trying her best to not lose it but I can tell she's close. I hope she finds happiness once she leaves me or I'm gone. 

I'm trying to stay positive and do my interviews that I have set up, I even landed one at Facebook but I'm too terrified to properly prepare. I'm so scared of failing that it's easier to just not even try. That might be literally the only reason I haven't killed myself already.

I've tried 15 different medications in the last 6 years. I'm seeking help. I have a psychiatrist. I've been through a million therapists.

I don't know what to do. I just constantly am saying to myself "I want to die" and "This is too hard." If I go to the hospital for help they'll just lock me up for 2 weeks and I'll miss all my interviews, then I'll come back home and go back to wanting to fucking die.
