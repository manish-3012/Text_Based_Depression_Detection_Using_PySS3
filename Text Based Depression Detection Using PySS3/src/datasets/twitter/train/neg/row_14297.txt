I canâ€™t stop crying and I want it to end. It is never getting better. Everything is staying the same, you just change the way you feel about it.So what if you donâ€™t fucking want to change the way you see things. This world is fucking miserable and is so damn exhausting to live and see everything fall apart.
Good people working hard to archives their goals and then poof.
It does not matter. 
I canâ€™t live for family, friends whatever. Itâ€™s so not worth it. The constant disappointment.
Iâ€™ll be one less stable variable in their life. So what. 
Go on with this life if you can, but I canâ€™t.
