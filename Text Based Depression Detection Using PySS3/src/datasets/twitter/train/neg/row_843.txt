I was told to kill myself, and part of me is slowly wanting to go with it.I fucked up.
I hurt someone, and in understanding rage, they told me to kill myself.
I've been trying to do better after this whole ordeal, most of my life really.
But...maybe they're right. 
If I just did, I wouldn't hurt anyone else again.
 I feel my want to get better just slipping and it scares me how much I want to make it reality.

I'm sorry....
