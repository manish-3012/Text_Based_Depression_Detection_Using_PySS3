It is getting worseDue to a recent problem with the girl I date (or dated, as of now I dont even know anymore) which just added to the pain I was already feeling, I am leaning more and more towards the idea of ending my life. Planning a goodbye letter, feeling the slight urge to jump out of the 3rd floor in the shopping mall or into the subway tracks. And now...now looking for the most painless ways to die, sleeping pills are currently leading.

Damn. Just damn.
