As a supervisor, how can I help someone who is suicidal?I recently found out that one of my subordinates has been having a really tough time dealing with stress at home. He has an ill child- some sort of recurring illness that requires constant hospital visits. He never wants to go home, and stays at work for as long as he can. However, our work is stressful and he has become unreliable. Meanwhile, his wife now has the stress of dealing with the child most of the day. 
This has resulted in him wanting to hurt himself.
What can I do to help?
