I don't know whyMy whole family hates me because I ASKED MY MOTHER if I could take the truck to a store to get some movies and snacks, I didn't know she was on her medication at this moment. When I'm about to head back she's freakimg out on me asking me where I was. I get home and she's yelling. I tried to explain to her that she said I can, she called me a lying bitch. Two days after that happened. I've been getting texts and calls from my family calling me worthless and inconsiderate and other hurtful things. I've tried calling my friends for help but no one answered. I've never been treated nicely. Since I was little they would call me fatass and stuff like that. I've always been bullied at school too, I wouldn't be able to turn a corner without any one calling me a slut or bitch. I don't see why. I never had sex. I've tried running away. They ended up finding me. I just want to stop here. I want to end my life now.
