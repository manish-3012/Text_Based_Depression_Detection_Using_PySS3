anyone do sorta half-assed purposely failing suicide attempts?I cut my wrists vertically a lot, but I know I'm not cutting deep enough to actually hit the artery. Or I tie something around my neck but don't actually hang myself. There's something therapeutic about getting as close as I can to killing myself. It's almost like i'm practicing or trying to work up the courage to actually do it. Anyone else do this?
