No more strengthIt's ridiculous.... I'm 33, a grown was man.  3.5 years ago I was dumped from a 7 year relationship.  I dedicated my life to her, and she's now made me want to take it. She got married 2 years after the breakup. I've been in therapy for 3 years and it doesn't help.... I have my list of methods and will choose one some day..... I just can't do it anymore.... I give up
