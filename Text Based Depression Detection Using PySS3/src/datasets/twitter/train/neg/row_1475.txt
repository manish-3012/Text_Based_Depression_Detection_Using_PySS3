Just tiredI think I'm just not meant for this life. I hate everyone and I hate myself. I try to be positive but that always fails because something happens. Some guy messaged me and told me to kill myself... honestly he is on to something. I have a lung disease that will slowly suffocate me anyways. Fuck this.
