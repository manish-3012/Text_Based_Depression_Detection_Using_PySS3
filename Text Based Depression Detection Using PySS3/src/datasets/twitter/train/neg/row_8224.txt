Nothing is going to be better for the foreseeable futureI don't know what to do because I'm in a bad situation and there's no way out I just want to die and I know there's always a way out, but they're all shit options like living with relatives I hate who look down upon me or the streets or keep living with my mom at 20 and we hate each-other arguing all time like really bad arguments with cursing and like getting in each-others faces,  I'm not able to do anything because I've not graduated high-school or got my driver's license and I live out in the country so I can't even go to school I know some of these things are my fault, I just feel like either I end it now or I solider on and I don't want to I have and I don't want to anymore it's just too hard and I don't know what to do, I feel like admitting myself to the hospital just to get away, but I don't know if it's a good idea because I feel like you have to attempt to hurt yourself or else it's just thoughts, but I'm scared of dying even though I want to kill myself.
