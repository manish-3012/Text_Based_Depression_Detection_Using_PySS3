intrusive thoughtsWhenever I feel somehow okay, they start to bother me even more than when I'm depressed. 

When I'm showering? I can't stop thinking about slitting my wrists or neck with a razor.

Taking a bath? Maybe I should try and drown myself?

Cleaning? Maybe I should hang myself on the belt that I need to put away.

It's honestly so tiring.
