help. i guess that's it.I think I'm pretty young to be depressed. I don't want to be. I don't really wanna talk about it, i just want to know how I can stop.  I don't think people hate me too much, but thinks like this just come down to me hating myself.

This isn't me saying I'm ready to die, it's just i'm getting there.

I started cutting myself today, and I just want to know any alternatives or ways to cope. thanks.
