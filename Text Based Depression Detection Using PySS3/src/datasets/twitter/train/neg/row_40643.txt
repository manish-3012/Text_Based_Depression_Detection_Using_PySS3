My suicideous evolution13 years old. I was thinking about suicide all day long. Until I met her, that girl. I fell in love with her and I think she is falling in love with me rn. This post is made to encourage the persons that are about to make something they will regret and make their close ones regret too. I remember when my father died. When my grandfather did too. Then my grandmom. I was at a 1% away from suicide. And I finally met LIVE in my life. Discovered a passion for horror novels, anime, and all sorts of things. With this post, I hope people who are about to suicide, think about it. AGAIN AND AGAIN. Because you can be happy with a little nothing. Because nature is awesome. Because LIFE IS GREAT. Don't back down on the smallest obstacle, persevere. And finally to end this post, a bit of humor: JUST DO IT!
