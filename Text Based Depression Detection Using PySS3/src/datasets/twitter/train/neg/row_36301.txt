I am depressed (obviously). I do not see a future for myself, I get bad grades at school and have very few friends.I am 15 at school I am constantly bullied but I am not a nerd (my grades are literally the worst out of the whole class), i am also far from being a popular kid. I don't know what category I fall into. I have 1 friend and he is the complete opposite of what I am (gets good grades, is genuinely happy) but for some reason we connected really well but are slowly but surely losing that connection. I sit all day in my room watching youtube my mum is threatening to take away my devices if I don't "get a life" so I just go outside, sit on a park bench and watch more youtube.

My parents are mad at me and my dad works hard to give me the luxury of a private school and I always feel a bit more guilty every time I fail an assessment or a test because I let him down. He  tells me this to intentionally  to make me feel bad. my parents went to a psychologist to see if I had any learning disabilities but I am perfectly normal and I am not a retard like everyone (including me) was thinking.

On my birthday (31/12) I went to some burger restaurant with my parents. It was going well at first but then my mum bought up school and it all went downhill from there I just looked down and ate my burger saying nothing while my parents kept on guilt tripping me. I wish I could go back in time and punch my dad right in the face and break his nose and just leave it would have felt so good. I do not see a future for myself I literally cant imagine myself with a wife, kids, a well paying job and a house.

thanks for reading whoever you are.
