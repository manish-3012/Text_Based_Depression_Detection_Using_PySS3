Wish I could talk to someone who actually understands how I feel.Iâ€™m not interested in private messaging anyone, just getting that out there.
I feel so lonely. I can never talk to somebody about how I feel. I see a therapist and it does help but I havenâ€™t seen her in so long now and wonâ€™t again because itâ€™s Christmas break. Every person Iâ€™ve ever spoken to misunderstands me in some way. I want to die so badly. Iâ€™ve wanted to die since I was 9 or so and Iâ€™m 18 now. I think about suicide everyday. Iâ€™m not a normal person, I feel like half a person. I can never make friends. I can never initiate conversation. I know Iâ€™m going to kill myself eventually. I just havenâ€™t yet.
