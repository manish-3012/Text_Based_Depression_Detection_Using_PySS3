I hope itâ€™s not the endIâ€™ve been very depressed the last few nights so Iâ€™ve drank I got arrested about a year ago for narcotics so I get drug tested by the state and if I fail one more test I go to prison I canâ€™t do that Iâ€™ve been so sad lately the only thing that has brought me happiness is the gay bars Iâ€™ve gone to Iâ€™ve finally accepted my self but if I get tested in the morning Iâ€™m going to end it all Iâ€™m sorry I love all the friends Iâ€™ve made and I love all my friends that have accepted me for how I am but Iâ€™m sorry I canâ€™t go to prison Iâ€™ve been drinking and waiting till midnight see what will happen I told one of my friends after today I wonâ€™t drink for the rest of March but Iâ€™ll see how that goes let my family know love them and itâ€™s not because they didnâ€™t support me for who I am.
