Boss making frequent comments about killing himself if "one more thing goes wrong". Don't want to make a scene if he is only being dramatic, but also don't want to regret not acting if he is being serious.My boss is going through an extremely stressful financial issue, and currently risks losing his whole business to the issue. He has been extremely moapy and sad, and more and more I here him mentioning that he wants to kill himself. He will say things like "if x happens I am going outside and throwing myself off the highway overpass" and "the only reason I didn't kill myself last night is because I don't know how this (financial issue) is going to work itself out."

He has always been a pessimist, but his recent comments like my examples are extremely and out of character. What is the best thing I can do to protect and help him in this difficult time. He was admitted to a psych ward for a few days about 6 months ago by his doctor, so I know that can be done, but he only had a negative outlook on the whole ordeal, and didn't seem to get anything out of it. 

What should I do?
