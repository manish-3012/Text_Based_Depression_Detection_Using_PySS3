I will recover, but I need some perspective.I have been depressed since I was a child and had an anxiety disorder for about as long. 

I am unmedicated and it's gotten really bad recently. I am taking steps to become healthier and that includes going to the gym. I had an appointment with a personal trainer earlier this week and when I went today with my husband, it all fell apart.

I wound up in the locker room, crying and texting him to leave. I got overwhelmed and I just panicked. In any case, there is that little voice in my head thats telling me how much better things would be if I weren't around. You know, permanently absent.

In light of this, I am finding a doctor - new insurance - and I'm going to do practical things to address this. But, well, I feel so damn fucked up. And I feel like a burden to just about everyone.
