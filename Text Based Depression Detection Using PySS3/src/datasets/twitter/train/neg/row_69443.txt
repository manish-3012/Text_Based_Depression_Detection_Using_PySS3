[I want to talk] Is there a reason for me to live?        I just turned 17 and Iâ€™m afraid Im not built for the real world yet, my single momâ€™s business crashed now we have to move to our relatives in a small city. Its kind of a culture shock to me but now my whole family wont address my issues, 

     I have depression (MDD), Anxiety, OCD, schizophrenia and DID (famously known as multiple personality disorder). I tried talking this to my family but they said I was being a pussy and Iâ€™ll get used to it. Im confused and I tried my best to ignore my symptoms but it just gets worst as days goes by. I have no therapist to talk since the nearest mental clinic is like hundreds of kilometers away so I cant solve my own problem by my own


What should I do?
Im losing my assets and Im desperate for help
