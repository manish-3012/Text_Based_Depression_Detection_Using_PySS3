When I succeedI feel like it will be the happiest day of my life, I know Iâ€™m meant to say my wedding day was, but this will be. 

I imagine it will be letting the steam out of a pressure cooker. 3 decades of pain, trauma and sadness that I will never have to think of again because everything will cease to exist.
