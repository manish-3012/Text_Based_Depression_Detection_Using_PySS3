I need to post this somewhereI canâ€™t get over the memories of the attempt, mostly the feelings I had during it. I remember that night like it was yesterday, even a year later. Iâ€™ve never talked to anyone except one therapist about it, and even then never talked about what I was really feeling. Iâ€™ve never gotten it out and I feel like I need to. 

That night I happened to be with my entire family (Iâ€™ll preface Iâ€™m already 25 yrs of age) It was one month after my first unsuccessful suicide attempt after I swallowed all my antipsychotics. I was feeling very suicidal again, I was having a crisis and hysterically crying, but my mom had slammed the door in my face. She was â€œsick of Meâ€ sheâ€™d said, sick of me not being better already. Iâ€™ve never felt more desperate in my life. Iâ€™d told her honestly and from my heart that Iâ€™d been feeling suicidal, that I didnâ€™t feel safe, because some tiny part of me wanted to live. She yelled â€œI donâ€™t care if you donâ€™t feel safe, I need sleep!â€. I remember yelling â€œPLEASE help, I really donâ€™t feel I can make it through tonight, please can I just sit with you?!â€ She didnâ€™t care. 

I decided then and there that I would make sure I succeeded that time. I went to the kitchen, took a kitchen knife and slashed my right arm quickly before I could stop myself. I then had the courage to continue and just kept repeatedly slashing at my arms until I started to feel dizzy. At that point, there was so much blood I got worried because I knew if my family went to the kitchen during the night to get a glass of water or something and saw all the blood, theyâ€™d try and rescue me again. I didnâ€™t want to be rescued, so I didnâ€™t want any blood anywhere it could be seen in the house except for when they found me and I was actually already dead and unable to be saved. I got the swiffer mop out, paper towels, anything I could to clean up the blood but at that point I was bleeding so much, trying to clean it up was just spreading the blood around more. 

I gave up cleaning up the blood, also because by that point I was so dizzy I couldnâ€™t walk properly. I couldnâ€™t think straight because I was starting to get weak, but I do remember thinking â€œThese are my last momentsâ€ and I wanted to die to something familiar, in my own room. I remember slipping in my own blood and falling to the ground. I managed to muster the strength to crawl to my room, turn on my Xbox and start playing â€œThe officeâ€ so I could die watching a show I liked, at the very least. I didnâ€™t have the strength to climb up on to my bed, the room was spinning around me, so I just propped myself up against a wall and just waited to die. I donâ€™t remember anything after that. 

Of course I woke up, in the hospital, twice as hopeless as before and angry and distraught I was still alive. I lost all feeling In my entire right forearm, and couldnâ€™t even move it (for the first two weeks). Iâ€™ll never get feeling back in it again, Iâ€™m lucky I can still move it now. They ligated two of my veins in my left arm, so although I can feel my left arm, the circulation is ten times as poor as my right. I canâ€™t hold a pencil anymore or write like I used to. Idk if Iâ€™ll ever get that back. Being scarred for life is also a permanent reminder. Summer and short sleeves make me anxious as hell. How am I supposed to get better when I have a permanent reminder of that day etched in to my skin?? When I canâ€™t even take notes or type on my laptop like I used to? 

Why does everyone expect me to be over it already? I tried describing it to my sister and she said â€œit was a year ago, arenâ€™t you feeling better yet?â€ No. I am not. I donâ€™t know how. I wish I could. I feel so unworthy and worthless for putting my family through that. I have all the same suicidal feelings before, but if anything theyâ€™re MORE amplified now, because I feel ten times more worthless for putting my family through that, finding me passed out in a pool of blood. How can I live with myself after I did that to them? If killing myself isnâ€™t an option anymore, how do I go on living with the guilt? The scars? The reminders? How can I ever feel normal again? 

Iâ€™m so sorry for rambling like this. I didnâ€™t know where else to post this and am feeling so emotional and upset and misunderstood by everyone. Iâ€™ve never talked to other suicide survivors before and that makes me feel even worse about myself for being selfish, like I should have just died still. Iâ€™ve never fit in this world, Iâ€™ve always been wrong and not right and unworthy, and idk how anybody else seems so comfortable in daily life.
