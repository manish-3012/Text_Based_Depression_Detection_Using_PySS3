Things are getting worse, am hoping this will be my last post.I donâ€™t think I can take this for much longer. I feel like Iâ€™m never going to recover, like Iâ€™ve been stuck in time since my first attempt. I just want this all to be over and I donâ€™t care how it ends. I donâ€™t have anything left to live for- the people close to me will be fine. Theyâ€™ll be better off without me.

Iâ€™m a really awful person and Iâ€™ve been trying to change but I have reached my breaking point. I donâ€™t know whether this is a note or a cry for help, but I canâ€™t do this anymore. 

I know that thereâ€™s a chance that somebody I know in person will read this, and all I ask is that you let me have peace with this decision. Maybe in another lifetime things may have been different, but the fact is that I canâ€™t change a thing. Iâ€™m going crazy stuck inside my own head, and I donâ€™t ever see an end to it. I canâ€™t see any other future than this.

I donâ€™t blame anybody for this- this was my choice and mine alone.
