My best friend is going to kill herself and I don't know how to helpMy best friend is going to kill herself. I personally was very suicidal at one point and cannot handle losing her. I've asked her to give me her dads number so I can get help but she won't give it to me. She's staying at cousins so I don't know her address either so calling the police is useless. If you guys have any ideas on what I can do please help me. I've lost three best friends to suicide and I cannot deal with this. If I sound calm that's only because I need to get help fast.
