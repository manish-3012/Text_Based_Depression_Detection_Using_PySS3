Iâ€™m finally ready to take the plunge. Washington, DC area adviceIâ€™ve been thinking about this for the past year hoping Iâ€™d feel better.

I havenâ€™t decided if Iâ€™ll be diving headfirst into water or concrete yet but Iâ€™ve whittled it down to the two.

Iâ€™m new to the Washington DC area and donâ€™t know if thereâ€™s a spot tailored for this but Iâ€™d be happy to hear any locations that would get the job done.

Thanks in advance
