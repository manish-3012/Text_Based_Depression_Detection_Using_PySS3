I'm transgender and I feel like I can't be happy.After many years of wishing I was a girl, making fantasies about being a woman, and cross-dressing, I've finally actually realized that I'm transgender. I'm tired of hating myself, and feeling disgusted when I look in the mirror.

No matter what I do though, I can't seem to find happiness. I started feeling happier before when I started doing things to make myself appear more feminine; I waxed my eyebrows, I shaved my body hair, and got some feminine clothing, but the more little things I do, the more I realize that there's nothing I can do to make major changes, and I can't express this in front of almost anyone. I feel so much more comfortable with the idea of living life as a woman than with the idea of living life as a man, but I'm so afraid that I'm making a horrible mistake and will regret it later. 

Even with the minor changes I've made I still just feel like I'm going through the motions every day, and it's gotten to the point that I can't focus on anything or find enjoyment in anything. The past few days all I've done is wake up, go to work, come home, stare blankly at the wall, or TV (If I can manage to work up the will to turn it on) and fall asleep in the early afternoon because I'm too exhausted from constantly thinking about how much I want to change, and how much I want to stop pretending to be someone I'm not, but I'm too afraid because it's a huge step, and everyone I'm related to is a fucking bigot. 

I'm so tired, and afraid, and I feel so helpless. The idea of hanging myself from a belt in my closet or taking a bottle full of pills is sounding more and more alluring, and that scares me too.

Sorry the jumbled mess of text, I'm having a lot of trouble thinking right now. I just got finished sleeping half the day away, and I'm feeling very worthless, and like I'll never be able to be happy.
