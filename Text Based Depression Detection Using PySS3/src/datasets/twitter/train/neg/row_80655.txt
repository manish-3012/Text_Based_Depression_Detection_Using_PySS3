If I want out I'll have to kill my whole family first.My aunt ended herself when I was two. I never knew her. My grandmother went completely fucking insane after she did it. I never knew her as a sane person.

 My mom has promised me she'll go crazy just like that if I ever do it. And she's the only one looking after my sister. So if I go down, the whole family goes down.

 So it would be only civil to euthanise them first. I'd have to catch both of them by surprise because I know I won't have the physical strength to overpower either of them individually, not to speak of together. I'd also have to lock the dogs away somewhere else first, too, because they'd defend their owners with their lives. Killing them one by one would be the least painful solution to everyone involved.

 Of course I know it's wrong and fucked up. But mom was the one who made it a hostage situation. If I go down they all do. It would only be humane to end it clean. But I can't do that, that's fucked up.

 All I fucking ask for is to be allowed to fucking end it. I'm so tired, I am so fucking exhausted with living and there's no relief or release from it, ever. All I'm fucking asking for is to stop being in pain and for some fucking reason that's too much to ask.

 I just want it to stop. I just want everything to fucking stop.
