I have no hope to wake up tomorrow. Wish I could fall asleep forever.My family moved into US in 2017, when I was 20. I didn't grow up here. So the people in my community don't wanna be friends with me. I know them, we work together but they never treat me as a friend. Even the same race people. I tried going out and talking to people. Nobody wanna be friends with an ugly brown guy. I go to a boring college and it's so hard to make friends. My GF lives in Europe and she lives a fun dorm life with friends. My sister is in High School and she is 7 years younger than me. We can't relate to each other's lives. But she grew up here she has so many friends. 

Looking at all the people I know, They're enjoying and I feel like I'm alone. I'm 23 years old and I literally have nobody. I never get invited to a party, NOTHING. My life is completely blank. I wanted to commit suicide so many times but my inside voice kept saying this situation will change. If it didn't change by the age of 25, I don't wanna live anymore.   


You are probably frustrated by this quarantine situation. Well, my life is like this every single day. I wish I had at least one friend in my life. I have no hope to wake up tomorrow. Whether I live or die tomorrow, It wouldn't make any difference.
