Damp garage conversion ruined my life, all I need is a painless way to end itWas no DPM down. My Dad built it rushed and is ignorant to the damage it caused me. This was 4 years ago. I used to be fit, healthy, confident, strong, get all the girls.

Developed awful taste in my mouth, teeth are rotting, can barely breath most of the time. Stomachs in agony, everything I eat makes it worse. Nothing comes up on tests so get told it's all in my head. My tongue is always coated and nothing gets rid of it. I've lost all my friends, love of my life,  my family.

I lived with being ill for 8months as I got ignored by doctors again and again. Got to the point I got angry and frustrated so much with it I started kicking off at home. Got sectioned. Still told.I'm deluded,  put on antipsyhcotic drugs. Came out,  still no.change..started kicking off again sectioned again. Still no help. Tests still clear. Family still tHink I'm mental. Got no.support from anyone. Tried therapy in all walks. Treat big detoxes tried spending Â£1000s on health food, fitness etc.

Ultimately I've lost everything and there's nothing I can do. I still kick off. I'm not irrationally angry. I just can't keep waking up like this. I've lost my whole personal through it. In my mind I'm still intelligent, still aware, but how am.o expected to live like this anymore? There's no more avenues to go down.
