I feel loved, calm and safe when I think about suicide. I feel like it's time to go.Something really bad has happened. Somebody is hurting me again. He dehumanizes me and is working towards destroying my life and my future. I will be safe from all of humanity by killing myself. In a few minutes I will go to the store and buy myself what I need to leave forever.

A few days ago I've found a dead animal. I felt sad back then. Now I feel the serenity of death again, the peace that only exists when everything stops. There is sth calm and beautiful about being non existent. The only thing that saddens me is that I'll be buried in my horrible hometown. I guess I never got to truly escape. At least I tried, but evil people are everywhere. The most loving thing for me to do is to kill myself. Let's hope I won't fall for my foolish naivety and my delusional optimism again. It does not get better, but at least everything ends, if I find the courage to die. I will kill myself in a loving way and it will happen within next week. My hopes will be directed towards a peaceful end and not towards a good future that will never exist.
