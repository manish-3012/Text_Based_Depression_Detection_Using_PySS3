31 now. Have a lot that could be going for me. Friends. Family. SSRI's. Therapy. Good Support. I still can't make it. Feel like there is no hope.Sick of it. Depression is wicked and it is crippling. I just want to fucking die and I can't help but worry about how it would effect those that care about me. Starting to not worry about that much anymore though cause I wouldn't be here to have to know. 

There's times where it doesn't necessarily get better but there are many times when it definitely gets worse. 18 years and I'm about done dealing with the shit.

Wearing a mask to hide it is getting old. Knowing that there truly isn't anything out there to make a real difference makes life seem even more disparaging. 

Can't say I haven't tried. I've done it all from hospitals, to therapy, to meds, to coping over the years. There was a moment recently where I felt like I made some real progress in battling back and then there it is knocking on the door again. I guess that makes the fall back into the hole even harder.
