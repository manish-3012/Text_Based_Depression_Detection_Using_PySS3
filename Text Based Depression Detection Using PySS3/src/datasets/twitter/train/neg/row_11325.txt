when is it going to happeni don't feel like i have control over when i will kill myself. i think that i am reaching the point where i am going to have a complete mental breakdown. i'm already far removed from reality and taking care of myself is extremely difficult. i can't remember anything, every single day is just blending into the next, i don't feel good. i feel sick. i think i'm going to snap and kill myself. i don't really know what to do? i can't go to the hospital because people are depending on me to take care of them, i have to take care of them, i don't have time to go to the hospital. i need to see a therapist, i'm trying to remember to call one but it has been months and months of me forgetting, i need to call a therapist really bad. other than getting a therapist i don't know what to do. i don't know what to do in the meanttime. i have to go to the store, i have to wash my cat, i don't know how i can do those things? i feel like all i can do is sit here and type. i really just dont feel good.
