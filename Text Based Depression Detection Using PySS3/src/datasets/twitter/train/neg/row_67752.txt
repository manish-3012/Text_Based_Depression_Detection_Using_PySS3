Casually Suicidal.Not sure if this is the right place to post this, not really knowing what to expect, just needed to express myself. Every time I have a bit of free time, or the smallest thing bothers me, I daydream and ponder just killing myself, think about how and when. It just seems to come out of nowhere and it's not even massively distressing anymore, it's just there. I don't know if that means I need help or not. Maybe someone else feels this way.
