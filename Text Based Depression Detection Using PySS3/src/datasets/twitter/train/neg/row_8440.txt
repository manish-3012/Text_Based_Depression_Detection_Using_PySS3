so much of the same bullshitI am a selfish, undeserving person. I find myself surrounded by family and friends who love me unconditionally, but I deserve none of it. What I do deserve is to be taken and maimed and tortured until I break and can appreciate the beauty of this world.

Until I break, that will never happen. I am toxic. I am ruining these peoples' lives. I look around and see people struggling every day, people who feel they have nobody to turn to, nobody to love them. They are deserving of what I have. I am wasteful. 

I am so tired of being disgusted with myself. I feel that it's time to end the selfishness with one final act.

I don't know why you're even reading this. I leech off of people who care. What a waste.
