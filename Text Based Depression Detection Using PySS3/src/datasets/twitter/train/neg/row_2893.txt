Is anyone else too scared to talk about how they feel?I've been baker acted 3 times, and it's been insanely traumatizing for me. I am extremely scared of telling people about my feelings due to fear they're going to call the police on me. I don't want to be taken away anymore. 

Everytime I told someone important to me how I felt, they accused me of emotional manipulation and called the police. And now I feel like I'm left in a state where I can't talk to anyone about how I feel out of fear of being accused of being manipulative.

I don't mean to be sad. I'm not trying to hurt or control anyone, I don't want to be taken away again. Even posting this is scary
