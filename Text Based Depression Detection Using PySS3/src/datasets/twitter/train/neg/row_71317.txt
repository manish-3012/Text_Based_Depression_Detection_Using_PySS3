depressionI've been in this state many times; even when I am out of it and functioning perfectly healthy the feeling of pessimism and depression always lingers around me. I know i'm prone to depression. After all this meaningless existence I end up not giving  a damn about life. I'm quite ready and quite tired. My grandmother is in a sickly state, fighting multiple myeloma. I see her and I think she's had a pretty good life and now dying soon, may be couple years at most? I don't know. The end is near, why fight it? I know i can fight on but I don't give a damn, so i reason that people like me don't deserve to be alive. All i do is cause others trouble. Fuck life
