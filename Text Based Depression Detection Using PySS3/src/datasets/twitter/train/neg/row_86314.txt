I almost shot myselfI almost shot myself. I can't help but feel like it is a very minor issue and I shouldn't seek help or talk about it. When I think about other people committing suicide, I feel like it's a major issue and should be immediately addressed. I have been thinking about it a lot and the urge to kill myself is still there. Additionally, I have a very big self-harming problem. I have a therapy appointment soon and I feel like I shouldn't bring it up.
