I feel lost.
I feel trapped all the time. Everyone around me seems to hate me. Every person at the register every person I pass by seems to look at me with disgust. I try and I try to stop and rewire my thinking but if everyone seems to hate me maybe Iâ€™m just the problem? My own friends donâ€™t even want to hang out with me. Maybe itâ€™s all in my head but I canâ€™t seem to stop all this thinking. 

What do I do wrong? I try so hard I just want to know what I do wrong. It feels like Iâ€™m a waste of space and since the only destination in life thatâ€™s a given is death why donâ€™t I just speed up the process?
