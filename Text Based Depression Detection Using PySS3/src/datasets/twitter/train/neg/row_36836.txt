Life is HardI honestly think that if it weren't for my cat and my mom I would have done it all ready. But Esther (my cat) is only 6 pounds and she wouldn't survive without me. Mom has horrible PTSD and agoraphobia -- she needs me to look after her. 
I'm studying to be a doctor. I am trying so fucking hard, and have been for a long time, to keep everything afloat. It drives me crazy that the man who raped and abused my mom and I gets to live his life like a normal human being, whereas mom can't leave the house on her own and I spend every night at three a m trying to talk myself out of taking too many pills. 
I'm not going to be able to handle med school. I barely handled the process of getting INTO med school. I'm never going to be able to help kids like I was, because what kind of fucking role model is a suicidal doctor who still screams at ghosts and can't manage a succesfull relationship without sabotaging it. 
Sometimes I lie in bed at night and cry because I want my mom. Mom's still alive, and so am I, but it feels like we are both only connected to the world by a thin string. 
It would be so much easier to not wake up. It would just be so much easier.
