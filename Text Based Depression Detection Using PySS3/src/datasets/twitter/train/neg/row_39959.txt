Do you think I'll regret it?I rewatched 'The View From Half Way Down' from Bojack Horsemen. For the past few months I just wanted to turn my brain off, to stop the voice that tells me how inadequate and worthless I am. Everyday I'm reminded about how behind I am in life. Reminded how I'm rotting away in my room, losing friendships, unable to communicate with anyone in any meaningful way. I look back and all I see is how depression and anxiety took away everything that made me me. I've been dealing with this darkness since childhood. I don't think I can have kids or get married with this disease. I feel like an empty shell of a person; I'm alive but I'm not living. I've been dead for a while. My family is preventing me to get help. My best friend treats me like a drug addict for wanting to get on antidepressants again. No one cares when I openly talk about suicide. I truly believe the world will be better without me. I don't think I can bring anyone happiness because of the way I am. No one values me. How could what I feel change when I kick the chair away?
