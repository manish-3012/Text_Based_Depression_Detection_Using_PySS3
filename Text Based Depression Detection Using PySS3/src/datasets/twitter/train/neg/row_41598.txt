I want to dieI really want to die. I stop cared about everything. My sucidal tendencies are getting worse everyday. I can't focus on doing my assignments. I relapsed, I cut myself again in order to have that adrenaline rush. Just so I can read my textbook. Is living even worth it anymore? Nobody cares about me. I don't have any friends and my family are the worst. I've been harrased by my brother and my parents are blaming me. I don't think there is anything left for me to live for. I've been think of suicide for every second of the day. To be alive itself is a torture for me. I really wanna die but I don't know how to do it. Why can't dieing be painless. I hate to be such a coward.
