Making preparationsI have one note written so far, another to be written that will be put under the door to the hall as a warning not to open the door and I'm sure I have more than enough pills on hand.

I just feel like today should be the day I should die.

I'm just too damn tired of living. I'm 21 but I feel so much older. I feel like I've lived far too long.

Besides that I just can't keep up with everything going wrong. It's like a leaky roof that I can't mend and I don't have enough buckets to handle it.

Uni was a mistake and I'm failing terribly, my student loan has been stopped because they think I've withdrawn, my medication was horrendous and I can't go back to therapy.

I know that my death won't have much of a negative impact either. Especially not on my family. They joke about things like this all the time and I know that when they joke about anything there's truth in it.

I just have a few more things to do before I try. Laundry mostly.

I can't think of much else to make this less of a burden on everyone involved. That is if they can be bothered to retrieve my body.

And I at least know it might save some people too since I'm an organ donor.

It's a shame they wasted more money on me. Will they be allowed to take what money is left in my account do you think?

They were never the kind I could talk to. None of my family were. I have no friends and no one I trust. I don;t think I ever have.

So what now?
