Anyone else get an awful gut-wrenching emptiness on a regular basis?I've been dealing with this for several years now, where every month and a half or so I drop down to a depression so deep that even my greatest passions become chores. I feel an emptiness that nothing seems to be able to fill. The only way to get out of it seems to be to wait it out and right now I don't know if I have the strength. I'm not sad, I'm not angry, I'm just empty. I don't know if I can hold on for my loved ones until the next ray of sunshine peeks through the dismal fog of life.
