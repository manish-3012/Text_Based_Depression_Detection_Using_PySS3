Not living, just existing.Not really sure why I'm posting here when I have websites like SS to go on (if you don't know what that is, I'm not going to explain it in case I get banned from here), I feel like I've been on that site for years and have seen people come and go yet I'm stuck standing still.

I've ordered my method of choice online but when it gets here I doubt I'll use it. I always make these plans up in my head and then can't even go through with them due to exhaustion and just general unwilling to make an effort. Plus I'm living with someone too and he's the last person I'd want to find me in such a state. He puts up with so much of my shit already.

I've spent all of today in bed - got out of bed properly about 3pm, ate, went back to snooze until 10pm. Now awake wondering if I should just go back to sleep. I know it's my own fault for not reaching out and connecting with people at a time like this but I don't have the energy. Would like to just hide in my bed for the rest of my existence.
