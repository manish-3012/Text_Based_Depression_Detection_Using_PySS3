I wrote this in my notes app and just needed to put it somewhereIâ€™ve been thinking about dying a lot more lately. 

It would be such a relief to quit breathing. To not have to worry about anything Iâ€™m worrying about.

I crave human connection, more than anything. And I can never seem to get it. Not genuinely. I donâ€™t know that anyone will ever love me the way I love them. I donâ€™t know that I will ever matter to anyone the way they matter to me. 

And the way I talk to myself is so awful. I tell myself all the time how no one will ever love you. No one will ever cherish you. Youâ€™ll die alone, like you always knew you would, and all this time youâ€™ve spent deluding yourself into thinking you could be happy is time you could have spent dead. 

I must be the problem. If itâ€™s always people wanting to quit being friends with me, I must be the problem. What other reason could there be?

But I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m doing wrong. And thatâ€™s the hardest part. I think Iâ€™m a good friend, a good girlfriend. But others donâ€™t think I am. They lose interest in my friendship or companionship after a year, sometimes less. 

So here I am, crying in my boyfriendâ€™s bed, on his birthday night, trying desperately to hide how I feel, knowing heâ€™s going to leave me soon. Knowing heâ€™s falling out of love with me, though he may say he isnâ€™t. Knowing heâ€™s lost interest in me, and Iâ€™m not worth the effort anymore. 

And itâ€™s more than just him. Itâ€™s everyone whoâ€™s ever lied to me and told me they cared about me. Itâ€™s everyone who fooled me into thinking I could be happy. 

Itâ€™s nothing I havenâ€™t felt before. But it feels so much worse this time. It hurts so much worse. And I know if I had a bottle of pills available to me, Iâ€™d down them without question, and wait for death. Iâ€™d welcome it. 

But what am I going to do, cut myself with his knife he keeps on the ledge and bleed out on his bed? Hang myself from his ceiling? No. And I donâ€™t have any pills available. Nothing I have will do the job. So I sit here, and I cry, and I hope someone notices my sad little state and forces me into getting the help I so desperately need. 

And I wait for death.
