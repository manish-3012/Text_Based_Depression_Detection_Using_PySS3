Post grad depressionHi, 
Iâ€™ve been feeling awful for a little over a month and need advice and someone to tell me itâ€™ll be okay.

So, this May I graduated with a Bs in Physics. I was very burnt out  and decided to take a job as an analyst for retirement pensions. While Iâ€™m glad I got a job out the gate and am able to make student loan payments in the grace period, the job is not for me. Itâ€™s such a boring subject to analyze. I freaked out when I realized I didnâ€™t like this job because I as so ready to like and take it and now the plan has changed! Iâ€™ve been applying to jobs more in my field and Iâ€™ve gotten one shitty phone interview. Iâ€™ve also been applying to grad school for engineering. 

Basically, I feel really lost and hopeless. I feel like Iâ€™ll never get out of this terrible small city where I canâ€™t even be out and proud with my girlfriend (this breaks my heart every fucking day) and Iâ€™m miserable. 
Iâ€™m scared of accruing more student debt and Iâ€™m scared of the future. Iâ€™m scared Iâ€™ll never get to where Iâ€™m going and Iâ€™ll be at my job forever. Iâ€™m feeling a little suicidal. 

I hate this part of growing up, no one ever told me how hard being a college graduate is. Can someone give advice and or tell me itâ€™s ok? 

Thanks for reading this.
