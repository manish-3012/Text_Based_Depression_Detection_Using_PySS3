I cryI am \_\_\_\_\_. Blank. Void. In the pits of a blackhole, it seems.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a 30 year old 'man' in a third world corner of the world just wandering around to let my myself go off a ledge. Just a matter of time. Although i am in an IT 'job' or so, they say; I can undoubtedly say that I have no 'career'. 

I had stopped trying a long time ago. So, it's my and only my fault. No one else's. And for that, I should pay the price.

&amp;#x200B;

The ultimate price. I am sick; Sick of my wasted life, Sick of having failed everybody who had some hopes for me, sick of this wasted breath &amp; life which could have enriched another living being instead of being utterly useless for a person as me. A erson who is already dead from the inside. And just has his outer shell of a body to shed &amp; burn.
