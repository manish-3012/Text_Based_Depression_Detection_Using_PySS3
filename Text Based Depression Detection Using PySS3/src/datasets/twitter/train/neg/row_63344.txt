Iâ€™m having a really hard time keeping it together todayI keep flipping between really really wanting to be dead and being too scared to do anything and knowing I shouldnâ€™t... but today is really hard. Iâ€™m not having a good time. I really need to talk to someone. Please...

Iâ€™m sorry if Iâ€™m not a priority or if there are more important people who need to talk. I donâ€™t want to bother anyone...
