How much does my life belong to me?I am nearing 50 and for a long time have been seriously considering saying goodbye. It is clear to me that things will be a downward spiral from here on out. Alcoholism, depression, chronic illness and not to mention being a mediocre, shitty person in general (though i have mananged to keep that mostly secret to this point)

Being a coward by nature the actual process of suicide does frighten me, but more than that is the impact it will have on wife, children, mother.  It would kill my mother (now 80) and seriously fuck up my kids (11 and 17). My wife would of course be hurt but she is a lot stronger than me and, in any case, if she really knew me she would not be nearly so sad.

How do we draw the line? My name is divorce or die but that is misleading. Divorcing isnt going to make me better or happier, it is not a question of "or " but "and" but maybe if i get a divorce first and wait a year or two before dying it would be better for them? Create distance?

How much do i owe my life to others? I am done with it. Seriously. I understand that things might get better and medication and so on, but no. No. I am done. How long do i have to hold out? If i die tonight they will have a million plus in assets. Considering my income, that is a lot--certainly makes up for lost income.

At what point can i prioritise my own relief over others' potential pain? I stay up late every night so that i can cry after everyone had gone to bed. Its not that i want to cry, but i bottle it up all day long and can only let it out then. I feel like i am going to snap and unravel at any moment....  how much do i owe them? I love my kids but this is not that. The two are not connected. I just want to not be.  Is that really, really such a bad thing?
