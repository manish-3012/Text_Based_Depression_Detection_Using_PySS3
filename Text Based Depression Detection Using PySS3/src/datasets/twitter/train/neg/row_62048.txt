I fantasize killing myself all the time..I take the pills. Who knows how many I am swallowing. I fall to the ground. Dead. My mother finds me a few hours later. Cold and dead. Everyone finds out at school the next day. I wonder if my ex cares if Iâ€™m dead. 

I hate these thoughts. I want to end it all so badly but I canâ€™t because my mom would be devastated. Sheâ€™s already had a rough life. I canâ€™t make her go though my suicide. I miss my ex. I feel like a worthless piece of shit. :/
