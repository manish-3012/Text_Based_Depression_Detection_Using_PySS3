i think the universe wants me to give up2020 is a bad year, we all know this. however, with 2020 being like this and then me already being actively suicidal, it's even worse.

i might become homeless soon, i just lost my job and no prospects for the future, i have no family or friends other than my roommate and i don't even think she likes me that much. i'm alone in the world and i have no reason to stay here in it.

the universe wants me to go ahead and kill myself. it's egging me on so i think i have to do it by the end of the month. life is only going to get worse for me, so why not end it now rather than letting my pain drag on.
