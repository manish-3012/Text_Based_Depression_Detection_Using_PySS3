Lithium and alcohol?Iâ€™m turning 22 next week (11/9). I honestly just donâ€™t feel like I can go on anymore. Iâ€™ve dug myself into a financial hole and Iâ€™ve come to the conclusion I will never live like a normal adult. I have a three months supply of lithium that I havenâ€™t taken in quite some time and a half of a liter of rum. 

Will this be enough to end it?
