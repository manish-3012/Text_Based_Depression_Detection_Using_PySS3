Can someone tell me what the point of living isIâ€™ll start this off by saying that Iâ€™ve had a very easy life so far and are very fortunate for the opportunities Iâ€™ve had, however I just donâ€™t see the point. We do the same mundane tasks every day as children to learn to do another mundane task as an adult. Every day is the same, for everyone. There is no meaning to this other than to carry on our species, which could be eradicated tomorrow and no one would never know this happened. All I am is a speck among billions of others on a tiny, insignificant rock floating through an ever expanding universe, making us more and more insignificant every day. There is no telling how many have lived before me and there is no telling how many will after I am gone, the names of most arenâ€™t remembered as they were meaningless, and this is the same that will happen to nearly all of us. Since once we die we are gone forever and unable to know that we existed in the first place whatâ€™s the point in waiting for something we will never know arrives? Every day we get closer to it  so why not speed it up.

If someone could tell me the meaning of living that would be great, if not oh well, I donâ€™t expect anyone to care as I mean nothing to you and am some stranger over the internet. 

All of this was just off the cuff so I apologize if there is any poorly written sentences.
