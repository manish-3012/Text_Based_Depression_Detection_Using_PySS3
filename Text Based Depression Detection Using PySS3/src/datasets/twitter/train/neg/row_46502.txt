I give upI really give up I just lost my job, very angry at myself And now I know I can't get good at anything. How come my friends get good jobs (for an example one of them is a graphic designer and I am no longer friends with him anymore cause I got into a fight) And I can't cause I lost my job. It's all over for me like really almost no friends no job no car. It's the end for me :(
