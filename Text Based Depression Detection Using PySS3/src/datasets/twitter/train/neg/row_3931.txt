I want my life to endI've had enough of everything. I want to end it so fucking bad and I'm not sure how long I can keep preventing myself from actually doing it. Every night I want to do it yet I don't, when I wake up I don't want to get up, every day is almost the same, there's no point in going on. I do nothing and I'm no use either. So why would I keep on going? What's the point of me living? When all I probably do is bother people. It's been getting worse since a few months ago and it just doesn't stop! First it didn't feel like I was depressed but now it of course does. First it was just thoughts and now I actually want to do it. 
Yes okay, my friends cheer me up. But no one knows I want to die so bad. I do want to tell a friend but I don't know who! My friends aren't like that, they probably don't even care that much about me. Maybe I can talk to one friend but I don't know how. I'm too scared to ask her if I can talk to her. Oh God no. I'm not like that, I shouldn't do that. 
You should know that I'm getting professional help but that's just making things worse at the moment. Sorry if this bothered you, I just want to know what to do at this point. Thank you if you comment.
