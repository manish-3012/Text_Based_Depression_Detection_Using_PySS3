chronic pain, loneliness, misery etceveryday has been pain for the past half decade (i'm 22). It is only going to persist, and there is no hope. This is hardly an emotional decision; it seems suicide is the logical decision given my circumstances. i'm too ugly and in too much pain to have friends. I don't have family other than my dad, and my sister hates me cus i'm a loser junkie. I fucked my heart up from smoking heroin and crack and had open heart surgery, which resulted in 3 other surgeries. Still in pain from that, and can't exercise ever again. My eyes burn from neuropathy and my joints ache like hell from accutane. My scoliosis is severe and my back pain wakes me up every night. I can't take pain medication because i'm an addict, and i'm an addict because i hate my life. The cycle is vicious. I am not going to reproduce due to ugliness, and when I blast my brains out, I won't be leaving anything behind - my dad is understanding about my situation. I would prefer euthanasia, but I'm technically not 'terminal'. I'm worried about disfiguring myself If I don't execute properly. I would have liked to have experienced having a girlfriend.
