i am afraid i am going to attempt, but i am a college student and i worry that getting help will just give more medical bills to my family.i have insurance but my family is very poor and i don't have much money either. i hear horror stories about people here in the US seeking help for mental illnesses and then leaving no better off and now they have huge bills to repay too.
if i do attempt and fail, that's even bigger bills for my poor mom. if i ever did kill myself, my student loans would be on her to repay. i feel like such a burden to her already, i can't stand the idea of putting even more stress on her. 
what a fucked up world we live in, where people need to consider things like this when they need help. no one deserves to feel this way. if they are suicidal and suffering, they should be able to get care without questions of being able to afford it.
what can i do? i am lost.
