Its wiser to get ready for death than for lifeIf your life is meaningless, then leave this world with meaning. 
Im a loser, Im a nobody. Im ugly, and definetly my taking care of my personal appearence is not existant for me. But I work out hard every day, some times even twice a day. I practice and study music buy myself at home. I have isolated myself from social life. I got no job or really important studies. 

I think at this point I can only work hard and leave this world doing something really impressive. That is what keeps me working hard and getting ready (physically and mentally) for that moment.

Any ideas?
