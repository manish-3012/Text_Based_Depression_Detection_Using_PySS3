My paradoxI don't want to kill myself, but I don't want to live either. I'm just tired of everything and wake up near enough every morning wishing I was dead. 

On the face of it you'd wonder why as outwardly I'm 'successful' but I've felt like this for as long as I remember. I've tried therapy, but my therapist couldn't understand why I felt this way and was no real help, I just don't want to take part in the great dance of life I guess. I struggle to take things seriously or apply myself as life just seems like one big absurdity.

I don't know why I've posted this, I guess I just needed to get it off my chest.
