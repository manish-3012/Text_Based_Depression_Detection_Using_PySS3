Suicide notes are boring, I wrote a dumb poem for when I decide to leaveI guess I'll just post it on my facebook or something like a true millennial.  

A farewell to all and sundry
A poem I always knew I'd write
Too weak to continue swimming 
Too weak to sink
The world is a ship
And I'm clinging to debris
Or tied to the mast and dragged along 
The light from belowdecks like a casino
A weary gambler strapped for cash
One last bet to place
The flip of a coin, its arc a trace
Heads you live, tails I die
And to those of you who'd claim not to know that this poem was brewing
I dub you liar, I dub you thief, stealer caught unknowing
You always knew this day would come
And so did I
Shot my shot and bought my lot
Ticket punched and thrown away
I always wished I'd be fixed
I'm sorry there was no other way
I don't want a funeral, no mourners, no masks
No one to ponder the questions left unasked
I only want what I've always wanted
To be forgot and then forgotten
Hopefully he'll be alright without me
