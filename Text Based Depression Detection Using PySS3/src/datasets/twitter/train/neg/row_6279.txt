Finding my place in the world.Iâ€™ve been lost my whole life. Destroyed over and over again by people that I love most. Guilted to be with someone that just wanted to hurt me. Lost, feeling like a an abandoned puppy on the side of a road. 

Iâ€™m tired. I can barely stand getting up in the morning. Living as a human is incredibly hard. Bring on depression, anxiety, DID, and on top of that chronic body pain - barely being able to move most days because Iâ€™m in so much pain.
 
Iâ€™m only twenty years old, but the pain makes me feel so much older. Itâ€™s hard to even describe chronic pain to someone that has never felt it. Itâ€™s like a constant dull pain, and sometimes when you try to move your whole body just says no. You canâ€™t. You have to stay in that place.


Anyways, enough rambling. Iâ€™ve bought the things needed to put me into a peaceful rest. Itâ€™s everything Iâ€™ve planned for. I have a month and a half left before I go.

Iâ€™m ready to go into the black abyss, where my soul will finally feel free.
