Feelings. Feelings deep down in there.I don't usually get upset. You don't understand how hard it actually is to offend me. But after hundreds of death threats and hateful comments I finally understood that I am not emotionally invincible. Not only from society, but even my own family. No one wants me. I feel so cold. So lonely. I've got no warmth. No warmth from people. No people who want to support me. I know I'm not the best person to exist. I've done horrible, unforgivable things. I'm fully aware of that. I was a pretty confident guy, you know? I always used to be so proud of myself. Proud of the damage I've caused. Proud of the pain I caused to others. Well, I still kind of am. I don't feel pity for people. Well, unless they're really important to me. And not many people like that exist. It's really hard to understand people like me. I don't care about anyone or anything anymore. I'm slowly becoming emotionless. An empty shell of a human. My life could perhaps even be compared to things such a garden with no flowers. No emotions, no positivity. I hope this will change soon. I hope I won't feel like this for much longer. I really just want to feel happy again. But I doubt it's ever going to happen. Every day comes more pain and misery. It's getting worse with each day. Everywhere I go, there's always misfortune waiting for me. Somewhere. Doesn't matter where. There's always something that ruins my day. My sleep schedule is messed up. At this moment, it's 4:50 AM. I always stayed up till 4 AM or longer. But this is getting horrendous. I don't know what I'm supposed to do with my life anymore. I doubt there's any happiness or positive evergy waiting for me anytime soon.
