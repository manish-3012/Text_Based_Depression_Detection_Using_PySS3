The urge to kill my self grows. Regrets. Sadness. Am I alone ?I honestly donâ€™t know how I have the strength to keep going.   I suppose there is Hope the size of a pebble inside of me that still has me holding on.   It must be.  Because I want to be free of this pain so badly.  Itâ€™s unbearable.  You look at your situation and u see nothing is getting better.   Youâ€™ve exhausted all your options and itâ€™s like.  The urge to die grows stronger.  
regrets flood my head. Everyone else that has chosen to leave me. Is happy. Much happier without me.     It gets thrown in my face all the time.   I love my mother so much and she loves me.  Sheâ€™s really why Iâ€™m still here.   I know it would tear her to
Shreds to know I killed myself.    Itâ€™s just.  So
Hard.  So hard.   I donâ€™t sleep well.   I struggle to regulate my emotions at work .  People think
Iâ€™m a weirdo.  Nd Iâ€™m not.   Iâ€™m just a 30 year old man thatâ€™s hurting so bad.   Does anyone feel like I do ?
