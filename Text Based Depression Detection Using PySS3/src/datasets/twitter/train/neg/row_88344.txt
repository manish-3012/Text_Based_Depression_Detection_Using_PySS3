I can't take my job anymoreI have been working at a place called great wolf lodge as a lifeguard for 3 years now. Every time I go in there I end up wanting to kill myself by the end of my shift. Yesterday I ended up working late because they needed help and I said why not what the hell cause I had in service that night as well and I had come in late too. Fast forward to the end of my shift, the way something specific was handled just broke me down. This was targeted at me specifically we usually have 2 supervisors on the floor and one manager. The other supervisor Came up to me and said that he didn't agree with how they handled things and I just broke down and told him what I am writing here. He got hired as a supervisor and told him this shit happens all the time. My mother picked me up after in service I worked from 2pm to 11pm, and I just broke down crying saying I cant do this anymore. I am 21m about to be 22. I just can't take this job anymore
