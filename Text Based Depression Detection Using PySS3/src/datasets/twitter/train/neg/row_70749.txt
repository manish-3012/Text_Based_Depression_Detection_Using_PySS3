I think the only way to ever get through life is to blue pill yourself in some way.Look at us all. Miserable and depressed. We can't see a way out and I think that is because we know everything in meaningless so we turn to suicidal thoughts to make us feel better, death is the only closure we will ever get to everything. I am not depressed because of an illness in my opinion. I'm depressed because I see the world for how it is and its full of unanswerable questions. It seems as humans we need something to pull us through life like a beautiful lie we tell ourselves. The truth of things is just too much to bare.
