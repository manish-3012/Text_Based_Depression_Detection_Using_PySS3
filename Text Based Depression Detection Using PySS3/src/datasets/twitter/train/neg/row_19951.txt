This is NOT a symathy post....Im 37, single, live in a country town, where men are supposed to work physical jobs. But due to my back injuries, im stranded and unable to pay bills and eat. Im leaving suicide till the new year so I dont hurt my mum before christmas. My mind is made up. Im one of those losers with constant shit luck, and every year Im sinking even further. Enough of my sob story, so here is what I really want to ask. I have 150 mg lyrica tabs and 10 mg baclofen tabs, and I want to know how much I need to take, I dont want to end up in a coma, I need complete brain death and organ failure. Can anyone tell me how much I need to take to end it properly. Also, this is a little left field, but are there any attractive, wild women who would willing to spend a crazy dirty weekend with me before I do finish this life. I only ask because loneliness has also been a curse, and I would love to enjoy the company of a woman, and feel like a real man again, so I can go out with smile. I know its sounds fucked up, but anyone willing to help me with this, I would be incredibaly grateful for my last horah. I would be willing to trade photos, as to show I am not fat, old or ugly.
