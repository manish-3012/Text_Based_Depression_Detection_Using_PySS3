Do any of you just wish you could od on whatever and just, leave slowly and quietly?I always wanted to go out with my head high and to the sky but i donâ€™t see any reason anymore. Iâ€™ve gone through every class of antidepressant besides maois, and i donâ€™t wanna restart that journey finding a new medication. iâ€™d rather just take a bunch of sedatives like i have been, but instead of just trying to get through the day, i wanna leave. with no note. with no one near. i want to die alone. atleast then, i wonâ€™t die thinking if they need something. or i did something wrong to them.

i just want it to end. i want the suffering to stop.
