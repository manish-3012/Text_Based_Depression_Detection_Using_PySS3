My dad keeps (unintentionally??) egging me on to commit suicide.All he fucking does is bitch about me being on the internet too much. He takes it away for the stupidest reasons. For example, he literally took it away for a day just because I didn't empty the dishwasher. He doesn't understand the concept of depression, and yes I know that to get better you have to do things you might not want to do, but he's not trying to solve the root of the problem. He thinks he's helping, but he's not. 

He's making me wake up at 6 am tommorow to go to some volunteering he signed me up for without my knowledge. He wants to get me out of the house, which I understand, but going this far is just unnecessary. It's currently around 11:30 pm as I'm writing this, so if I fall asleep at midnight, I'm only going to get 6 hours of sleep (when I usually need 9-10). I'm probably not going to be able to fall asleep that early because my sleeping schedule is fucked up. He told me to go to sleep early for the past couple of days, but I just can't change my sleep schedule that fast, especially since I have depression which affects one's sleeping neurotransmitters. 

The majority of my day was spent dealing with OCD today, and he's just back at it again, telling me to smile, like that will fix all my problems. Fuck off. Not to sound like some angsty emo, but he doesn't understand me at all. He literally threatened to stop taking me to the psychiatrist so I won't get my meds. Bitch are you trying to make it easier for me to commit suicide? This dumbass thinks I'll be put under government housing, but I'll kill myself before then. I guess I'm just scraping the bottom of the barrel, trying to get the best out of life before I go (which is like video games and internet and shit). 

When I think about killing myself, I feel disappointed. Why couldn't I have had a good life? But if I can't have one, suicide is the next best thing.
