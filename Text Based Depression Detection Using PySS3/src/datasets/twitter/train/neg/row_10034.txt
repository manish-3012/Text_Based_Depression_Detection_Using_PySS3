The medication doesnâ€™t help. I canâ€™t copeI lost everything I held dead recently and Iâ€™ve not been able to bounce back. Iâ€™ve always struggled with the way I feel and tried to end it all many times in previous years. Now I canâ€™t see any silver lining I donâ€™t want to be here, I donâ€™t want people to care, I just want to disappear as if I never existed. The only fear I have is how it will effect those who are close to me. I donâ€™t want to hurt my family or my friends but I feel like theyâ€™ve all abandoned me and I just canâ€™t do it anymore. I donâ€™t want to be here. I canâ€™t find any reasons to keep going
