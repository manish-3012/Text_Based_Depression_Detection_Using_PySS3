Im just so doneI've just been yo yod around for two years with my now ex and it hurts. This isn't the first time this has happened to me and it just seems like this is going to keep happening. This person told me they'd always love me then just stopped giving a shit. Im tired of getting close to people just to end up not meaning shit. I have no friends to talk to and Im too scared to call a help line. I cant afford therapy and I honestly am afraid to die but I feel like its my only option. If I die, Im a coward. If I live, Im a liar. I cant fucking win and I never could. I just want this to end.
