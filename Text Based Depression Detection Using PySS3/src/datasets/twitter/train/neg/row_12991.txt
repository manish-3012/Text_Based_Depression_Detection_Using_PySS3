Intrusive Thoughts Are Killing MeI have an amazing life. I have an amazing family and friends. I am smart, I am pretty, and I am fun. But I can't keep living like this; I can't stop fantasizing about death. I literally can't imagine growing old with anyone around me. The thought of turning 80 and still being alive terrifies me.

I can't focus on my life at all because every time I sit by myself suicidal thoughts pop into my head. Right now I just want to hang myself from my office ceiling. No one would notice for a day or two if I told my SO, friends, and family that I was studying hard for an exam. Or, if I did it on a weekend, it might even be 3 to 5 days before someone catches on.

All of this is making it hard to be affectionate towards others and is making me an outcast. I feel so outside of myself right now. And I can't ask anyone for help because I need to show people that I am stronger than last year. That I did beat my depression. That I'm worthy of love. No one will love me when I'm needy.

Lately it seems that my SO might be talking to another woman. I'm at the end of my rope about a lot of things, but that is just pushing me off the edge. Every time I think about their messages I start crying uncontrollably.

What can you do though when he tells you he loves you, right?

I feel so empty inside. No matter how much I do to fill myself up, I'm just a black hole that will never be satisfied. Why let such a person live? I'm too set in my ways to change. If I were gone, I think most people could move on easily since I don't have anyone I talk to everyday outside of my SO.

I try to make changes and I keep failing. There's no point. The thoughts will always be there and they will probably win soon. Why try fighting it?
