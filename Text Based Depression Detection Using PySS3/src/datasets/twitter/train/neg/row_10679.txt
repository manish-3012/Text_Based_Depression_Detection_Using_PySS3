My girlfriend is leaving meHey guys. Rough time right now. I am a college drop out. I owe my best friend (who no longer is my friend) $600, and my girlfriend just told me she doesn't know if she loves me anymore. Tonight is the first night I've wanted to actually die. I just don't have the will to keep going. I still love my girlfriend. I hate that I've become a burden on everyone around me.
