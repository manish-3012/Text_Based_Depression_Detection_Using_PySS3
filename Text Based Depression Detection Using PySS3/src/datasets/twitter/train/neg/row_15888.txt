I lost who I wasSo let me say this before I start... thank you for taking the time to read this...

My whole life has been an amazing ride and was filled with so many great people and times. I lost myself because everyone in my life has gone. My best friend is serving 15 years in prison and every since that happened my life just feels like itâ€™s going down the drain... I lost 50k not to mention the love of my life deleting me out of her life... I have no money anymore... my car is fucked, and I feel like Iâ€™m not a man anymore. I feel like life just keeps punching me while Iâ€™m down... I canâ€™t fucking take it... Iâ€™ve always been so strong and always made sure everyone else is happy and okay... I donâ€™t even know how to cry because I canâ€™t let myself feel broken... I just feel numb, I miss everyone in my life thatâ€™s fucking gone... The world just isnâ€™t what it used to be...
