Struggles..I'm very stuck in this point of my life. I am unattractive and flawed but I have an amazing family, support, a home and everything I need. So I'm like okay, I SHOULD kill myself because i'm probably too ugly to fix.. but.. I have all this. My options now are suicide or plastic surgery.. There is A TONNE I have to do to fix my appearance and it'll cost a lot of money. It just gets hard sometimes :/ The only friend in real life I have is my cousin and I've had one BF in my whole life, it wasn't even that long or serious. I get soo lonely due to my ugliness
