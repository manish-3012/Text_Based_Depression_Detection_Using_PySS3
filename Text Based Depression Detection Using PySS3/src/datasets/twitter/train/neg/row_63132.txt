The concept of life is unbearable

The worldâ€™s climate will raise to an unbearable temperature while I am still alive. Our favorite restaurants and businesses we grew up will and are closing. With climate change, we donâ€™t even have that long to live, Iâ€™m twenty and I probably wonâ€™t die from natural causes/old age. Speaking of, i donâ€™t know what I want to do with my life which means idk what I want to do in school and aimlessly wandering absolutely sucks. I like to lay around and be sedentary. I donâ€™t want to work for the rest of my life...it sounds miserable. This pandemic made me realize we could all die at any given moment. I guess I say all this to say, I donâ€™t enjoy life or the prospect of living. Itâ€™s exhausting. Iâ€™m tired of taking care of myself. Iâ€™m tired of caring for others all the time. Iâ€™m tired of constantly working to support myself, and I have a fun, easy-going job. Should I just do heroin and get sick until I die lol? Is life worth it for those of us that think of life like this?
