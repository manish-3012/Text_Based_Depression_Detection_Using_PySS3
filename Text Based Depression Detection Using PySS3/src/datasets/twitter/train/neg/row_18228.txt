i dont know where my life is goingim currently in high school, and my family isnâ€™t fairly well off. my parents work long hours and i have to look after my two littler sisters everyday. my dad, although he drinks and smokes weed often, is a very stoic man. i look up to him in a way. however he nags to me about how i should take up a sport and do something with my life. he constantly complains about this and i understand why. i could possibly get a scholarship so my family would have to pay less for college, but i really feel nothing towards sports. i dont really care for sports and ive never enjoyed participating in them. i dont want to let him down, so i tried doing soccer. i felt very out of place there and i was made fun of alot for constantly having cramps during conditioning. i was sick of it so i quit. when i told my dad he brushed it off, but i knew he was disappointed in me. at the time i was really struggling alot with myself and problems i had with the people around me, and on top i had some pretty hard ap classes. all around i was stressed and i had nobody to turn to for help. its been a couple months after this whole debacle, and i cant say ive gotten any better. ive been able to keep up with grades, but im beginning to feel empty. i feel talentless and idk just capable of nothing. all my hobbies are all art related, and i dont think pursuing a career in editing would make my dad proud. my relationships feel shallow as well, like i feel like i cant tell anybody this or ill just be made fun of or looked down upon. idk. i just want to stop trying so hard. tbh ive considered a life of 9 to 5 where i can play video games in my spare time. i feel like i would have less worries doing that. but i dont want to disappoint my family as the oldest. idk i just really dont know whats in store for me next and im scared.
