Did I assault/creep on someone else again?I'm the guy who was behind this post:

I was meeting up with my ex-girlfriend, who I broke up with because of this OCD, for the first time since. We hugged. I noticed her breasts against my chest and leaned my chest in, but I wasn't doing it for sexual pleasure, but rather, it's felt natural.

Back in her room, I noticed she was wearing nothing but a bra under her jacket, which got me thinking about her breasts again. Naturally, I leaned in my hug, but wasn't doing it for sexual pleasure. I leaned back a second after realizing it.

Did I just assault her/do something creepy? I can't ask her because we're broken up and I don't want to make things weird.

**I wasn't sexualizing it, my prior thinking about it caused me to seek it as natural placement of my chest. Not for pleasure.**
