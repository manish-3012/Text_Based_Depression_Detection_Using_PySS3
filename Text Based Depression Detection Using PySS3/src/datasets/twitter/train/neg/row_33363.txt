I regret not killing myself two years agoThen I had nothing to live for, I spent most of my days in bed, unable to get up. Nobody showed any kind of interest about where I had gone or what is happening with me. Nobody cared.

Now, two years later. I have a boyfriend and we just got our first apartment, he is so excited about living together but I am horrified. I know that I wonâ€™t be able to support our home, since I even canâ€™t keep a job since it makes me even more suicidal. I really really wanna die, since meds and doctors donâ€™t help(I take meds daily and visit doctor once a month). I dont wanna live him alone, but I really cant go on anymore...
