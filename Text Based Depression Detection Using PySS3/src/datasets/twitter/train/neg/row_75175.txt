I've been extremely happy for the past few daysLast week I relapsed into a vicious cycle of self harm. Its a nasty habit I picked up when I was a kid. It didnt help, I just felt embarrassed for doing that shit as an adult. Nothing can ease the pain now.
I went hiking yesterday, alone. It was such an enjoyable experience. I felt calm and happy, smiling the whole way. That was the first time I went outside in months. Im writing goodbye letters remembering all the good times with my friends and family, the bad stuff doesnt faze me anymore. I will give away all my stuff so maybe they will remember me as someone they can rely on, and not like the burden I became because of my illness. Only after I decided I'm doing it have I found peace. Knowing its going to happen soon gives me comfort. It will all be over.
