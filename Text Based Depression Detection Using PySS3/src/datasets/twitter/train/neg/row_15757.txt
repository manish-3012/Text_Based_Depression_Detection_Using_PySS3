Im fucking worthlessEveryday, I feel worthless. The only things that make me feel good about myself are my friends who care about me so much and when i watch PewDiePie(cliche i know). Everyone at my school looks at me as a loser and im always being teased, pressured and bullied. The only thing stopping people from physically bullying me is that my friend is a fucking giant and is so popular. That may be a perk but its also a burden. My friend is great but the fact that hes a giant makes people treat him better without getting to know him. I recently made friends with this girl who i then learned to have a crush on and had been talking to her for months everyday for hours. I then introduce her to my friend and soon enough, she spends time talking to him constantly, ignoring me, and making me feel like absolute crap. This has happened so many times with so many different people. It isnt his fault but this factor makes me feel absolutely horrible. Lately ive been thinking suicidal and have even been on the edge of my apartment building one foot out. I find myself crying and depressed a lot of the time. Its worse when im in front of people and i have to act like im okay when really im not okay. Anyways thats my story if u read to the end thank you.
