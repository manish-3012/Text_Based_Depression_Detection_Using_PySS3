Even if I had a future, the world doesnâ€™t.Letâ€™s just pretend for a second that the basic bitch â€œiT gEtS bEtTeRâ€ advice actually worked. Letâ€™s say that overnight all my depression, anxiety, trauma, mistakes, etc. vanished and I was reborn as a heathy and happy person. There still wouldnâ€™t be a point in living. The planet is dying, the economy is shit, the political system is shit, mainstream media/entertainment rehashes the same garbage, and the general public is too fucking entitled to have any awareness for any of it. Everyone is so fucking selfish and apathetic, they donâ€™t care about others and they donâ€™t care about problems unless it affects them directly. Whatâ€™s the point of living in such an alienating world, even if I did better myself? So I can keep working and make money for some rich asshole? So I can keep distracting myself with material things? So I can keep going through the motions of what life is â€œsupposedâ€ to be? Fuck that. This world is never gonna change in my lifetime, so thereâ€™s no point in even sticking around. Fuck this shithole.
