I'm getting desperateI'm almost done. I just can't keep finding the drive or push to continue with people. It seems nobody puts fourth the same effort as I do and I feel rejected or pushed off by everybody. I just can't keep trying anymore. Everyday is a constant battle and I always lose at the end if it. I'm just so tired. Doors keep shutting and I'm just so close to ending it. I'm begging for help. Please somebody give the courage to continue because I'm scared of dying but it seems to be the only way to relieve my constant pain.
