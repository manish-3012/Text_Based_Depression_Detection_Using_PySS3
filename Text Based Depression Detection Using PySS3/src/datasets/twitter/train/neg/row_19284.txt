I want to die but I hate all the methods availableI've been actively ideating for the past 3ish months but I can't commit because I am too afraid of more pain and discomfort, or failure and being left with more disabilities than I already have. 

I had surgery yesterday and I prayed that I would die while I was under anesthesia. I was so upset when I woke up and grieved all evening and am still grieving today. I'm not religious but I prayed, I prayed so hard that my heart would stop or I'd have a blood clot or a huge embolism or I'd bleed out before anyone could do anything while I was unconscious and peaceful. 

I just don't want to be alive anymore. Due to my severe medical problems I am a burden to my husband, the only person who cares about me. I recently lost my best friend and have no other friends and no social skills. I'm incredibly unattractive and just getting older and uglier as my medical problems take over my life. I have complete anhedonia and can't feel pleasure, love, or anything other than the grinding pain of existence. I can't enjoy anything, food, music, everything is gone. I'm a worthless piece of shit and all my dreams are dead because I'm disabled, and I'm nothing but a burden. 

Yes, I have great doctors and therapists. No, none of it helps or will help. 

I either have to try to take up some death sports or have some riskier surgeries.
