Life is going decent, but i just canâ€™t be happygonna cut the sob story out of this because no one wants to hear it, iâ€™m writing this as my girlfriend lays beside me asleep. no matter what happens in my life i just canâ€™t make myself happy, i donâ€™t get excited over things, i donâ€™t find joy in things that i used to, i feel pressured and stressed 90% of the time. suicide is the only thing i think about every single day. iâ€™ve been admitted to a psych ward for suicidal reasons once before a couple years ago and all i think about is maybe next time that wonâ€™t be an option because iâ€™ll do something crazy enough to actually get myself killed.

i donâ€™t have a lot going for me at the moment, my mom died last year so i was left homeless at 18, my dad wanted nothing to do with me so iâ€™m currently living with my brother. i have no friends and no real hobbies. i work a shit retail job with my girlfriend, and i dread being alive every second im awake. things with my girl arenâ€™t great either lately, weâ€™ve been fighting a lot and almost broke up once, the stress of thinking sheâ€™s gonna leave me or cheat on me is through the roof and i canâ€™t sleep at night because itâ€™s all i think about. even though i know she would never do either of those things it still worries me because thatâ€™s just the kind of person i am. 

my mental health has been so bad lately iâ€™ve been researching places to buy cheap handguns so i can just end it all at once. fucking gun control. take my life not our guns. iâ€™m tired of being stuck in this mindset but i donâ€™t know where to go for help.
