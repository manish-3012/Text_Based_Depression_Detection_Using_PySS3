FuckIm back. I thought i got out of this shit but im back here posting again feeling like im gonna blow my head off if i actually wake up in the morning. Sometimes this shit doesnt work out no matter how hard i try or how many times i try. Im so fucking dumb for giving life so many chances. Im really really tired.
