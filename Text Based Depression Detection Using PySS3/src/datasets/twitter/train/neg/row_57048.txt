HelpI lost my job because of the Covid situation and didnâ€™t have enough capital to put into any LT business. My money has run out, Iâ€™ve sold all of my stocks and now I donâ€™t have a penny to my name. My bank balance is Â£0, I have no job and Â£7k debt. On the 4th of January Iâ€™ve got Â£300 worth of Direct Debits to pay out with no way of doing so. My debt is increasing my the day. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE give me some ideas on how I can get my money up. I feel so trapped
