Want to kill myself today, but meh.Planning on killing myself around 1 or 2 today.  Middle class white male who never had anything go wrong.  I've never been happy, don't know why, why live if you're never happy etc etc.  I also know this is a cry for help and i'm okay with that, i'm almost positive I just need someone to say "stop being a dickhead you dickhead" and i'll be okay.  Today I looked at pictures of people who actually struggle through life and told myself "look at that shit, your life is fucking easy compared to that" but I don't know.  it's never been that my life is hard, I just don't get anything out of it.  I just need someone to say "you're a white middle class privileged dickhole, don't kill yourself" and anyone who understands that weird feeling of "my life is good but im not" to comment.  thanks.
