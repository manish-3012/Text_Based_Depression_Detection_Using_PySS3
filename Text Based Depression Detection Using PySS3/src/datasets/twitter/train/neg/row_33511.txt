failurealmost a month later and iâ€™m finally out of the hospital. itâ€™s funny how when you try to kill yourself, and then get sent to the psych ward afterwards, all they have you do is sit in a room, color (only with dull crayons), and see a therapist every other day who listens to you for 5 minutes before ushering you out the door. 

i still donâ€™t have meds, i still donâ€™t have help. all i have now is liver damage, insanely expensive hospital bills, and a sense of failure. if god is real, he must really wanna watch me suffer
