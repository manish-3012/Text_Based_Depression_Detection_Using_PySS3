It's not even a question anymoreI'm under immediate threat of being committed and medicated against my will -- I don't even want to talk about it. I'm about to take a dramatic dive in my standard of living within the next couple years too. I have no way of supporting myself, and am not interested in alternatives. I don't get along with people, and all I really want to do is get away from everyone. Now I have a golden opportunity -- a perfect reason. 

If I don't find a lawyer who thinks he can get me out of my mess by Friday (I doubt anybody will think they can when they hear everything), I'm putting my exit bag to use. You ever have one of those moments where all the awful shit in your life comes into spectacular focus? Checkmate on me.

That's all. I don't even know if there's anything to talk about. I've been humiliated in ways I don't even want to acknowledge. They've scored all the points they're going to get on me. How's the weather where you live? Where I am on the West Coast, it was warm all last month. Just finally cooling down.
