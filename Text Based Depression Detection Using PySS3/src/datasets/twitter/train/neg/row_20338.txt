The thought of being freed is comforting.I'm going to fly and be free soon, don't know when but I know soon.

I can't wait. I'm going to be free from this place! I'm really excited. It's like going on vacation where you're nervous but excited at the same time. I want to spread my wings and fly away. To finally see the light and ascend to where I belong. I can't wait for that moment. I'll miss my friends and family here but I know it'll be better in the long run if I do this. I'm going to fly and be free and nobody can stop me.
