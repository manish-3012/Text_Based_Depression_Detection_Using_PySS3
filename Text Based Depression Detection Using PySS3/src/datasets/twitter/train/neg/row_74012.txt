Reached out for help and shot downI've dealt with mental illness most of my adult life. Anxiety is fairly constant, eventually it wears me out and I can fall into a deep depression. This brings on alot of suicide ideation, negative self talk, constantly tearing myself down. 

I have sought out counselling, and found it sort of lost it's effectiveness, I don't like talking to friends and family because the reaction is always.... Poor even if people mean well..

In the last two weeks the depression set in again and I've felt like talking to someone about it but I can never bring myself to. I feel like a burden (I know this is normal) and don't want to turn people off.

This morning I woke up and was stuck in a mental loop of suicide ideation and negativity. Trying to think of some solution. I rolled over to look at my phone and saw a girl I'd been chatting with from a dating app had messaged me out of the blue, we sort of stopped talking over the last few weeks. She had wished me a happy leap day and asked how I was doing... I turned it over in my mind... Should I just say how I feel? What do I have to lose? Maybe this is a good opportunity to let out my emotions. So I did, I said I was thinking alot about suicide and wasn't having a good day.... It couldn't have gone worse... She blew up on my and called me an energy vampire, said she doesn't need people like me in her life and I'm disrespectful to her. She basically went on a little tirade and told me to never talk to her ever again... I'm not really sure if I have a question about this just thought it was almost kind of funny? In a morbid kind of way, like it couldn't have gone any worse than that. Was this mean? Am I in the wrong?
