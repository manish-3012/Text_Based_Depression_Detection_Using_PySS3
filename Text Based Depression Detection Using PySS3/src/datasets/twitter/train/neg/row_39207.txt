i live with a woman who started cheating on mei have nowhere to go. and if i had a place to go, i have no way to get there. and if i had a place to go &amp; a way to get there, i don't have a way to make money, because my credit is completely wrecked and she does all my banking. i have no friends, no family, no job, no car, no membership in anything.
no way out.
i need to hear a damn good reason to live.
