Thanks SW in advance.Is a 30/30 powerful enough to not leave me a vegetable?  I've been sitting here for about a month with this thing loaded in the corner.  I put it to my chin a couple times to feel the cold metal and to ensure proper placement, but I fear that I may survive this.  I've posted here before, but I get the same advice and it doesn't help.  I have so many demons in my past yet no one to come clean with.  I'm sick of mirrors, just want to punch every one I see.  The guy I see looking back isn't anything I had imagined he would be 10 years ago.  I have depression, anxiety, and stress which cause me to have no motivation, and everyday I come home from my "going nowhere" job and lay in bed for hours staring at a wall.  Many times my staring matches with the wall result in me crying uncontrollably and feeling so alone.  I'm not alone though, got a girlfriend.  We've had a rough year or so and it's going down the shitter.  I actually spit in her face today in a fit of rage.  I've advised her many times that she should go meet a real man who can actually satisfy and make her happy. ( a car accident makes from my waist down numb and uncomfortable and has greatly affected my sex life.)  I wish I would've had that outburst on her in public so I maybe would've been brutally stomped out by some real men.  Overall I'd rate myself a 4/10.  I had 1 friend, my girlfriend, but not anymore.  I associate with people at work but I put on the happy go lucky bullshit there.  I'm real tired.  This is draining everything in me.  I had big dreams of college and wanting to be a proud and productive citizen.  Arrests and demons from childhood have abruptly ended all my dreams.  So, will I be okay with the 30/30 or should I go pick up something with a higher caliber?
