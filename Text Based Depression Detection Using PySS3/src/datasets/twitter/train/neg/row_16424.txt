I donâ€™t think what I think means much anymoreIve had my values and thoughts and viewpoints demeaned and broken down and crushed beyond repair, but I feel like a dick anyways. I feel like an asshole when i really shouldnt, all because of some simple bullshit. This is pile don so much other shit too and i dont think i can handle it. I dont have any family that supports me, the people I once loved never try to support me either, and my friends feel so distant that even asking them to help feels embarrassing and meaningless. I havent talked ahout anything i have been feeling for a long time either, because i feel likr if i do, itâ€™ll be stomped on just like everything else. Mental abuse venting could jusy lead to my problems being out down over othersâ€™ issues and i cant handle that. I feel close to just taking myself away from people because it just seems more and more likr iâ€™m the problem. Sorry for being nonsensical i just needed to get this tupid shit out somewhere
