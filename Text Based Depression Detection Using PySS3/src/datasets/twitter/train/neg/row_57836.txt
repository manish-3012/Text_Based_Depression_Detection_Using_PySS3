The worst its beenI have just hit an all time low in depression, I am past the anger/frustration that I am used to. If I am depressed I get angry, I get mad, and sad; I attempt to harm myself through the means of hitting, banging, scratching, but now I am passed that. I haven't gotten angry yet, nor mad, nor have I done anything to harm myself. I simply opened up my laptop and began to write my suicide note, it came to the point that I was tired of typing into something that has no response, so I turn here for assistance. This is not my first posts, might even be my last, shit I'm even at the point of calling the suicide hotline. I never thought I'd hear myself say that.

For all of those who just read that and are completely lost I will link you to my previous posts, I think it should explain my back-story. [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/gshtd/dead_at_17/)

There's a whole lot more and actually some updates but I shall tell it to those who inquire about it.  

**Edit** I think I have come to the conclusion that I am going to finish writing my suicide not and end it later tonight in my bathtub by slitting my wrists.
