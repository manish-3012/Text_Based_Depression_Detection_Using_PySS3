Maybe it's time for me.Please read everything i have to say before commenting. I've been living on this world for a short amunt of time but for fucks sake i cant handle it. Everyday feels worse amd worse. The only person who shown me love and affection left me for my friend amd the fucking shit going on at my home males it worse. I've been putting off hurting myself because i know there are some people qho give some fuck about me but they'll leave me. Everyone does. Its been a cycle for me. I cant get a job and leave house and the closest thing i have thats good is that im good at editing videos. God i miss my ex so much. She's been everything to me. She was the only person to help my self harm and alcohol issues. But now who cares?? Not her. Fuck man I've been dreaming of my own funeral for the longest time. I just cant handle it. But at this point i think it might happen. I'm sorry that i wasn't good enough C. Im sorry i couldnt show how happy i was. Im sorry that this fucked thing you call a world pressured me into this. Maybe in the afterlife this could be better...
