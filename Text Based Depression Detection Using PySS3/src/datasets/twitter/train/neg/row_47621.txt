Ready to go.I just can't go on anymore.

I am going to play some games with my brothers tonight, after that I'm going to do it.

I couldn't get any helium so I had to make a pipegun. I really hate how violent it is, but I guess the result is the same.

I'm just tired of being a fuckup. I didn't pay rent so I am fucking my roommates over, including my brother since he is one of my roommates. 

Spent $400 getting a wisdom tooth pulled 2 days before my car got towed. Car got towed 2 days before I lost my job. Can't seem to get my tax return because of some mixup with an old address. Couldn't make my fucking final car payment because it went to getting it out of impound, now it is going to be repo'd.

I'm just sick of life. Why does everything have to be so hard all of the time? 

I'm 28.

I fuckin hate bananas.  

Heres a link to my fuckin favorite song. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT4RainY-lY
