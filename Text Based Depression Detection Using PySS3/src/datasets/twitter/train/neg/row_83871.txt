Society, have mercy on me. I hope you're not lonely without meI don't fit into society. I thought I had a place but not anymore. I thought I could find happiness by helping others but not anymore. Being alone sucks and no one understands it. Staring at walls every day, having no one to talk to, missing the sensation of touch makes me sad. Everyone says that it'll get better but every day I only lose people. No, it's not getting better.  Why is it worth it if I cry every day? Is this worth it? It's not anyone's fault but mine. I'm not even that bad a person :(, I just have the wrong numbers in the lottery and I will never win. Why play a game you'll never win?
