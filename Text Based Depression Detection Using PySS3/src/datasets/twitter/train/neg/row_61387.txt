I just wish I was neededIâ€™ve never been important to anyone. From my earliest memories Iâ€™ve never been needed, or wanted, or someone to keep around for any extended period of time and I just donâ€™t know how much longer I can go on like this.

This feeling has seeped itself into every facet of my life. I canâ€™t trust people, I canâ€™t be hurt anymore, absolutely *no one* has done anything but use me as a doormat and Iâ€™ve never been able to understand why. I tried to isolate myself and become comfortable in it but the loneliness is just another reminder that it doesnâ€™t matter what I do...Iâ€™m not allowed to be happy.
