Iâ€™m not active anymore, but I constantly find my self imagining things, even tho I not at that point anymore. Or is it we are always at that point after getting there?So itâ€™s been about 3-4 years since I last tried. Maybe about 2 years since I really wanted to. I work in the National parks doing maintenance, surrounding myself with natural beauty and trying to see the good things in life. It helps me a lot.
However, there is many many time where I do a hike and a get to the top, look over the edge, and see my self jumping and falling. Or when itâ€™s snowing, just stripping down and taking a long hike.

I donâ€™t know if want to, or anything like that. But I mean given the right circumstances Iâ€™m not fighting it. But I have, like, activated a part of my thinking. Like is this alway going to happen? Am I still active? Am I just to the point of understanding that that is an option and I have to now actually reject that option now? 
Is this only me? Am I alone with this?
