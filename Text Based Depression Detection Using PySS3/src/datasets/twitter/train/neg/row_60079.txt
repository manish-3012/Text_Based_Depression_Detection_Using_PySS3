The only thing that stops me are my parentsI've been severely depressed for over 3 years, now. Zoloft and weed have helped a great deal, but thoughts still surface. I tried to kill myself with an overdose last year and just got sick and threw it up, did not tell a soul. Since then many friends have moved and girls don't seem to care much for me. Now I type this im shaking and sobbing/laughing wanting to end it. But I just can't face my parents. I'm the youngest of 5 and my older brother has OD'ed multiple times from heroin/oxy, he is still alive. The thought of putting my death, or even the idea of me dying onto them is just so painful, I cant put them through that after all the work they have done. But, it doesnt stop the thoughts, just reroutes them. The emotions are just crippling me, i've never cried like this before.
