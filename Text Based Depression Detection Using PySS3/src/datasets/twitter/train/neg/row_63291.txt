I'm so tired.That's it, that's the post. I'm so goddamn tired.

I know exactly how to kill myself -- a cocktail of hard liquor and a handful of my lithium, but I don't have either on hand. When I get more of my lithium later this week we'll see. Maybe I'll get off my fat ass and stop being such a goddamn coward and do the thing.
