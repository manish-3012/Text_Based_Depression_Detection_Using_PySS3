It's 10 minutes past midnight and all I want is to die.I don't know why I'm posting this here. I guess I just need to let it out.

There's not even anything to be so sad about in my life. The big picture is good, it's just the little details that make me want to take my own life. My stepdad molested me when I was 15, my mom literally doesn't give a single fuck. She even sexualises me herself. She wanted me to be in a relationship with a 28 year old man when I was 16. She told me to be nice to her boss who kept asking to hold my hand in public, because we would get more money if I was nice. I never go out, because every neighbor around me that catches me makes inappropriate comments and just stares. I see women being sexualised everywhere I go and it makes me feel so small. I am more than my body. I am more than my skin. 

I have no friends and I never go out. I don't have a problem with it, it just gets lonely from time to time. After a while it gets exhausting when you are stuck with yourself in your head all the time. I don't want friends or a hobby as a temporary fix, I want to be okay with myself. 

I have social anxiety, but that's not an actual thing in Germany. Everyone just thinks that I am weird. I cannot deal with people in real life, not even my own family. The people I've ever been comfortable with were my ex-boyfriends; because I chose them myself. I'm getting judged for everything I do; even by the person who considers me her "best friend", when we don't even talk about each other's lives. 

I couldn't get my second (better) degree in school, because I couldn't handle the people. I feel like I am not a part of this world anywhere I go. 

My existence is exhausting and pointless. I don't want to be here anymore.
