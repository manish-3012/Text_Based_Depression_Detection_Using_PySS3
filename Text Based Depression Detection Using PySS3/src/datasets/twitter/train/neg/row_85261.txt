You cant change who you are.I cant rememeber a time in my life that I didnt want to die. Even when I'm happy, I want to die. It isnt something that I want to want, but it is who I am. This compulsion of mine causes a lot of problems in my life and my only solution is, to kill myself. I dont know if it's something I'll ever accomplish, but it's a desire I dont think I'll ever be able to get rid of. No matter how much I trick myself/others into thinking I've changed for our pleasure. I am who I am and I want what I want, some things you cant change.
