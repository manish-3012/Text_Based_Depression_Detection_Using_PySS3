Had to move this post from /Anxiety to /SuicideWatchOver time I've gotten to where I can handle most issues I come across constructively. Not necessarily perfectly, but I can see the problem, see how I'm feeling about it, accept those feelings and find an appropriate action if necessary.

I can't seem to do this when I think about how I relate with other people. I'm successful socially, and I don't avoid social situations as far as I can tell, but I often feel that I am awkward, unsuccessful and on the outside of things (I depersonalize my interactions both at the time and when I recall them.) When I try to address these thoughts, rather than establishing that it's at least somewhat inaccurate and fixable, I end up spiraling into depression until I can pass out for the night.

For instance tonight I tried to post to the anxiety subreddit and ask if what I was experiencing was typical of a social anxiety issue. Instead I ended up curled up in my bed, at one point beating my wrists together, wanting desperately to find a lighter and burn myself, and in lieu of that find a cliff and a gun, stand with my back to the fall, put the gun in my mouth and let the propulsion throw me off the cliff so that I'd be sure to die.

I'm pretty sure I don't want to die, and I don't want to hurt myself because I know that doesn't actually help me. But if I can't even address the issue in privacy without creating a detailed suicide plan, talking to someone else (interacting with them in a very vulnerable way) about it would probably be a billion times worse, to a point where thoughts might even become actions. I really don't know, because I can't get close enough to give it any thought. What do I do?

EDIT: No one will talk to me...
