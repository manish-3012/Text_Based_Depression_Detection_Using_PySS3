Stigma Surrounding SuicideBeing in control of oneâ€™s fate should be a human right and people should not have to resort to painful and often botched attempts at suicide. Iâ€™m sorry for saying this but there are people who are suffering and see this as an act of ending that. Society makes it seem so cowardly and extreme when in reality it takes bravery and extreme circumstances for one to be at that place. Iâ€™ve been researching and self starvation is not ruled as a form of suicide but can be peaceful if you cut out all foods and drinks. Online it says it will take between 2-4 weeks so iâ€™m gonna try to push myself and you can give up whenever you want but for the sake of my mental suffering iâ€™m gonna try.
