My future isnt brightI feel empty, like a shell of what I used to be. I feel like everything I do doesn't matter, like the people I care about don't matter, and I feel like everything is falling apart, like these events happening are things I cannot control, yet I suffer the consequences from that as if I was in control. I've tried to go to therapy, I've tried medication, nothing works. I can't fix it, and I'm afraid at some point it may get the best of me.
