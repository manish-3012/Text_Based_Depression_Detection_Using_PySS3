My time here is almost up (literally)I was tired. So tired. Tired of a meaningless mechanical existence. Everyday the same pointless activities with the same people in the same environment. On the outside I was like everybody else. On the inside I was screaming. But no one heard me. The boredom of life was eating me from the inside. 

6 months ago I took the biggest loan the bank could give me, quit my job and have been living off of that money up until now. The ONLY thing that I felt could have changed my meaningless life was winning a shit load of money so I've been playing the lottery the last 6 months, slowly using up the last of my borrowed money. My initial thought was that if I would not have won the lottery I would end my life.

Today that money is almost gone. I have no idea what to do. I've been researching different suicide methods and they all scare me.

So I estimate I'll completely run out of money in 2 months. Don't know what to do or who to turn to. So here you go interwebz, this was my story. And it ends in 2 months.
