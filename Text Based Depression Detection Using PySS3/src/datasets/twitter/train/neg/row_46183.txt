My girlfriend [17F] attempted suicide last night. I [17M] really don't know what to do anymore.So, my girlfriend of 2 years tried to kill herself last night. She called me a couple hours before to tell me she loved me and sounded somewhat off, but nothing really out of the ordinary. 

I know she's been going through depression and anxiety issues for a long time and that our relationship has helped her a lot during her dark times. We have a good  and healthy relationship overall and i've always been supportive and caring to her. 

This morning i got a message from her telling me that she attempted suicide and failed,  i feel completely broken and (even though i don't wanna accept it) mad, even though i'm in full support mode right now, i don't know what to do. I know she had suicidal thoughts before and i've always been there for her, i've never had to deal with this situation before.

English isn't my first language so i apologise beforehand

I'd appreciate any advice for this situation, thanks in advance
