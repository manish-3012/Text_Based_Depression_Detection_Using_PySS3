Everything is getting too emotionally heavy and I can't take it. I don't know how to cope and suicide is seeming more viable and accessible than ever.I can't really say this anywhere else but yeah that's how I really feel and I hope I can look at this post in the future and be in a better place and if I am reading this from a worse future, then I never want to know how that feels and hope I can end the pain.
