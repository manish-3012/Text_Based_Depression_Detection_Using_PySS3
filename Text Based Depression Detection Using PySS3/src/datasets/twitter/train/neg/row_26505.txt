Itâ€™s not at all comforting that you can relateItâ€™s great that Iâ€™m not alone in this and all, but think about that. Thereâ€™s all these people that want to end it so there must be good reason. I say I want friends, that I want out. How can you have friends when you can barely handle yourself? â€œPm meâ€ they say. â€œWe can chat, I know how you feelâ€ But I canâ€™t. I canâ€™t communicate with other human beings because I know at the end of the day weâ€™re all selfish, and that you will abandon me, think Iâ€™m weird, hate me even. I canâ€™t talk to you because one more disappointment will be one too many. I have to be isolated. Depressed. Suicidal. Because to live a normal, happy life just isnâ€™t in me. I can put on the act of being normal, but Iâ€™m just acting. I donâ€™t even know who I am. So how could you possibly relate?
