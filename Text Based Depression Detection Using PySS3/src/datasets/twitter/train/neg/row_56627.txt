im not sure what to do anymore, and i feel like shit for considering taking the easy way out.this might get long. but i feel tired. tired all the time. tired of living. tired of sitting, doing nothing. tired of these thoughts. tired of my cycle of self-harm, regret, staying clean, relapsing. everyday is the same terrible shit. i cant stand the body im in. even with support, i canâ€™t transition for another 2 years. the horrible feelings of dysphoria, tiredness, and depression feel like too much. I consider the easy way out a lot. Im just too pansy to do it. im not scared of not living. im scared of the pain itll take to take me out. i sit in my room, considering death, but too pansy to go and get results. i get made fun of every week. that i canâ€™t handle anymore. The only things keeping me even here is my boyfriend, who understands my struggle, as he is also ftm, and my best friend. But other than that, whats the point of living through this endless suffering, this terrible cycle any longer. I feel drained, having to joke, laugh, and be happy. Because every night, i sit in my room, unable to stay happy. Just wondering how i could deal with my pain, and how i could escape my life. I feel like a faker. I fake being happy. I fake being fine with being female. i question if i somehow make shit up for attention. i doubt myself everyday. i cant anymore. i just want it to end.
