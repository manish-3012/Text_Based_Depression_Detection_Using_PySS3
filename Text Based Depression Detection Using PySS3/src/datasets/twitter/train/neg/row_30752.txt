Pretty much done (21M)I believe I knocked a girl up. I found a positive pregnancy test in her bathroom that only she and I use. My grandma just passed away so I've been stressed out. and I am not going to raise a kid that I don't want financially nor lovingly. She doesn't believe in abortions. Is there hope for an abortion if I don't want it or should I just end the stress
