I've thought about this nearly every day for 13 years. It is time.I'm so scared. And I am so alone. My family is poor, and I'm broke. I live a couple states away from them, on my own, and I don't know if I'll make rent next month. I have been living on a shoe-string for 4 years.  These are all superfluous issues, but it adds to the stress and feelings of hopelessness.

I don't foresee my life getting any easier. I have social anxiety which has lessened since coming out of my teen years, but it is still prevalent. I am so alone, and I can't fix it. I seem to fuck up everything I attempt. I will be in debt for the rest of my life due to school, which I didn't finish. I started again recently for an associate's degree in a field that won't earn any money anyways. I have no motivation to do any of the things that I might find rewarding. The stress and loneliness are too much. I'm breaking. I'm broken. It's 6pm on a Friday and I'm crying alone in my room and no one cares. 

I'm 24 years old, and I should have friends. I should have someone. This is just too hard. I can't anymore. I want to leave. There is nothing for me. It might hurt some people, and I hate that. I just don't want to feel this anymore.

I don't expect a response. I don't even expect anyone to read this. Nobody notices me. I hardly exist as it is.
