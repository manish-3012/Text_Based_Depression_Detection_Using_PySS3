I have questionsI don't know what's going on anymore.  My life's fine as far as I can tell.  Like, I can't think of any serious problems. But somehow - I don't know how - I ended up here, writing this, hoping for some sort of response without even knowing what to anticipate.  Like, it' 3 o'clock on a school night, and this is still taking precedent.  I swear, I'm basically on autopilot right now.

It's been going on for so long, and I've been pretending not to notice it for even longer.  And right now, at this moment, I'm typing and I'm not even sure what I'm typing, or why, but I am.  I'm so confused that I'm getting frustrated.

So why is it that I feel this way?  Am I too sensitive?  Are my expectations wrong?  Am I trying to hard?  What is this thing, and why do i feel it, and how come nobody seems to recognize it, and why am I one of those people who can't, and how do I stop it?  Can I stop it?  And if I can, should I?  Does anyone know?  

Please, I just need some answers.
