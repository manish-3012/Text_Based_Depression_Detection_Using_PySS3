I'm barely hanging on.Things with my ex have gotten worse with me being away. Today she didn't even talk to me. I tried calling and got no answer. I text her and got one word answers...This is the mother of my child...who I did everything I could for...it was never enough...I can feel it in my soul that she's with another man...I can't even get a response to find out about my daughter...I want to die. I really wish I could do it...to be free from my pain...the hurt of losing her has kept me out of work for two weeks...our phones are going to be cut off tomorrow because I can't pay the bill. My car payment was due last week and I couldn't pay it. My storage space with all my stuff is going to be sold because I couldn't pay it. I can't do anything right in my life...but she's fine. She's good actually...the love of my life...she'll be ok with me gone...it'll be a wake up call and she'll be the mom I know she can be...I just need to find the strength to pull that trigger...
