I want off Mr bones wild rideI have so many disparate, fleeting thoughts that I can't hold onto long enough to analyse. All I get is their associated emotions, mostly fear and hopelessness. But I'm controlling my environment more and the desire to die is subsiding... I have this routine I do where I do a "dry run" by holding my breath, nothing else but my own free will keeping my mouth shut, and doing that until it hurts and a little bit of fear sets in. It reminds me that it's not something I want to experience and even helps broaden my thoughts a little. I don't think this is the last time I'll ever need this sub as somewhere to move my attention, but I think I might go a few weeks or months until next time.  

(title: "I want to get off Mr Bones wild ride" is a meme from a roller coaster tycoon player who trapped park guests on a roller coaster called "Mr Bones wild ride" and they complained saying they wanted off. The deepest pit of depression often feels like a terrifying ride I can't get off... Unless dying counts)
