ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”Iâ€™m losing the family I created because of my actions and my own familyâ€™s actions. I shared information about something in my relationship that I truly understand now that shouldnâ€™t have shared and Then I asked them not to treat her differently and they started treating her like shit and disrespected her then to make matters worse I lied about it about me telling them for 5 months and had my bestfriend/ fiancÃ© looking and feeling stupid since the past when I told her the truth during our fight. I only want her and my son in my life at this point. If it was up to me I would go back in time and do a lot of shit over. And take bac eveyythjgv Iâ€™ve done and maybe never involved my family at all. I miss her and my son all the time. I cry myself to sleep and I cry waking up. I want this pain to stop ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”
