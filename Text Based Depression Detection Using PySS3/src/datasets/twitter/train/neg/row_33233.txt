I don't know how to deal with life anymore.I just want to end all of the emotion. I'm 14 years old, and I am a transgender girl. I haven't started anything, and I don't have any plans to. My parents are sending me to an all-boys school next year. 

Over the past couple of days, I've been extremely depressed. I met a nice transgender girl my age, and at first, she helped me cope, let me relate to her. But, lately, it just won't go away.

I have no courage to come out to my parents, no motivation, either. I live in a very catholic area, too. Everyday I wake up, see myself, my height, hear myself talk, and I just want to cry. But I can't.

My hobbies include playing and making games and music, but sometimes I want to drown the sound out.

Lately, I've wanted to drown the emotion out, too.
