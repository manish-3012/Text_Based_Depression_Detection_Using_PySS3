I didnâ€™t want to ruin Christmas.
I have been suicidal now for about 3 years at least. The depression has been around much longer, (it comes and goes,) but the desire to end my life is a constant. Even on my happiest day, the thought remains. 

 I even know how Iâ€™m going to go when I do it. Like most folks, one of the biggest things that scares me about attempting is the possibility of failing. My idea is to tie a noose around my head standing on my tippy toes, and shooting through my temple. If the shot alone doesnâ€™t end me, certainly the noose will.


I had some free time today so I did a â€œdry run.â€ My parents are away for the holidays and I am alone in the house. I tied the rope around my door handle, over the door, and forced the door closed. I put the noose over my head and synched it down a little, still plenty loose enough to get out of, and just stood there. I know if I had that gun in that very moment, I would have done it. Iâ€™m glad I didnâ€™t. I donâ€™t want to ruin Christmas.
