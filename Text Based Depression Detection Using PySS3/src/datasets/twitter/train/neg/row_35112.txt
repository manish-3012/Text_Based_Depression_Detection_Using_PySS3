I don't want to die but I don't want to live eitherFirst, English isn't my first language so sorry for any mistake. 

I used to think about killing myself and how to do it but I've been going to the therapist and taking medication and you could tell I'm better, the thing is life isn't getting easier. I can't get a job and I'm moving to my old neighbourhood with my dad because my mom can't pay the rent anymore. Also I will no longer have health insurance and even if public hospitals are pretty good where I live, the demand they have makes it harder to go. My friend attempted suicide a few days ago and I tried to talk to him about how you need to push yourself and try to get better but I can't take my own shit anymore, I'm so done with life.

I wish I could stop time. I wish I could go to sleep forever. 

I'm thinkin about overdose so I can go to an hospital and spend my time there, I don't enjoy things I just want everything to be okay.

Again, sorry for the English
