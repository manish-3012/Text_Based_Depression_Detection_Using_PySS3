Feel like I cant copeHi, this is my first time posting on Reddit, long time lurker.
basically I feel like I'm going crazy, and its been gradually getting more unbearable for the past year, before I was depressed but I still had a sense of self. I feel detached from reality, my thoughts frighten and confuse me.

 I'm unable to have any emotions and feel tense all the time. I've started drinking pretty much every night to try and cope and get to sleep.
I'm having a hard time finding any meaning to go on when I'm unable to get any enjoyment from life anymore, all I do is go to work, come home and sit in my room and the longer this has been going on the more helpless I feel.

 I've tried getting help but I just think negatively about it and criticize the people and medication that could help me. 
I've had suicidal thoughts for years but now they're starting to feel different, like I'm really considering it as a way out, not that I want to die, I just cant cope with feeling this way for much longer.
