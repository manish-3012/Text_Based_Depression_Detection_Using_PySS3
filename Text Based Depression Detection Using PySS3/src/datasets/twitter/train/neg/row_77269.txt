I feel like I'm a bad person, despite others saying otherwiseI don't know why I feel this way, and I wish I didn't. I think over the years, I convinced myself I am a bad person and I don't deserve what I have. Every choice I make I feel regret for the other one I didn't choose. 

I want to kill myself, but if that means hurting others more than me, I couldn't bear that, which makes me want to do it more. I want to make others feel better, no matter the cost. I feel empty and most nights, it just consists of me questioning why I need to make others happy and not myself. 

It makes me miserable, knowing that no matter what, I'll feel like I made someone feel anything other than joy. It makes me just want to stop, but even doing that makes me feel that way.
