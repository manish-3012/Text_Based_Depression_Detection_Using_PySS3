I have no family, no friends and no one to talk to.And the few people on the internet that do offer me to talk to them, i don't because i also have severe trust issues and paranoia and can't develop a healthy relationship with anyone. And unless i have that and am very very comfortable with someone i won't tell them how i really feel. So basically im traped with my own mind not being able to tell anyone how sick i really am and i just want to DIE
