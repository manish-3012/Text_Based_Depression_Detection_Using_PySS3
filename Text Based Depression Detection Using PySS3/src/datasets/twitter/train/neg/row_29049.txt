Morbid thoughts on mass violenceRecently mass killings for reasons political and otherwise have dominated the media. Every time another incident occurs, grief for the families of victims, as well as the overall communities, countries, and humanity as a whole is nearly overwhelming. 

But I am always struck by the same thought. 

Why wasn't it me? I would gladly trade places with any of the victims. These innocent humans presumably have families and dreams and lives that they want to keep living. Their deaths move people to protest injustices and address problems that may have otherwise been swept under the rug. Compassion and empathy abound, solidarity soon takes the place of shock.

So why can't it be me? I have a death wish that I can't fulfill myself. Like many people with suicidal ideations and empathy. I love the people that love me so fiercely that I would rather spend eternity with a mind that aches for death than put them through the pain of my suicide. 

Naturally, death in this way seems like  a welcomed out. 

And then I wonder about the victims. Who were they? Was a single one of them like me?  Did any of them have lives so bleak that they fantasized about an easy out at the hands of a psychotic terrorist? Did they long for an end to the broken mess of their lives?

The next step in my thought process is their loved ones. None of which should have to bury their dearest.

Sorry for being so dark. Scotch and depression do that when they get together.
