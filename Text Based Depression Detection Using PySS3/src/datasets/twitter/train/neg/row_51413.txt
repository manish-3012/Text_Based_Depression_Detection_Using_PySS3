Where are they like they saidLearnt today. Even the best of friends i can't rely on. 

This girl and i have been thick for 8 years. We moved apart but still at least minimum once a month we spent hours on the phone catching up. 

She always said... if you need anything I'll be there. 

Well with the shit going on in my life right now i needed her. First time i've called her for help. I'm always there for her. 

Annnnd my response... sorry I'm too busy this whole week. 

Now i get it. People have lives. I shouldn't be putting my burden onto someone else blah blah but man what a kick in the guts. Right now I'm really really deep in a hole. And her support would of been great. 

Think i might be heading to hospital today for help. I'm mentally just bout coping. My husband's family bully me so badly yet he never steps in ever. ...the bullying hurts yeah. But him not sticking up for me hurts more. Then someone tried to beat me up in the shops ...and my husband stepped back. 

I'm breaking and i hed help before i get to low again.
