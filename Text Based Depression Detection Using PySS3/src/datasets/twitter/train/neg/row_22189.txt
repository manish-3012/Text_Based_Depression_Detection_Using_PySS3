Hey guys - I need your help with a case, please.I'm over in r/assistance and have come across this case. I don't feel qualified to handle it and ask you for your help. You guys do great work here and I know this one is out of my league. Would appreciate any help you can give this person._x000D_

By-the-way, feel free to contact me in r/assistance (I'm one of the moderators) if we can be assistance to you. We have a retired social worker that can find programs for people in their area from everything from food, healthcare, housing and other areas. We love what you do here and will help in any way we can._x000D_
