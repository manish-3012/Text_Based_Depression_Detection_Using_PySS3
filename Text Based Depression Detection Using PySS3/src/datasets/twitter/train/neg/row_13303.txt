I want to open up to my parents but I cant and I dont want toIm more scared about telling my parents im suicidal than killing my self. I havent told anyone I know yet since whenever I did I deleted my msgs to them befire they could read since I instantly regret them. Idk if I can survive for longer and I have been suicidal and has sleep problems since I can remember. What should I do should I tell my friends and family or no. Btw I only have a mum dad and sister who I can talk to since all my other relatives live far away in different countries
