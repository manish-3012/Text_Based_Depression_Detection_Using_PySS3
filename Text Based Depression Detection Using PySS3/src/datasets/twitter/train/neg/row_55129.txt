CollegeColleges so fucking stressful Iâ€™m barely passing everything and Iâ€™m getting a bad GPA for the program Iâ€™m in. Iâ€™ve been depressed for so long my mental health is destroyed no matter what I keep cutting and relapsing and just not doing better. My therapist isnâ€™t helping I wish I could just have someone give me a magic potion to stop the pain in my head. I want to give up so bad.
