Post suicide attemptI attempted to kill myself 3 days ago and spent 2 days in hospital for an overdose. I am young and live with my parents and telling them what I had just done was the hardest thing Iâ€™ve ever had to do, and watching their reactions was possibly worse. Iâ€™ve had meeting with mental health crisis teams since then and my parents have been checking in on me almost all the time. They read my journal while I was in hospital and saw that it was planned. Iâ€™ve been depressed for many years and I think itâ€™s genetic as well. Iâ€™m not really sure what Iâ€™m supposed to be feeling right now, I donâ€™t want to be alive but I donâ€™t want to leave my parents because it would destroy them past the point of return. I donâ€™t really know where I should or can go from here, I guess I just want advice from people who have been in my position.
