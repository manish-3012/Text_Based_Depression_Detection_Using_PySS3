Thanks for ruining my attempt, COVID.Hi all, sorry for the mobile formatting.

So in early March my parents decided to go for a month-long vacation. I saved up 1200$, which i planned to spend on drugs and food. I was gonna party all month, then off myself a couple days before my parents came home.

Because of this COVID shit, they decided to surprise me when they came home early.  Now weâ€™re in self-isolation, and I have to hide the fact that Iâ€™m having drug withdrawals.
