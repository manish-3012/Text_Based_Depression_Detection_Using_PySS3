What do they tell you?When you call a suicide hotline, what could they possibly tell you that would be of tangible help?  Iâ€™m trying to imagine how hearing nice or supportive things from a stranger would have any long-lasting effect.   That may sound negative, but I donâ€™t mean it to be.  I can imagine someone â€œtalking you downâ€ at the moment, but what about next week or next month?
