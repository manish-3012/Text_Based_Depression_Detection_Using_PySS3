I made it and Iâ€™m not happy about itI did it I survived the summer and it genuinely pisses me off Iâ€™m starting to feel like wanting to die every night and visioning it is normal and if it is how can you deal with that I need answers I canâ€™t have this year be like the ladyâ€™s Iâ€™m sick of psych ward visits and sick off all of this shit I want to be done why do people have to care why should my death hurt them I dint want to hurt them but I want to be done with this all off it  but people seem to care about me which almost makes it worse most days
