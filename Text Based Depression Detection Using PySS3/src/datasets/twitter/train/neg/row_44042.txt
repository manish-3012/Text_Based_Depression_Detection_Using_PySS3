I don't want to hurt anyone... just me6 months ago I tried to kill myself with an overdose but it didn't went the way I had in my mind. My life just sucks, I think that my life is worth be lived without love. I'm very shy and I can't talk with girls, but last month I was talking to a girl I met and I thought that for once in my life I found love. Last week she just stopped texting me and I went to talk with her in person. She just said that she had a boyfriend and didn't wanted to talk with me anymore. I think that I will never find love. I just want to kill myself and end my suffering but I don't want my mom walk in my room and find me dead on the ground. I really wanted to kill myself and don't hurt nobody.
