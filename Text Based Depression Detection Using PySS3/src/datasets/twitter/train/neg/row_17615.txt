Iâ€™m not going to. I keep telling myself that muchThese past 6-7 months have been hell for me. Iâ€™m too weak. I let her slip away. I should have fought harder and tried to be a better person before I met her so she could still be mine. But Iâ€™m the reason she didnâ€™t like herself, and Iâ€™m the reason she gave up. I donâ€™t blame her, I blame myself. 
Now I find things out that I donâ€™t want to know from little details, and Iâ€™m at fault for that too. 
What was I supposed to do at a certain point? She stopped trying and I knew I wasnâ€™t good enough. Iâ€™ve bettered myself and Iâ€™ve worked hard to show her I am what she needs but she disagrees. 
Iâ€™ve been committed before, but after those friendships/relationships end, I feel a sigh of relief. I feel like I donâ€™t need to worry about those people and I can worry about myself. But her.. I canâ€™t do what I have always done. I love her. I truly and deeply love her with all of my heart and soul. Every fiber in my body yearns for her. Since she left, food hasnâ€™t had taste, I canâ€™t sleep, nobody and I mean nobody at all draws my attention. She talks to me still. Tells me â€œI should try and be single and to talk to other peopleâ€ the first thought in my head when she said that was â€œIâ€™d much rather kill myselfâ€ and I havenâ€™t thought that since 2011. Itâ€™s crushing me because I am having these rushing thoughts of it. I know better than to kill myself, but I have the heaviest impulse to just drive as fast as I can down Mount Lemmon and just cut off onto the cliff. Every time I think that... I feel calm.. and that fucking scares me.
