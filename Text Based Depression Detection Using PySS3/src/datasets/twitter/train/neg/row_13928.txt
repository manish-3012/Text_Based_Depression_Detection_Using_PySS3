DepressionHi all Iâ€™m 22 year old,my life is utter failure.Right now I want to commit suicide and i was searching YouTube to find ways and I finally decided to take poison..I have very high anxiety,i cannot speak to a person without having trouble my toungue gets mixed idk what the problem is and everyone makes fun of me even my family members,never had a girlfriend because i dont know how to speak to a person..The only company I had through my life is Video games and it was my happiness.For the last 2 years Iâ€™m having severe depression because I failed at exams never have I failed before in my life,i was a good student and now i have been taking drugs for almost a year it somewhat eases my pain,my family has financial troubles and my mother sold our assets to pay for my fees and i have failed the exams,my father left me 7 years ago and somewhat i feel like my mother hates me and the only person i love is my little brother and he is younger than me 12 years and before i go to sleep every night i look at his face and thinks how much i will miss him my mom is angry at me and i dont know the reason,I dont want to live and here in my country i cannot go to work unless i get a good education so im still stuck with my mom and she pays for all my expenses and i feel like im a burden to her,i dont want to be a burden for anyone although i will miss my brother and my mother is very angry at me for the last few days.Sorry for the bad English
