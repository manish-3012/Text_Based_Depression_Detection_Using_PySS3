feel like a loserjust graduated high school recently which is crazy because all those years in high school iâ€™ve been depressed and did not think iâ€™d make it. i wasnâ€™t active in school or participated in anything so now thatâ€™s itâ€™s finished, i have nothing.

i have no money to continue schooling. i have no future plans. i have no friends. the job i have now sucks and pays nothing. 

i dont want to end it because i know itâ€™s selfish of me and i dont want to leave my dog, my family, or my boyfriend behind. i want to be happy for them and for myself but im a loser
