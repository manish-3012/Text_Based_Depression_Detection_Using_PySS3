I hate the way i lookIâ€™m tired of not ever being pretty or being that ugly girl in the group of friends that no guys ever notice until they accidentally trip over me. Why must I have the worst genetics ?!

Itâ€™s not fair, many girls get to be pretty and I canâ€™t cauwe of my features. I hate my small eyes and my big nose and my fat lips. I hate my moon face. I hate it ALL!!
