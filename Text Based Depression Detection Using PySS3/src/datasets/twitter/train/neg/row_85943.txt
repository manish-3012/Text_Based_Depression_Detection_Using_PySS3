I really want to kill myself.&amp;#x200B;

Why tf is it selfish to kill myself??, don't tell me it's selfish, i never even decided to be born, why tf do I have to care if my parent gonna be sad. I'm 17, live with my single mother, I'm ugly, very dumb (socially and at everything else, like I can't even make a basic conversation with another human being), anxiety, no social skills, no friends (never had), has been bullied since 1st grade, have no passion in life, why tf should I stay alive there is no reason, it's just pain for no reason.
