I'm just tired of everything.Lost my temp job the other day. I have no real family. Abandoned by my parents. I'm just at the point where i don't care anymore. I went to college thinking that getting a degree of some kind would matter but it doesn't. I have realized through my trials and tribulations that coming from a broken family or no family at all is practically a death sentence in this society. I cannot go back to fast food again because i feel completely out of place surrounded by idiots. I don't want a job doing shitty customer service anymore. I want a job that actually pays something and isn't complete garbage and dead end. I get depressed because I am 25 with no car, family that doesn't care, and now unemployed once again with no future. It is all becoming pretty hopeless. I do not make friends anymore because i see them as a waste of time because they are mostly temporary at this age. I don't look for relationships because I don't make any money to survive and take care of myself so why even try. I don't know probably gonna hang myself or use the shotgun to blow my brains out.
