Misconceptions about suicideThis has probably been discussed before, but I feel as if I and others here don't necessarily want to die some violent death, but to just be free of an existence of pain. With our current technology sometimes suicide is the only way to make it stop. I have always aired on the side of "you are gonna die anyways, might as well make the best of life". But sometimes the emptiness is too much to bare. Especially when you've had it all and lost it. I just wish technology could hurry up and I could put myself in the cloud like that episode of black mirror, San Junipero.
