Feeling like its the right thing to do.I mean... Its my life, its my suffering... Its my situation. Nobody's gonna understand the situation better than myself. I see no exit and I don't think any of the stuff Im going trough is gonna change any time. 

I feel like just giving excuses like... "my mom would be sad" "things gonna change" "therapy will help me" is not working anymore. 

And the amount of suffering I will avoid by ending it is far beyond the amount of happiness I'm able to obtain if things change.

I'm very sorry if this makes someone feel worse, I swear its not my purpose to make any harm... I just want to know... Why should I not do so?
