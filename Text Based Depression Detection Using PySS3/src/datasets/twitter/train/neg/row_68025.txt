Feeling really, really, soul-crushingly down.Things are feeling extremely tough, and I'm stuck in a bad situation. I know logically I'm somewhat capable, but I'm helpless to change things around me, and it has eaten away at all of my self confidence and is now chewing me up. I'd rather not wake up tomorrow, or ever. It hurts in that weird way to even think about getting out of bed, and my emotions are a black pit, making it even harder than it was to find any lifeguards (or spelunkers) around to help me out because I can't be even moderately friendly. I am running out of options.
