The Fact That I May Bring Value is a Moot PointI had to consciously stop myself today.

What I mean is, it was an impulse, but now it has turned into a fully formed thought. I've had suicidal ideation since I was 13, 23 now. I was just trying to go over things, as my depression has gotten less severe over the past week. I mean, I always want to die, but I never feel like doing much about it.

But now, I don't know. I made lists. I said, why do I want to live? I don't want to hurt my husband. I don't want to hurt my family I don't want to hurt my friends.

Okay, that is all based around other people. So let us look at the reasons I am a valuable person. I am empathetic, compassionate, intelligent, interested, good at integrating ideas, creative (been published a few time, have over 30K views on my Youtubes)...I am cute, fit, I find myself to be pretty funny though in a black humor morbid or corny kinda way. Witty-ish.

I have tried self-therapy. I have tried CBT, IFS, psychodynamic. I have been on 3 or 4 medications. I have tried recreational drugs and gotten off them. I have lived with my family and I have lived in other states and another country. I have been defensive and I have been vulnerable. I have been helpless and incredibly independent. I have tried smiling and hiding everyday and I have tried complete acceptance and everywhere in between. 

Now, I know it is not customary to say good things about yourself when you feel suicidal, but that is kind of my point about why I do. Not to say I don't ever think negatively about myself, because obviously that happens, but it really isn't the focus. But I am so incredibly over the fact that I have value to give. I take it as a fact of life, and one that just isn't worth living for. I cannot imagine one possible thing that can make the amount of pain I feel worth it, and I am ready to do something about it. 

My husband is amazing, so supportive, so helpful, doesn't get mad at me for being depressed, I cannot imagine a better person. If I cannot be happy with him or with myself, I just don't see it as possible.

*I have never, ever thought of suicide as selfish, but I wish that people would stop caring about me, because even though it is my choice, I wish I wouldn't have to hurt them* 

*edit: what I mean to say is, people have made it very clear to me that I bring value to their lives so I believe it; I just cannot come up for the life of me a reason how I bring any value to mine*

**tl;dr I've done a shit ton of evaluation, don't think I'm a bad person, I probably have quite a bit to offer, think other people really do want me around not for shitty co-dependent reasons but because I bring value to them, and none of these things make living any less painful**
