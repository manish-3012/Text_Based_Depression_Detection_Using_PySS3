My friend lost his fiance, now he is very suicidal, what can I do?I'm sorry for posting this as I know posts like this come up almost daily, but I'm running out of options.  my best friend's fiance left him after 7 years and is not coming back. He [32m] is definitely madly in love with her and didn't really see this coming.  to make matters worse, he also has genital herpes and feels like he'll never find another girl.

it's been over 2 months and he is continuing to go downhill.  he hasnt slept or eat in weeks.  he has lost 30pds.  he has been to the doctor and as far as I know was given xanax and some sleeping pills.  nothing is making a dent.

just in the past few days he is talking about killing himself.  I have no idea what to do now.
