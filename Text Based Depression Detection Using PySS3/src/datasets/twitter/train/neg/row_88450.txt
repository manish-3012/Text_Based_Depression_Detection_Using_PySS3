So overwhelmed.
At 32, Iâ€™m lonely, depressed, have no friends and live with my controlling, abusive covert narcissist mother. A sudden and long-term physical health issue (that I still donâ€™t know the cause of) has robbed me of much of my independence and has allowed my mother to regain some control over me that I fought so hard for, as Iâ€™m forced to depend on her to get around and do things. She often prevents me from doing things I enjoy and coerces me into doing things I donâ€™t want to do. Looming medical bills and fighting losing battles with my insurance company while running out of money keep me up at night. COVID has made things even worse. Before I got sick, I was becoming more comfortable with my gender identity and starting to feel good about myself, starting to look forward to the days again. I was finally getting my badly damaged teeth taken care of so I could have the confidence to smile again. Then suddenly, my world was turned upside down, my psychiatrist and therapist all but abandoned me, every doctor left me alone and afraid, my teeth have worsened and Iâ€™m embarrassed to smile again. I dont recognize myself or my life anymore. I canâ€™t do the things I could do 14 mo the ago. I canâ€™t do the things a normal, previously healthy 32 year old should be able to do. No doctor knows whatâ€™s wrong. Ive been to so many and tried so much medication. I donâ€™t know where to turn for help. I feel so alone. I hate my life. I hate my mom for making my misery even worse. I want to be hugged. I want to be held. I want to be loved and wanted. I want my old life back. I want to harm myself. I want to die. I want this pain and misery to just end.
