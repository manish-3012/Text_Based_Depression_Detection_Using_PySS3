College FinalsMy stupid ass was complacent this semester and as a result I've got a D in a class I need a C in to take the next courses.

I'm fucking seized up right now and I want to walk to the nearest parking deck and fucking jump because I can hear my fucking parents screaming at me right now about wasting their money and the government's money because I'm on an AFROTC scholarship and I might not even be able to go to Field Training this summer and my whole fucking life is fucked up at this point
