Alcohol is numbing my guilt of committing suicideI have a dependence on alcohol however I haven't been drinking it every day or every weeks, but once in a couple of months. That may not seem like much but we I do drink it I feel dependent on it, recently something horrible happened and I feel so happy to be somewhat drunk now. 

I know I'm not a harm to myself but the thought of dying while in this mental state makes it seem so much easier to do....I feel free somewhat and happy....I plan to be drinking for awhile, possibly staying up for 3 days at the max to avoid having PTSD dreams...These are usually triggered by stress and I fear going to sleep so that's why I'm staying up but I don't want to feel crappy while staying up.....

For once in my life, I feel no guilt about killing myself. No guilt about what my family may think because I feel like they would be okay, etc. I think I'm going to drink daily, I know this isn't healthy but I feel like this is the only way to feel alright and just okay.
