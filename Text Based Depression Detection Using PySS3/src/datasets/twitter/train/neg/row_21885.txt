Happy birthday to meA month ago today I thought I would be long dead before today. Unfortunately I'm still here for my 21st birthday. But nothing has gotten better for me since. I've been completely alone this month and haven't really seen anyone. Life is awful but I'm still forced to be here.

Anyway, guess I'll legally buy a bottle of wine tonight, I think my friends have forgotten so I'll be celebrating alone
