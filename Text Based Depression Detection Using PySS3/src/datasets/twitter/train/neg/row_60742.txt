Not sure what to doI used to go to an Ivy league school. Last winter, I was having a really tough time and wanted to kill myself. I decided to ask for help. I didn't have much faith in the psychiatric process, but I was hoping that someone would be able to give me a reason to get up each day: a reason to do something rather than be nothing.

Much to my surprise, after being put in a mental hospital, I was thrown out of school. I was sent home with a 2 week prescription for an antidepressant and told that I could reapply in the future. I reapplied for this current term and was rejected. Apparently they think I need more time to recover (even though they didn't bother to talk to my doctor from home, or give me any warning that I might not be reaccepted until a week before the beginning of the fall semester).

Sorry for the tedious background story, but I wanted to provide some context for my question. Why should I keep trying; why should I try so hard to eke out an existence when pretty much every day is fucking miserable?

I've spent a long time in therapy; I've probably taken half a dozen different anti-depressants. The only times in my life where I've felt even the slightest hope for the future were the result of massive delusions as to what is possible/plausible. I've only ever felt slightly happy under the influence of terribly unrealistic dreams.
Now I have no idea what to do. Should I keep trying to go through the admissions process for my former college? Should I find a new university that might accept me as a transfer? What should I do for the next couple of months? I probably should go out and find a job, but why? Why should I go to all that effort? What exactly is the end goal I'm working towards?

Sorry for this tedious, self-indulgent rant, but I seriously have no idea what to do.
