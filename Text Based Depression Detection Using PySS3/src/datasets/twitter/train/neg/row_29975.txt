I think im just ready to end itI still feel lost. Nothing ever changes. People im friends with or no have their lives moving on while im stuck in the middle of college and absolutely hate my life. I feel like I shouldâ€™ve just killed myself a few years ago. Wouldâ€™ve made things easier for everyone. Every day I contemplate suicide and i think its officially my best option.

Im a single and very alone guy in college with no feeling of hope or happiness. People are getting married, having kids and starting their lives after college. I canâ€™t even find a girl thats even remotely interested in me at this point. And if i do then they get scared away by my depression.

Im behind in school and feel like its never going to end for me. Im not a very good student and still have about 2 years left of school. Feels pointless to go on and i know whatever job i get wonâ€™t mean much to anyone. Ill just be a useless underpaid guy with no real future still.

It just seems like its all come to this and thereâ€™s no way out. Its painful for me to say because ive been trying for years now, the last 2 years especially, to find reasons to live and be happy but the number of reasons continues to dwindle and my desire for life continues to fade. Idk what im going to do. Idk when im going to do it. Idk how im going to do it. Just feel like it needs to be done
