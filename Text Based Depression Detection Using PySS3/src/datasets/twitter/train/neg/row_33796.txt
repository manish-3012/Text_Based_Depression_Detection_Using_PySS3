I'm not suicidal, but I'm feeling horrible.I recently met the girl I'd like to spend the rest of my life with. She's plain out amazing, and she feels the same about me. My parents, who are hardly supportive of anything I do, don't like her. They've gone through the measures of not letting me see her (I'm a senior in High School), on the days that I actually have spare time. I have basketball everyday, even on most Saturday's, so I have no spare time except Sundays, which I'm usually 'grounded' by my parents for some indirect reason that's plain out ridiculous: eg. getting a 'B' on a reading quiz for AP Lit. I feel like my lack of seeing her (it's been almost two weeks now) is going to have her lose interest in me; ultimately losing her altogether. She's not a hardcore girl, my parents are just extremely controlling and like to take away what's most important to me.

Speaking of her, I'm also in another issue: she drinks. When she drinks, she drinks a lot. This has recently (before I met her) led to sex and a blowjob with two disgusting guys, respectively. She's promised me she'll not try to get drunk, and she's been keeping it so far (by not going full out shitfaced), but I really want full assurance. I know I can't handle any drunk sex 'accidents' while I'm with her, and I've brought it up to her plenty of times. I've had plenty of alcoholics in my family, and I don't want her to end up the same.

I know I'm a pussy compared to other people here, and especially the kids in Haiti; but I just needed to get it off my chest. I got so angry I punched a hole completely through the drywall in my house; cutting my hand up and injuring my wrist pretty bad. My hand got stuck somewhat inside the wall, if that tells you anything how angry I was at another lost weekend with the girl I'm beginning to love.
