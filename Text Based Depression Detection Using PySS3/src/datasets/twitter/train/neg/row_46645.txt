Is suicidal ideation often a chronic lifelong thing... As in repeating?Three years ago I had suicide thoughts every hour of every day for four months. Those were the worst four months of my life. I half attempted... I guess. Like I drove with my eyes closed, never wore a seat belt hoping for a crash. I had a change in circumstances, and they went away.

I think that they're cropping up again. Wikipedia said that people with a history of suicidal thoughts are more at risk than otherwise, and I found that kind of depressing (no pun intended).

The point is that suddenly thinking that this will be something that I'll have to deal with on and off for the rest of my life really hurts. It kills hope. Like there isn't an end to it, only breaks. Has anyone else had on and off issues with this spanning long periods of time. What helped you? What should I do? I absolutely cannot afford a therapist. I need to help myself somehow. Thank you.
