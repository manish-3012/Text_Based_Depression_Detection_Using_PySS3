All of my hopes have been crushed. I donâ€™t want to die but I donâ€™t think my life can get better.Every time I think it might, it only lasts for a moment, and then gets worse. My mom and my two cats are the only ones who have truly been there for me, and theyâ€™re the only ones who make me feel guilty enough to stay alive. I drafted a note. I feel nothing right now.
