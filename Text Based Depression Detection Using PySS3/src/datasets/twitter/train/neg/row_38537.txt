I need help for my friend...So my friend always has really weird mood shifts and tends to skip school to "vent" and he's planning on killing himself in 9 weeks.
He watches a lot of suicide/gore/killing videos and always talks about he wants to be like them. 
He always says that no one cares about him, and how everyone would be happy when he dies as well as talking about how there's no chance for him to make it up. 
Should I call 911? How can I help him? Should I just try to wait it out?
Please help, and thank you for your time...
