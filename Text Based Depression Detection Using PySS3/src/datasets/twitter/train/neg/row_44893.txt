Drifting....Part 1; Sorry Reddit didn't let me post 2 hour essay.

Hi. You don't know me. It's 2:51. In the morning and I have a ducking basketball game that I need to sleep for.... but I just finished up 13 reasons on Netflix and... well yeah.

Made a new Reddit account cause secrets... Read with caution, throw everything you know out the door and maybe, just maybe you can see through me.

Warning: A lot of stuff up ahead I did warn you. I don't know if I broke any Reddit rules or law or anything but I'd appreciate if anyone who saw this saved a copy of it before deleting it if it does get deleted

No one in my life will know the whole truth except the people who will read this. I'm going to ... fuck my hearts beating fast... say the most darkest parts of my mind. The things I have done... tried to do... things I wish I can fix.... I don't know what to think anymore... fuck I might even go to prison... maybe I don't know...

Start at the beginning? First world problems, you know classic 'school sucks'. I'm a troubled kid with a troubled life. I was diagnosed with ADHD early on and I did a lot of shit without thinking.

My parents cheated on eahother... they always try to angry up on the other. Trying to make the other parent look bad and while I love my family, they just try to look each other feel bad.

My older brother is gay... not that it matters but when I was 3? 4? 5? Too you and too oblivious of what he was doing was wrong. Hell I thought it was normal. Got me to look at each other naked? Too long ago to remember the pieces. I remember we played truth or dare with his other friend that might be gay Idk. And the main dare was flashing each other, weirdly that was the nicest he was when was being nice. Other than that I'm just a little loser who liked PokÃ©mon at the age of 8 or whatever. I've grown away from him, and I haven't cared about him since....
