Can I talk to someone?I know this is far fetched, but i have no friends and no one to talk to. I'm 19F, I don't quite expect anyone to stick around or genuinely be my friend (though that would be great).. but it would be very nice to have someone who would listen to me rant for the first time and talk for a bit, as I'm on the verge of finally just ending it like I've wanted. 

Thank you, and sorry if this post is inconvenient.
