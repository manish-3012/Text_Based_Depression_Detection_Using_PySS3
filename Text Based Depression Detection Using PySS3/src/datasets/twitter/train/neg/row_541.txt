I just need someone to tell me I'm okay and I just want to believe itNo long post like last time. I'm just so angry and sad and I don't know how to help myself in healthy ways anymore. I self-harm. I've done it less lately, and I feel worse when I don't do it. It's the only thing that helps. On my other alt account all I do is fly off the handle at people I think are assholes, but maybe it's just me. I feel like I'm never going to be better. I'm just me, and this is how I am. It feels doomed. I don't know how to interact with people anymore. Nothing is enough. I thought seeing my friends would help, it didn't. It just reminded me how lonely I am. All of my problems are unsolvable because they're not even real problems. They're just me. I need to be loved, just a fucking hug, anything, but I can't ask for help from anyone I actually know. I go back to work in 2 days and I know I can't do my fucking job anymore. I'm snapping. I've been snapping for months and it's finally happening. Help.

Sorry.

(How am I "doing this too much" when I haven't posted in days? Another useless thing to make me fucking furious for no reason because I'm an immature oversensitive piece of trash.)

**EDIT IN RESPONSE TO CERTAIN ASSHOLE COMMENTERS**: I DO HAVE A FUCKING SHRINK, I JUST HAVEN'T SEEN HIM OVER THE SUMMER. BUT THANKS DICK, I REALLY LOVED BEING REMINDED THAT I'M A BASKET CASE.

Also if you followed me here from /r/GameGrumps just wonder if Danny would tell someone to kill themselves. Probably not, right? So maybe you shouldn't either, you fucking monsters?
