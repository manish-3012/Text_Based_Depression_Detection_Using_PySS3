Passively suicidalI donâ€™t have plans to end my own life, I donâ€™t have the courage to do it Iâ€™m a huge wuss with pain/discomfort, but I feel like if I found out I had cancer or a fatal disease I wouldnâ€™t care, or if I got into an accident as it came I would feel relief of some kind. I want to die but I donâ€™t want to be the one to end it, does anyone relate?
