High or in pain? Reddit, I got serious physical problems. I spend every fucking day in constant pain or high or sometimes both. 
Reddit what should I do? My disease is incurable and will only get worse. Doctors haven't done shit for me, they give me drugs sometimes but thats about it. 

I'm sick of it. I haven't thought clearly since i was 14. I'm either distracted by pain or too groggy to keep a train of thought going. On top of all this I've been unemployed for over a year. I can't keep doing this anymore.
 

But at the same time I can't kill myself. I've given up on my life. I'm just wasting time hoping that I'll die soon. I'm worried if things don't get better I'll end them.
