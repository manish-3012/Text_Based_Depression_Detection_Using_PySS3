Suicidal me is backI felt reaaaaally good for short period of time, I thought it was finally working out for me, I felt happy even. But then the things went back to shit. I don't know how I deserved to be hurt over and over and over again by people who said they care for me, but seems like they never actually did when it comes to me almost taking my own life. In the past two weeks every day some new shit happened and was strong, but there is just a limited amount of problems one can take. And I reached my top. I was trying to be strong for my family, helping around, because they were struggling, but once again I was taking their problems on me and no one asked me how I was feeling or how I was doing. Yesterday I completely broke down, I selfharmed myself pretty badly and was thinking about suicide, but then decide to go to my dads bed, crying, shaking and almost unable to breathe. I woke up, I am home alone, I feel numb, everything hurts and I don't know what to do. How do you do life?
