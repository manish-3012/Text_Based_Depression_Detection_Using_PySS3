It sounds like such a good ideaI've been in the absolute dumps for a while now. The other day, the idea that I could just *end it all* popped into my head, and I smiled. The first time I've been remotely happy for as long as I can remember was triggered by the thought that I can just kill myself and be done with it all.

I'm sick of the severe anxiety dictating my life and stopping me from living how I want. I'm sick of the sudden crippling inability to speak and connect with people. I'm sick of this unemployment despite having a good job history, and not having anything to wake up for. I'm sick of feeling absolutely nothing, not even from my past passions and hobbies.

I've always been a miserable, incapable idiot. I hate this world, and I hate myself. I'm going to do it right after I post this, no doubt in my mind. See you guys, hope you all manage to find happiness.
