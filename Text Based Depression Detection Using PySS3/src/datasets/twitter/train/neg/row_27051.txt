Iâ€™m s t r u g g l i n gI have so many awesome friends and family who I love dearly, but I just feel so alone. I know they would be supportive if I told them I think I have depression and possibly anxiety, but I just donâ€™t want to burden them. They obviously care about me so much, but they shouldnâ€™t. Iâ€™m an absolute garbage human being who never says the right thing at the right time and hurts people because of it. I do want them to find out so I can finally get help, but I also donâ€™t because, again, they shouldnâ€™t be burdened with me of all people. 
If someone starts to figure it out, I push them away. 
I never feel like I can be myself even around my closest friends. 
I put on a fake smile that makes me despise my self more and more with every excruciatingly long day that passes. 
Iâ€™m just done. 
I have absolutely no will to keep living. 
â€œSo why donâ€™t you just kill yourselfâ€ I hear you ask. 
Well the answer is simple. I know my friends and family would be devastated and they donâ€™t deserve to feel as shitty as I do. 
Other than that I literally cannot think of a single fucking reason to live. 
I hope everyday that they will stop being such awesome people or realize how much of a shit person I am so I can finally fucking off myself. 
I used to have such hopeful dreams for my future, but now I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll even be able to graduate high school. 
Iâ€™m so fucking unmotivated and get told off for having Câ€™s. 
But I just donâ€™t care anymore. I donâ€™t have the energy left to care, to take care of myself, I just hope I die in some accident where no one is to blame.
