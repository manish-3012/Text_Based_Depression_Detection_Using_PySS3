i wanna die, but i dont wanna hurt those around meim 16, male, and i want to fucking die

i have (mainly) good friends

i have a family that loves me

but they know nothing.

i have felt suicidal/depressed before when i was about 14 years old but the feelings have come back in the past 6 months with a punch. i used to be the kind of kid to go on bike rides with my brothers, wash the car with my dad, go out with friends, but then now all i wanna do is lock myself in my room watch tv/listen to music/contemplate how shitty i feel. i feel like i fuck everything up, every girl i date, once we date for about 3 weeks they leave me and fuck someone else. every time i feel like my parents start to feel proud of me, i fuck something up and they lose respect for me. every time i do make friends, i have a small circle of about 10-15 friends, they always end up leaving or fucking me over. as mentioned before, i do well with the ladies, dont get me wrong, but i feel like an ugly sack of shit. 

i feel worthless...
and i just want help...
