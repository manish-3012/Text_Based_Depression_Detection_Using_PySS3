I wanna dieIm always sad
Nothing in my life works out
Im alone
Im worthless 
Im fucking coward I donâ€™t have the fucking guts to kill my self 
I fell like Iâ€™m so alone that no one understands me I have no one to talk to Iâ€™m just so fucking alone
I just wanna die already
Why was I fucking born just to hurt
My life is fucking endless pain endless regret
I donâ€™t have real friends my parents are treating me like if I was their property I canâ€™t live like this no longer I ask myself why someone canâ€™t just kill me
I live a shit life 
No one loves me 
Im alone 
I donâ€™t have any joy in living 
Im just trash 
I want to kill myself but
