AdiÃ³sToday I will jump under a train. I tried to suffocate myself three times for last two weeks, but in my case it never worked. My previous attempt was 20 months ago, but I decided to change something. And I failed. Failed. Another failure. I have no more of any inner resources. My life was a stupid joke, a useless piece of junk. I've  never asked to be born, but why should I chew all this pain for every moment of my ****** existence? Waiter, this life is rotten, take it back.

I just wanna sleep. Somebody, please, turn off the light.
