Its all in my head but it's still realI consider myself an smart man.
I know chemical reactions, electricity,brain areas influence mood, thoughts,etc. My depression could very well be chemical:I still feel it as real.
I won't say the method since it's against the rules but I decided a method to die.im not a minority or gay;suicide is not common in. My group,yet I still want to.
As I said I believe it's all due to bad brain reactions...my survival instinct told me to post here and try to survive .
