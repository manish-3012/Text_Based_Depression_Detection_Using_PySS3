People change so fastOkay so Iâ€™ve been raped (not in a violent way tho) when I was only 14 by my oldest male cousin.
I had severe anorexia at 15 because of sadness in general 
I had an natural incomplete abortion at 15 with my current boyfriend . (Iâ€™ve never had sex without condom since the rape Iâ€™ve been traumatized and I always cry after having sex, I guess itâ€™s pretty annoying for my partner but thatâ€™s just part of being me)
My mom found out ofc because Iâ€™m a minor and she had to pay and authorize the surgery to remove the other half of the fetus . (Sheâ€™s a single strong mother that I love like crazy and I just disappointed her with my entire existence) 
I received a lot of hate from my brother and the comments my mom and brother make sometimes are heartbreaking. I just go to my room and lock myself to cry. 
Iâ€™m 16 And Iâ€™m really self conscious and sad. I donâ€™t feel as young as I should and I canâ€™t laugh like my friends do and I just feel different around everybody and I feel that everybody dislikes me and judges me. I lost my 2 main best friends even before the anorexia stage because they just changed and left me alone battling with all of this.
My dad died when I was 7 and every time I mess up I think of him and how disappointed he is of me.
So now being just 16 I want to end everything but Iâ€™m a coward and I love my mom. But Iâ€™m a complete mess, people are better of without me. Every time I think of my future I feel it even further away and it feels like fantasy to me, because thereâ€™s not such thing as being happy. 
I wanna get better I swear. Iâ€™m a really happy girl inside. You just gotta put a little effort on me .
