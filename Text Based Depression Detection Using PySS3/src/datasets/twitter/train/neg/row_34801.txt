Feeling isolated in physical painI don't need talking off the ledge right this moment. But I was finally getting better with my suicidality, and now I got yet another uncontrolled chronic pain disorder: migraines. I feel like I'm losing control again, and that's why I'm writing now, before it gets to a point where I wouldn't reach out at all. 

I often wake up in the middle of the night or early in the morning in so much pain, and that's when I think of suicide. I feel so isolated. Sometimes I wake up my girlfriend (and she gets sleepy grumpy, though she does her best to hide it), just to hold my hand... But there's nothing she can do to help. She can just get upset from watching me suffer, and then I feel bad for putting her through it, so I stopped. I call other friends sometimes, one in particular stays up way too late, but talking to people doesn't fix me. Being acknowledged doesn't make it hurt any less, so I don't know what I'm trying to achieve.

I just need a battle plan for what to do in those situations when I'm alone, in pain, and starting to plan suicide. It hurts to move very much, I struggle to focus my eyes, my mental clarity will have gone down the drain, and I'd rather die than go to the psych ward. The distractions I usually rely on don't work in those cases.

Any input at all is appreciated!
