Let's find that exit they call paradise WOOOOO!My life is a joke and it's not funny anymore. I can't force myself into any social situations or even perform the most basic tasks. I feel miserable all the time and I hate myself. I don't see any reason why I should stay on this crazy train.

"No don't kys, you have so much to live for"

Yep. Plenty of pain and suffering to look forward to. I can't wait to do alone in 40 years when it finally, truly, all becomes too much.

"Things will get better"

No things will get worse and I am the problem. As I get older I'll have to accept more responsibilities and I can barely cope as it is. I am my only real problem and the best solution to a problem is usually the easiest one.

"Loads of people care about you"

Yep, poor deluded people who think there's something worth saving. Also people who don't feel the misery I feel on a daily basis. They just want me around because it makes them feel better to see someone more pathetic than them.

"I love you and I don't even know you"

No you don't, don't toy with me you fucker. I appreciate the sentiment though. I know you were only trying to help I'm sorry I swore at you.

Don't worry about it though guys, I honestly don't have the balls to kill myself properly. I'll probably just go out like a rank amateur, slowly wearing myself down with booze and other addicting habits until something gives out and I choke on vomit or something.

I know words won't save me. I don't think there's any way out at all. Ever. Haha. No one is born on purpose, no one belongs anywhere, everyone is gonna die. Sorry for wasting your time. That is assuming you read all that bollocks up there. Why would you do that? Go somewhere else and surround yourself with positive people. You don't need people like me bringing you down.

TL;DR I'm a retarded dumb idiot and I suck, but I don't have the balls to jump under a train.
