I am alive right now because of a carI have schizoaffective disorder and major depression. I have been suffering from this depression all the way back to the third grade. I hate living and just wish I was dead. The only thing keeping me alive is a car (Toyota gt86). Iâ€™m thinking of just using the money I was going to spend on school to buy one. Iâ€™m afraid if I do Iâ€™ll end up dying.

Iâ€™ve lived a pretty shitty life. Iâ€™m going to die a virgin. Iâ€™m ok with that. I hate living so much and honestly sex canâ€™t be good enough to make me live. 

Iâ€™ve tried to get help. Iâ€™m on anti depressants and a lot of medication for my psychosis. Nothing works for my depression though.
