How do I help my friendMy friend is currently a senior in high school. She has been thinking of committing suicide for a while now and her thoughts of suicide were so bad yesterday that she finally opened up to the school counselors and got pulled out of school and sent to the hospital. This was actually a good thing because she was finally going to get the help she needed, until her parents stepped into the picture. 

She is supposed to be scheduled for daily check-ups at the hospital as her parents are legally obligated to. Today, however, her parents have refused to to schedule these appointments and express their discomfort with sending her back to the hospital saying that it will get worst if she goes. They want her to continue to go to school and continue life as if everything is normal even after they found out that she wants to kill herself. 

My friend had already been diagnosed with anxiety disorder in the past, but her parents refuse to help her get any type of treatment for it because they don't really believe in mental disorders. They simply don't understand the gravity of the situation and think that this will just blow over. I try to comfort her in whatever way I can, but there's only so much I can do since I can't take her to the hospital myself. Is there any way I can help her convince her parents to take her or is there some type of number or number or service I can call in order to help her get the help she needs. She wants help more than anything, but her parents are stopping her from getting what she needs.
