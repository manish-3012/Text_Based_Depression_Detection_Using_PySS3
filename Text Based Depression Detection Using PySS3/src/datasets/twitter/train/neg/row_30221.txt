I know this is the stupidest thing to complain about, but I don't want to get old.I don't want to get old. I don't want to get wrinkled and lose my hair. I don't want to stop going out on the weekend and meeting new people. I don't want to stop meeting pretty girls. I don't want to stop having good sex. I don't want all my opportunities to close off. I don't want to not be able to switch careers or do another university course. I don't want to be ugly and invisible and boring. I don't want to be stuck.

I know, this happens to literally everyone. I'm not special. I'm lucky to be alive at all. I should be happy. But I can't help it, it makes me feel sick.

My 20s are coming to an end and sometimes I don't see the point in going any further. The whole having kids and being miserable working to pay off a house forever then dying thing seems awful. I can't imagine anything worse.

What's the point? What's good in the future if you're not into having kids?

In like 50 years they'll have anti aging. Our grandkids won't even have to go through this. We were so close. So, so close. missed it by that much. This sucks.
