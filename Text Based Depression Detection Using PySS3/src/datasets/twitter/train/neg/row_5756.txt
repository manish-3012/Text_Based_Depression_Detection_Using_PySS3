UPDATE: yesterday I posted about killing myself with pillsAnd I did took a few of Clonazepam and Lorazepam which made me sleep all night and almost all day but I'm obviously still here.

About the guy who broke my heart: he said he loved me, he asked me to marry him a few months ago but now I know he doesn't care if I die, literally AND plot twist... He is married and has a few months old baby girl.

Yeah... I feel used, he lied to me, I'm in so much pain because of him. I don't know how to heal...
