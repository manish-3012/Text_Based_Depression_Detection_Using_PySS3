ClockworkThe season changes and I slowly die inside until something happens and I'm back to my normal self with, of course, the still pressing issues but they no longer matter once again. What a relief it is to get through such a hard time! 

But you know, I'd like for it to stop entirely. The hurt I feel. If I could just follow through once it would all be okay. I make everything else happen why can't I make this? My method has finally came to me and it feels approachable. More approachable than anything else I have dreamt of. 

Yet, with a date set, I don't feel complete. Something is still missing. Could it be that it is not my time? Or is it that I'm going about it all wrong? 


Oh. I see.



 Setting a date is where I have it all wrong.


 Right now then?



It's a good thing I'm lazy right now. It's my day off in 8 days. Ain't doin shit as far as I'm concerned.


I'll get it figured out. One way or another.
