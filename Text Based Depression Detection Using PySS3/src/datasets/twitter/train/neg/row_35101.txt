I need help, now.Guys I don't know what to do anymore and I don't know where to turn, I guess that's why I'm here. Tonight I lost my last friend because of a stupid text. I'm so tired of my life and just wish I could restart. I don't know if I can keep this up any longer. It's worn me down so much. I hate where I am and I hate what I am doing and I hate what I've let myself become. I need help, please, somebody
