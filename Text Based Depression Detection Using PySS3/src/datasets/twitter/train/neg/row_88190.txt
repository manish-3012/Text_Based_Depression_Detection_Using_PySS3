Can barely take it...This is my throwaway account. 



I feel like shit whenever I talk to a new girl. Me and this one girl has been talking for a month or so and she knows all the drugs I abused before. Every ex girlfriend either did not know about me abusing pills or they freaked out and left me. I haven't had a girlfriend in a year and 20 odd some days and let me tell you, it feels good to like someone again.

Her name is Abby and she knows I used pills and marijuana as an escape. We never really hung out but she claims to really like me. This is shocking to me because no girl kept talking to me once they found out about my drugs. Here is the catch:

I'm petrified of getting hurt, getting used, being lied to, etc. My father mentally abused my mother and cheated on her. I've been in a handful of relationships and I put in so much effort. I'd go out of my way just to make them happy. I treated them so damn well. Then they just left. I'm afraid this will keep happening. No girl wants a guy who abused pills...nobody. I feel like a failure.
