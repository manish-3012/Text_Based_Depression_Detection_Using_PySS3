I don't want to kill myself, but I don't see another way outI'm a piece of shit. I have a beautiful girlfriend, who I don't deserve. I have friends, but I feel like I'm the background character in everyone else's life. I'm the friend that everyone goes to when they need help or need to talk to someone, so I always feel obligated to be fine when I'm not.
