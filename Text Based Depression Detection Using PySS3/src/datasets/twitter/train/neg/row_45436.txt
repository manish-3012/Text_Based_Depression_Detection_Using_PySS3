my mom told me she has no say if i want to kill myself.basically my mom told me as I admitted to wanting to take my own life ,â€ I canâ€™t make you stayâ€. The words bother me a lot right now as iâ€™m contemplating my life. I donâ€™t know how she meant it. It hurts. Iâ€™m sorry iâ€™m just ranting at this point but iâ€™m just scared of dying because i donâ€™t want my family to be sad. Especially my dad
