I am afraid of myselfI've reached a new low in my life. I've been down before,thought of suicide,but I've never went through with it. These last few weeks I've been thinking about it more and more. I feel like if things keep going the way they do, I will end up doing something irreversible. I have never cut myself up until 2 months ago, but thats not helping me cope anymore. I try punching myself,ripping out my hair, and just about anything to feel something. Its progressively getting worse and I'm afraid of what the last thing will be that will set me over the edge. Ending it all is sounding better every time I think about it.
