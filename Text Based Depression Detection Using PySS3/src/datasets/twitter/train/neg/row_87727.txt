iâ€™m just venting and cryingso my boyfriend broke up with me because his other boyfriend told him to I was in poly relationship and it didnâ€™t even seem like he fought to stay with me and he said that the trust between him and his other boyfriend sometimes matter more than our relationship every did and Iâ€™ve never felt so low to the point where Iâ€™m telling my friend my last request if I do kill myself and Iâ€™m just donâ€™t really want to go on without him
