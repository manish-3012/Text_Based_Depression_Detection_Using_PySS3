He doesn't notice that I'm losing itMy freaking boyfriend is always busy with SOMETHING. I don't blame him. He's a chipper and productive dude. But he doesn't notice how much pain I'm in. He actually just doesn't talk to me much in general anymore. It's very hard to get his full attention. Either way what would he do about it? Send me away? It's been a mystery. But I miss his company. Now I don't have much left.

Today I injured my neck and can barely move. I've been in bed all day. Haven't eaten yet... didn't really plan on it. I keep having the suicidal thoughts even though I'm not brave enough to do anything with them. Sometimes I feel like people won't miss me that much if they hardly even talk to me in the first fucking place. That goes for everyone. What are they missing? Nothing. I've lost it all.
