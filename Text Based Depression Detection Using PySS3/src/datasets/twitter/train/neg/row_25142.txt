I miss her so much. More than anyone could know.I need help about two years ago i was engaged to my soulmate. Her name was Rachel, too me she was the most beautiful woman I have ever seen. She was killed about a year ago and I don't know what to do I don't want to stay here on earth without her. I am drunk as hell and am seriously thinking about going to visit her. I just cant do it anymore.
