Why should I not kill myself?This is a legit question.

I literally make every person, and animal, around me miserable. I hate my mom for things that happened years ago. She has a hard life, still takes care of me at the sad age of 22, and still I hate her and make her miserable. My animals are stressed around me constantly, and sometimes I have to do everything in my power to not hurt them for reasons even I don't understand. Today I hit my little dog for a stupid reason, and then I hurt myself because I deserved it. I am no fun to be around, I've lost nearly all my friends, and any relationship I had a chance at I ruined. I hate myself and I hate everyone around me. It's even worse being around those I love, because I see how horrible I am through them, and how hard I am to be around and talk to. I've tried medication, drugs, drinking, but nothing works. I honestly see no reason not to end my life, it would be better for everyone. Usually when people say something like that it is just them being selfish and unreasonable....but no, it would honestly be better for everyone, even me. I can't find a single reason not to at this point. Living would be the selfish thing
