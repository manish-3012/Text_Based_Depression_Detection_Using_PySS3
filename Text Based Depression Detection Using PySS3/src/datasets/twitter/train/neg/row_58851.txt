Iâ€™m 13 and always try to act happy but still slipped up lots of times earlier this year and am very close after a hard day. Also sorry for grammar rambling and what ever I mess up on I might live another day or a full life.I have had multiple times where I had a bottle of bleach right next to me but had to talk myself out of it.

I feel like if I did every one would feel mad and manipulated. Thatâ€™s probably the only thing thats holding me on besides the fact I got my new Pc recently and a few friends.

Prepare for me to talk about my pc a bit. So with my pc it is probably the only thing that really brings me happiness any more and feel like I would miss so much without my pc. ( and yes I know what it sounds like but I donâ€™t believe in the afterlife)

I have I big friend group but only enjoy the friends who I donâ€™t get to see that much because they are a year ahead of me. With the people my age most of the time they donâ€™t take me seriously and I doubt would believe I am the one who made this. Another thing with the people my age is I enjoy hanging out with a few of them and others itâ€™s always in the moment but never well for ever.

Now with why would fell like a manipulator. I always act happy dance and sing which are basically the opposite of depression and have been the lead of multiple plays because I also some what like that. Another thing with plays is earlier this year after one some one said I seemed like a genuinely happy person. 

I donâ€™t know what to do. I have not told a single person yet except for one friend some thing like this years ago who I am trying to become better friends with again but because they are in a different grade then me I have a hard time talking to and have not been diagnosed with depression so I feel like one of does 12 year old girls who decided they have depression which is a whole other thing. 

I just want some help and donâ€™t want to die.
