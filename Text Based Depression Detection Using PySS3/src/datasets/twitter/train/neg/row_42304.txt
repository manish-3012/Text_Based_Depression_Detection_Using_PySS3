So hopelessI'm 19 years old. Background: I have OCD and anxiety issues. 
I feel like such a fucking dumbass. Last year at this time I started feeling "foggy". It's so hard to describe but it's hell on earth. It feels like I'm a little drunk, like I can't focus on things, like I have a clouding of consciousness. It's absolute torture 24/7. Well, the doctors told me it was anxiety after a ton of tests, and I was put on an SSRI. I gradually got better and eventually returned basically to normal. In come alcohol. Of course I can't drink like a normal person. Of course I HAD to have the personality where I binge every time like a fucking irresponsible dumbass. I drank regularly for the last 7-8 or so months. In that time I've blacked out probably 4-6 times. Each time it happened I told myself I would change but i couldn't. I'm weak. I can't drink like a normal person. Well, I could just quit drinking, and have decided to completely quit. But, this is where my original story comes in. The awful feeling, the torture, the complete hell on earth, is back. My mind feels like it's only half on and there's nothing I can do to fix it. It happened after I was a dumbass and blacked out AGAIN. I'm so stupid, if I had just drank like somebody who had half a goddamn sense of intelligence I'd be fine. But no, I can't. I woke up the day after and noticed my mind was back in the torture. Back in the fucking thick of it. What if it's permanent this time? So here I am, trapped in my own version of fucking hell and I can't even say it's not my fault I guess. All I think about for half of the day is how I can end the suffering. I've had to start taking Xanax just to calm down enough to stay alive.
