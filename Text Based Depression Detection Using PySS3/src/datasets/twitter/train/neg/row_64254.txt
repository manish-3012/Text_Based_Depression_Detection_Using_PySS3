I wish I could stop everything just for a momentI don't like feeling like this. I just wish I could go to sleep and never wake up. I'm tired of pretending to be happy. Everyone just thinks I'm annoying, and honestly, I do too. I'm a fucking boring person, and people hate being around me. I don't wanna kill myself, I just wanna stop everything. I don't know what to do. The people I wanna be around think I'm either annoying, boring or both. I feel like most people don't wanna be around me and anytime I try to talk about this people don't seem to give a fuck. But why would they? What did I ever do for them? Even if I try my best to be a nice person everyone just wants me to shut up. I'm scared I'll do something I'll regret. Like scream at a person what I really think of them, or tell someone about this, and they just start talking shit about me. I'm scared i'll tell one of my good friends this and they'll start seeing me differently. I don't wanna die, I just want someone to hug me and tell me everythings gonna be all right without judging me or thinking i'm just looking for attention. I don't wanna die but I feel like there are no other options. I'm scared people will think of me as the depressed girl. Anytime I try to talk to someone I really want to get to know they usually push me away. Or I overthink and fuck it up. 
I want everything to just stop, but I don't wanna kill myself. I might not have another option though. Anyone else feel like this?  I'm sorry, I just needed to rant.
