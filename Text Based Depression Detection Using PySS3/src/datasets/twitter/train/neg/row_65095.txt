Could there be a mass suicidal generation ahead?I haven't been feeling good since a long long time and even tho I contemplate the thought of what life means for me for every once in while, I think think my mission is to speak out on what I see while I am slowly falling in to a more fatalistic approach to life. Count depression and loneliness on top of  l am scared for the colder months to come. 

This is my situation as a context.

My life has been a mess when I grew up, parental neglect, abuse and religious bullshit. But it got me thinking about the current state of things.

Humanity is going to shit, our planet is changing for the worse through our impact, and us including the future generations have to work our asses off in order to change things for the better.

But we have a Xanax addicted, social media depressed generation coming that is so disconnected with the world around them that. IT renders then completely incapable of doing anything. A good part of the future generations will be mentally crippled and I think that in western societies suicide will skyrocket because of the complexity of problems that have to be solved in order to stimulate change.
