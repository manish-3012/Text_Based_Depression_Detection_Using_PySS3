I have nobody left.No friends left, disowned by my parents, girlfriend "wasnt ready for a relationship" after everyone told her she was stupid for getting with a sick boyfriend. Guess its kind of a good thing anyways. One of the biggest things keeping me from doing it was not wanting to hurt people, but now with nobody left to hurt, nobody to turn to for help, i feel like i could do it without any guilt. Idk if i should even explain my reasons for it, but ive had suicidal thoughts since i was a kid, maybe just bored with life and always feeling so hollow, even when shit goes south i cant cry even when i want to. Every day is painful to breathe, and to be honest i dont want to get better. I already hated the fact that of all people to survive a bout with cancer, it had to be a suicidal fuck up like me. 
So all things considered, suicide might just be the biggest accomplishment of my life.
I wish you all the best.
Goodbye.
