not karma whoring, i thought maybe someone could help...hi, i don't really know where to start, i don't have any friends, not even my brothers are annoyed by me, my mother's a fucking pshycopath, my dad lost his job,. my mom "quit" hers, we have no money, and it just keeps getting worse and worse, i try to sleep as much as possible (today, i woke up at 5:38pm) hoping it'll get better but it doesn't, i know it's supposed to "get better" but i just legitimatley don't think it will. I'm just not good at anything, and anything i am, my brothers are better at, i have a high I.Q (170) but i suck at school, if i knew no one cared about me, i would kill myself, but they do, and i wish they didn't. I'm just really, really miserable, and i just wish there was some way around it, but i can't find one, i'm not like  *on the verge* of killing myself, so maybe i should have posted this under depression, i don't know, i just want help...
