Any hope for (m)e?My other posts only got 1 good response which still didn't help much. Posting here made me feel even worse and suicidal. Edit: People are also insulting me through pms now.

I'm 19 and a half and never had a girlfriend. I have a serious case of anxiety, I am not good looking and not tall. I have never asked a girl out because I can read body language very well and I know people don't care about me. How do I make this happen? I am looking for a relationship with someone. I have a threshold of 6 months. If nothing is successful by 20, then I think I know what to do. I'm looking for actual advice. My grades and health are in jeopardy and ill probably get kicked out of college in December, but finding a relationship is my priority, and school is a second at the moment.

Reponses not accepted: "If you cant love yourself you cant love another person" "If youre not happy single, you cant be happy with another person" "Youre young, things will get better" "Don't look for a girlfriend just to have a girlfriend" "Improve yourself first" "Don't look for a girlfriend because everyone has one" "Don't compare yourself to others" "Have confidence" "See a therapist/ get professional help"

If you don't have a response or feel the need to downvote people on my post, then tell me a good suicide method time and place. I am looking for good advice and non professional help. I can afford therapy but it doesn't work.
