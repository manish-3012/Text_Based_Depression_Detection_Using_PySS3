i don't know if i can make it to mondayi would honestly have killed myself by now but i have nothing to use in my apartment and i don't have the energy to walk across the street and jump off a building. im in a partial program and i missed it today because i was too depressed to get out of bed because im a fucking failure. everyone is out of town for the weekend and its just me alone in my apartment. i can't think straight. i can't go back to the hospital. im a lost cause. i don't know if i can live to monday when the program starts up again. i have never had so little motivation before. im a lost cause
