Darkness# Darkness

 I'm swimming all alone in a pool of darkness  
and I feel like darkness is slowly pulling me under  
I yell for help but no one is there to hear it  
I begin to see the water at eye level  
and I kick and flail  
fighting to stay above the darkness

  
But the darkness won't let go of its hold on me  
and I slowly begin to give in  
to the feeling that lies below the water line  
the waters starts to fill my lungs  
the lungs that once held so much life

  
yet now they allow the murky water to replace that  
I know that this path doesn't lead to happiness  
But why doesn't someone grab my hand  
pull me from darkness's grasp?

  
because no one knows I stand at the boundary  
the boundary between light and dark  
so I give in to the thing that holds me  
All of the strength and all of the courage  
that I once held in my heart  
can't save me from the water

  
So I slowly slip below the world of conscientiousness  
undetected by the occupants of that world  
I don't want to fight anymore  
I've given into darkness
