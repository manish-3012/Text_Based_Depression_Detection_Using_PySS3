Itâ€™s creeping backHi there, I havenâ€™t visited this sub in quite some time because I felt like I was doing better. I guess I was wrong. I felt pretty ok for some months now, but now itâ€™s just creeping back over me. I can no longer afford my antidepressants and it just seems like things are getting bad again. I canâ€™t shake the feeling and I canâ€™t get it off my back. Iâ€™m not sure what to do. Iâ€™m extremely apathetic and exhausted today. Iâ€™m trying to remain focused at work, but I feel like just walking out and running my car up a tree. I feel bad for this post, but I guess I just needed a place to vent. Sorry.
