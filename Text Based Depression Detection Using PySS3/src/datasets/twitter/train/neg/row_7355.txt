ConcealI usually donâ€™t care about appearing sad in front of my family. I have given up trying to put on a facade. They can tell by the look on my face how drained I am. They probably donâ€™t fully realize that I am gone on in the inside. I am so broken. Life finds a way daily to show my why I should kill myself. When it comes to my one friend, I never let him see me sad. I completely do a 180 and try to act like my old self. I donâ€™t want to appear that my life is falling apart with him. I text him and never show that I am on the edge. I see it as an escape. He knows nothing about how truly miserable and suicidal I am. He will be the most shocked when I hang myself. The environment around me reminds me everyday of how terrible everything is. Why is this happening to me? I donâ€™t want to go on.
