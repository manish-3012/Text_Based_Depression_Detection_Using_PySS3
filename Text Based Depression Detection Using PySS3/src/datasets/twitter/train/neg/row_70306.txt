Strange, why can't I contact with therapists in Korea....In here Korea 99% of people are unawaware of who are Therapists. In practise they only play with candles and herbs thus lack psychological knowledge. That means there are no therapists who are somewhere between psychiatric docs and stubborn counselors, since psychology is still taboo. There are only snob psychiatric docs only diagnose pills and want moneys, conservative cpunselors try to correct people same as others. Neither are LGBTQ friendly since they are snob try to correct people. Lastly, there is right to be mad but why do people try to correct person try to be mad? I just want to use my insanity as fuel.
