Thanks to everyone who tried to helpHonestly I appreciate the help. But it's no good. Irl I'm all alone. My last friend keeps telling me that it would just get better if I tried. And she gets mad when I explain that I have and there is no point. No one else wants to be around me. Can't really blame them. I'm uninteresting. Never have anything to say. I just feel like I've been locked in a cold pitch black room, with no light uner the door crack.
