Second time this week please pleaseI'm feeling the sympthoms of my suicidal trial yet. I can't think about anything without feeling without air, and with my heart speeding. Here and now I don't know if I am writing anything that someone can understand, because I have to think to make any phrase, and I don't want to. I tried suicide saturday, with medication. That shit didn't kill me, it only made me feel extremally dizzy and convulsive. No one to take care of. I'm alone. FUCK. I'm smart, I'm beautiful, I'm everything that I was supposed to, but for some reason I'm not enough for anyone. I was one of the best gone wilders ever here, and I had to forget it because I thought it was so embarrasing, idk, I loved it, but hated it at the same time. My heart is hurting hurting hurting, and there is no medicine. I will try a different method this time, because I can live dying. I'd rather die already.
