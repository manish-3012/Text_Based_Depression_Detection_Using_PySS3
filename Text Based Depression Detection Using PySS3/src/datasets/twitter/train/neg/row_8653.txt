Holy shit I canâ€™t make it stopHoly fuck Iâ€™m drunk and Iâ€™m full to the brim with anguish and what is going to keep me from killing myself tonight.  Iâ€™m so fucking tired people, Iâ€™m sick of feeling so empty and also so full of poisonous shit at the same time, Iâ€™m so tired of wasting myself for one person Iâ€™m so tired of everything. Why canâ€™t I find someone or anything that makes me happy or at least doesnâ€™t make me feel fucking worthless.  Iâ€™m never enough for anyone.  Oh my god I wish I were dead holy fuck. Iâ€™m so sorry to anyone reading this.
