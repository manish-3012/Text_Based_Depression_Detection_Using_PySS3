All my happiness is goneI'm trying to be a good person, but apparently that can't be. I want to be good for the new year, new decade. But I'm less then a failure, at least failures try, I have never tried in anything. I could have the greatest setting and greatest people around me and greatest drug and still I would feel like this. I'm extremely unhappy, I deserve it, I knew this would come. I want to be good, that's all.
