Iâ€™ve never felt this awful and hopeless beforeHi everyone this is my first post here. Iâ€™m sorry if Iâ€™m rambling or nothing Iâ€™m saying makes sense. Iâ€™m having a lot of trouble putting my thoughts together. 

Iâ€™m sad that I feel the need to post. I just finished my last final exam and I had an anxiety attack during it... I couldnâ€™t focus and my vision got so blurry. It was really scary. And now, about 3 hours after, Iâ€™m still shaking from anxiety. I canâ€™t think straight. I feel so dizzy and nauseous and sick. 

My depression has not been this bad since I was like 13. Iâ€™m 19 now, my birthday is next month. I really donâ€™t know what to do. I canâ€™t stop thinking about killing myself. Iâ€™ve never thought about it so deeply and seriously before. Itâ€™s fucking scaring me. 

I fucking hate feeling like this. The stress of schools along with relationships with everyone in my life and my relationship with myself has just gotten to be too much. I canâ€™t fucking take it. Iâ€™m shaking really badly. I donâ€™t know who to talk to. 

I donâ€™t want to kill myself but at the same time I do. How the FUCK does that even make sense? I hate my brain I hate depression I hate everything about myself. I self harmed for the first time in years. YEARS. I canâ€™t believe myself. Iâ€™m so ashamed and embarrassed and guilty. 

I see a psychiatrist monthly but since our last session things have escalated so rapidly and intensely. Should I take myself to an emergency room? I donâ€™t know what to do. I donâ€™t know what to do I donâ€™t know what to do
