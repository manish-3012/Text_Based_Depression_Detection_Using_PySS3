I am on the verge of ending it allMy dad has a declining health because of me i was never able to meet the expectations of my dad and he got angry at me and now because of all those time he is having high blood pressure and extremely high heart rate at looking at the hospital bills it really seems like a good idea to die so my dad won't have to pay my schools fees anymore ( you can't get a part time job In India until you are 18) so this maybe the last time i am here i hope you great life
