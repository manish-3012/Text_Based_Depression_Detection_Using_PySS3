Youâ€™re all playing a sick jokeâ€œGet helpâ€

Then the help you ask for either: isnâ€™t there, because the doctors your insurer recommends are dead or retired; isnâ€™t there, because the doctor doesnâ€™t answer his phone or voicemail; isnâ€™t helpful, because they cherry pick information that fits their hypothesis and ignore everything that suggests otherwise; or comes with caveats, I scratch your back you scratch mine.  

I want to be dead.  So badly.  This is such a fucking nightmare.
