Don't know if I can make it to 2021  

At my lowest today. Not sure how long I can keep living like this. 

Iâ€™m a prisoner in my own apartment. I canâ€™t leave. I donâ€™t have a car. Itâ€™s in such a remote area that I canâ€™t walk anywhere. Bus recently shut down. Wonâ€™t work again until the end of January. I paid my rent and thatâ€™s it. I donâ€™t have enough money to pay my phone bill. My dental bills. My student loan bills. Donâ€™t even have enough money to pay for groceries. Wonâ€™t even get hours at my job again until February. Can't get another job until then. Can't walk there. Can't afford to Uber there. No fucking bus. 

All I do is sit and count pills and wonder how many it would take. Take 20mg of melatonin, sleep for fourteen hours. Rinse and repeat. Nobody would know I was dead for days. Maybe weeks. Even if I manage to make it through December, I canâ€™t pay rent for January. Iâ€™ll be homeless. Not even able to sleep in a car. Almost 100k in student loans. No health insurance to get help. No therapy. No Prozac. Iâ€™m at my breaking point. My mouth is a fucking mess. Eating disorders and nicotine addictions throughout my teenage years means I need 5 of them pulled. Sometimes the pain is unbearable, but I donâ€™t have $1200 to throw at a goddamn oral surgeon. Iâ€™m fucking 23. 

And I did all this to myself. I couldâ€™ve been more successful. I couldâ€™ve been in a more secure spot right now, but the night always comes, through suicidal thoughts, depression or eating disorders, and it always made me want to die with it. Iâ€™m trying to hold out, but the light at the end of the tunnel is getting dimmer and dimmer. I donâ€™t know how long I can live like this before giving in.
