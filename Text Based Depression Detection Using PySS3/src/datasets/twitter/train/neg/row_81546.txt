I donâ€™t get itI donâ€™t get it. Why does no one like me? Iâ€™m talk decent looking and I am nice. I try to be as interested in others lives as much as I can be and not focus on myself but that doesnâ€™t make people want to talk to me. Anyone I â€œmeetâ€ on tinder doesnâ€™t reply, I have no way to meet people in person as I live in the middle of no where and canâ€™t go to bars(even if I could I canâ€™t really drink so wouldnâ€™t matter). Iâ€™m not in school and anyone from high school hates me, or at least doesnâ€™t want to associate with me. Iâ€™m a total loser and I donâ€™t get it and I donâ€™t get what to do. Iâ€™m so close to killing myself but I donâ€™t know how to do it. I know it would hurt my super small family aka the only 4 people who acknowledge my existence, but I feel like a little bit of grief compared to 6 FUCKING YEARS of depression and suicidal ideation is fair enough. Canâ€™t wait to be called selfish by all these people who always post about â€œreaching out to a friendâ€ or  any of that bullshit because you were all selfish to never realize that I had fallen off the earth and no one even realized I was gone. Fuck this world and fuck everything in it, canâ€™t wait to be the bad guy in this situation.
