Iâ€™m ending it tonight and my parents will be to blameAll I wanted to do was to live my life a little and not be suffocated in their confinement. I loved to live so much I am sacrificing my life for at least 5 other teenagers who wanted to live just like me. Maybe just maybe someoneâ€™s parents will learn from it. I wonâ€™t be a coward, I will be a hero.
