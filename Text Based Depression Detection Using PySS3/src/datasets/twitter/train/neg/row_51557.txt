I have nothing left, I'm a user and a piece of shit.I woke up this morning to the best friend I've ever had pointing out all the ways I'm a fake piece of shit, that I'm self centered and only pretend to care about others for personal gain. And she's right, I've denied it every other time I've been told the same things but her explanation made me realize I have to stop lying to myself. I have no one anymore. I have maybe 2 or 3 friends I can go to anymore, no family, and a shit job that overworks me that I'll probably be fired from soon because my depression makes me as slow as fuck. I've had no home since I was 17, a high school dropout, an addict, I just see no way of my life getting better anytime soon. And my entire life has only gotten worse the older I get. The first time I tried killing myself was at 8 fucking years old, I can't even count how many times I've tried after that. All I do anymore is work, sleep, and think of the quickest way to go out.
