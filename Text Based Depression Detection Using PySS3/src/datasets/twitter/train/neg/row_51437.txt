I'll never amount to shitI make a dollar above minimum wage, I've dropped out of college at least 5 times (that I can remember), I'm on the verge of getting kicked out of my apartment, I have no friends, I don't get along with my boyfriend, My car is a piece of shit that is going to crap out on me any day now and I can never imagine being able to afford a decent car on my own, I would not be able to hold down a good job just relying on the bus because the bus system over here sucks, I'm just a low life and that's never going to change. I'll never amount to anything. I've tried changing things so many times but I also get discouraged and fail. The few family I have in my life  - they are not in good health and it's killing me. I won't have anyone but my son left one day and I have no idea how I'd ever take care of him on my own. To anyone just saying I need to start making positive changes...I agree but at the same time you don't know how hard it is to climb out of poverty when it's all you've ever known and all you've ever lived. I just hate my life why live it?
