w h a t d o i d o ?i'm literally 12. i recently started self harming, but it's just gone downhill since then. my head keeps spinning, my self esteem is plummeting, and all that's keeping me from ending it all is animal crossing. seems stupid, i know, but i'm just so confused.. what do i do? (trauma is 6 years of non-stop bullying with the same from my 3 sisters)
