Venting I guessI realized last night aftee forcing my self to hangoit with friends that I'm neither happy nor fulfilled either way. Stay home and isolate and feel bad about how Im wasting my youth crying in bed. Or go out and watch thes people be normal and laugh a d have a good time; while I'm ready to OD on my klonopin in the bathroom. Nothing makes me happy anymore, I actively avoid any conversation with my boyfriend and brither I can. I used to have a pact that I would make it to the end for my 13 year old dog but I don't even feel like I'm adequately caring for her anymore. So anyways- I'm trying ti find the right combo if klonopin and alcohol to kill me without being too suspicious lmfao
