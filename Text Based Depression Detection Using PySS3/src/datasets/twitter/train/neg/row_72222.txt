Why should I tell people I'm planning to kill myself if I REALLY want to die?I am tired. Me threatening to commit suicide all the time is nothing but annoying to the people around me. I know the consequences of telling people I have a plan. They'll just hospitalize me and make sure I don't hurt myself. So if I *really* want to die, shouldn't I just shut up about it and pretend I don't have a plan so no one can stop me? Telling them means that I'm not 100% serious about dying. It would be pure attention seeking, right?
