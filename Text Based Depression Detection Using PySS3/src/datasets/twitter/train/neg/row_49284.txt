I really want to help my bfBut I donâ€™t know how. He is struggling so much from heavy depression and anxiety. He frequently wants to end it all and he attempted suicide a month ago. This has been an ongoing struggle for him for years. He is currently seeing a psychiatrist and recently saw a therapist (who he hates) and nothing seems to help him feel any better. He is depressed and lonely and suffering all of the time. The only joy I ever see him experience is when he plays with our dogs.

Just looking for some input on what I can say/do besides just be there for him. I sometimes get angry at him and I know itâ€™s wrong and not helpful but staying silent seems worse like I donâ€™t care about him and donâ€™t have any response. I love him so much and canâ€™t imagine how much pain he is in. I want him to go into a treatment facility but he flat out refuses.
