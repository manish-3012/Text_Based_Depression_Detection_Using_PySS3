Why is it so hard to ask for help?If I'd had access to a sharp knife (I'm too apathetic to put in enough effort with a dull one, only managed to shallowly cut before giving up) earlier tonight, I wouldn't be here right now. I knew the feeling would pass, but I didn't want to burden my friend by reaching out for help. As stupid as it is, I didn't want to make her cry by admitting I'm suicidal againâ€”I suppose it was just that I didn't want to know that she was crying, since she definitely would have if I'd succeeded.

I used to think, "it's stupid of someone to not get help if they're feeling this way; why would you think you're a burden?" Turns out this was very much an instance of cognitive dissonance or hypocrisy.

I knew there was a problem before it got this far (feeling the extreme apathy typical of depression), but I didn't say anything. I kept asking myself, "why won't anyone notice?" and then tried very hard to convince everyone who was concerned that I was OK.

I'm very worried that the next time this hits I'll have access to meds to OD on or a knife I can end myself with (though I will note that I only tried to slit my wrists, setting the blade against my throat made me hesitate). I can't check myself into a hospital until next Friday at the earliest, and I have no idea if I can make it that long.

I don't really know why I'm posting. I don't want to talk to the psychiatrist or therapist about this, because I don't know if they'd be helpful, and I don't want to change my medications again (they already make me sick all the time; upping the doses or adding more seems like a bad idea). I don't want to make my friend worry. I can't bring myself to talk to family. I guess I'll talk to you all, safe behind anonymity (the only time I can speak up, it seems).
