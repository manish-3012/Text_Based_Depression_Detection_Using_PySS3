How to stop feeling overwhelmed and hopelessI've been dealing with depression and suicidal feelings for a long time. I'm trying to get my life together to be less miserable, but I feel like I can't make progress in any area of life. I'm just scattered. I can't just pick one thing and focus because I feel like there are problems everywhere and they are all interdependent. 

I have to finish school, but I feel too depressed and can't focus to do the work and the work seems hopeless anyway. I chose to study English and know I'll never make a decent amount of money with it anyway. 

I want to make friends, but I'm depressed/not fun to be around. I don't have much money to go out, so I just stay lonely and depressed. I can't drive either, so it's hard for me to get around town. 

I want to get a driver's license, but I have really bad anxiety about driving and I can't afford lessons and there's no one around who would be able to teach me. 

I want to get a job and make some money, but I need to finish school first, so I stay worried about my financial situation. 

My house needs repairs that I can't afford. It weighs on me that I don't have the ability to have a nice environment to be in. I'm depressed being in the house all the time and the house being a mess/falling apart. 

Every problem I try to work on has a bunch of other problems attached to it, so I can't make a move in any positive direction. I'm just spinning a bunch of plates and going nowhere. 

I had the ambition to work in a creative field, but have realized I lack the talent, drive, and connections to do that. I'm depressed over that, I feel like a complete failure. I feel too old to do anything of value. I feel like I'm just going to be miserable for the rest of my life. 

All these feelings make me wonder why I bother with anything\-\-nothing will help. It's rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic. I'm drowning and don't know how to get myself above water.
