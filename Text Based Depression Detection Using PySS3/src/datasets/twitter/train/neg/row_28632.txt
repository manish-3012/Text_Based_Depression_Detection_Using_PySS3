Chronic Tonsil stones, Gerd LPR, PTSD... StrugglingFeel like giving up 

I feel like everything I love about life is being limited by my ailments

I have to follow strict diet constantly 

I had to quit smoking weed ( my one crutch that helps me)

Im anxious in all social scenarios due to fear of bad breath
I often avoid seeing my friends or even kissing my wonderful girlfriend now


I was molested as a small child which left me with a number of mental health problems.. Anxiety , ptsd , substance abuse problems, depression

I don't know what to do anymore.. I'm trying hard to get a grip but the thought of suicide runs through my mind daily. 

I want to love my life again but I've been dealing with the phisical ailments for upwards of 10 years now and it's hard to think of a time where I wasn't deeply depressed or anxious
