Help meI feel I'm depressed for about 6 years. I don't like going out, I prefer to stay at home, but I always feel bad for not going out. Isn't that a paradox? Also, when people ask me out, I usually make excuses and later I'll just sit on the couch watching tv or playing games, and feeling very bad. I don't understand myself... How can I fix it? Right now I just want to kill myself... This way the pain will end and everything will be alright.

Thank you for your help
