Waiting to dieI have almost entirely lost the will to live. For years now Iâ€™ve been living for other people (friends, family, etc) and just absolutely going through the motions in every other aspect of life. Iâ€™ve neglected so many things: relationships, my health, finances, career. Now this hole Iâ€™ve dug seems insurmountable. That being said, the act of suicide seems selfish to me. I know it would hurt people that care about me and leave them with unanswerable questions. I just want a way out. Iâ€™m tired.
