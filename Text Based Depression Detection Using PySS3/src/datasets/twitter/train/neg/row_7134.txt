Worst year of life, can I really recover?2016 wasn't just a bad year for the world. It's also been undeniably the worst year of my life. So bad in fact that I don't know how I'm supposed to come back from it. Just seems like I'm falling into a state of static crap. I don't see the light at the end of the tunnel.

EDIT: I probably should have included what happened this year in my life

Well my mother had a second stroke almost exactly one year after her first. This one has almost physically disabled her and left her in a perpetual state of anxiety. Then I started messing up at my crap job. Got written up three times. Then I made the mistake in enrolling in classes an hours drive away thinking I could get a promotion later on. After that my father, the only person caring for my mother, died suddenly. Both myself and my sister had to quit our jobs and move back in with her. Our hometown sucks by the way. The last of our pets died soon after. Now I've lost almost all of my money when just in June I was so close to saving up to my next financial goalmark. I have no friends and no girlfriend so I'm pretty much all alone outside my immediate family.
