I'd kill myself if it weren't for my parentsI've had enough, therapy doesn't work, medication doesn't work and I just can't go on any more.

Today I cut myself and tried to hang myself with my belt and reached the point where I almost passed out. It didn't even hurt, I just felt tingly all over. Another few minutes and it all would've been over but I can't disappoint my parents. I've been putting on a happy face for them since starting medication and they told me they're glad to have their son back but it's all a facade. If I were to die it would devastate them but I just want the suffering to stop.
