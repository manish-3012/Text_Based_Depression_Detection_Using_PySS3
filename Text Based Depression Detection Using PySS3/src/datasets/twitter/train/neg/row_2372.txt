i am at rock bottom and donâ€™t know what to do.the past couple of days i thought things were getting legitimately better but suddenly everything just got so fucking bad. i canâ€™t even see things getting better now and i feel like im in a dark room that is locked and i canâ€™t get out. 
suicide has been the star of the show in my mind constantly and i canâ€™t see it going away. 


yeah i realize that i was just doing close to ok but i felt like it was just a filter because when i think of it things were still bad.  i feel like everything is against me and i canâ€™t get out. i canâ€™t look at myself or speak without crying and the littlest things make me break. im so tired of feeling this way and iâ€™m tired of myself.

i canâ€™t get out and i donâ€™t know what to do. 
i feel like i canâ€™t talk about it because anytime i do it upsets people and even my therapist tells me she doesnâ€™t know what to do. iâ€™ve seen plenty of therapists to know
that itâ€™s me and not them.

i canâ€™t go to the hospital again 
it tore my family apart because stuff happened with my brother and even if i did i know theyâ€™d just jack me up on more meds and it wonâ€™t change a thing. 

thereâ€™s no light at the end of my tunnel as i see it and i genuinely donâ€™t know what the fuck to do.
