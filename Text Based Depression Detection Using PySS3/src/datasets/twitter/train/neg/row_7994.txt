I'm doing it nowI never thought I'd last this long but time flew and life got worse and worse until it all fell apart. I woke up today and realized that I don't feel anything anymore. I'm not sad or afraid anymore. I'm just feeling finished with it all. I failed out of my undergrad and I'm failing the classes that are meant to improve my GPA. I wasted thousands of dollars in savings on junk so there's no turning back. My computer is broken too. I cut off all my friends and my family has given up on me. I'm about to be disowned and thrown out of the house once I fail this semester and once my mom sees my empty bank account. I look like a mess and my teeth are slowly rotting. There's not much left for me to wait for, I don't even care about the things that used to make me want to live. So to everyone, goodbye.
