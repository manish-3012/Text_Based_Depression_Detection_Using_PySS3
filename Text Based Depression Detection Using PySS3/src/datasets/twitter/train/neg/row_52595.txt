I don't knowWhat to think, or what to feel anymore

I'm in a more apathetic phase right now but sometimes the sadness seeps through the fog that clouds my thoughts. 

I've been inside of my mind for way too long, been alone for even longer. 

I look so god damn forward to dying, my single greatest desire. I don't know how long I can keep waiting for a natural death, one of these days I'll have to do it myself. 

I've lived for 20 years, and suffered for more than half of it. The fuck am i still breathing for. Hope that things get better are you kidding me. Nothing will ever be good enough to fill the void that's been created inside of me.
