It's comforting to know it'll end somedaySo life at the moment I can't really control. I live where I live and am stuck in a lease, I am trying to apply to different jobs but have a stable one for now, and the guy I'm dating is cool but it's not incredible.

Am I the only one that doesn't want to die necessarily, but I like the idea that someday I'll be completely unconscious and not have to worry about anything? I've been suicidal in the past, not really these days but maybe I'm dealing with the aftermath of breaking up with someone who was horrible. Maybe I just have so much crap going on that I can't control that even though I don't slow down, I hang out with friends as much as possible and I consider I have the most control over my happiness and independence than I've ever had (unironically) why do I still like the idea of my brain completely turning off?

Like one of those pool meditation pods sounds amazing. The idea that when you die it's just darkness and quiet, and that sounds incredible. I've only smoked weed but I'm not into hallucinogens cause life is crazy enough as it is.


But death almost seems comforting. I don't want to die because I still have shit to do, but is there a way to just turn off your brain entirely and be removed from your body? Music connects me to my body and makes me feel alive, but I want to feel... Removed maybe? Just so I can have a break from everything, even if just for a moment.
