Ive passed the lineIve finally decided to kill myself. I even know when. I have a perfect plan of cutting my wrists in a bath full of water. I simply have noone to live for... There is a girl that is real nice and everything but she is just making fun of me. I cry every night hoping tomorrow I will find someone but it just never works out.
