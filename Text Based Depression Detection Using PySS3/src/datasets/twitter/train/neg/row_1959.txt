I thought yesterday was going to end one of two ways 1. I was going to be dead 2. I would be in a mental hospital but neither happened and I just feel empty nowThe title is basically everything. I want to die and I really thought I was going to do it yesterday. I really really wanted to. Iâ€™m not scared of death or of dying itâ€™s something that will eventually happen to everyone so why not now? Iâ€™ve been going up and down the list of how but almost every option scares me or I just donâ€™t want my family/ friends finding me like that. But Iâ€™m such a shitty person that does nothing but make everyone worry or upset so I might as well just do it. I feel so hopeless and thereâ€™s no point anymore
