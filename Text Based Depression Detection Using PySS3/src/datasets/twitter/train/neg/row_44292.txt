How do I respond?...Whenever my friends tell me about their plans for the future and their dreams, goals and ambitions, they always ask me what I am planning for the future. I can't exactly tell them a bottle of scotch and about 4m of three strand nylon rope. My response is always "I don't know" but I feel like they are starting to suspect that that isn't the whole truth.
