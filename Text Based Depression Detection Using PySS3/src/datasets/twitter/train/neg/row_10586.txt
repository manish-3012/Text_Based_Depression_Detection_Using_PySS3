All of the nerves are exposed, and the loneliness just gets more painful.I try to act all tough and manly, but people see through it. I care too much about the way people feel around me, what they think. "What am I doing wrong?" and "Am I even adding anything exciting or interesting to their life?"

I struggle socially, I struggle to talk to my nieces and nephews the way I should.. they see me as boring.

I'm.
