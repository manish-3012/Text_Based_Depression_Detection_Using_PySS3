I'm not sure what's wrong with meI'm struggling with university. It worries me, but I can't find the motivation to do any work. I find myself wishing that I wasn't alive. I'd much rather die in my sleep than continue on this way. My friends and family offer their help but I find myself being unable to accept it. Further, I can't muster enough courage to tell them I'd much rather be done with life.

I'm too scared to kill myself, but I find myself, too often, wishing I was dead. I'm not sure what I'm doing with this post. 

I'm too scared to seek professional help. If I'm not suffering from anything, does that mean my thoughts are normal? If I am suffering from something, how much of that disease is accounts for my identity?

I don't know who I can talk to about this.
