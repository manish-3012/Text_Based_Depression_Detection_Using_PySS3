I am at my wits endI canâ€™t take any of this anymore. I always feel so alone and isolated. No one would even care if I was gone. My life is falling apart. I just want it all to end. Everything gets worse and worse. I am done. I know how Iâ€™m going to do it and all. I am going tonight. This is my final good bye. If anyone can give me a good reason to stay I might but at this point it would have to be pretty fucking good. I have been abused my whole life and I will never be able to escape them without doing this
