I'm not sure if I want to kill myself first of torture my bully prof and classmates firstI have exams and requirements until tomorrow but I've already given my all. I don't deserve to be shouted at. I don't deserve to be played. My grades shouldy not depend on their moods. My dignity should not be at their mercy if they are insecure they should just die. I hate school. I hate life. I hate that I can't fight back because it's wrong.
I want to die. I sincerely want to die. I should've killed myself on my birthday this April, now because i postponed it I'm suffering more.

Suicide is the answer stop saying that things will get better i always say that but it only gets worse.

I WANT TO DIE. KILL ME. MAKE IT STOP. MAKE THEM STOP. STOP STOP JUST STOP. STOP BEING BAD. STOP BEING MEAN. STOP PLAYING WITH ME. STOP PRESSURING ME. STOP JUDGING ME. STOP TELLING ME WHAT TO DO. JUST KILL ME ALREADY
