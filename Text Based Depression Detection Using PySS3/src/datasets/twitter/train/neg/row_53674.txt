I'd rather die than never be me againI hit my head this january, and ever since then I've been experiencing post concussion symptoms (dizziness, visual snow, fatigue, head pressure). things keep seeming to get better, then worse and worse. all I want is to be back to myself again, but if I can't I'd rather die than live a half life. my love for my family and my girlfriend keep me alive, but sometimes I feel like taking a knife and slitting my veins. I have been through hell these past two months and every time I start hoping that things are gonna get better, they get worse. On top of it all, everyone is telling me to suck it up. The docs are tired of me and refuse to believe that I have a problem, and even if they did, it's not like they could give me anything that could help. I can't do anything I love anymore. I feel inhuman. I'm going to hold out hope for a little while longer, but if shit keeps getting worse by summer, I'm just going to try to go. At one point the fear of death will be trumped by the lack of love of life (which is what kept me going when I was depressed).
