I need help I guessMy brother died by suicide a little over a year ago. He was my best friend and I've been fucked up ever since. I had suicidal thoughts before but now I've tried 3 times since. I don't know what to do. My husband is sick of dealing with it. I've been going to a therapist once a week for a while now, he has control of my meds and I'm being good. He's still pissed. I don't know what else to do. I'm trying. What else can I do to make him see I am trying to be normal? I'm not currently suicidal, but if I had to say I think that's probably how I'll go eventually.
