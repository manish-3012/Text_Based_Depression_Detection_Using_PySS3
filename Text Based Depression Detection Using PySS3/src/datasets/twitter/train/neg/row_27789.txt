Lost my second job within a yearTo spare the details, my first job had me get a slew of drug screens before they sent me to a jobsite. I passed them all except for the hair follicle test. I smoked weed back in college and havent since, and this was about 3 months after. Then a month later, I found another job doing the same thing and after 4 months of busting my ass they laid me off.

Im now sitting in my room considering why Im even still here. It sucks. My parents are pretty much done with me because Ive been a screwup since day one (my opinion, not theirs). And now, Ive lost two jobs within HALF a year even. I live with my brother and his girlfriend (now fiancee), and I hate the fact that everytime I see them, I get this feeling of inadequacy and dont understand why I am just getting a shitty hand. 

Ive spent my entire life rolling with the punches, taking everything in stride, but now Im just done with this rat race. I feel like Ive mentally checked out, even thought I can go around in public and act normal, happy, whatever. But in my own head it is spiraling out of control. Ive tried talking with friends, even a therapist, and it doesnt seem to help. All they offer is advice, but there isnt anything anyone can do because its all on the individual to get out of the mindset. But I find it tough when all I can see is my life spiraling out of control while my brother has a fantastic life setup. 

I just wish I could go work and keep the job. I want to start a life but I feel like Im trying to rock climb with greased hands and feet. I want the comfort of having my own place and having a steady job, but it is starting to seem less like a possibility and more like a dream. 

If anyone wants to chat, Ill be around. Thanks for listening.
