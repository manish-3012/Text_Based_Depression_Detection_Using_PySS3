I hate myself but I can't bring myself to hurt those around meAs of late each day feels like a struggle to get through. I haven't been able to see a therapist and my mental health is steadily deteriorating.

I've had some throughs for the past several years but never acted on them. Things are getting hard now. The world is so fucked and I hate that I'm living through this.

The thing that stops be from going any further is knowing how it would negatively effect those around me. It's not much, but it's what's stopping me.
