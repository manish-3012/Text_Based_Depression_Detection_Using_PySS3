I see no reason why I shouldn't kill myselfI'm a bad person. I'm a pathetic person. I have no goals, no ambition, no confidence, no friends, never had a relationship. I hurt people. I hurt people I love. I'm a complete and utter failure in every aspect of my life. I suck at my hobbies, I get angry too quickly, I can't get out of my bad habits. And worst of all is I don't want to get better. I just want to die. This world is sick I don't want to exist in it any longer. If it weren't for my parents I'd just travel the country aimlessly until I get killed or kill myself. I'm a nobody and there's no goddamn point to any of it. I wish I'd just have an aneurysm.
