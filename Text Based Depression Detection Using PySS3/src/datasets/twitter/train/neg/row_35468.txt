It's time.I posted here before and got no response,  even though it felt good to get some stuff off my chest.   Things  have gotten  worse over the past 2 weeks.   I kicked my roommate out a month ago and have been sitting lonely in my house, with my thoughts.  The only human contact I've had in the past couple weeks has been with coworkers and the guy at the window at jack in the box.  

I recently found out my ex terminated my parental rights through our states supreme Court. It hurts me deeply because it was done behind my back and I am listed as John Doe. Which is what I plan to make of myself.   I have the resources and I am surrounded by hundreds of miles of desert.  I get off work at 8am, even though it really does that matter if I work,  I can't take the money with me.   But I will leave a note for who ever searches my house and I will leave enough food for my cat.   The thing that scares me the most is last time I wrote on suicidewatch  I cried the whole time I wrote it, but this time everything seems okay.

If you're reading this, everything will be okay. May the Gods  be with you.
