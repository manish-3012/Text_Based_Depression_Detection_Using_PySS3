My sister is recently a single mom. History of suicidal thoughts and now she's saying she wants to hurt herself again. What should I do?I'm taking care of my sister, and by that I mean I'm paying for the apartment and utilities (it's a two bedroom). The dad ran off a long time ago. My girlfriend helps with the baby a lot and I thought things had been improving.

Well, today I got a call from my mom saying that my sister has been telling her therapists she's been having thoughts of hurting herself. I don't know what to do about it. I'm really torn. They're going to take the baby away, most likely, and I don't know how I can stop this downward spiral.

What can I do? My sister is kind of self righteous and self centered. She's never been thankful that I got an apartment so she could have a place to stay and a place for the baby. The first day she moved in (paying 0 bills) she complained about this and that, and she's just complained about one thing or another like she owns the place every day since almost. She never even tries to get a job, she just relies on everyone to coast her through life.

The worst part is my parents enable her to do it. My parents tell me, "she's so vulnerable, she's in such a bad position, please understand" and they make excuses for her, over and over. It's been this way as long as I can remember. She's never grown up or lived on her own and she's 28 years old. I'm 22 and trying desperately to hang on here. I work and do my best.

What do I do reddit? Please help.
