I constantly do this to myselfFalling back into old habits I hurt myself today. I havent bruised in a long time but I just did it again. Not as bad as I usually used to do it but the hopelessness is getting to me. I lose a little hope in myself every day. I dont think I'm worth it anymore. I want to kill myself but the only thing thats stopping me is how it will make my parents and friends feel. It scares me because if I have a bad enough break down I might stop caring about that. I'm just so tired of fucking my own life up and bringing down everyone with me. I dont want to be a burden anymore. I have convinced myself that if I died in some tragic way, I would help everyone realize they need to live their lives. I feel like my death could be good for everyone. I just want to stop hurting so bad....
