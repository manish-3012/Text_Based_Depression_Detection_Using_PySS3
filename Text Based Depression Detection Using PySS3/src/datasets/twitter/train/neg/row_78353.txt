Feeling so lonely and utterly hopeless.I just don't know what to do anymore. I am all alone. Completely alone. I am in a state where I have no friends or family. I have been quite fortunate coming here, I've met a lot of good people but their lives and mine are completely seperate. I would see a professional but I don't even have the cash for a sliding fee clinic. _x000D_

The big problem is that I am having trouble being motivated to even pursue things I like, I mean, I enjoy them but they don't give me any hope or fuel a desire to keep going with my life. It's hard to stay happy when I don't have anything to really keep me going. School is just a means to get a career, it doesn't really give me hope for the future. _x000D_

I feel like I really need to meet people before I lose my mind, it's just I am afraid I will just push any potential friends away in my current state. I thought I could be a recluse but I was wrong, I am utterly beset by intense sadness and lonliness. _x000D_

I know what the common suggestions are for helping to alleviate this but more than anything I just want someone to talk to right now. Anyone.
