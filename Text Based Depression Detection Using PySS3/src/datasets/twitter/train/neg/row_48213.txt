i regret being born (16/M)im done. im exhausted. i hate myself and existing so much.

I have barely any friend, school makes me suicidal, i've been bullied for my appearance all my life and i've been diagnosed with depression and severe self hatred

I have no idea what to do. School puts too much pressure on me, everything is pain at this point, and its just unbearable.

People have been telling me for years that "it gets better", but thats a fucking lie.

Im completly done of this burden that is my life and this unbearable pain that is my existence.



I have no idea what to do. Help me
