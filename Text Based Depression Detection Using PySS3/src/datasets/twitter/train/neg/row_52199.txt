So...it seems I need a titleLong and of it, I'm wondering why in the hell am I even righting this. All I know is I'm laying in my bed, tapping on an iPadm crying whilenI think of how ironic it I that I'm "first world" enough to have an iPad and the ability to complain on the Internet...all the while wallowing in the every growing, overwhelming sadness...it just hurts so fucking much. I'm so fucking scared I'll loose my job soon. My family needs my income. We have no ability to live if I lose it. Goddamnthis damn device was a gift from ym boss two years ago. They once loved me...I just don't know how...I guess I do know how I screwed this up. I did. It's been so hard...I'm so fucking scared. Ther emusr be something wrng...oh god why am I so stupid....damn if damn damn it....this is ridiculous, I feel like an attention whore on the Internet....I just haven't....I feel like I can't make the overwhelming feelings stop, the solutionis the deal withthe issue, the issue is me....sounds dumb but also logical....


God...you catch ten good breaths you wonder why your even still nothing to type....I feel like I need to apologize for even doing this on this subreddit, but what can I do. No friends, all family are either dependents or hate me....maybe I just need a few good hours. I'm so tired....damn, not in a bad way, I mean I'm still here...but goddamn wouldn't it be better....there is only so much fight in one person, only so many times I can forge ahead with blind optimism. I'm a smart guy right...,I'll figure it out....I'll find a way to live? What is the phrase...it feels like my whole brain is crying.....I think this is making me feel worse...making me want to die even more. I'm pishign send on this before I delete it
