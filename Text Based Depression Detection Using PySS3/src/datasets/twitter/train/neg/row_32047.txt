Nobody seems to understand.I have a fairly severe form of social anxiety. Some days I don't feel much. Today was just awful.

Few people understand. Have you ever woken up, knowing that today you were going to be afraid of your best friends and family for no reason? And that you could be feeling this way for weeks at a time? I feel like a handicapped citizen. I've watched hot people, ugly people, saints and bigots find genuine happiness. That is the worst pill I've had to swallow, that the only people who cannot find opportunity are the ones that cannot speak up.

Scratch that, one person understood. But I scared her off. Hard for two people with our problem to make conversation. There's less than a 1 percent chance I'll ever talk to her again.

Why can't I be content? Or happy? Or normal? Or successful? Or appreciated? Or brave? Or Anything? WHY CAN'T I BE ANYTHING? ANYTHING BUT AFRAID, AND DEPRESSED, AND SELF-LOATHING. UGLY, STUPID, NAIVE, WEAK. I CAN'T JUST TAKE WHAT I WANT. WHY CAN'T I KILL MYSELF? WHY DO I HAVE TO CARE ABOUT OTHERS? I DON'T WANT THIS ANYMORE. EVERY DAY IS JUST REGRET AND PAIN.
