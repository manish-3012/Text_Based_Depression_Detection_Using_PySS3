Constant suicidal ideationIâ€™ve been both depressed and suicidal since I was 11 (Iâ€™m now 21). Sometimes I felt a little better but Iâ€™ve never broken free from the feeling of depression weighing me down. I know itâ€™s not normal to want to die every day of your life but itâ€™s honestly become a part of who I am; everything I do, I feel the option and possibility of suicide, itâ€™s always there, wether it be in the back of my mind or if Iâ€™m actively thinking about it. Iâ€™d probably call it passive suicidal ideation. My anxiety is overwhelming, I can barely get up without a crushing sense of dread and helplessness washing over me. I try so hard, I really do, but Iâ€™m finding it harder and harder to stay. I just want to be free. I just want to be me.
