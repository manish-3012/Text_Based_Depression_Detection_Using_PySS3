I can't do this anymore, one last goodbyeI can't be like this anymore.
 
I pretend that I'm normal. I go to work. I work 8-4 like everybody else. But there's this everlasting sadness inside me. Some days it worse, but I still put up my shell towards people so they don't worry. I smile, I laugh, I crack jokes. 

But then I get home.

I just break down. Crying, smashing things, punching the wall. I don't know what to do. I just get overwhelmed with this hopelessness. I wish there was something I could do, but I've tried for too long.

The last time the knot untied. This time I made sure it's nice and tight. I guess this is my goodbye. 

I'm sorry for the times I let those near me down.
I'm sorry for not being normal.
I'm sorry for giving up so easily.
I'm sorry I can't take me anymore.

Goodbye and thanks for everything
