Iâ€™m never good enoughMy whole life Iâ€™ve been raised in competitive surroundings. Competitive household with my siblings, competitive high school with kids who were richer than me, competitive college with people who were smarter than me, competitive work where every made friends and Iâ€™m too socially awkward and â€œdifferentâ€ for not wanting to get drunk every night. 

Iâ€™m tired of competing. Iâ€™m tired of not being good enough. Iâ€™m so tired. I just want to disappear.
