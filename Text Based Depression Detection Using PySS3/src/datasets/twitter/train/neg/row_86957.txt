I avoided this for far too longI've been suicidal for the past six months. My thoughts took over me over that period of time. The single things that were keeping me from committing suicide were my dog and my sister. They're the only ones that I loved in this period of time and that I knew loved me back. Today, they proved me they don't. My sister took care of my dog for the past 3 months because I couldn't but I still can't. And I know that if I die my sister can take care of my dog. Two months ago, I promised my sister that I won't commit suicide while she's still alive. For her it was a joke but for me it's a really hard challenge. My dog attacked me today. I have never seen him like that before. My sister and I got into a fight. She didn't give a fuck about what I had to say. I'm just holding her back at this point. I don't see any reason not to kill myself anymore. I'm trying to find a reason but I really have no hope. I think I should do it. I probably won't go to sleep this night either. I'll probably try to find reasons not to do it and methods to do it. Maybe I'll even bring myself to finally end it. I guess I'll see tonight
