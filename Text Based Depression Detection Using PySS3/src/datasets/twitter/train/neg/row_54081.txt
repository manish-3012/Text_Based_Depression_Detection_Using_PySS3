Iâ€™m struggling trying to think of a reason to continue livingPeople always give small reasons, like finishing a book or waiting for a season finale of your favorite tv show, but I donâ€™t care about any of those things. 

I genuinely donâ€™t feel like I have any reason to live. Other people could take better care of my dogs than I can. My fiancÃ© just left me. I donâ€™t have any siblings. My mom lives across the country. 

Iâ€™ve been thinking for days and I canâ€™t come up with any reason to go on living.
