people are selfishNo one cares unless they can gain something, when youâ€™re dead itâ€™s social standing. Even on here whenever a woman posts redditors look and help them more since they think they can gain some fucking relationship and itâ€™s gross. Iâ€™m so sick of this shit. I have nothing to live for besides the faint hope of a miracle happening. And I have no clue what it is. I hate people. Not humans but society as a whole, god that sounds cringy. The selfishness and etc. my life is shit and I wish I knew what it was like to not want to end it. I remember my mother sending me to therapy when I was ten cause I told my autistic olderbrother I wanted to die and he just snitched cause he doesnâ€™t know how to care for someone. I also hate the people doing this shit for attention. There are people with everything and they canâ€™t just realize hey it could be worse. I think I could be poorer buts thatâ€™s the worst it could get. So many family members died cause of stupid fucking shit that wouldnâ€™t of happened if I was more privileged or my family was. No one Iâ€™ve ever talked to has had a family member shot or died in a stupid fucking accident or abused while in a wheelchair for their last years of their life. Iâ€™m fucking sick of this shit. Iâ€™m in my late teens and no other teen Iâ€™ve talked to dealt with anything like this. I canâ€™t vent outside of these shitty fucking rants or a stupid journal.
