No reason not to.I've been thinking seriously about Suicide for over a decade now. 

All I ever wanted was to have a family and settle down, but it didn't happen. I try to do other things, but they don't make me happy because it's not what I wanted. I'm halfway through a PhD because learning was just something to fill the time. I hate it. There's no point doing anything else because it won't make life worth it. 

Found out in January that I can't have kids. That means I can NEVER have the life I wanted. I'm alone, sick and deep in debt from the PhD so adopting ISN'T the option people keep telling me it is - like it's SO easy and SO obvious. 

All anyone says is THERE'S PLENTY OF TIIIIIIME!!!!! YOU HAVE YOUR WHOLE LIIIIIFFE! And I'm sick of it. Time has run out for me. I'm only going to get more sick. I've ended treatment because I don't want to prolong my life - I doubt it will kill me, but I don't want to drag it out. 

Suicide is ideal for me. No more pain. No more sickness. No more debt. No family to leave behind. No partner. No friends. Last time I was in hospital I was gone 4 days and nobody noticed. I've tried reaching out but nobody listens. They have partners and families and don't give a shit about those of us that weren't good enough. 

All I'm doing is using up time until I die - why prolong it? It just seems so much less wasteful to go now and be out of everyone's way.
