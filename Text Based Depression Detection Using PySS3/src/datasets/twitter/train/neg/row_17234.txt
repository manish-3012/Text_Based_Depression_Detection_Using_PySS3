It is quite weird.Before anything I want to say I'm not thinking about, you know, killing myself right now. No, it is quite weird. Some days (more constantly this past few weeks) I've gotten 1-2 hour rushes of "What if?" I suddenly notice she doesn't care, my classmates don't give two craps, I don't fit in anywhere and I get a sudden feeling of "What if I killed myself?" "I could do it any second.". I get so very anxious in the moment, mad, sad... Idk. then just today I feel quite happy about somethings. But then I realize I'm alone, staring at my computer, doing nothing and I get this weird feeling again. I must say, I realize I get like this for pretty dumb stuff but in the moment it is quite different. As well, I'm somewhat young and have a lot in future. Yet, sometimes I lose my sight and fall. What is up with me?
