I want to kill myself on my birthdayLook, Iâ€™m not going to but Jesus, it sounds great. Iâ€™m gonna be 25, and I just feel no future. Iâ€™ve made so many mistakes. I was so sick, so broken. And Iâ€™ve acknowledged those mistakes and have tried to grow but I just live with so much regret. I wish I had a time machine. I wish I could change my past, change the person I was and create a better person in the present. I work a job I canâ€™t stand, all the extracurriculars that I enjoy donâ€™t even bring me the joy they used to. Even my favorite movies and sports I can barely get any enjoyment out of. I feel soâ€¦empty.
