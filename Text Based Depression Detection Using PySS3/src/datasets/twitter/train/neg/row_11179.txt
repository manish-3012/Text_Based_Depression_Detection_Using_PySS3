I don'y know why but I never prepare for things the way I should. I am going to fail a test and probably wont graduate at the end of this. I put a belt around my neck and choked myself to see how it felt if I was going to die. Never have I been more depressed.I rather kill myself than see my family's disappointment in me I want to die.
