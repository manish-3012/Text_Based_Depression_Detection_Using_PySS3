ExhaustedIâ€™m so tired. Iâ€™m not sleeping properly, Iâ€™m not eating properly. There was a huge family emergency so Iâ€™ve been missing work. 

Iâ€™m moving soon, and supposed to be planning a wedding. It feels like everything is just stacking up and up and up and itâ€™s about to fall right on top of me. 

I canâ€™t talk to anyone about it, because itâ€™s not as important as anything else thatâ€™s going on. Iâ€™m terrified to see yet another therapist, and meds are incredibly difficult. 

Iâ€™m at a loss, and i know ending things would be easier for me to handle. Iâ€™ve gotten close before but whimped out, but now Iâ€™m not sure I even have the strength to stay anymore
