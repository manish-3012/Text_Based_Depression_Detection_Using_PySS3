I wish I killed myself before this decade startedI had my chance but I decided for some reason I would proceed with my plan to be successful this year. Part of my path to success was finding a job to fund myself into the success I want. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m getting a job even though Iâ€™m being considered for an interview by a ups store. Now  Iâ€™m regretting my decision to stay alive because this year has been a disaster and disappointment. I just suck period. Iâ€™m ugly. Iâ€™m stupid, the only way I can live a decent life is by throwing my dreams in a trash can and going to college to live a lame lonely adult life. I think Iâ€™m just going to kill myself right now
