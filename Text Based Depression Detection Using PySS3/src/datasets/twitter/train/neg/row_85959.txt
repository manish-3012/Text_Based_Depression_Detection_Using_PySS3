The World isn't EnoughWe all had this idea of perfection in our minds. I have experienced many different states of consciousness. I now believe or have the idea that death is a crossroad, or the step before rebirth into another state of consciousness. Quite like how different species grow out of their shells as they grow. When we die our Consciousness expands and grows out expanding beyond our human body. What we leave behind is a shell like a snake.  Accept this growth is into a whole different paradigm.  This is what I think is possible. I have outgrown my human shell and I desire to expand beyond the limitations of it. The shell of my old self is is rotting within this old paradigm.  It is painful and I belong somewhere else.  I don't belong here anymore.  I have decoded much of the mysteries of this reality, it's  numerical source code and the meaning of life is hidden in plain sight.  I want off this rock and I'm ready to face what comes next. Whether it be permanent death, another dimension of consciousness, another human life.  Whatever.  This labyrinth of my life here in the world is a dead end.  No pun intended.
