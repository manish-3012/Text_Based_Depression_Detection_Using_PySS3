This seems to be different from all my other postsI've told my story in previous posts. Unlike those other times, it's not a suicidal breakdown where I'm on standby to die. I'm just posting here to ground myself before I get there. I just feel shitty. It's good to vent. Even if not in detail, it's just nice to let others know my feelings before I get overwhelmed by them. In the small chance that people have been following my story, which I doubt, I'd just like to let them know that I'm doing much better now. I haven't attended therapy or gone to a psychiatrist or anything, I just decided one day that If I want to live the rest of my life being at least content, I'll have to try for it. Thanks for reading and letting me shed the exterior of my emotions off. It feels good to.
