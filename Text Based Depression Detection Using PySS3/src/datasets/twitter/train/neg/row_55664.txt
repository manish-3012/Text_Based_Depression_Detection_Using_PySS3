ive set a date2019 was the worst year for me and ever since then things just keep going downhill. i constantly have to fake my emotions and conform to others expectations.
I either feel so much pain or nothing at all. I no longer have negative thoughts towards death. On my 22nd birthday ill be gone. feels like a weight being taken off of my chest finally telling someone about this.
