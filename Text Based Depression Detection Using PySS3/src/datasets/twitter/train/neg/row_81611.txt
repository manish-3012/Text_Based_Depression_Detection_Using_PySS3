I'm sad about how much i eat. Then i eat more.I'm to lazy to do anything about it. People tell me I'm still growing but im 16 now and nothing has changed. I feel like garbage. Nothing makes me feel happy other then music and my dog. Moved schools lost all my friends and let my self go. Want to just fucking blow my brains out. Im just a fat, anxiety filled wreck. How did you guys deal with this shit. Don't know how much more i can take of this.
