If I get fired tomorrow I'm ending my lifeTo put it very simply, I landed a job that pays very well that represents the one chance I will ever have of possibly escaping the fucking horrible person I am. 

However, I've fallen below their standards because I am a worthless fuck up who can not get over their anxiety enough to do a simple job and I know in my gut tomorrow is going to be the day I get fired.

This was my only chance at maybe being a little happy.  I haven't self harmed in over a year but tonight I need to fucking bleed because I deserve it for sabotaging myself again. 

Tomorrow if I get the bad news I am getting blackout drunk and then throwing myself from a bridge.  I will never be the person I want to be. This was it, this was my last chance.
