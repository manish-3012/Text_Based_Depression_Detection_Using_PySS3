People say things get better, but it's not like I'm ever going to stop hating myselfI'm sure that any problem I have with college, trying to find a job, or relationships is temporary, but I hate myself and I always have. I hate this depression, I hate how ugly I am, I hate how shy I am, I hate how scared of everything I am, I hate the random rage fits I have. There's nothing that I like about myself. And why should I expect that to change? I can't just get rid of all these flaws, they're all part of me. I hate myself more than anything on this planet. Every day I imagine taking a bunch of pills and ODing, but I don't have any to do it with.

I genuinely can't see why people like me. Like I have close friends who really like me and I have no idea why. I suck.
