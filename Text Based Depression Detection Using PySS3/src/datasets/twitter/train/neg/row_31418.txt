Hoping for a compelling reason not to pull the trigger.i find the hardest thing about existing as a human being in todays world is knowing that at the end of the day we are more insignificant than a grain of sand. that everything that is ''us'' and will ever be resides in 4 types of grey tissue that is our brain. that anyone can die but it takes courage and persveirence to live. once i myself dies you all become nothing, everything that ever was and ever will be dies with me. and nobody will ever view the world exactly as my brain did. my mortality is what i can always count on, i can die young or old it doesnt matter because i can never truly know when it will happen, without any hope of ever knowing when or why i will die i have to assume it will be the very next second. i also find myself in awe sometimes knowing that all 19 years of my life, every single memory i have, every single brain function, mucscle movement, test score, paycheck, i have ever made can all be made entirely irrellavent with one well placed bullet, i dont know wether to live my life or end it all before i find myself anymore dissapointed in my own species and my sorry existence. i still cant beleive we humans havent found a way for us all to live exactly equal in a  classless, stateless system based on common ownership and free-access, superabundance and maximum freedom for individuals to develop their own capacities and talents. i dont think thats asking for to much, weve had thousands of years to get it right by now. im tired of being owned by my posessions and other people emotions im either going to start living my life for nothing but my own happiness or im going to end it with a hollow point. at this point it could go either way. i just wanted to get some insight from outside non-biased people before i make my choice
