Just want to end it all.I got to know my father has started drinking again. He beats my mom. My mom on the otger hand has taken alot of debt. Everyday loan sharks call me . The one person I loved left me. I was suffering from depression because of this and she said she couldn't take it. I have already tried 5 suicide attempts. My friends also left me. I don't feel like I beling anywhere. I think I'll never be accepted. I think I am different from everyone. I have never been this low. I feel so broken. I feel completely shattered. This pain is too much. I don't have money to go to a therapist. It seems so hopeless. Powerless. I just want to end it all.
