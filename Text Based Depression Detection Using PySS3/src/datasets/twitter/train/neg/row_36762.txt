Iâ€™m 20 years old and going to be homeless tomorrow. Why am I even here?Like I said in 12 hours Iâ€™m not going to have a home anymore. I work a shitty job at subway making minimum wage where I have yet to hear 1 thank you from anyone employee or otherwise the only thing I hear is how much of a fuck up I am. I have a girlfriend but we donâ€™t talk that much since I work nights Iâ€™m asleep when sheâ€™s up. I was living with my mom still which is fucking humiliating since Iâ€™m 2 years past the time I was supposed to be out of here and she told me to leave in the morning because I wanted my nephew to get out of my room so I could sleep after I got home and wouldnâ€™t let him play my Xbox. I canâ€™t live with anyone else because no one but my girlfriend would accept me there and she lives with her parents who I wonâ€™t be a burden to. I donâ€™t have a car to live in and if I died I would finally get to see my grandparents again if there even is an afterlife. Why the hell am I still alive when as far as Iâ€™m aware Iâ€™m an homeless idiot with no ambition who no one values or cares about?
