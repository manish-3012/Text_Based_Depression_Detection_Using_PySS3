[NSFW] I masturbated to a bestiality video once when I was high on cannabisI don't know why I did it. I kinda brushed it off as a weird thing I did while high, but it's starting to haunt me. I would not do it while sober and I don't have the intention to. I am a vegan and a feminist, so I'm against all kinds of abuse against women and animals. I feel dirty, like I've harmed someone. People tend to tell me I'm a good person who wouldn't be capable of hurting somebody, but I feel like a fraud because of this. I imagine myself getting into a relationship and the other person never knowing I did something that sick; people I get into relationships with tend to think very highly of me, so I would feel like the biggest fraud. Do I deserve forgiveness?
