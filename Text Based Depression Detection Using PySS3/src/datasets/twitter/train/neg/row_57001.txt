I don't want to exist anymoreI've attempted multiple before when I younger but it never worked so I gave up and I just feel like I'm trapped and forced to stay alive.  I hate this. I just want to go away and just disappear. I feel like my entire existence is just a giant ball of bad luck. 

I hate being stuck in my city, I hate living with my family, but I have no choice, I'm stuck in a college I never wanted to go to, I have nothing to live for besides my cat and he's getting old. I just gave away a feral cat that I bonded with, I looked forward to hanging out with her when I came home, they both gave me a reason to wake up, they made me happy. Now I don't know what to, I have tubs of food left for her that my cat won't eat, I feel so sad every time I look out my window and she's not there waiting. I hate feeling shitty everyday. I just wish I was never born, there's no point in living but I just can't bring myself to go through with it. I've felt like this since I was a kid and it sucks, I hate forcing myself to live.
