I have no value to societySociety is engineered to push people like me to the edges. I do not have value to people and that can never change.

Therapy is useless, as it cannot change the reality of the world. I am very deeply bothered by the way the world conducts itself and what humans value. I will never be content with my place in this world. It's insane that it's considered a sign of mental illness that I don't want to live as an unattractive poor person in a world that views me as scum. We only pretend suicide isn't a good thing because valued people sometimes kill themselves (attractive, rich or talented people). The reality is humans low-key promote suicide constantly.

If you're ugly, you have bad genetics. If you have bad genetics, you're making the human race worse just by existing. People want you to commit suicide because your death makes the human race stronger. That's why people mock ugly people so much. Making the ugly people kill themselves is the entire point. This applies for all traits that we have decided are socially acceptable to mock (bald, fat, small dicks etc).
