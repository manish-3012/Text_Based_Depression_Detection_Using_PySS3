Need advice or help or somethingIâ€™ve alienated almost everyone I know through years of shitty behavior/me being an addict and pretending to not give a fuck.

Now, Iâ€™ve wasted multiple attempts at going to school, potential friendships and relationships, and feel like I have next to 0 potential of living a meaningful life. Is it possible that itâ€™s not worth the hard work itâ€™s going to take in order to fix things? I donâ€™t know. I want to just cut my loses and end it already
