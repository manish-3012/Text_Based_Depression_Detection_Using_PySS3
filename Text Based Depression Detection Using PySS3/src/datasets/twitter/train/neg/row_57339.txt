Dreaming about ex making me relapseHello 

Last couple days I've been dreaming about my ex non stop we broke up in December and it's been 6 months and I was doing ok for a while then bam it's all coming back .

She moved on 1 month after the break up (rebound) and I feel like I'm back how I was before. 

1 scare turned into 8 and now I dont kneo what to do. 

I hope everyday I get a text from her and that shes broken up. 

Everything reminds me of her and our memories together.  

I'm blocked on all socials and phone number but with my spare account I can still see her face and on fb I still see some old comments and statues on her wall.

I am talking to other women but they aren't bringing me happiness. 

I dont go to therapy or consoling bc I know I'll end up being sedated. Or change by taking medication. 

I know its dumb to kill yourself over a women bc theres always someone else. 

But for me shes my only love. 

I'm not going to do anything at the moment , I read that post about that one user getting doxed so I'm minding my words here. 

Please don't dox me in anyway I can't have my mother finding out about how feeling nor do I want local authorities knocking at my door. 

I'm writing this to vent out feelings and I hope you know that atm I'm not gonna do anything
