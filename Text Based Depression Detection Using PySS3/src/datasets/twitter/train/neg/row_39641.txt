Just started paying attention to sub-reddits like r/SuicideWatch.After being an "active" Redditor for over a year, I believe it's time for me to try and give back to this community and help any hardships its people encounter over the course of their lives. I hope to really make an impact on someone else's life, and well. If you have any troubles, and are in need of help, please send a message my way. I will try to do my best to help you out.
