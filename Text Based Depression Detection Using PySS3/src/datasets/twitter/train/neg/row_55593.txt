Almost jumped off my balcony yesterday since my dad was very angry with me.i'm glad I didn't but it just lingers in my head "Suicide". When I'm angry or sad, I always think that but I know I'll go to hell if I do. I really don't want to but it makes me so sad and mad at the same sad. I don't know what to do.
