Why can't I just get on with things?I'm in my 4th year of engineering and I think I have been depressed for at least the last 2 years. The last time I went to bed happy was in 1st year, all i remember is the feeling of contentment I dont remember why i was happy. I have coped the last couple of years by sleeping until the pm and getting drunk 3 times a week. Recently college work has been piled on even though i sit down to do work, I achieve nothing. All this sitting in front of a desk does is allow me to ponder how useless I am. I have a good group of friends who help me with college but they dont know I feel this way. I have thought about killing myself but never planned it seriously I just hope i die in my sleep. 

I want to succeed but I won't help/allow myself.
