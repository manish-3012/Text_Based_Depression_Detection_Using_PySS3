I need helpI'm 14(m) my mom and little brother are going to a hotel this weekend I will be home alone and I am very tempted to end my own life. I am truly alone in this world. I want a gf but no girl wants to talk to me or be into the same stuff as me or even go through anything I have. I have 1 "friend" but he is an asshole I really want a good gf and friends. Lots of other stuff has happened in my life and I really need a good friend or gf to vent to but I cant. I am truly alone in this world except for my music. I just want the pain to stop.
