No faith left in humanityI decided when I woke up today that normalizing and rationalizing my suicide makes it okay, and removing the social stigma of suicide makes me hate myself less. 

I'm a masters student and I'm going to complete my degree in 14 days. 

My dad died over Christmas break, he was absent my entire life and he had the most brutal slow death. We made our amends, but there's so much that my family doesn't know about me. 

I was sexually abused when I was 4-6 years old by my older male cousins, I went on to be a drug dealing violence thief; became an addict and alcoholic.  I've been to jail, I'm pansexual. I'm First Nations and Greek...so I'm not native enough for the natives, and I'm not white enough for the white kids. I'm supposed to go away to treatment after grad, but it can't come fast enough. 

Every day in this society is torture. I have no faith left in humanity: people are inherently greedy and there is no genuine goodness anywhere. 

I'm a drug addict alcoholic who fucked someone at my dads funeral. On Jan 5 I did some meth and got a bottle of whiskey then decided to drive my Audi A4 around my city in the snow and ice. I got airborn and wrecked my car, fled the scene. Left my drugs in the car, had to lawyer up and burned the remaining funds in my savings account. 

I have nothing left and this world will be a much better place without me in it. I'll travel to the US if I can attain a gun in order to shoot myself. What do you recommend I do? I hate myself and that'll never change.
