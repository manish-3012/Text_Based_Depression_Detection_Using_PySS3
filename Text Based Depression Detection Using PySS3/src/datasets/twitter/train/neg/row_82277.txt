I don't think I'm depressed.They keep raising my dosage or trying different meds, but it's all the same. I still enjoy playing games and talking with friends. I still have an appetite and a sexdrive. I just feel like all of this points to me not being depressed. 

Doesn't this mean that my wish for suicide is justified? If it's confirmed I'm in my right of mind when making the decision to kill myself then who can be sad? It's not fair that other people's lives are affected by my own. 

Why does nobody trust me? I want to sleep so badly, I just keep staying up later and later. Why do humans hate suicide? Even religions say it's punishable with hell. I don't understand why we feel obligated to keep each other alive. It's 5am right now and I just want to go to sleep. 

I'm trying to figure out the most unobtrusive way to kill myself. We can't discuss methods here though so I won't talk about it. 

I used to not want to suffer when I killed myself but that has changed recently. I want to cry and scream when I die. I want to be torn apart and forced to watch. I want to have all my instincts tell me to survive, to run, and for me to fight it. I want to die terrified.

My friend broke up with his girlfriend recently. I feel like he's more upset about it than he lets on. I really want to help him but I don't know how.
