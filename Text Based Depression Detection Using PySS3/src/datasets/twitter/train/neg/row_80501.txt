I want my death to be an eventI want everyone to be shocked when they find out I've taken my life.

I want images of my hanging body to shock people.

I want everyone who ever bullied me for my weight and cuts to start harming themselves.

I want all the girls that rejected me to puke from crying so hard.

I want my friends to realise what kind of effects their invalidation of my feelings had on me.

But all this is a mere dream. In reality, people will just be a little sad for a few hours then move on.

Laugh and the world laughs with you, weep and you weep alone.
