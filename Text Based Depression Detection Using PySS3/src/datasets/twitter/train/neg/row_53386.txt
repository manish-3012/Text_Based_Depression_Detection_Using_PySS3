This is going to be long and confusing so prepare for a shit showI don't use Reddit that much, but why not give it a shot. 

 I feel useless. My friends don't need me, I have never played a big role in their lives like they had to me. I wan't to tell them about what I am feeling, but I cant. I would look like a pussy. I also make fun of suicidal people with them, so that would make me look like a hypocrite. I am such an asshole. I make fun of people all the time for shits and giggles.

 If I tell my friends that I feel suicidal, they might think I am a emo, even though I am not. Like I said, I am a bully and I feel bad about it, but I get satisfaction from making people sad. For instance there was this kid at school who posted a video about himself drinking a shit ton. This kid was bullied enough already and has tried to kill himself before. So anyway, I go up to him and I say, " Why the fuck are you drinking and posting that shit on your story?" and he says " It is either I get drunk and high or I end it." then I said " Well fucking end it.". I walked away with a smile on my face, I felt good for trashing a kid and I don't know why. I used to mess with my friends to in a bad way. I would lie and try to manipulate them so I could feel smart, so I can say that I started all this drama, but in reality all this would do was make me more delusional. That is a problem I have now, I cant tell if what I am thinking and feeling about others is true?

I wan't to kill myself, but I wan't to see what the future holds. Then again, no one cares about me. I am a piece of shit. You know I spent 3 years trying to be friends with this one guy. Even though he doesn't care about me I would do anything to be friends with him. It will never happen and I am wasting my time as well as yours. 

Anyway to summarize I like to bully people and no one likes me, but I am to much of a bitch to kill myself. No one probably finished reading this, I am useless even on Reddit.
