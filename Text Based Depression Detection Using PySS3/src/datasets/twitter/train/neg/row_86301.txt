If life is only supposed to get worse the older I get, I should just end it when my life is supposed to be "carefree"I'm a teenager and I've heard that I should enjoy these times because it only gets worse. My life isn't the greatest right now, dealing with Depression, anxiety, Loneliness, etc. So it doesn't help that people say life is just going to get worse. 

If things are only supposed to get worse the older I get, I should just do it before then because I don't believe I'll be able to take it.
