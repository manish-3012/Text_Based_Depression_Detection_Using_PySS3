How I constantly feelI keep thinking that my time is limited. I fantasize about 2 different suicide scenarios... alcohol and sleeping pills, or ordering cyanide salt and drinking it (I know we can't talk about methods too much). I can't stop thinking about these. It's been a couple years since I've been very depressed, about 9 months since I've started staying in bed excessively. I have no desire to do anything, including fixing my situation. I'm going to run out of money eventually and then I will be forced to sell the house, a process which literally terrorizes me, given how little energy I have to do anything.

Suicide is the ultimate avoidance for me now. The ultimate relief of my constant anxiety. Preventing me from perhaps becoming homeless.

My parents once offered to let me go there, but they're getting up there now. They're in physical pain themselves. They don't need me coming back at 44 fucking years old.

Why can't I just die already?

I've posted along these lines before, I know. I can't fucking keep this to myself, it's too much. I can't tell my parents, they don't understand depression and I don't want to scare them. I am scared to say too much to my Dr. in case I get sent to the hospital involuntarily. Same with a hotline. But maybe that's what I need, I don't know. But then do I want to get better and keep living this shitty life? I'm tired of this.
