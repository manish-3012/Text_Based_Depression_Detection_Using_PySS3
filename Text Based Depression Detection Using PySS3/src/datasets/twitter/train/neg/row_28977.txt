I tried to kill myself recentlyIt didnâ€™t work out. 

I donâ€™t know who Iâ€™m telling this to but I need to get it out. 

I donâ€™t know if I didnâ€™t take enough pills, or if the blade didnâ€™t cut deep enough, but Iâ€™m still here. And I donâ€™t know what to do. 

Iâ€™ve struggled with suicidal thoughts since I was 10 but never really acted on them. I had enough to stop me, school, uni, etc. But shit got bad, I said my goodbyes, and I tried to kill myself. And then I woke up. 

I woke up in my bed, my phone ringing with a scared friend on the line. I woke up angry that I was still alive. I was so fucking angry at the dried blood on my wrist and bitter taste in my mouth. And I donâ€™t know what to do. 

Iâ€™m medicated, I smile at my friends and family, and I think about killing myself every day. Every fucking day I have to fight this losing battle against my own desperation to end my life.
