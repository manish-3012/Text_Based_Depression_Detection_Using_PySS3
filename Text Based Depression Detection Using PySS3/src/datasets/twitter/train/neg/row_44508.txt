20f, in college, crippling anxiety, donâ€™t know what to doI have a very run of the mill â€œI donâ€™t know what to do with my life, and I have no hopeâ€ story. I know itâ€™s kind of a standard thing for many college kids, but the fact that this is a shared experience doesnâ€™t really change things for me. I hate college, but I know if leave I will feel even shittier doing nothing with my life. I come from a broken home, and weâ€™ve been financially struggling since my parents got divorced. Iâ€™ve gone to therapy, started lexapro, I exercise daily, yet I hate life. I feel hopeless. I know itâ€™s supposed to get worse before it gets better, but I donâ€™t care. I donâ€™t abide by any religions, so I donâ€™t know if I believe god can save me from this sadness. I donâ€™t expect life to get better either. Everyone in my family has mental issues that they will probably never get help for. My anxieties and depressive thoughts feel inescapable. I donâ€™t know what happiness is anymore. I know Iâ€™m young, and there is so much time ahead of me, but that thought is almost dreadful to me because I know Iâ€™ll waste that time somehow. There is so much pressure on me to succeed in our family, and Iâ€™m scared I wonâ€™t. Iâ€™m scared I wonâ€™t find a job after graduation, Iâ€™m scared I wonâ€™t find love. Iâ€™m scared I wonâ€™t have any friends left because they all found better people. I have an amazing support system right now, but it all feels so deeply rooted in my biology and who I am. I am an anxious and depressed person. I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™ll ever escape that.
