I need help.I'm 27, suffered from extreme depression and anxiety my entire life. I attempted suicide about three years ago and still haven't recovered. I've been unemployed for those three years and picked up an alcohol problem along the way.

I still live with my parents and spend my days sitting in front of my computer 24/7. I need dental and physical therapy but can't afford it so I'm in constant pain.

Enrolled in college and dropped out within the first month. The few friends I have left emigrated. The future is bleak and I'm considering killing myself tonight.
