I was planning to kill myself tonightThe social isolation was getting to me. I had surgery 2 months ago, I was supposed to be getting back to my normal life by now but this stupid virus prevented that. My social life basically hasn't changed since I have been isolated. To quote another redditor "you call it quarantine, I call it Tuesday". That realisation almost destroyed me, and probably still will. I ultimately decided to give antidepressants another go (for anxiety). I'm not sure if it will help.
