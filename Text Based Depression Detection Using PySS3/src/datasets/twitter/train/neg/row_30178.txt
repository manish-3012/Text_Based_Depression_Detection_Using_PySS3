Suicidal depressionLately Iâ€™ve been talking like Iâ€™m leaving and itâ€™s concerning to me. Iâ€™m content with dying yesterday and I want to go. Iâ€™m happy which is the funny part, I have and alright life but Iâ€™m tired. Everyday I wake up is another day Iâ€™m forcing myself to get through. I love what I bring to the table for people but itâ€™s just not enough for myself. I have no idea why I feel this way. Not today but one day.
