I think I'm doneI'm 52 and have been battling depression for over 20 years. I've been on a ton of different meds. Some worked for a little while others did nothing. Been in therapy on and off for about 15 years. It's great talking but when it's over I don't feel any better. I'm now doing ECT as a last resort. The memory issues suck but the general anesthesia is awesome.

The only reason I'm still around are my 2 kids. 16 and 20. I know they are going to suffer. I feel so friggin bad about that. But it's no longer enough to keep me here.

I've planned the day and method. Maybe between now and then I can find some peace knowing my pain and suffering will finally end. Like it did for my younger brother. I don't believe it at all but it would be cool to see him again.

No idea why I wrote this. Not a cry for help, just a goodbye.

I hope you all find some peace and happiness while still breathing.

Goodbye and good luck.
