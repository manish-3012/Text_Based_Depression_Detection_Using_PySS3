This sub has become my home where I check daily regardless of how I am feeling, start my day with it and end my day with it.I guess it helps to see people like me here whenever I check. People that have their own reasons for ending it. People that might have similar problems like me. I am not a positive person. This post isn't positive either. I will eventually kill myself one day, and that is one thing I am pretty sure about. It would mostly be around 25, I am 22 now. Coming here daily gives me a bit of energy sometimes, not to feel better, but to just hang on, or just have breakdowns alone. I can't cry. Life, bonds, everything is worthless in the end and will cease to exist. Life may disappoint me, but I disappoint myself, so that's okay. I hope I get some disease, or I die in some accident on my way. Its funny because these thoughts never leave me. If I am feeling okay at any moment, and I am given a chance, to just give up on my life, erase anything related to me and my existence and me from memories of people, I know I would choose that 100%. I am sick, too sick in my mind.
