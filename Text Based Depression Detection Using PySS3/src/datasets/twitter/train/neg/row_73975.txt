Does anyone else hate it when people randomly say, "It's okay, it's going to be all right"?I have seen lots of posts on instagram, Twitter, etc like, "This is a gentle reminder that everything would be just fine, keep breathing." and other "quotes" similar to this sentence. Maybe I'm just scrolling down my feed, looking at memes, distracting myself from what is going on inside my head but suddenly someone decided to put this "gEntLe rEminDer". It really annoys. Does these kind of posts really help anyone? Does these give them hope?
If yes, I'll definitely stop hating the posts because even if a single person feels safe after reading them, I'll know there purpose is served.
