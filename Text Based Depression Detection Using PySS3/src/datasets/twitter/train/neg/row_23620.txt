Just got off the phone with suicide hotline for my best friend who is thinking about suicide.It was the worst 30 mins of my life im still shaking and crying.


my best friend has been telling me he wants to die for the last 2 months but the last 3 days he has described how he knows where his mums gun is and might do it when im at work since his mum works at the same time.

Hes saying things like

"Look, you told me to tell you if it gets to this point. I think I'm gonna try something when she's at work this week.

I was thinking maybe I'd take a bunch of tylenol and ibuprofen, then knock myself out with benadryl. Perfect OD and can't be saved if after 4 hours. That's something I came up with while "thinking" today. Tylenol kills the liver so even if you manage to survive the overdose you'll get sepsis quickly, and ibuprofen causes kidney damage and internal bleeding. Medical knowledge sure is handy."

Just now he said he got his new oxygen tank and also said "That's another way to die. Oxygen is extremely flammable. I can just put that on and open the oven. Lungs burn instantly.
Medical knowledge. Yay"

I'm the only person he talks to and we have an honest and open friendship.
He doesn't talk to his mum because apparently, she is a weird person and he won't talk to any helpline because he doesn't want to talk to random people.

I'm getting really scared and I also live in another country he lives in the states I live in New Zealand.

This is starting to affect me mentally since my dad also had bad depression this month as well and this is becoming to much for me...
