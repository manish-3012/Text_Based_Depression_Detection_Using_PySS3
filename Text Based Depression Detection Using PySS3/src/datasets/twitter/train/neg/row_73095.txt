Need some help for someoneHey fellows,

I just happen to hang out on a video game with someone sayign over and over again that he will kill himself tomorrow, trying to help him atm but I really struggle to help him (trying to stay away from advice and letting him talk). He is closing more and more, have strong nihilist views (nothing matters, why bother) without the nice side of it. 

Could anyone help me help him? 

Cheers,
CM
