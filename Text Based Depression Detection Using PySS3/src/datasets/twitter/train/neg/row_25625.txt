I attempted suicidefew days ago I attempted suicide and my biggest wish is that I didn't survived. Is so painful to live in this constant state of thinking and hearing voices and telling them to shut the fuck up, I hate so much the feeling of being alive and can't describe the hell it's going on inside me and how this have been killing me for years.

Even after this event I feel like nothing changed, nothing. I keep putting a smile in my disgusting face and cracking stupid and unfunny jokes all the time which only my Mom "laughs", I don't know what to think anymore, I don't know what to feel anymore sometimes I just want to cry but I can't, I simply can't and it hurts so badly, sometimes I just want the people I love around but it seems it's all going to hell. It seems I never learn, it seems I stay at the same place everytime and nothing changes, my vision about people and this whole world never changes and it will never will. I feel so disgusted in being alive and being me, for being so useless, for giving too much of myself. 

Maybe in the future, when I'm older and when I truly understand the pain of being alive I'll attempt it again but I will make sure that this time works. Maybe all the pain I've gone through as a kid, all the violence towards woman, all the bully, all the bad influence, all the fights, all the begging for helps ain't nothing. Maybe I'm just another 16 years old who thinks that knows shit when doesn't.


I'm sorry if there's any misspelling or gramatical errors. English is not my first language but I feel like I can open about anything when I'm speaking in another language.
