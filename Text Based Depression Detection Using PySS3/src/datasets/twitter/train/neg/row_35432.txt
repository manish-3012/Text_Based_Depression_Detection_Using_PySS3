I'm going to disappearTitle says it all. 
I'm filled with shame and self-loathing. I can barely talk to friends anymore.  To try and describe how i feel is futile, really. I mumble and walk about doing the same kinds of things each day hoping something might end up different. Gonna buy a gun and find some place where nobody will find me.
