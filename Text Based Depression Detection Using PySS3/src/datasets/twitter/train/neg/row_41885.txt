Drunk, retinitis, aloneSince I was a kid (15 years old) I been drinkin. Later I got married, wife cheated on my ass. When I was married I quit drinking. I checked my eyes and I have retinitis. I got a divorce I meet another gal, I lost her for been drunk....

Today Im broken, my heart crushed and only thinking Im going to be blind. My relief is drink to the maximum and pull the trigger.
