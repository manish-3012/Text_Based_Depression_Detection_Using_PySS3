I'm an idiot.My bestfriend had just gone through one of the worst break ups in his life, I told him it'll be fine. 1month later he overdoses on opioids.

He's been wanting to hang out and talk before this whole mess, but all I did was shut him down. He said he was lonley and i said go on tinder or go to the bar and meet some people... what the fuck was I thinking? He made it so obvious yet I was so blind and stupid to notice he just needed a friend around to talk to.

I'm extremly relieved to announce that he's still alive and that theres a 2nd chance at life for him. I don't think i'll ever be able to understand the feelings he had for this girl or the pain he's going through, but i'll do everything that i can to be there for my best bud and to listen to him. 

If theres any advice yall could give me for dealing with this, it would be much appreciate it. I really am a idiot...
