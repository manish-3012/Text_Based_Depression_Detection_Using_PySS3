Worst year of my life, the thought of death is the only thing that brings me true happinessYou can only go so long with no friends, girl or anyone who cares about you before you slip into a state of suicidal thoughts every day.

I'm In that place rn, no one gives a fuck no one cares to come out and the person that did has just ruined everything.

I can't say I'm gonna die now but I will definitely die in a couple of years, I'm a failure never even had a gf or kissed before. Never had a true friend who I could trust.

Always been the person to get used by others, got nothing to look forward to and I'm over it all.

Knowing I can put an end to all my worries and suffering honestly makes me smile. I know how twisted that sounds but I have nothing keeping me here.

People always say it gets better but from my experience it doesn't, it's been like this for years.
