Emptyi feel really empty and lonely most of the time. i can't really connect with people and if i try to reach out my efforts get rejected. im constantly jealous of people who can have relationships. i really want to be loved and im tired of hearing the same old happy go lucky bullshit like "it gets better!" or "youll find someone soon!" it's been too damn long since i've actually had a "relationship". i always end up getting left for someone else. i don't feel good. its been years since i've felt something. its always me who gets hurt in the end. im awkward and bitter and self loathing. i want this shit to end, im tired of waiting. i hate being alone, its suffocating. i might as well just die. thanks for reading i guess
