A really dumb reason to commit suicideAlmost two years ago I read a blog post. The author said some things that I found were really hurtful. When I and others tried to explain how hurtful his post was, the author said that we were being selfish and should feel ashamed for feeling hurt. I cried so much that day. And I never stopped.

I still think about that blog. The author has said other hurtful things, but not as bad as the one I described. Sometimes I fantasize about getting revenge on the author. Sometimes I physically hurt myself as a way of getting revenge (dumb right?) But other times I consider committing suicide as a way to escape the author who believes these hurtful things and just posts it on the internet to mock people like me.

This is a really dumb reason to commit suicide. This guy's blog is only one part of the internet, and there are so many nicer places I could visit. I have a friends and family who love me. And my material needs are taken care of. It's a great life. I shouldn't throw it away because of one mean guy one the internet. That's why I won't commit suicide.
