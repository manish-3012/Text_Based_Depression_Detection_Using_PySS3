Whatâ€™s the fucking pointI got plastered tonight, and seeing that Chadwick Boseman is dead just really hit it on the head. Whatâ€™s the point of living? Iâ€™m alone in a different city from my family and Iâ€™m totally isolated. Nobody gives a fuck about me and realistically all I do is work to pay bills so Iâ€™m not homeless. I just watch tv when I finish work and thatâ€™s it. Whatâ€™s the point? Why keep on living? Sorry Iâ€™m super drunk right now and it just got me thinking about why I should still be alive.
