ByeSo, I guess this is it. I don't really feel as sad as I thought I would. I always knew I would go out in the woods down the street, weird. Don't know why I'm even typing this. Sorry to waste your time.

I'm sorry to my little one to leave you. But you're better off without me just like everyone else is. 

I'm sorry to anyone that ever had the displeasure of knowing me.

Also, thanks Trent Reznor for making my life a little less miserable and making me feel a little less alone. You helped me more than anyone else ever did.


Bye
