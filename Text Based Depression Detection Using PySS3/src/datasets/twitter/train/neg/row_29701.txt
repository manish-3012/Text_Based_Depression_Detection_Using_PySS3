I feel more alive in dreams.I think life is really an honor to get as a gift but when it comes to me, I realise that everything is so blurred out and I would love to give my life away to somebody else because to me I just don't feel alive I don't study well I don't participate in social activities I am separated from people i dont hang out with friends i dont talk much not even to my family because nobody seems to understand me and each time I try to say I am not okay like everybody tells me to do I just get pushed further and further away into the hole in which it gets harder then to get up the more I try. I want to be free from this constant knot in my stomach I am constantly scared of something or worried about something and I do get days where I feel motivated like "hell yes today is the day I am gona stop giving a fuck' and it's great until 1 hour later when I realise I am still the same person that just tried to fit in but can't.  And I am always there for people because that's who I am I am a giver not a taker I am a forgiver not someone who will revangen you and I get taken advantage of so much , but I don't mind because my heart just feels that's what I deserve if people are hurting and I am in their life than its probably my fault even if it isn't I will blame myself I wasnt there. I wish I could end my life, but at the same time I am a coward for me If there was a wish one wish than it would be for God to wait until I fall asleep and trap me in those good dreams I feel alive in while I never wake up again. I am sorry if some of you find this stupid I understand it's just something I wanted to share to see if anybody feels the same.
