I wish I had the fucking ballsI hate my life. I hate fucking being alive. I say these things to myself all the time every single day. I want to be fucking dead already. Every day I tell myself I'm going to do it. Yet every day I don't. I don't know if I'm too lazy or too much of a coward, but I wish I would push myself to just fucking do it already. Every day is nothing but fucking suffering and pain I need an exit. I wish I was gone already. I wish I had the strength to push myself to do it already. I can't fucking take this shit anymore. I just want to be gone forever.
