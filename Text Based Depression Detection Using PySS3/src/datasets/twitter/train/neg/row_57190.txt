This is it I guessIâ€™m just so done with everything. Woke up today crying and have cried since. I canâ€™t take this anymore.

I have a job where I mean nothing.
My parents donâ€™t care.
My friends dismiss my problems.
I dropped out from school.

I mean absolutely nothing to other people. I am a failure and worthless.

I donâ€™t deserve to live.
