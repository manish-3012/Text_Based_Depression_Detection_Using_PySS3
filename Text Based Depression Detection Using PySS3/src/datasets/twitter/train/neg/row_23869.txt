Valentines Day just reminds me of how hard it is to grow up in this society.As I sit here writing this post, blood dripping from my wrists, all I think about is pain. As a 14 year old boy, all they expect you to do is marry a girl and have children to live a happy life and retire. I donâ€™t want to do that, I want to go out with a boy, and live a happy life. But I canâ€™t do that in this society. I would be bullied and beaten, my parents would hate me. I could never do it. Heâ€™s perfect, has the most beautiful eyes and the best personality. I only wish he loved me. I canâ€™t live without him and know that I will be emotionally crippled if I ask him and he says no, or worse hurts me himself. I loved this world and would love to thank those who help others, I wish everyone was this awesome. Goodbye
