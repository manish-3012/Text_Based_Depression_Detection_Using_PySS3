There are so many things going wrong. I can't take it anymore.For some context, I've been depressed and an addict since I was 15 or so. So four years, and never thought suicidal thoughts etc would be a problem for me. But hell, here they are continuing to crop up out of the blue. I never lead the best life and was never the nicest person, but I knew where my problems where and tried to fix them, maybe that is the problem that I tried to do so alone without help. I'm never happy and I'm always just looking for one more fix that keeps getting bigger and bigger than the last,  and it's tearing me down. I'm a public servant of sorts and save life daily and it just keeps takes piece after piece from me, burnout I believe is the term, but had I quit or got help when I started noticing it I'd probably be fine, instead I let it infest me and screw with my mind and the end result is a person who is broken beyond repair who just lost a great friend and wonders how the world just keeps on moving after it. Who wonders daily who would care if he took his own life. I see posters daily saying suicide isn't the answer, then what the fuck is? I know how beyond help I am so why even bother. I'm just so lost in everything and I see only one exit from this hell. Having to balance this college and my job along with people, family, and whatever else has taken its toll on me. I always wanted to explore the world after college, but I don't know if I'll last long enough. Advice?
