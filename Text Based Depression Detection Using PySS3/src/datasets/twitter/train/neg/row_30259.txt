I just want to end it allTo everyone around me, my life might seem perfect. I married the love of my life, have a great job that pays well, the husband who supports me in every single thing. So why would i be unhappy or depressed right? Well I guess I am not INTERNALLY happy.


1) I have huge insecurities. I dont think I am good enough for any thing or anyone. All the while i lived with my parents, i thought i was a burden to them, and now that I live with my husband, i see myself as a burden to him

2)I don't really know if my husband actually completely trusts me or holds any resentments against me. I've messed up in the past and I don't know if he has forgiven me or if he is just holding it in and hating my every move. I asked him and he said he doesn't hold anything against me but I just don't know if he is being honest

3)I am overweight. It is a constant fight and struggle with my weight and my love for food.I lost 20 kgs before my wedding with strict diet and i have put on 10kgs back after that.. I hate myself for letting that happen.. you might think that's silly but no. I eat one thing i love and i put on weight the next day.

4)I just feel worthless. I feel like I never do anything right(plus I am extremely clumsy)

5) I am extremely awkward and I dont have any friends.

6)I just hate myself. I can't seem to bring myself to like myself. I am just disgusted by myself.

All these might seem like stupid reasons but all of them combined.. they are crushing me and i feel like i am moving from one place to another like a walking corpse. I just don't know what to do anymore.
