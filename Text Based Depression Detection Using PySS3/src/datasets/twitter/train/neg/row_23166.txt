Why are they gone, but I'm still here?Why? I've lost wonderful people, beloved pets, friendships. Even recently, my neighbour who I've known since high school just lost his mother. She was so kind, and loved her son with her whole heart, but she was taken away from him. And a girl I had a crush on in primary school had taken her life a year ago. 

Of everyone, I feel as though I'm the one who deserves to die. I feel guilty knowing people lose precious family, friends, pets, and other beloved things, but I'm still here. Why am I still here?
