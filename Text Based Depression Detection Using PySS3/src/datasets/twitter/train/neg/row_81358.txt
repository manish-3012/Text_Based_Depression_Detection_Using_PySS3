I donâ€™t really feel like life is worth livingFor some people it is. Some people have great lives Iâ€™m sure. Some people have amazing friends or they found their soul mate. I have nothing and no one. I have my daughter who would be better off without me. I have a husband who just picked a fight with me before he left for work because I was feeling depressed and he apparently â€œjust wants me to be happyâ€ and he thinks getting mad at me for being sad is the right way to make me happy. Heâ€™s not my soul mate but Iâ€™m stuck because my family wonâ€™t take me back at this point. We just got married last year and I have a baby. I donâ€™t have a job Iâ€™m waiting on state approval for child care assistance.

So I left everything that I know behind to move in with my husband. I moved 800 miles away from my family. At the time I didnâ€™t even want to be with him I was just so desperate to get out of my familyâ€™s home because I was so unimportant to them. I was so lonely and depressed. Even now I have no one not a single soul I can call to talk. My parents would never understand my sister and I donâ€™t talk about these things none of my â€œfriendsâ€ answer the phone when I call and never call me back when I ask.

I have no one Iâ€™ve always been alone. No one even wants to be my friend god knows I donâ€™t have a fucking soul mate. I want to kill myself because my baby will be better off. I donâ€™t want to be in this relationship anymore but I canâ€™t leave. I donâ€™t have anyone or anything to offer the world. Even if I could leave my marriage I would never find anyone else to love me the way I want to be loved. I canâ€™t even find a friend that truly loves me. I just want to end it all and get it over with. I tried to kill myself at 15 but I failed and I didnâ€™t try again because I hoped things would get better. I wish I could go back and tell myself that it never gets any fucking better
