"Suicide is a cowardly act"I hate when people say this. As horrible as this sounds: if there's something I respect with people who take their lives it's their courage. Going against our biggest instinct and natures greatest force, the will to live, requires a massive amount of will power and bravery. There are many things wrong with a person losing their life, but their are **not** cowards.
