please someone help meIâ€™m a nuisance to those around me and Iâ€™m not getting help. Ive tried. Ive really tried, but nothingâ€™s working. My best friend stopped responding to me, my therapist canceled 3 appointments on me, and my dad has a break down when I bring it up. Suicide prevention left me on hold for 10 minutes and never answered. My first post here even went ignored. If these arenâ€™t signs, I donâ€™t know what is.
