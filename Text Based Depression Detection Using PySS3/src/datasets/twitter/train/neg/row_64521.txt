I'll be 18 soonMy 18th birthday is right around the corner and I've been telling myself for years now that I will end it a day after. But I'm not sure. But I'm also excited that it'll be over. But I'm also so so devastated thinking about how my friends and family will react and have to live with me being gone. I don't know what to do.
