I want to kill myself if I don't succeed with my dreams by a certain age. I feel like I just can't deal with that level of failure. Suggestions for other options?I really don't like life. I really wish that I had never been forced into this fucking cesspool. And I really don't have much that feels worth living for. I don't like my job. There's barely anything to do around where I live. The only thing that's really keeping me going is working towards my dream of being a writer. I've been posting and I've been getting pretty good comments. And I know it will probably take some time to start building an audience and such. But still, I have the plan in my mind to kill myself if I can't live fully off my writing. I don't feel like there's anything else there for me in life if I can't have that. Any suggestions how not to have this thinking pattern or other things that can be done?
