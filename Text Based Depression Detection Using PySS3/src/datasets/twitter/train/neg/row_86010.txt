Running out of money, no friends irl, family hates meI'm 19 and this close to trying to end it again.
Tired of being stuck in a place I'm not welcome and the fact I can't be with the people who cares about me makes things worse.
Honestly think I'm going to try end it by this week, I'm too tired to keep trying. The last post I made like this, some cunt convinced me to keep going ffs.
I'm just tired bois. I hope everyone here pulls through whatever they're going through.
