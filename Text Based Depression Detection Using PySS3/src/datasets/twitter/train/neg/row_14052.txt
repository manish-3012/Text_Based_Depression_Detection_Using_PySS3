When people say they wish they could go back and talk someone out of suicide....
What if what it really took for the person to not kill themselves was a lifelong investment with them? regularly needing to talk them through problems, watching them self harm then stop only to start again, make choices that seem counter intuitive over and over again, and stick by them when all they seem to express is that their entire life has been and feels like an excersize in torture. 

The statement seems to come from the angle that they did this because they thought no one cared at all. What if they just needed *more* care than most and no one cared *enough*. 

What if, like me they realised, life was never going to be happy, that they wanted more joy out of it than they were ever going to have.

In any other scenario quiting under these circumstances is normal and even encouraged.

Think of an aspiring actor, at some point some people have to realise that their dream isn't going to happen and they need to settle for something else.

What if my dream is just to be low key happy and it's just not in the cards for me.

And don't tell me it will pass, I've been in this hell for over 20 years.

Let me tell you about my current fantasy that I would 100% do if I could.

I would willfully end my life just for the 1:46 minutes that Eponine gets with Marius in Les Miserables. 

That's what I have wanted for twenty five years. It would be worth my death just to have it.

What it would take for me to be happy isn't sustainable.
