What the fucks wrong with meI got an email back from a place I applied at asking me to call back for a short interview. I called and as soon as i connected i hang up I couldnâ€™t even handle a simple hi or hello. Iâ€™m shaking rn. Iâ€™m so fucking stupid. I really need to get a job and i cant even handle a simple phone call. Hell i cant even look at peoples faces in person. 

My anxiety has only gotten worse. I canâ€™t even communicate with people properly, i have to look to my aunt to figure out what to say most of the time. Iâ€™m 18 already I shouldnâ€™t need my aunt for shit like this. 

Iâ€™m probably just gonna kms, no point in sticking around and just being a burden to everybody whoâ€™s unlucky enough to know me
