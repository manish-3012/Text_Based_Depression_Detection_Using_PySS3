haven't felt excited in a long timeis it normal that i just have lost excitement in anything that used to make me happy
i feel tired all the time i feel guilty for not doing anything im bed ridden most days 
i find it so fucking difficult to get up and face the day. i dont really want to be part of the future anymore. theres such a huge heaviness in my head it feels like its stopping me from thinking straight. i want to get out and go but im pretty scared of dying but im just sinking into this hole of tiredness. loss of motivation and drive. i cant be bothered to see friends because i dont want to burden them with this stupid issue but idk where to start. i dont have money to see a psychologist and my parents are super religious and think that if i feel like this i just have to stop acting lazy. if i express to them that i want to seek help they think im mental. i dont want to bother anyone. feel like my only option is to go. sorry idk how to format this better.
