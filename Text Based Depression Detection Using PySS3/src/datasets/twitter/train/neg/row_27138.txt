Chickened outI had everything together, note, items to be mailed to my fiancee, and my belt. I've been depressed and suicidal since I was about 10 and I've come close so many times but I just decided today was the day. I can't work due to mental health issues, can barely leave the house either. I never get to see my fiancee because it's a LDR and I have no money to go and be with her. I don't see a way to fix anything. I've tried medication, therapy, counseling, hospitals, and it never stops. I had the belt around my neck, all I needed to do was kick the chair but when I stared at my feet I just froze and got scared and just thought of my fiancee hugging me and I just couldn't do it. I still desperately want to, I hate being alive, it hurts every single day and I just want out. I wish I was strong enough to do it.
