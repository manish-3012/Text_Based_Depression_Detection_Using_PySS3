On The Roof. Contemplating Jumping. I have a bottle of a bottle of antidepressants. Help.Thereâ€™s a lot going on. I have so much self hate and lately things have just been falling apart. I had 2 anxiety attackâ€™s in school today. I know I said Iâ€™d wait till I turn 16, (check my profile posts...if you want) but it just gets more and more difficult with every fucking minute and every second. 

I guess a lot of people are probably thinking Iâ€™m â€œAttention Seekingâ€ since Iâ€™ve been posting on this thread a lot lately. I can understand why. I really can. And at the end of the day, weâ€™ll see. 

I really hate to post on here as much as I do. I really do. Iâ€™m sorry. Iâ€™m so fucking sorry. But I donâ€™t know what else to do. Iâ€™m out of options. Iâ€™m sorry. I swear. I hate myself for doing this, but I have nothing else to do man. Iâ€™m sorry. 

Everything seems to be declining and going to shit. I canâ€™t handle this. I broke up with my GF about 1-2 weeks ago. Iâ€™ve been cutting ties with everyone. I canâ€™t handle this anymore
