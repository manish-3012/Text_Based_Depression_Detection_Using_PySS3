Things Are Not Getting BetterI have been depressed since 6th Grade, and now I'm a freshman in College. I've gotten therapy with multiple therapists over time span. I'm on medication that has also changed and gone through different psychologists over the years. Yet, nothing has changed. I've been suicidal since my depression started. When are things supposed to get better? I've learned coping skills, I have a support network, I've followed every play in the rulebook. I still want to kill myself. I've researched enough to know all the possible methods, and the most effective ways. I've gone to the hospital before due the concern of others. It didn't help. In a room where my dignity was stripped, I watched those with manic bipolar scream and jump all over the place, active while I sat in the corner and read a book. I don't have an obvious reason for being depressed. No trauma, no family history of depression or suicide. The only reason I struggle to kill myself is because I don't like the pain that comes before death, and it would hurt my family. I can't get motivated due to depression and am failing college. I may have to drop off and go home. But, I cant see myself living working a job that doesn't require a degree. I hate manual work. I hate retail. I want a job with stable benefits and enough money to live comfortably. Although it's all worthless if I'm sad anyways. I've been going through trial runs of killing myself. The supplies are always within reach. I've given my pet enough food to survive until my body is found. I know how to make sure emergency finds my body and not civilians to lessen trauma to others. (I know it wont mitigate all damage caused by my death, but I'll try my best). I'm never going back to the hospital so don't even try.
