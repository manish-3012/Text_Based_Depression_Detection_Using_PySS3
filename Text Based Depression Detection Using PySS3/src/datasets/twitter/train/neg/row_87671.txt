It's all one lieEverything I've thought about anything is just a big delusion, I know it sounds angsty but it's just all a big lie pretending to be happy, everyone thinks I'm doing better than ever but I've never been more alone or empty in my entire life, I'm still as broken, I'm just better at hiding it. I don't have any sort of self-respect to realize that the friends or people that have been in my life for the last couple of years hate my guts completely and I only act like they don't because I don't want any of it to be real yet. Everything feels empty but at the same time worse than ever. It makes me so fucking sick when people tell me I'm a good guy or anything that just jerks me off even more when I've just got really good at living a complete lie. I feel like I have no actual self, I'm just hollow and it's completely gone. I've been on autopilot so long that I don't know how to be genuine anymore. I almost miss the dying inside feeling compared to the dead inside feeling.
