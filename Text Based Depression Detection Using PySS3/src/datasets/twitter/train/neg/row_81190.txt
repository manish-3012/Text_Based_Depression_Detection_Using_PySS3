I dropped out to focus on my business which was going great but now is failing and I have no career option because I have no college or university grades or degrees and cannot keep running my businessWhat do I do? I have saved around $20,000 from my business, I want to just travel as much of the world I can with that and then kill myself

I own a software business which has around 4000 users and they paid for lifetime access to my software which is a dumb decision by me because I technically have to support them and the software forever and now my mental health is so fucked because every day Iâ€™m working on updates and I just canâ€™t handle it anymore. I dropped out of school and I have $20k to show for it but now I have no career path or anything... all I can think of every day is killing myself because I canâ€™t keep updating my software every day itâ€™s killing my mental health inside and itâ€™s barely working, I get so many support tickets every day

All I think of every day is buying a ticket to some other country and then killing myself so my family canâ€™t find out what happened, or travelling to some other country and trying to stay there for as long as I can before Iâ€™m caught, maybe goto the amazon rainforest where Iâ€™ll inevitably die but at least I can say I did something interesting in my whole life

I have no future
