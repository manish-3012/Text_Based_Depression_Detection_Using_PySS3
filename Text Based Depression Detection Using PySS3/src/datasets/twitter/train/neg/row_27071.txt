I thought if it ended, I would end my lifeI always thought that if me and my boyfriend broke up, I would kill myself.

Well, the other day I told him that I think I suffer from depression and that I really need help, and today he broke up with me because of it. He said he couldn't be with someone like me, that I scared him, blah blah blah.

Well, I'm still alive, so that's a good sign. I actually feel happy, as strange as it feels.

So basically, right now, things are okay.
