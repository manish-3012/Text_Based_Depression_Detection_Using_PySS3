A subreddit some of yalls may/may not know exist...Iâ€™ve been seeing a lot of teens on here lately. Which is absolutely fine because I am a teen too, and I am here too quite frequently. 

However, Iâ€™ve noticed in my years here that even though everyone is super great and supportive and helpful, sometimes you need people your own age who relate to your everyday issues. Adolescents are no exception. 

So, I want to link r/TeenageSuicideWatch if thatâ€™s okay with yalls.

Sorry if this has already been done ):
