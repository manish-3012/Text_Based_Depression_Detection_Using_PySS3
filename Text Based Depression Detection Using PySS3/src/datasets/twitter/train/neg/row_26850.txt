The world would be a better place without me.I honestly don't see the point. 

I'm in my second year of college. I failed about 6 exams. I lied to my parents about half of them because I'm a coward and an idiot. 

I don't see a future from this college anyway. Who would hire me simply because I studied russian and english?

I dread the day my mom hears that I failed so many of them, and I'd sooner throw myself from the 10th floor than tell her. 

I want this shit to fucking stop. There's nothing fun in my life except for stuff you use to escape from it, like movies and games, and even those don't make me happy anymore. 

The only reason I haven't killed myself by now is because I don't want to bother anyone. If there was a button I could press to erase myself and every trace of me from everyone's memory I'd do it.
