no way out of this loopholeI am the only child. My father cannot work because he has health issues. My mother also because she need to support him. I need to support them financially with 2/3 of my salary (I don't have a high paying job).  Every month I am broke at the end of the month and I can't quit and find another job because they are strongly against it (maybe they worried of not getting money during my jobless times.) I don't have a car, living in a small rented apartment and no friends. I have my needs. There is no way out of this shithole. I wanna escape. Thanks for reading.
