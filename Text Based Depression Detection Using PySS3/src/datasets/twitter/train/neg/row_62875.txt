Just an emotional Gen z who needs to get over myself and my self loathingCan I rant. Vent about my problems, speak my true mind without it getting bottled up in my head. Please. 
For my whole fucking life Iâ€™ve been told Iâ€™m too emotional and I need to get over myself. 
Since I was 8 I fantasized about my life ending. But Iâ€™m not serious, Iâ€™m just being dramatic. Apparently. 
Iâ€™ve tried to tell my mom and family about how I feel but they just tell me itâ€™s an excuse to get on pills because I need attention. 
Everyday I feel numb. The only thing I feel other than numb is sadness. The sadness burns through my arms and legs, especially in my palms. Itâ€™s physically hurts. 
I cry like fucking 8 times a week, and every time I reach out Iâ€™m told Iâ€™m just emotional. 
I donâ€™t believe I have a purpose on this earth because I canâ€™t see what I could possibly bring to people. I am narcissistic, selfish, mean, vain and annoying. I have no self love and everyone that ever meant something to me hates me now. 
I dropped out of college because I hated it, but canâ€™t find any other path in my life. 
My boyfriend stares at other girls asses and talks about how other girls look good. He wonâ€™t have sex with me and criticizes my outfits. 
Woe is me. 
I donâ€™t have a close family and all my friends moved away. 
Is ending it cowardly or is it something only people with courage do. 
Canâ€™t seem to figure it out.
Sorry for my complaining. Iâ€™m just emotional. I just needed to rant.
