i really don't have friends anymoreIt's so normal to hear in this subreddit but I really don't have any. There's no one I message on the daily, go hang out with; no one to call my best friend. I don't have a circle of people I trust and there's no one who really cares. I've always been a social butterfly and enjoyed being bros with everyone, but that's turned to bite me in the butt bc now I have no one I can confide in. I've never managed to keep real friends and I'm always less than a thought in the back of someone's mind. I'm so extroverted but have social anxiety now and I don't know what to do about it.

Oof.
