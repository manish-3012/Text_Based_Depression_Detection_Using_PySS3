The hard part isn't that she's done with me, it's that she doesn't care and is eager to get rid of me.I've had a pretty tough road the last few years. Therapy, depression meds, panic attacks and more. But I'd finally gotten everything together. I had a girlfriend of fifteen months who I absolutely adored. Monday morning, my life seemed absolutely fantastic. Then she broke up with me. Deadpan, like she just didn't care. When I tried to ask questions, she answered them vaguely and then just left. Apparently she felt "stuck", and I was the easiest thing to get rid of. I felt desperate for answers, so I went onto her FB (Yes, that was stupid. I don't give a fuck). I saw her talking to one of her friends, talking about how fine she was, how she felt like she could "enjoy her youth" now, and how excited she was for "Boys"

I'm a lesbian, and I'm so fucking done with it. 

It's never good enough for anyone. Every time I meet a nice girl who seems to actually care about me, I'm never enough. Is it because I'm gay? Is it because I'm not worth loving? Am I just a shitty person? I don't understand, but I'm so tired of it. I'm so tired of feeling like I will spend the rest of my life alone because I'm gay and no one will love me. I'm so tired of not having anyone who cares. I'm sick and tired of it, and I don't know how to make it better. I don't even know if I'm suicidal. I just want OUT.
