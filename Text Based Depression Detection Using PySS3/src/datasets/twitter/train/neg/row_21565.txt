i can't do this anymore **Why is it so bad to commit suicide?** I've been suicidal since the age of 8 im now 19 and nothing has ever helped you could give me the most money in the world and id still want to kill myself, I dont want to be here anymore im done with my life i have no purpose to be here i hate my life and everyone around me im miserable. Ive never had a easy upbringing growing up with a bipolar mother being bullied,  struggled with bad mental health, being threatened to put into care if i dont stop being suicidal. i've attempted suicide 3 times all those times i got caught. I have BDD, ADHD, ASBERGERS and depression i can't live like this anymore, i was promised help by my doctor but been waiting over a year and still no letter about me getting help i feel hopeless. I dont see any purpose being here the only reason im alive is im scared it will fail. Id try go missing and never get found but i dont want for people to see what i looked like. Im sick of life :( I dont understand why its so bad to kill urself? people will get over it nothing would change the world would still be the same. My mom always says shes sick of me and my depressive thoughts so why not?
