I feel like a failure and can't get help when I tryHey.

So I'm a 31 woman, and maybe have ADHD. The therapist who was so excited about suggesting that's what's always been wrong with me never went any further than feeling very pleased with herself. I went there asking about aspergers but she said I made eye contact so nope.

I can see the ADHD however. Tried to call the psychiatrist who perscibed my Prozac about it, but he never called me back. I tried twice.

I work as a fitness instructor but I'm trained as a ballet dancer. I could still dance as I look very young, but I put on weight after an injury and this endless depression made me develop a bingeing habit and I've been trying to lose 20 pounds for two years. I live at home because I'm broke.

I was a merit scholar. I feel like an idiot for pursuing dance even though it is the only thing that really makes me happy. If I don't lose weight, I don't see the point in living.

I am planning to kill myself in 20 days. I can't go into more detail without filling this up. I can't take this anymore I am useless financially, I do seem to have ADHD and struggle to accomplish the simplest tasks. I am a joke of an adult.

I am humiliated. I make stupid mistakes all day, I can't keep track of them. I feel there are things about me which are endearing but I am a failure. 

My room is full of the things I love, books, motivational quotes, artwork, fashion, things from dance. I have this idea to leave it as a shrine. I keep imagining old friends, my brother, my boyfriend, family visiting it and maybe understanding me after I've gone.
