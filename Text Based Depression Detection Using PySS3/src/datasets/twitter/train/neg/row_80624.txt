What should I try before giving up?I'm feeling suicidal, but I don't want to make a bad decision or rush anything, so I'm giving myself until Good Friday to make a serious attempt at feeling better. If I can't find a sense of hope by then, I need to stop feeling the relentless stress of existence. I'm most interested in hearing from people who have been suicidal, but now feel okay about their lives.

Thanks.
