Anxiety due to abuse.Had been abused by my own brother when I was small and I can't share it with anyone or my family either. Thank God for Reddit. I need to forgive others and myself for whatever wrongs have been done or I have done. Plus I'm no more teen so the stress to be financially stable fucks it up more, I had to drop college for a year to get my life back to track again and starting from March, 2020 I'm about to be sober.       No more blame games and no more relationships, no overthinking, no self harm.
