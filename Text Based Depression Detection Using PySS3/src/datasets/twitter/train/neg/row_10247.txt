Right now seems like a perfect time to commit suicideIâ€™m a 27 year old  with no way to fix this problem at all and my social life has just collapsed. My family absolutely do not care me whatsoever outside of my mom. My brother wonâ€™t even sit in the same room and talk to me for 30 minutes.

I have extreme social anxiety and I donâ€™t have the initiative or the right talent to make it better. I recently sent a thread on reddit asking how to fix it knowing damn well I wouldnâ€™t follow the advice.

I have no skills whatsoever and nobody to teach me anything. My family is the only one I know and I donâ€™t have a mentor at all to help guide me through this. I can do basic things by myself but whenever I try to learn a new skill I basically canâ€™t.

I have never worked once in my life and it again seems scary to get a job now with no one to help guide me. Only knowing my mom has made me stuck and my mom gets paid by the state to help take care of me. She also has very limited amount of people in her life. I love her though so itâ€™s a decent but scary life to live. Iâ€™m not going to be ungrateful and say that it was my parents fault. Fate just laid itâ€™s hand on me.

So I have no jobs no skills and nobody who cares for me. I have lived 1/3rd of my life and I have a feeling it will never get better. Should I just kill myself and get life over with? It seems like the best action I can take instead of waiting for time to bite my mom and have her die and be on my own permanently.
