Intensely lonely on New Year'sI wasn't invited by anyone. I don't have any real friends. They're friendly to me to some extent, but they don't actually care about whether or not I'm around. They have a group chat that I'm not a member of. They don't even try to hide it from me, because they don't care that it's hurtful. The man I'm in love with has a girlfriend and probably never even thinks of me. I don't have a family that cares. My family is the same as I am. My brother is probably even worse off  than me, as he's unemployed and has been his entire life. He's 27 and still lives at home. He often doesn't leave the house for weeks on end, because he has nowhere to go. He has no future prospects. I'm scared he feels as horrible as I do all the time. I'm scared he's going to kill himself, but I'm also scared that he feels like he has to continue living in pain because he doesn't want to hurt us. 


I was going through my instagram feed and realised that my "friends" all have groups of friends that they hang out with. They were having dinner together and going out. I threw up because of how anxious the realisation that I'm all alone made me. I don't even have hobbies. I know I won't get any texts from anyone when the clock strikes twelve. 


I have no one and it won't get better. 


I don't think my life will get better. I know it won't. I've never been happy and I never will me.
