Hey reddit, convince me not to kill myself?Given up at this point. Yall seem to lift my spirits a bit more than anything else can, so i guess this is my one last try to hang on. Decided to be done with it all, tired of being miserable, tired of my medical and mental problems, tired of all the physical pain i feel for no good reason, tired of not being able to talk to people like normal, tired of the extreme emotional abuse ive gone through my whole life. Tired of it all, reddit. This is probably my last hurrah, idk. Always been a very indecisive person, so im bavk and forth. For the last year ive slowly leaned towards being done, as everything ive tried hasnt helped a bit. So sorry for rambling, just getting carried away i guess.


Edit: woke up with puke all over me and a bottle of pills. Cant say im happy it didnt work. I dont know what i feel.
