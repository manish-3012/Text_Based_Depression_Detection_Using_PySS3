Should I let my mom arrange a marriage for me?The main reason I want to kms is because I am still a kissless, handholdless, hugless, virgin but my mom said she would find a wife fro me if I wanted. I know to western females arranged marriages are oppressive slavery(everything is slavery to them), but do you think Indian women are different? I am handsome and muscular but I am 5'8 which is why no girls have been interested. I was planning on killing myself either way when my mom dies, but should I give it a shot? I am about to turn 20
