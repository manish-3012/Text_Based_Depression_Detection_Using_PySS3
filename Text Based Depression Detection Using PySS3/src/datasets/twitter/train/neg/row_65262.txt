Mood changed for the betterI don't know if this even belongs here. The last 3 nights I've hurt myself. Today I Googled suicide and clicked on this sub. I spent a few hours responding to some posts here, and each time I wrote to somebody I realized that I should listen to what I was saying to other people. One user told me that he'd miss me if I were gone, and that meant a lot to me.

Somehow in between ignoring work to respond on reddit, and taking a way too long lunch break, I got caught up on work that has been piling up since Monday. I went to tell a friend that I got caught up, and my mood changed from wanting to hurt myself to joy. I was able to humble brag that I leg pressed 1400 lbs, have a BS in physics, and am a good dad. My friend (the only friend I have) said he's proud of me too.

The sad reality is that I know I will swing back to those shitty feelings again, probably way too soon, but for now I will enjoy being happy, and will spread it where I can.

Edit: BS = Bachelor's of Science, not bullshit
