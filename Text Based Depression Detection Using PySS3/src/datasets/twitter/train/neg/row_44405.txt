I think i just need to type thisI keep thinking about killing myself and its a little bit scary. I think i wont do it but the idea is becoming more and more frequent in my current mind-state. Im worried i might get carries away and do it somehow. As my reality is getting pretty grim. The worst part is my mind or maybe even my soul is seeing it as a success, like if i die then i will end my suffering and then ill be free. A part of me feels so trapped, trapped in infinity. Trapped in the feeling of being lost and confused and regretful guilty failure shame ruined everything. Alone. I dont want to continue . I get it think positive. I know how it all works i am seeing a reality where i can rebuild myself. But then i am still lost because i ruined it . I am self sabotaging. I am afraid i will never make it out of this. I am afraid i have lost my bestfriend forever. I know i have . I cant contact you. You disappeared you had to go because i was lost in my mind. but its like you died. I am mourning your disappearance. I am lost without you. I love you untill infinity. Without you i may aswell die. I guess i cant get over this. Almost 2 and a half years its the same stuff. Everyday. I cant suffer this anymore
