i wish it wasn't so difficultthere's always going to be the thoughts that are both for and against it. they make me take into consideration pretty much everything anyone has said to me associated with it, but overall the ideas making me want to go through are generally more significant at this point; in fact, they have been for an extended period of time, but i've now stopped doing what has been helping me distract myself from them.   
i've essentially given up on trying to think of ways to come out, i mean, i've taking everything into account: my family is catholic which makes that riskier, but the primary thing is that they're all polish including me, however i never went to a polish school, and i can only speak very basic sentences in the language, whereas it's the opposite for them. hell, i don't even know the word for "gender" in polish, how am i meant to describe everything else? no, i can't just say to them 'i wish i was born as a girl' and leave it at that; they're obviously going to ask more questions, questions which i would not be able to answer for the most frustrating reason:   
i simply cannot speak their language well enough to be able to describe it in detail.  
it's legitimately an absolute miracle that they still haven't discovered what i do as my main coping mechanism, perhaps sometimes being good at hiding things is unhealthy in the long run.  
school is something i used to do quite well in, especially in primary, but immediately when that changed my performance has cascaded drastically, and it's difficult to grasp motivation towards it - mostly because of the uncomfortable environment it provides. the worst thing is that i consciously am aware of what is happening to every aspect of my life, yet i'm also fully aware that i'm too pathetic to do anything about that, and i don't even know if i can so if i tried and failed it'd undoubtedly only end up worse.
