At least I have a timer..3 years and I'll be 18, then I can join the military and figure it out from there... 3 more years of considering almost every day whether my suffering now is even worth it and then I'm out of here.. 

"At least you aren't homeless,

At least you aren't in Africa

At least you don't have cancer

At least you have friends 

Bullshit.

At least I have a timer."
