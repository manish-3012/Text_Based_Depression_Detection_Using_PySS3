I need helpThe girl Iâ€™ve liked for 3 years told me that itâ€™s never going to happen between us and Iâ€™ve been miserable ever since. I was going to commit suicide last Friday, and I made the mistake of telling my closest friend group. One of my friends told my mom, who then prevented it. Exactly one week later I started to get the urges again, somehow my mom found out again, and she went off on me for doing so poorly in school and always being depressed. Thanks mom. You can tell she hasnâ€™t had to deal with this before. Sheâ€™s told me the usual â€œsuicide is the most selfish thing possible, suicide is a sin, suicide is never the answer, itâ€™s insane to end your life over a girlâ€ B.S., but that wonâ€™t change anything. I still feel the urge sometimes, but I try to hide it now. I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™ll ever act on these urges, but who knows. I might. Somebody please help me.
