Can i use your stories for inspiration?Hello! Im an aspiring musician that is looking to make a song about how people who have made the decision to end their life are usually very happy, and nice, and try to make time with friends and family before they actually go through with ending their life. If you have ever known anyone who went out of their way to hang out with friends, or gave away their favorite things before going through with suicide i would love to hear about it. This song is going to meant to raise awareness. I've attempted to kill myself in the past and nearly succeeded and I'll never stop regretting it. I really appreciate you guys!
