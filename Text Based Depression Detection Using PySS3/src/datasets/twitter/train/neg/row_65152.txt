Ow ow OW!I'm cursed to live with some kind of body pain that will not go away. If it's not my shoulder it's my back. If it's not that. My knees or ankles. Fuck this everlasting bullshit. I will never be " normal". Why can't people including women just accept me for who I am. If I have to be isolated then I will die alone at the hour of my choosing and in a manner of my choosing. God loves all,  yeah right he don't like me
