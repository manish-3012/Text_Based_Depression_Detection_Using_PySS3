I'm just so tired (f/21)I'm just so tired of life and I'm just wanting to give up. I'm just tired of the cycle of days when I think that I'm fine but then it just crashes. I'm thinking that today is going to be the day that I do it. I'm home alone today for most of the day. I'm just on my way to buy some sleeping tablets and hopefully I manage to kill myself properly. I was meant to kill myself a few weeks ago and I've managed to make a will but I had my plans ruined. 

I have seen a GP and I'm meant to see a mental health nurse on Thursday but I don't think that is going to do anything. I've been to a university councillor and its not done much either especially since it is so close to the end of the term. I'm never going to finish off my degree, the anxiety is too much. I'm always going to be a failure and even if I did somehow finish uni and get something like an ordinary degree or 2.2 honours, my life is basically over.  People keep saying the same things like 'its a permanent solution to a temporary problem , ' but this problem has been going on for a year. They allow sick dogs to be put down, so why can't people allow me to kill myself?
