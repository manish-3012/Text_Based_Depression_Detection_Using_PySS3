As soon as my mom falls asleep Iâ€™m killing myselfI just canâ€™t take it anymore. My only friend doesnâ€™t want to be friends anymore. No one ever wanted to talk to me. Iâ€™ve always been a loner. I never knew how to communicate well with others. Iâ€™m the biggest fucking loser and dumbass on this planet. Iâ€™ll be dead soon so it doesnâ€™t matter. People only act like they care about me when Iâ€™m thinking about killing myself but never when I want to hang out. It doesnâ€™t matter anymore though because soon Iâ€™ll be dead and Iâ€™ll get to join my dad who killed himself as well. I can see why, this world is full of shitty people and it just isnâ€™t worth living anymore. The biggest relief Iâ€™ve had in my life was me deciding to kill myself. This will be the best moment of my life. Iâ€™ve always bitched out before but not this time. Iâ€™ve made up my mind that life isnâ€™t worth living alone.
