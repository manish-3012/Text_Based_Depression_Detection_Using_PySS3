CAN I JUST FUCKING DIE ALREADY??Every day. Every day is pain. I'm struggling to even type all this, my head is moving from left to right. So: my PS3 broke; my phone broke; I got angry and threw a water bottle at all my books and comics I WORKED SO FUCKING HARD on collecting, all my friends are nowhere to be found, my family has admitted their hatred for me. My life is shit. I don't know what else to say. I'm going to just go ahead and try to kill myself AGAIN and if that doesn't work I'm giving out my address on /b/.
