If I don't get into a class for my major next quarter I'm killing myself. Yes, I know how stupid that sounds.I know how stupid it sounds, but look at the big picture.

I am a second year Computer Science student. Next quarter, my school has zero open seats in any class relevant to my field. I'm very, very far away on the waitlist right now-- somewhere around 100th for classes that hold 150 people. 

So I'm taking only Gen Ed classes next quarter. Obviously these are notoriously easy classes. I honestly don't think I can handle it. The only reason I've been able to hold it together through college so far is because I love my major and I can pour my heart into my classes and perform really well. But if I'm not in any I'm going to go out of my mind with boredom. 

Not to mention the tuition. My parents will be paying more than $11k for me to do fucking NOTHING. Make 0 progress on my major. Basically sit on a waitlist. 

I already hate it. I've got nothing against GE classes, they're necessary, and they can be nice filler when taking really hard classes. But I'm already so burnt out. I have no motivation to keep going.

I hate it here. I want to just quit now. There's no reason to keep going anyways.
