I can't keep living, neighbor hates me and I hate life (24/m)My neighbor (30/m) is tired of my shit. 

I cannot keep waking up in the middle of the night and cry like a baby all the time. 

I whine, I complain, I am a toxic person. 

I am a miserable fucking retarded-ass mothafucka

I need to hear the truth. 

I should be good to take my own life. 

Think about all the people who wouldn't have to put up with my shit anymore. 

No more screaming at 3 am in the morning (My Neighbour would be very pleased) 

No more waiting for my next fix (alcohol or marijuana) 

No more hearing comments from family "he just wants attention" no I don't actually.... 

I want this pain to end and don't know how. 

Someone hot girl is going to call me a retard down the road. 

Then I will more than likely begin uttering threats to her and make many several creepy and incriminating comments in the heat of the moment. 

If I don't take my own life now, I fear the "what if, what if" what if I end up killing somebody in a fit of rage or rampage. I wanna take my own before this happens to someone else. 

If I take my life now, that saves other people from being hurt by me unintentionally. (If it was intentional, I would be insane/lost my mind).
