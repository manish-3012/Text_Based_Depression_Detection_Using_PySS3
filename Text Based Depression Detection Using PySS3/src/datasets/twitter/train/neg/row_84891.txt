Iâ€™m just not sure what to do anymoreI found out my best friend and ex fiancÃ© are dating a few weeks ago. Which fuckin sucks. I moved to a new state when the pandemic started for a fresh start and now I have no friends or support system out here. Then one of my closest friends killed themselves last Saturday and Iâ€™ve been having a really hard time dealing with that this week. I havenâ€™t been eating or sleeping from anxiety. I tried talking to my partner multiple times, sometimes they were supportive and helpful, but most of the time our talks ended with them being upset with me for something like not using the right words to express myself. 
Today was my friends funeral, all I asked was that my partner showed me a little extra love and support and I didnâ€™t hear from them most of the day. And when I did they just got mad at me. So now Iâ€™m laying in bed, crying, feeling lonely as fuck and wondering if I should just end it and stop all of these feelings.
