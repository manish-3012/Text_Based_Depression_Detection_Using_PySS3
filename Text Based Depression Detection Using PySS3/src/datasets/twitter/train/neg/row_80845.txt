My disease is telling me to quit.Itâ€™s been 3 years since my MS diagnosis.  Been unemployed for 18 months and starting a new job in the morning. But as I lay here, I am crying uncontrollably. How I feel...it doesnâ€™t stop. 24/7, 365. 
Iâ€™ve held out this long for my family...but maybe I can make them understand. 

I canâ€™t get excited for tomorrow when I just want the present to cease constantly. I find no respite in anything. The symptoms I have to face have withered me down to a defeated man. I beg God to take me. To release me. I canâ€™t live my life like this. I wonâ€™t.

I want this because itâ€™s the only answer I have to this disease. It is logical to me. And the most ideal course of action. 

It is really hard to convince myself Iâ€™m wrong when it solves my problems and the voice is rational. Itâ€™s not a â€œI want to be dead.â€ But rather, â€œI truly do not want existence. In any format.â€

I have been to the hospital before, and have been seeing help for 3 years. But they can only do so much. It is a losing battle for me. And one I feel is inevitable.
