I love irony, its like a fun twist on Hypocrisy!I've always had urges, I've always fought them off  I've always been the golden boy of mental health recovery stories that people use, it's ironic that I've helped a lot of people convince them not to commit suicide and here I am, irony is a really beautiful thing, it's like a fun twist on hypocrisy in a way, even though I've tried my best to help people I won't fucking forget those who I wasn't able to help, their existence always haunts me so I keep doing it I keep helping, not because they haunt me but because I hate that I'm selfless, and I hate how much I fucking do for people and how many times people have abused that part about me, it just hurts...........it hurts a lot whenever I think about it and its all the time I always do my best for people im always there for people, but whenever I need help where is everyone they just.........vanish, Ive always had suicidal urges and urges where I wanna go back to the way that I was.......that being similar to living under a rock with no connection whatsoever or human connection,  im not sure where ill be after posting this but its becoming slowly larger and larger and its becoming so much harder and harder to fight.....ive fought for far too long, ive never had a childhood since my brain decided to block it out due to trauma and i just had to grow up early.

people should appreciate what they have a lot more often really it's like we're missing, an emotional common sense, I take care of others yet I can't take care of myself for fucking shit and I'm just sitting here on the edge thinking how would my head splat if its gonna be slow or fast, painless or painful....... I think I would prefer slow and painless, I've managed to come to terms with the concept of death but not the concept of just not existing, doesn't matter anymore I probably won't be here
