FUCK THISone day I will finally kill myself. this is too much to handle. iâ€™ve lost everything this year. the love of my life left me, my friend died, my grandpa died, i lost my music, all my passion for anything i  once loved. iâ€™m missing school, failing classes, IM JUST A HUGE INCONVENIENCE TO EVERYONE
