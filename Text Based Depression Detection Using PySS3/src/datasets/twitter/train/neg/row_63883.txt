The man who sexually abused me as a child had a job with the UNThe job only lasted a few months for whatever reason, but I only just found out. When I reported him to the police I was told multiple minors had made reports against him and so I had a good chance of some kind of conviction. 

That was 10 years ago. And I can't be fucked with this bullshit anymore.
