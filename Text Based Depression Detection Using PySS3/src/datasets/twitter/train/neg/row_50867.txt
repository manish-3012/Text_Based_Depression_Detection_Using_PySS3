I set the date for tomorrowI don't know why I'm coming here to tell y'all this, but I'm planning on ODing tomorrow. I just can't do it anymore, and I have no hope that my situation will get better. I've been able to distract myself for awhile with material things and superficial relationships, but I always end up coming down from those highs and plateauing at the unhappiness level of which i started.

I am planned to leave for university in two days, so I need to get it done before I leave. I don't want to face any more pain, anymore anxiety.I  don't want to have to try to make new friends with people who do not want to be friends with me. I don't want to make any more excuses for others to laugh about or to let the people close to me down. I have contemplated this for awhile and I feel that my decision has been made with solely my best interest at heart. 

I'm kind of out of it right now since i've drank and taken a few ativan so excuse my spelling and grammatical errors.
