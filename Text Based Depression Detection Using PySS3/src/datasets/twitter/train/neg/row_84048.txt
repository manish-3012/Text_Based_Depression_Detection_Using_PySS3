I am so doneI don't have anyone to talk to right now and I literally want to get this off my chest. Amongst other issues my best friend has had two mini strokes in the course of 2 weeks and today was the second stroke. She told me that the world is fucked... I am normally the one to say something uplifting. I want to kill myself. I am so tired of being shit. This is not about burdening anybody with my problems I just hope that me typing this out will expel this desire. So many things I could write about as one of my many past reasons for wanting to take my own life. How selfish right? I don't even feel bad for myself I just feel I have no control at the moment. I even wanted control of my weight, just a small thing to keep me steady during one of my flips but I think I even fucked that up today. I pick shit people to befriend. I already understand that people have more important shit to do than think about me which is honestly fair enough. My brother has a therapist for his childhood experiences and I, the oldest adult sibling, have managed to dupe everyone into believing that I escaped my past unscathed but I had it so much worse. But no one thinks of me, because I am quite, calm, kind, "you just handled it better", "you're strong". I'm tired. Yes, I put that in the past but the present is also hard a "rough patch" mum calls it. Why is it that I switch from being okay and "charming" to "very not okay" or "dark" so easily? Today I feel a clutching pain in my core like a fist bound up within me. It is a familiar feeling that I get when I feel low. And today after a year of shedding over 70lbs I overate like a fool. I just wanted control over something at least.. its not a big deal to most people but I am "tiny" apparently but not ridiculously thin. But I'd rather thin than fat but id rather just lean tbh. I am worried a day will come where I am not strong enough to see a reason to live when I feel there isn't one.
