Hello.So, Iâ€™m not even sure what to say really. Iâ€™m just really... exhausted, I guess you could say? I donâ€™t really feel like holding on anymore. I usually feel pretty sad about it and sob uncontrollably when Iâ€™m right on the edge like I am tonight. But tonight I feel peaceful. No emotions at all, really. I think Iâ€™m finally ready to let go. But I guess it doesnâ€™t hurt to reach out one last time, right?
