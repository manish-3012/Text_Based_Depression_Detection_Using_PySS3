iâ€™m honestly done with this shit(throwaway account)

iâ€™m 18

molested by mom until 13

sheâ€™s an alcoholic, pathological liar, and straight up certified piece of shit

dad suffered from drug addiction and schizophrenia and wasnâ€™t around much

he killed him self about 8 months ago

i basically spent my entire childhood alone

my brother and sister were popular and i didnâ€™t have friends, when their friends were over they were always mean so iâ€™d just hide in my room

my brother grew up with living with his well-off dad (same mom,different dad) and he doesnâ€™t understand what our mom put me and my sister through (stealing money from us, fucking our credit, calling cops on us, just being a typical alcoholic shitbag)

even my sister barely understands what i went through, for some reason my mom just decided to pick me to molest and physically abuse

iâ€™ve only told 2 people about what iâ€™ve been through and their the only people in my life

my sister and kayla

i met kayla in a mental hospital last november 

we were both there from friday until tuesday

we became really close in there and talked about everything to each other

weâ€™d walk the hallways back and forth all day just talking about whatever we were thinking of at the moment

i wrote my number on a piece of paper and gave it to her, i was really nervous but she seemed excited to keep contact when we got out

the first day she got out she broke up with her emotionally abuse ex

heâ€™d keep messaging her on different social mediaâ€™s after she blocked his number/facebook/instagram

over the next 2 weeks we hung out probably 6-7 times even though weâ€™re both busy with work all the time

she seemed to show some interest in me

she said i smelled good and she said i have pretty eyes all the time

weâ€™d always have these moments whereâ€™d we just stare into each otherâ€™s eyes not saying anything but it wasnâ€™t awkward at all

her ex showed up at her house one night and itâ€™s all gone down south from there

we went from hanging out all the time and texting about our days to barely seeing or talking to each other

in the past month weâ€™ve only hung out twice, sheâ€™s even cancelled a couple times

at first i wasnâ€™t sure if it was him controlling her or if i was just looking too into things

today we talked on the phone for a bit, she said sheâ€™s been busy with work, school, and seeing someone

she asked me if i wanted to hang out tonight (to smoke)

everytime weâ€™ve hung out, iâ€™ve smoked her up, and the two times we hung out in december it was when she was out of weed

since i was busy with work i asked what she was doing tomorrow, sheâ€™s cooking dinner at her place with a friend

so now i think sheâ€™s seeing someone that not her ex and now that sheâ€™s sees how iâ€™m such a depressed shy piece of shit that doesnâ€™t talk about anything but his childhood problems she doesnâ€™t really enjoy my company anymore and just wants weed out

the only time iâ€™ve ever felt any sort of happiness is with her and now it feels like itâ€™s all gone and iâ€™m worse off than before

what the fuck do i do
