Friend in Wallingford PA threatening suicide.I live in Canada and I have a friend in PA who's been constantly depressed and always talking about suicide. Specifically he says he plans to wait until he's able to buy a gun in two years and do it then because he feels like that's the only way he'd be able to bring himself to actually do it.
Regardless, I've been worrying more and more that he's going to just spontaneously do it one day. Last night he told me he's already written a note "in advance", and refused to discuss it. We've talked before and it seems like nothing I could say or do would help change his mind or cheer him up at all.

He tells me in the past few months he's been extremely depressed and no longer enjoys any of the things he used to love doing. He's been less and less willing to talk at all. Due to the distance we can only really talk on IRC and he's hardly been on lately.

He's told me how he dropped out of college because he didn't see any point, didn't know what he was doing there and felt like it was just a waste of time. Since then he's been working a dead-end job and never really seemed happy. The past few days he's been extremely depressed and not really willing to talk at all.

I called some nearby suicide help centres, but they're surprisingly un-helpful, saying they don't cover that area. I called the local police department and left a message asking them to call back. I know only his name and address; I could probably find his home phone number on Google and so I've been considering calling his parents as well. I think he needs professional help ASAP.
