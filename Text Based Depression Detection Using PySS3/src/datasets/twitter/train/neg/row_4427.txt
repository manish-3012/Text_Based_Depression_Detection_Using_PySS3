I want to dieThis shit is killing me, man, I wake up every morning with a horrible roommate. Barely helps anything we have like no food and no money.  
I have been suicidal since the day I was nine I've been tired of been bullying I couldn't stay out of the fight but god damnit look where it got me.  
I know its a new day but everybody reading this. Its too late.
