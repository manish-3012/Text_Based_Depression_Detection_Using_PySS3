What if someone came in your homeWhat if somebody came into your home and took everything. They ripped all of the pictures off of the wall, all of the furniture out of the rooms, and your family out of their beds. You wake up with nothing left at all.
Now, realistically, you have options. Legal options and (depending on how you feel about the justice system) things can and will be done. But in that instant when you realized it, if not from then on, you would feel broken. You would want to kill that person who took everything away from you. Even if you didn't have the means, and even if you never did anything but call the cops, you would think "what I would do to get my hands on that son of a bitch."
But what if it's you? What if you took everything from your home and took your family out of their beds, leaving yourself with nothing? What if you didn't even realize it until after it was done? Kind of like a coma; you've been asleep for a year and you wake up to find that somewhere in there, somehow, you destroyed everything and cant even speak to why you did it.
That's what it feels like. I share the same skin as the person who took everything from me. I see a picture of myself and I see a murderer.
And my god, what I would do to get my hands on that son of a bitch.
