Feeling horrible, don't really know what to do.So basically a shit ton of things in my life are going wrong right now. I'm 20 and I still live with my parents, The only girl who cared about me (an on and off gf) is ditching me because she moved. I'm feeling ugly, stupid, etc. etc. I just feel like suicide is my only way out. I feel like I'm too pussy to do it but I keep on getting closer and close and I don't know what to do. 

I've been on meds for depression but I hate taking them because they made me so lethargic and tired and didn't really improve my mood as much as they sapped my energy to feel bad at all. I hate saying I have depression because I feel like I might not even actually have it and I'm just another whiny white middle class kid complaining about nothing. It's just I feel like shit and I don't know how to improve my llife. I work out 5-6 times a week, I take good care of my hygiene, I clean my surroundings, and I try to have stimulating hobbies like playing the piano and reading.

I still cant manage to ever feel fulfilled ever. Sure I'm better than when I started at all those things but I'll probably never be great and people don't like me any more for it. That's another thing that gets the most to me is the feeling of not ever being important to anyone besides my parents. I feel like I'm a background character in my own life and everyone around me can be well adjusted and happy.

I think my girlfriend breaking up with me triggered this but I usually have her to talk to about when these feelings happen, but now that I don't have her to vent to, I don't know what Ill do. I don't want to be the guy who turns to e-strangers every time he feels like shit.

TL;DR: Trying my hardest, feeling my worst.
