The future's not looking brightI have nothing to look forward to, im 25 never worked in my life, currently studying a masters but I feel like im gonna drop out soon. Im a failure, I suck, I have 0 motivation to do anything meaningful apart from playing video games (my escape where I forget everything). 
Even if I sort my life out, Im just gonna be a wage slave for the rest of my life.

Everyday  for the past few months I think about ending my life, its starting to get annoying.

On top of that, you see people doing good in life or who got their shit together and you're reminded of how much of a failure you are.
