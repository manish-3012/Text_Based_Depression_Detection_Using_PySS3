Kid killed himself in schoolToday at SRVHS, a freshman committed suicide by drowning. And I feel no compassion let alone shock due to it. I didn't personally know the student, but still. How is suicide, death and tragedy becoming more normal? Where school shootings are about as common in conversations as the classes you are taking. I don't understand anymore.
