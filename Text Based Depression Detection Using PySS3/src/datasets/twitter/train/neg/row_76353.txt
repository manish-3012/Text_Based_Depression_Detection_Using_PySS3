online friend is suicidal-need advicehi,, iâ€™m new here and iâ€™m not sure if iâ€™m doing this right but

i met this friend through a game and we started talking on discord. donâ€™t know anything about him except that we live around each other, his secondary school and that weâ€™re both 16. recently one night he opened up to me about himself, and revealed that heâ€™s been bullied from young and has been diagnosed with depression.  has a family who doesnâ€™t care and said heâ€™s been suicidal these past few years and is gonna to kill himself after the release of our major exam results sometime this month. 

i told him iâ€™m sure itâ€™s hard and that heâ€™s super strong for dealing with this for so long,,

i really donâ€™t know what to do, i feel so useless because i canâ€™t do anything at all to help him. i donâ€™t even know his real name! i canâ€™t believe all i can do is sit around and support him while hoping he reconsiders

any advice at all is appreciated greatly! have a good day &lt;3
