Going through some rough time, but I also wanted to say thank you to everyone.I used to wake up every other morning thinking about ending it all, spent many years like that and I've posted a lot here. Seeing other people going through similar situations made me feel like I'm not alone and I'm not a freak. 

For the past 2 months I've genuinely wanted to be alive, and if not for my sake then for my family and friends who are very dear to me and I love them very much. Things are starting to look better, like I'll have a future that I can be proud of. It's unbelievable still because I was sure it was inevitable for me to end my own life and I thought that's the just thing to do. 

I definitely still got a lot to improve and sometimes I feel really bad, because I'm only here thanks to all the amazing support I have received, without my caring mother and a very close friend I consider more like a brother, without them my life would be impossible. Makes me feel like all I ever do is leech from people who care about me and that they would be better off if they didn't invest time and effort into me. I definitely haven't earned it so I don't understand why they compromise their lives to help me out. I bet my thoughts are irrational and I'm having a really bad episode right now, my body seems so disgusting and I feel completely inferior to others who are so much better than me. 

Thanks for reading this and don't worry everyone I'm gonna be fine, just wanted to share my thoughts and I hope the best for everyone.
