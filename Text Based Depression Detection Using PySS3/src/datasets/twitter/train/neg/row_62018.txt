today i realized iâ€™m alone.iâ€™ve been struggling with depression since i was about 15. i struggle to connect with others because i missed out on socializing in my early years (i.e. 15-23). iâ€™m now 29, in a new city, living with my two friends that only know each other through me and an odd situation that happened between us, (girl moved from australia and fell in love with my best friend. whatever) and with the new realization that iâ€™ve squandered all my time alive. 

iâ€™m a disappointment to my parents and family. iâ€™m struggling financially, socially, mentally, emotionally, physically (diagnosed with ulcerative colitis late last year.)

i truly hate the situation iâ€™m in and i want to be happy so badly but life keeps slapping me down. i havenâ€™t had a genuine connection with someone in such a long time. i feel so alone and like i canâ€™t talk to anyone besides someone i would have to pay to listen to me.

not in immediate danger. just need to vent. i hope whoever is reading this is doing well. probably gonna delete this in a bit because iâ€™m drunk ðŸ¥´
