i (f14) can't take it anymore after what just happenedchild sexual assault tw:

last night, my dad did things while he thought i was asleep. he's done the same several times throughout the last 3 years but not like this. his nails hurt really bad, i was already "bleeding" from the inside but it didn't even fucking repel him. 

he acts like everything is normal but right now i just wanna slice my wrists open. i've been just listening to music since he's let me have a day off school. lil peep, $uicideboy$, my friends, and followers are the only thing keeping me alive. i don't even feel much emotionally except anger and shock, i haven't even cried yet but i know it's gonna get worse.

i know i'm not gonna kill myself, but if i were to do it i would take some drugs. i only have a bit of experience with them, but i know that it's probably the only thing that's gonna keep me this numb.
