Will anyone even noticeWhenever I'm feeling suicidal I sincerely wonder if anyone will even care that I'm gone.  I reach out to people and barely get responses.  I barely even hear from my own family.  I try hard to stay put together for everyone and they don't even notice me.  I don't even know what to do anymore.
