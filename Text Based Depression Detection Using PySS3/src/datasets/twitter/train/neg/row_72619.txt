Having a tough morning, don't feel suicidal, but just out of rehab and no one to talk to. Can I still get help here? Just want someone to talk to.Sorry if I'm in the wrong spot, don't know where else to ask? Been trying to get in anywhere for help and am having no luck. Does anyone have the time or patience to let me bend their ear?
