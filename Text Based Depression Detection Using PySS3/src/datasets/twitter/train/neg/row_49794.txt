Now it's my turn.Couple of days ago I really started thinking about suicide. I tried to hang myself to see what it felt like and it felt like peaceful. But now I'm scared. I think I don't want to die. But I don't want to live this life either. I was so optimistic about everything. Tried to help people. Talked to them. But all I got in the end are just bunch of dissapointments. Every single fucking day is another dissapointment. I'm fucking tired. I really am. I began thinking about suicide years ago but these days I just can not take it. I can't cry man. How fucked up is that? I can't fucking shed a fucking tear. I miss my emotions. I miss when I was in love. But nobody fell in love with me? Why though? Why would someone fall in love with a monstrous looking motherfucker who they have never met before. To them I'm just a stranger. To all of them. I feel so fucking lonely. I fucked up everything. And I wish there was a way to delete everything. I'm so sick and tired of everything. Why me? Why 

I can't even change man. I don't want to be handsome. I don't want to be a better man. I just wanna fucking die. I don't even know why am I writing all of this and what to get from strangers from the internet. Rejection sucks man. And I feel stupid to tell people I want to die because some worthless whores didn't love me. I AM stupid. I don't want to live anymore. I don't know. I just don't fucking now. I hate my stupid fucking life.
