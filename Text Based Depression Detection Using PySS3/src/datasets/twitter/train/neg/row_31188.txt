I've quit therapy.After years of slowly opening up to many therapists, I finally found one who seemed to gave a shit 3 years ago. 

I finally opened up to her about being an incel. It's still relatively easy to open up about my past. It's not easy to open up about my loneliness... I told her just how deeply I yearned for a lover. Someone who'd just soothe the pain a little. Someone to hold me, something that could just help with the pain when years of meds and therapy and hospitalizations and alternative help and drugs couldn't.

"It's normal for teenage men to want a relationship."

We had brought up the idea of termination for a while but this was fucking it.

You don't get to tell me this loneliness is normal.

You don't get to tell me that carving "unlovable" all over my body is normal.

You don't get to tell me that having dreams of a woman's fingertips on my scars be more traumatic and horrifying and hurtful than any nightmare of my rape or parental abuse or bullying is normal.

You don't get to tell me that being unlovable is normal.

Fuck you.
