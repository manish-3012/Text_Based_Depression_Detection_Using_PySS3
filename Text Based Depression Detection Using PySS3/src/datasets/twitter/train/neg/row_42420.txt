I donâ€™t think I can take this anymore..Sorry if this will get long. Iâ€™m 16. Iâ€™ve been struggling with some really bad depression ever since I moved away from my now called â€œexâ€. I loved him so damn much and I was taken away from him to this stupid state Texas. Honestly It all just makes me want to kill myself. My ex broke up with me because he said it wasnâ€™t going to work out with me being in a different state, which I understand that it wasnâ€™t going to work out, but Iâ€™m still really suicidal about that shit.
Thatâ€™s all Iâ€™ve been thinking about this month; suicide. It feels like my life keeps getting worse and worse to the point where Iâ€™m thinking life itself just wants me to commit suicide. If I die I wonâ€™t feel this pain anymore.
Yesterday, two of my best friends left me. They thought I was too fucking depressed, they were right. And now something new today, my Ex said that heâ€™s not going to text or talk to me anymore and honestly I feel like I should just end it all tonight somehow. Iâ€™ve got school tomorrow and itâ€™s making me feel even more lonelier and stressed than ever. Everyone has left me. Nobody loves me.
