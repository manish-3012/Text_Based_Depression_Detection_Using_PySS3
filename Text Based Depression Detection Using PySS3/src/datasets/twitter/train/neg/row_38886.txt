I can't fucking do this anymoreI'm shit, life is shit, everything is shit.

I'm trans, and I can't keep fucking suffering like this. Every day I have a fucking panic attack when I wake up, and it continues throughout the fucking day. I can't live in this body anymore. I'm done.

I might fuckin just slit my wrists tomorrow when my parents are at work.
