Nothing to sayI posted on here a couple of days ago about a girl I was seeing, long story shortâ€” she ghosted me because the sex wasnâ€™t good and now sheâ€™s with my friend. Anyway Iâ€™ve just been reminiscing on the good times we had together, and seeing her have those good times with my friend, it fucking hurts. And I know with time Iâ€™ll get over it, but righth now an hour feels like an eternity. itâ€™s too fucking much for me to handle
