I had the world yesterday and now itâ€™s gone forever...Im a 25 year old man. I have a great life, I look attractive, I have money, i have many friends, a great family, a great job, life is good for me, I have no reason to feel like this but I just donâ€™t know what to do anymore. Iâ€™ve suffered from depression for years. Iâ€™ve tried to get help, Iâ€™ve tried talking to people but I canâ€™t get out of my head. Whenever Iâ€™m alone I just cry and want to die. 


I hate being at home. My mother is sick and isnâ€™t who she was when I was young. Sheâ€™s turned into a monster that tears my family apart because her mental diseases. I love my family but I canâ€™t deal with that anymore.


the past year was the best time of my life. I met the woman of my dreams. She was perfect to me. We had the greatest time together and she showed me a side of the world that I know Iâ€™ll never see again. She showed me what it meant to Really be in love with someone. We spent every single day talking to each other and hanging out. We had plans for the future, I finally found a place in my life where i was actually happy and nothing else mattered. She was perfect, amazing, unique, smart, beautiful, she has it all. But today she left me. She not only left me but she cut off all connections so I canâ€™t try to get her back. She said itâ€™s not me or anything Iâ€™ve done, sheâ€™s just not in love the same and didnâ€™t want to hurt me ever again. She was my everything.


I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m posting here. I donâ€™t know what I hope to achieve, but I canâ€™t deal with it anymore. I just want all this pain to disappear. I know itâ€™s selfish and itâ€™ll hurt a lot of people and Iâ€™ll be missed and itâ€™ll be a waste of life when Iâ€™m blessed with so many good traits.

Iâ€™m incredibly lost and on the edge...
