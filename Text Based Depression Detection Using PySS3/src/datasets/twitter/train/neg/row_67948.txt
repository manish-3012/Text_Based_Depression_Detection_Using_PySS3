What else is thereI've been self harming for years and over the past few months finally went to my doctor to try medication. So far I've been on 4 without any luck, the tranquilizers only help when I'm reaching a hysteric point. I saw a psychiatrist who said they think I have BPD but as far as I've heard that's just a very general disorder that everyone self diagnoses themselves with so it's not a "real" problem. I feel completely alone now. I have no one to talk to, my meds are failing, my state's stopped me from being able to get a job and every day is just this same droning misery. I'm just existing at this point. I keep visiting nice places I used to go to with friends and it rips my heart to pieces. I feel like ive died and I'm just a ghost wandering this neighborhood alone. The silence makes me want to scream and break things around me. I can't stand being so alone. Every day that I hurt myself I wish that I could just accidentally go too far. Then it would be too late to call for help and I could just be free. I don't see things getting better. So what's the point.
