Will death cure all pain?Hi everybody, 

I'm depressed for almost two years now. Or maybe just sad, i  don't know. 
I've been thinking about suicide for two years but i can't do it because i don't want to bring sadness to my parents and few friends i have. So i'm drinking everyday just to try cure inner pain. Also, i have job. I'm just sitting there, waiting for 5 pm. Then i'm going home, buying some booze and you know what's comes next. and this shit repeats for everyday. I don't want to wake up, in my fantasies i die while sleeping. So i guess i'll just have to wait 'till i'm completely alone in this shitty world and do the job right. My inner wounds will never heal. My life means nothing, i'm already dead inside, maybe it would be fair to be dead for real ? 
thanks for reading this shit
