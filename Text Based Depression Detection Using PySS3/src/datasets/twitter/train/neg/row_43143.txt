i'm not gonna do it tonightim 18, but i've had "suicidal thoughts" since before i hit double digits. 
i've been on meds since i was 12 or so, ive got lots of diagnoses, but i self undiagnosed myself with most of them. my life is very good now, really, but all the memories are the bad part. 
im so nervous and falling apart, ive got no one to talk to about it all. i dont really want any unsolicited advice from old dudes, but id like someone to be there for me is all. i dont let myself be vulnerable anymore because i dont have anyone to be vulnerable to
