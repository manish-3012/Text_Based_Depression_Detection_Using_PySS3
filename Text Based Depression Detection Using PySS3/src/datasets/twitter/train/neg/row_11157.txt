Will someone please just talk to me?I have been experiencing a lot of dissociative symptoms lately. Sometimes it takes me several hours upon awakening to figure out the basics if my life. Other times I feel like I'm not in the "real world," but somewhere else. Often, I'm not really anywhere. 

I have enough sense right now to know that I'm headed down a really bad path. I packed a few things, left home and am on my phone in an empty parking lot. I don't know what I'm doing or why (or even know for sure when it is), but I have some not good stuff with me. This is the start of a pattern I have that's really self-destructive and that often ends in something traumatic.

Will someone please just be there for me so I am distracted and don't do anything stupid?
