Please don't do it.My mom just told me someone I knew commited suicide today. I'm heartbroken. They left a young daughter behind, and with no one to take care of her now, she'll probably go to a home. This person was amazing and I was planning on seeing them next month. 

I just wanted to say this to anyone reading this post and thinking about it,

Please don't do it. 

Not because some random stranger on the internet told you to, but for yourself. You deserve to see just how amazing life can get if you hold on a bit longer. Death is a given, but it doesn't have to come so soon. There's just too much of life you haven't experienced yet. It's too soon. You don't belong there, not yet. 

No matter what your life looks right now, it's worth fighting through it. It always gets better, but only if you stay here to witness that.

You are strong enough and you can get through this. 

No matter what life throws at you, you can survive it. 

There is hope, there is help, and there are a lot of people that want you here, and people that will want you there in the future.

I hope I meet you someday, friend. 



I'm sorry if I messed up grammatically or if I made it clichÃ©, or didn't make it meaningful enough, English is not my first language and I'm still shocked and was barely able to type this out. Stay safe please.
