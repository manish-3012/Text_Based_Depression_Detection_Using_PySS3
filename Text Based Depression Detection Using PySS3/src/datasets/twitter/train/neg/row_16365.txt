I dont know what to do anymoreI am truly alone. 0 Friends. 0 Family. I just want to end it. All I think about is why it isn't easier to get a suicide drug. I hate being like this and just want to end it.

- I live in an Asian developing country. Been here 6 years.
- My immediate family and closest friends I've had, all stay in western developed countries
- I never really talk to them. Maybe once every 6 months.
- I'm in said Asian country cos I fucked up my education in said western country, and because of immigration laws, I'm in the Asian country. I cant even speak the local language!
- Of course I have to lie with something positive when asked why I'm in the asian country.
- I feel like I'm being screwed over at work but am too lazy to do anything about it.
- I'm always in constant shame because of point 4. 
- I feel suicide will remove the shame I've caused my family.

I'm constantly in the state of suicide and just want to end it, but dont have the means to do it peacefully. I dont know what to do anymore.
