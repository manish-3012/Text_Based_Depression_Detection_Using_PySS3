My plan to getout without hurting anyoneIâ€™m 24 and Iâ€™ve realized I will not find love ever. I tried to find satisfaction in hobbies really did but at the end itâ€™s not the same. Only one person really cares about me and itâ€™s my mom. Iâ€™m saving a decent money for now and my plan is to save as much as I can and once my mom leaves me Iâ€™ll donate all my savings to anxiety and loneliness research, volunteer myself into medical trials and leave and help the people as a final good deed. What happened to me should not happen to anyone
