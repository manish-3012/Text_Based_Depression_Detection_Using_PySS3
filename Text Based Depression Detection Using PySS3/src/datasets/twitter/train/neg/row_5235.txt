I put a date on my calendar of when I would roughly kill myselfIt's a really weird feeling when you tell yourself that you will commit suicide or at least consider doing it more often at a certain point and time. I really don't want to do it but the pain is getting worse and worse everyday. Each day I lose the will to live and keep going little by little. It's a scary feeling. I don't want to go but I don't trust myself to live life. All I'm doing is existing. 

I give myself until spring or summer. I hope things will get better during these next few months. God better make a miracle happen or I'll be gone... it's just too much for me... please come back...
