Please please help me. I don't know what to do anymore.I'm sorry to bother you all, but I don't know what to do anymore. I hate my life. I hate every bit of it. I feel like there's nothing left for me to go for in life anymore. Its extremely selfish of me but from time to time I keep thinking about how great it would be to finally end all my suffering and how great it would be to no longer feel so much distress and sorrow. My family has no money at all... We can't afford anything. I hate going through school and having all my peers stare at my old clothes, smile at my torn sneakers, and snicker at the fact that I don't have a cell phone... Its not even like I can get them back by succeeding in my future, because my family can't even afford me to attend college nevertheless community college. I hate my life. I hate how we can barely afford food, our home, and everything else. Why was I dealt with such terrible cards in my game of life. I don't think I'm a bad person, and I always do my best to help the people around me and treat them with respect. Why is this happening to me? I already suffered so much when I was little, but why am I still suffering? I hate my life, and I hate how nothing good ever happens to me. I feel terrible for burdening you all with my desire to hurt myself. I'm so sorry everyone, but I don't know what else to do and who to turn to.
