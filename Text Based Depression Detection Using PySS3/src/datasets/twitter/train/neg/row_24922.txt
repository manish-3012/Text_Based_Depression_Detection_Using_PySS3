I add nothing to this worldEver since I was a little girl I've been starved for attention. Would lie about getting praised in school to get attention from my mom, would make scenes just to be seen, etc, etc.

That has followed me into adulthood. I constantly need validation that I'm attractive and I honestly genuinely have no idea what I look like anymore because I've gotten people saying I'm hideous and people saying I'm beautiful and people saying I'm average. I don't know anymore and it drives me insane. A part of me does not want to exist in this world if I'm not physically perfect, because I feel like it's possibly the only thing I have to offer.

I'm a horrible, vain, self-obsessed person.

I don't feel like I have a personality. I kindof just become whatever I think the person I'm talking to will like. I don't have more that one or two things that I feel very strongly about one way or another. The few things I do care about, I feel like they make me unbearable to be around, because nobody else shares those interests.

My relationships have all fallen apart and at this point it must be me. I don't have any friends. My family doesn't speak to me, because I was molested and even knowing this they still would rather not ever see me again than stop talking to a pedophile. That is how horrible I am.

I tracked down my estranged father, who I've never met, and he told me he has no interest in knowing me.

People don't like me. I've heard people say I'm weird and awkward when they think I can't hear them. I make every social situation I'm in boring and uncomfortable.

My life is so mediocre and I add so little to this world that I genuinely don't know what the point is of going on. Nobody around me would be worse off if I was gone. The most horrible thing about me dying would be that there'd be some pressure on my boss to find a replacement as soon as possible.

I don't blame other people. I wouldn't want to be around myself either.
