nowhere to gomy mother nearly beat me today
growling and showing her teeth, calling me an useless bitch
threatening to beat both me and my brother, breaking my bedroom's window out of sheer anger
i wish i could escape, but it's too dangerous out there
i wish i could kill myself, but i can't even imagine leaving my dearest behind
i'm stuck in this limbo with nowhere to go
