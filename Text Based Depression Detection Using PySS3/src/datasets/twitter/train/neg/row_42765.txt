Almost attempted suicide againI got so mad at myself last night. It's just the usual, I hate myself and overthink so I get furious. I was drunk and high (yeah, I hate myself because of that too) and i got into my car, it was 3AM and I live in a small town so there was no one I could hurt but myself, and I wanted to drive into a wall. I was going to but I stopped because I have people who care about me.. But that's not enough for me, I hate my life and I want to end it. God, I really want to die
