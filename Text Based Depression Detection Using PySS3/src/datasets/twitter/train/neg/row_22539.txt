Feel very guiltyIt seems like every year around May, June, July or August I end up in a psych ward. Except this time it's worse because I have an one year old daughter. Her dad is a dead beat loser so if I die it would be up to my mum who I live with to deal with custody, my daughter and my death. How the fuck could I be so selfish and even think of doing that to her. She loves me and my siblings do to but they live in another country. 

Mum has gone to take baby for a walk so I thought I would reach out. I've attempted suicide 3 times but never had the courage to go through with it (hanging).  So I guess not attempted but was prepared and got very close to doing it. Had lots of drugs and alcohol...was at the right place and had the rope ect and that was when I was pregnant. How fucked up is that?

Now it's back again and I can't seem to pinpoint what the problem is except for the fact that I'm far too emotional and hate life so much. I love the people I have in my life but when you are so far down the rabbit hole no one can help. 

The guilty and shameful feelings about leaving my daughter will go when I die but I'm alive and obviously not brave enough to go through in the act but I fear that one day soon I'm just gonna snap.

Thanks for reading.
