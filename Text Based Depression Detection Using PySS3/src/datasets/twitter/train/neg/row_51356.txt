I'm afraid of myself.Let me start off by saying that I'm not a native speaker so I apologies in advance for any mistakes. Also this my first post ever in reddit so there could be some formating errors.
I'm 19 year old college student and I study in the USA as an international student. Today while I was working on an assignment my laptob crashed all of a sudden so I forced it off  and when I tried to turn it on again it simply didn't work. I tried multiple times then I got frustrated and I simply took a hammer and smash it ( I know stupid). Now, I know I could get angry easly, in fact, this happened many times before. So I wasn't that "worrried" about myself. What made me worry, however, is that after I broke the laptob I was still mad and felt the desire to hurt myslef so I went to the kitchen and took a knife and I almost stapped myslef before my housmate came to the kitchen to see what's going on and I acted as nothing was happening ( he heard some noises, I told him my laptop fell down) I'm really concerned, reddit. Hadn't come to the kitchen I would've stabbed myself. I never in mylife thought about suicide or harming myslef before, and when I'm angry I just take my anger on objects rather than others ( I know still wrong). What'sWhat's going on here? I should also mention that the finals are around the corner and I'mI'm a bit stressed.  Also I never went back home since I came here to study. Any advice or help would be highly appreciated.
