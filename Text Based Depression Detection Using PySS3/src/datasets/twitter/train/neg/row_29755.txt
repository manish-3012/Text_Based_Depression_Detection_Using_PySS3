Donâ€™t wanna die but donâ€™t wanna liveMaybe itâ€™s because none of my friends care about me and always leave me out. Maybe itâ€™s because Iâ€™m so ugly and skinny that Iâ€™m teased everyday. Maybe because my favourite artist XXXTENTACION was murdered. Maybe itâ€™s because my boyfriend constantly makes me feel like shit and ignores me all the time. Maybe itâ€™s because the smart classes are too smart for me as Iâ€™m really far behind. Whatever it is I wanted to just disappear or fall asleep and never wake up. My mum tells me depression is a selfish disease and that I only care about myself and i wallow in my own self pity because I only care about my self and why I need to volunteer and stuff but I really donâ€™t have the energy to do so. Maybe I am selfish and maybe thatâ€™s why everyone hates me which makes me want to die more.
