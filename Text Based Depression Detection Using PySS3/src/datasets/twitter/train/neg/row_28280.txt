What's the point?So I posted here a few days ago. Some very kind stranger managed to talk me down from the proverbial ledge. But I'm lying here and I have no idea what to do. Everything is so fucking pointless and futile. I don't understand why we live. None of it means anything. None of it affects me in anyway at all. I don't feel anything anymore. So why should I have to go on living, when all there is to life is this numbness? Everything we do just doesn't matter. Working, loving, everything, it doesn't make any difference. I don't matter to anyone, so why am I here? I hope I have the balls to end it before the week is up. I can't do this much longer.
