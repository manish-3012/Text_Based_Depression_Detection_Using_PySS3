An honest psychologist, "I think some people are outliers" (where everything goes wrong for them)This quote was a visit was from a year ago but it still resonates with me now because I am much closer to the end date.  He wasn't saying this to encourage suicide but to avoid the horrible drivel about "reframing my thoughts" that everyone else does. He listened (in shock) to the last few years of my life (and that only scratched the surface) and said this.  And it never stops being true.  My life is just not normal. The things that happen to me are so freakish and bizarre that if I listed them, I am certain someone would know who I am - or - you wouldn't believe me for a second (but I'd have to list 30-40 of them before you said - no way - this is BS).   

I wonder if other people feel this way - or understand what I mean by this "outlier" thing.  I think there is no better course of action, logically, not speaking as a "depressed person" to end one's life when nearly everything that can possibly go wrong does go wrong - in every facet of life.  It's been so exhausting to have to put up with a life like this, I can't even explain it.
