Finally TiredI finally snapped today. Ive been on the verge of snapping for quite sometime now. Its hard to be caring and loving when the universe wonâ€™t treat you the same. Ive tried. Hard. Ive given many second chances, but today I stopped thinking about giving that second chance. Im considering OD-ing on my medication of Concerta...I really honestly donâ€™t know what else to do.
