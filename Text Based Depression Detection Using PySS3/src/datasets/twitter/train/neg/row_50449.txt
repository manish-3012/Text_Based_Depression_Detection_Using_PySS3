I'm TiredI'm tired of fighting and I want to give up. I have been struggling with schizoaffective bipolar for almost five years now. I'm lucky in that it hasn't affected my functioning too badly but I'm tired of fighting it. I have to work so hard just to pretend to be a functional adult in social spaces and it sucks.

Its not all bad though. Along with the depression comes highs. My last high was two years ago. It snuck up on me like a thief in the night. I was constantly taking sleeping pills to sleep the days away when I wasn't working, I felt defective, and I felt depressed. Just all around shitty. Then one day I couldn't get the sleeping pills and I couldn't sleep.

The most amazing feelings came over me after like a day of not sleeping. I felt euphoric, like life mattered, I stopped buying sleeping pills, started exercising, I felt connected to life. Instead of thinking there were too many hours in the day, I started to think there weren't enough. I had to eventually go back on my medication because I started hallucinating but that feeling of vitality lasted about six months.

I said all that to say, I now feel disconnected from life. I feel like I felt before my period of positive energy. I don't care about anything. I go to work and play video games but that's it. I haven't paid my rent in months. I take Advil pm everyday to sleep. I don't care that I'm not taking care of myself. I dont care that my life is going to shit. I really want to go to sleep and not wake up.

I'm tired of fighting this illness, tired of living, nothing makes me happy in this life anymore I feel dead inside.
