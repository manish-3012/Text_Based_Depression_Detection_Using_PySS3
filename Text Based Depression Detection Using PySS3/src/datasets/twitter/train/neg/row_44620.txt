NowSo Iâ€™m currently in the shower. Just had my first outburst/argument with my dad (aka just yelling). Iâ€™ve been bored on vacation and today some of his coworkers invited me to go fishing on their boat wth their girlfriends included. I agreed because Iâ€™ll finally get some time away from my dad and actually have fun. Time comes when we re about to leave and my dad freaks out and says heâ€™s going with us because he doesnâ€™t trust them.

Iâ€™m almost 24. Iâ€™m an adult and have been living on my own since 18. I came on this trip to ultimately kill my self.

In the argument he asked to talk in private and I said no Iâ€™m not comfortable doing that. He stupidly asks why and I remind him of what he has done to me and my previous boyfriends.

He acts like those were not a big deal and justified and I actually told him the reason why I was here was to get closure with him and that I want to kill myself.

He things Iâ€™m over dramatic and is like â€œsuuure.â€ It pissed me off even more and walked to my hotel room. He works here so Iâ€™m worried he might come in.

I barricaded the bathroom door. Idk what to do.i had my suicide planned out but now idk. So Iâ€™m standing in the shower contemplating everything

Sorry this is half vent but idk where to post
