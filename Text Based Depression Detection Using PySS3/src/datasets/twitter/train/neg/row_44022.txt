Its my 25th birthday in 7 hours. and i would preffer not staying alive by then.This post is pathetic just like everything else i do. 

I am turning 25 in 7 hrs. There isnt a single good thing that i might have done, that i can think off. Even till now i am financially dependent on my father. I weigh a 100 kilos. Not really doing much work. 

And to top it all....i fell in love with a girl. and the day i confessed my feelings to her, was the last day we spoke. She doesn't even wanna acknowledge my existence anymore. 

Also before you people suggest that i seek help, pls know this that i have been seeing a psychological counselor weekly for more than a month now.  She says that i need to start respecting and loving myself. 

The problem is....i cant do that. There isnt a single cell in me thats worth respecting. 

Its funny, i remember being told in school that everybody is here for a purpose. I have lived 25 years.....dont even have a clue as to what that purpose is. 

I am engineer by education, hence i am kinda methodical in my approach to things. I have every thing in place. The pills, the bag...everything. 

I am just writing this cause i dont wanna be alone in my final moments. All i have ever wanted was love and companionship.
