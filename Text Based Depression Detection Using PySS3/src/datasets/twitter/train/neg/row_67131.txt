Just need a place to vent.23 years old, things changed after my concussion in 2015. That's when the depression and suicidal idealation set in. My past 3 relationships have been plagued with myriads of instability, it really has begun to feel like I'm the problem. I wish my brain was wired differently,  I've isolated myself the last few years, it's hard leaving the comfort of being alone sometimes. I'm always riddled with guilt on making my parents life harder. They fled a war torn country to work 7 days a week 14 hours a day for decades to give me and my brother a better life than they had. I'm so sorry guys. I'm so sorry I'm an emotional and financial burden I know I wasn't the child you envisioned having. I feel foolish, praying to a god that I may  not believe in to give me some form of a terminal disease so I can finally die. I'm a waste of this planet's resources and my families. I just want to get into medical school first. I know it's the one thing I can leave for my parents when I'm gone. Something to finally be proud of their son for. I've begun recording voice notes as of tonight, messages I can leave them. To tell them how sorry I am for being who I am. I'm sorry for being the black sheep of our family I'm  so sorry for the stress I've caused you guys. The needle is still under my dresser. With enough potassium.chloride to instantly induce a heart attack. Maybe one day I'll have the balls to actually push the plunger after pricking my vein. You both always deserved better.

-Your failure of a son.
