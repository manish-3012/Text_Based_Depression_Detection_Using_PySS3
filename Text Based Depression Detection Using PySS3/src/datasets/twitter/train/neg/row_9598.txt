It is cruel that I wake up everyday.There is no point in continuing my life. I serve as a complete punching bag to life and nothing else. Why should I fucking bother anymore if I am so incompetent?

Nothing will change and I can never be satisfied in my life. No matter what I will still feel this way. Also doesn't help that I am going on 2 months unemployed. Just shoot me at this point. All of this is bullshit and I cannot ever be thankful for existing.

No reward for living. Zero. I just ask for a permanent rest and for the sack of not being burdensome, I wished my mom just kicked me out of the house. I do not care about anything. If only I was authorized euthanasia but no, looks like I will have to research an effective method.
