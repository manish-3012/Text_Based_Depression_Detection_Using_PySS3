Life is in the gutters20M College Drop-Out, Debt, Unemployed, Anxiety/Anger Issues, canâ€™t drive without anxiety issues, slightly overweight by 20 pounds, no friends.


Only thing I have going is my family, I have great parents who let me live rent free, and great siblings I get a long with. If anything happens to them it will break me and if something happens to me it will break them. Iâ€™m trying to keep myself sane but Iâ€™m reaching my limit, having mood swings. Was crying thinking about how to land a job alone inside the car. I canâ€™t even stare at someone eye to eye, canâ€™t even pick up or call someone with a phone.

I was planning on joining the military if I go through my weight loss next year. But I canâ€™t see much with myself, I feel anger.

I feel so lost, I wish I could start again.
