My past year of life was a lieFor the past 10 months I've been lying to my family about pretty much everything. I even lied to my doctor I was out of depression and stopped taking meds. My self-destructive mind just didn't want to get better. I was so anxious at one point in time I couldn't even go outside for two months. As a result I dropped school and my part time job. Now my parents want proof that I'm still attending as they became suspicious. I have few hours to provide them with certificate I was promoted and if I don't they will just find out the truth on Monday. 

There's no way to live the lie anymore and I really see no way out. I would probably kill myself by now if I didn't meet person to live for and I can't hurt her by just giving up. Please help, how do I tell them?

EDIT: Okay thanks everyone, I decided to tell the truth - not sure how yet but I think I'll just sit and talk with them.
