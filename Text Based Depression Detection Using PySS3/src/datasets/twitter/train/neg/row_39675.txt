Im killing myself before my dad gets home at 3AM, just cannot fucking do this anymoreidk how there must be rope in the garage and well the other option is much worse.

i just cant deal with life anymore.  Depression really started as soon as I got to college.  Then I dropped out my 2nd semester of my 2nd year after just being in near total isolation and tying off tshirts to simulate strangulation multiple times.  Now ive sat at home for a year and a half just gaining more weight and hating myself more and more day by day

There is no hope on the horizon for me.  At 270 pounds id have to lose 100 to ever get women to care about me as thats my shitty reason for wanting to do all of this.  I put every slightly attractive woman off and just cannot even talk to the attractive ones.  Im 20 and have done nothing besides go to prom and get one kiss.  I cannot stand being a fucking loser anymore and id have to put in 2 years of daily going to the gym to even be competitive with the ugliest of my guy friends.

i just cant, its too much work, and ill be fucking 23 by that time and fun "youth" i missed out on ages 17 and up will be practically fucking gone.

i have about five hours to finally set myself fucking free I just need to go through this time
