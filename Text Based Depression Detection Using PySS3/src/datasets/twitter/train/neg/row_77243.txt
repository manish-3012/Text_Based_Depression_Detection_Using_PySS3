Tell Me

Tell me, why? Why canâ€™t I be happy?

What have I done? What should I be?

I did what I was told; I did everything expected of me,

So, why? Tell me why I canâ€™t be happy?

I continued; I made the bed; I strove my best;

I did everything, as told, but they still left.

Tell me, tell me now. Whatâ€™s wrong with me?

Do I really not deserve to be happy?

Please, just tell me, am I horrible? Am I cruel?

Tell me, am I unlovable or am I just a fool?

Tell me, what did I do? Make me understand.

Tell me what to do; I shall follow your command.
