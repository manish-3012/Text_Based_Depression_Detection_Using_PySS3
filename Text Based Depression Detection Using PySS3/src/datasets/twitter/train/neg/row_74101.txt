I don't know who needs to hear this, but it ain't easy. It definitely ain't.We are biologically *wired* to avoid death at all goddamn cost. The slightest hint of death and our bodies shoot into fight or flight mode. Admit it, it's just another buzz phrase because you don't accept our choice. Which is okay, but it doesn't make your perspective correct. 

You know what's easy? Sitting in your room all day, *thinking* about committing suicide. 

You know what's easy? Saying fuck it, and just roving through life, being miserable, without actually applying yourself  to anything. 

You know what's easy? Going to therapy and taking medications when they aren't helping. You're just doing it because people told you to. 

You know what's easy? Saving funds in order to purchase your exit plan. And you can stare at that bitch, day and night, and never do a damn thing. 

You biology, coupled with the uncertainty of death, kills your drive. Even if you aren't particularly afraid of death, the process terrifies you. 

It just takes a certain amount of pressure on the soul to get you to that point. But I tell you, it definitely ain't easy. There are videos of people who have access to firearms, and you can see them bracing themselves. So how about we fuck off with that exhausted fucking phrase already?
