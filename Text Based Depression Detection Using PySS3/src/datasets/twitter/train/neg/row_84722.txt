Doesn't it feel pointles as fuck when u know hoe its gona endI've been like this ever since I was little I swear my earliest memory is of my dad beating me when I was like 3 or something. N the way all hose events when I was younger trickled through my life like it's not like I'm stupid , are extremely non sociable or anything I just have this honest to God fucking crippling anxiety that pops up when I'm alone. I've got some xanax and alcohol n am ready to end it I've tried getting help. It's honestly being alive every moment feels like im trying to distract myself or I just get the feeling of sadness n my eyes sting trying not to cry, I'm in my last year of highschool, and I don't know what I could do with my life. I see no future cos I don't think I'll ever improve it's like I know I'm going to die young nomatter what
