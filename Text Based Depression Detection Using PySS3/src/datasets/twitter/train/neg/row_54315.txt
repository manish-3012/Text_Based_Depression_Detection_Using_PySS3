I don't want my life anymore.Like I wish I could just transfer my years of life to someone who would do something with it instead of me. I've waisted my life. My ex used to scream in my face how I am nothing and I've done nothing with my life but I honestly was at least trying before him. He hurt me in so many ways and then just became a tinder patrolling fuck boy after we broke up. His birthday was this week and coupled with Valentine's Day I am really struggling with loneliness and depression. 
I want to go on his page and see all of our mutual friends who wished him happy birthday so I can delete them out of my life forever. If they don't want to believe he abused me I don't want them to be a part of my life. But I have been able to refrain from letting my pain act out in any way. I haven't had a steady job in years and barely get enough freelance to survive. It destroys my self esteem worse than he or my parents did, and that's saying a lot. I used to really be confident and like myself but now I just find everything and everyone so exhausting and overwhelming that I just wish I could die. I think about it a lot. I already tried to poison myself last year when he was telling me I was telling me I was disgusting and a whore and meeting up with outer girls and lying to me about it. I feel isolated after learning that he and my parents are narcissistic abusers and I have no one.
