Nothing is great in this worldEverything u see in this world has a greatness and weakness. So in this world nothing is great. ADVANCED tech example, people always wonder high tech is something wonderful. But its overated. Advanced tech still shit to me. Cuz the weakness so mind blowing. So this world are same. About advanced tech look at wars. 70 years ago nazi had advanced tech but still lose against allies old tech. So, still thinking abou wonderful tech. 


The ugliest is people also stealing another people tech. I know, this earth is like a colloseum. The gladiator is a people around the world who fight each other for domination in different way. everyone always glorifies the country, sometimes race, religion and ideology.  that's why I'm sick of this world.  every human being always kills each other for it.  I just hope the world is 100 percent changed.  a tragedy that can make humanity remember because of its bad nature.
