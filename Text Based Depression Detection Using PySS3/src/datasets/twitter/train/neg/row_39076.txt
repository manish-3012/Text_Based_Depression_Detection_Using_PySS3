How could anyone blame someone whoâ€™s suicidal when we didnâ€™t ask to be here?I honestly donâ€™t understand this clown world. I was thrown into a world with a bunch of people who donâ€™t give a rats a** about me. Forced to be a part of a race that I would have never chosen to be a part of. Forced to wear this hideous face my whole life but yet If I want to kill myself Iâ€™m the bad guy? Can someone explain this to me? Suicide is the one choice a person actually has to truly be free but weâ€™re the crazy ones.
