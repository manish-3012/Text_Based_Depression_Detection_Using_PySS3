The doors keep closing.I've tried. I've tried and tried and tried. I feel like I've done everything I can. I've gone through medication, I've tried therapy, I've tried counselling, I've tried talking to close friends, relatives, people I trust. But nothing works. Nothing ever helps. I can feel it, see the doors closing one by one. And I feel like there's only one option left. And I'm afraid. Terrified. I don't know what to do anymore. I don't want to die, any more than anyone else, but I don't know what to do. I'm running out of options. Justifications. Reasons. Every night I dream of death, and every day I just wish I could die. But I don't want do. I'm growing weak. Oh god, I'm growing so weak. I hide behind smile after smile, I hide behind a person that others want to be around... but I can't take it anymore. I can only see one door anymore. Please. Somebody. Anybody. I'm out of options, and I don't know what to do.
