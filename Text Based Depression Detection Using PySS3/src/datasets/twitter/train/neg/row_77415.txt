I should end it nowIâ€™ve been through so much and I just canâ€™t take it anymore. I need to kill myself. Iâ€™ve think about it everyday. I look at my life and wonder why me? My dad abandoned me as a child. I was molested by a family member. My step used to abused me and during that same time I was being heavily bullied by peers. My mom left to live with her bf. Iâ€™ve love so many and havenâ€™t been loved back. My past has caused me to be shy and I have no friends. My family that I have barely talks to me. Iâ€™m gay and nobody understands the pain of being unwanted so much. I tried loving myself but I hate everything about me. I canâ€™t live as myself Iâ€™d rather be straight or a female because Iâ€™m tired of being gay itâ€™s only add fuel to the fact that I have no friends or family. So many people on here say they are suicidal and add I have my gf or mentioned their families. I would kill to have people who cared about me. Being black doesnâ€™t help either it feels like a burden than something to be proud of. Iâ€™ve never experienced broad racism but Iâ€™ve experienced it through the way people treat me and talk to me. Iâ€™ve gained so much weight from my depression thereâ€™s no return. Iâ€™m at a point where I get triggered by see people just because they are happy and I want to be happy too. And the crazy thing is I know they might not be happy but Atleast they feel happy at all. Iâ€™m never happy. Iâ€™m worthless. I just wish I was aborted. I never asked for this. Iâ€™m ready to go.
