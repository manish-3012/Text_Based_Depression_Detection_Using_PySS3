i am sick of who i am and the only way to change it is to cease to existi have fought for close to 5 years to feel happy or feel like i am enough and i am so tired. i will
never be enough and i will never learn to not base my validity off of affection from others. please someone help me. i want to feel alive again. ive started to consider that i might suffer from some form of cotards delusion. i want to hurt myself to feel. i want to come so close to losing my life to cherish it. ive always had the thought of persuing having electro convulsive therapy conducted on me to see if it would help but now i want to
be fully conscious to feel my soul leave for a breif moment... death has me in its grip it just wont squeeze tight enought to kill my fat ugly being.  my sobriety even feels like a waste. im sorry i just dont have anyone to express any of this too :(
