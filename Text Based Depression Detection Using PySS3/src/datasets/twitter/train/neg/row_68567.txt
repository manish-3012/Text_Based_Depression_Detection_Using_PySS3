Going back to nicotine again after being nicotine free for nearly two yearsIâ€™ve been on the verge of a major mental breakdown for months now and because of this panic thatâ€™s just getting worse my mental health has been rapidly declining more each day. Today, after being nicotine free for almost two whole years I started smoking again. The stress was just too much. Today I also relapsed with self harm, I lost track of how long I was clean tbh I just feel so terrible all the time nothing I do even makes me even remotely happy anymore all I can think about now I how much I wish Iâ€™d just drop dead. Iâ€™ve even thought about overdosing on caffeine and hoping my heart will just give out. If this doesnâ€™t stop soon I feel like I really will die, and Iâ€™m not even scared.
