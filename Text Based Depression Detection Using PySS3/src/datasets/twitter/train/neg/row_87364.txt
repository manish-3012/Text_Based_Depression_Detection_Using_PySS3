Wanted to kill myself 3 days ago, so i took somewhere around 20,000 to 40,000 mg of advil. Telling someone is not an option so what should i do?Wanted to kill myself a few days ago, so i took somewhere around 20,000 to 40,000 mg of advil. this was exactly 3 days ago. the first 2 days i felt very sick but now i feel perfectly fine and nothing is visibly wrong. I regret taking them but i also can't tell anyone or else i would be sent to the mental hospital for like the next year, which id rather die than do since ive been through all of that already. what should i do? just say fuck it and see what happens or go to the ER?
