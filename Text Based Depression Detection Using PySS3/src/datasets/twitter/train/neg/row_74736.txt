TMI alert weird thoughtsI canâ€™t be the only one that either gets incredibly suicidal, wanting to harm or incredibly horny right?? I mean whatâ€™s that all about?? I canâ€™t be the only one that uses sex as a distraction right? My nearly husband thinks Iâ€™m just wanting him all the time which in some way I do but mostly, itâ€™s just a distraction technique. Like Iâ€™m either gonna try and kill myself or have an orgasm. Only thing is when the buzz of that goes I then get super anxious and suicidal again. Sorry too much information.
