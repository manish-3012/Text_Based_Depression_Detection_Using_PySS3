My life doesn't matterI will just be another number, another statistic. It won't matter if I was gone because I was never here in the first place. 18 years of my life that I will never get back. I'm a waste of space, a waste of a life. Everyone thinks I'm crazy because I hear voices or that I've been in a mental hospital for three weeks. Maybe because I take all of these meds and therapy. 

No one ever cared or will care about me. I never will reach my goals because I'm so stupid and lazy. I will never have a girlfriend. All I do is cut myself and cry. Nick, no one cares about you. Nick, your not good enough to live, Nick just kill your self. This pain will never go away. I just want to be dead right now, I don't want to see another day living like this. Life will never get better. Game over I lost, goodbye.
