My story, to whoever cares (19 F)Hi, this is my first Reddit post. Sorry if it's bad. Also, mobile user.

My life has pretty much just been blow after blow at this point. Heart surgery, lost all my siblings before they were even born, depression, etc. I've been picking up the pieces repeatedly, but honestly, I dont see the point anymore.

I was involved in a recent devastating wildfire that took almost everything from me (except my family and pets, I'm lucky enough to have them here.) And just ruined me. 

I was stuck in the town while the fire was taking place, and there was smoke everywhere. I would've died if it wasn't for a kind firefighter, and I'm so grateful, but I just cant help but feel like everything has gone downhill. I don't have money for therapy, most of my "friends" are really really unhelpful and rude, and my ex-boyfriend broke up with me because I was sad/mad/terrified about the fire. I dont know how that was my fault, but it didnt help with my suicidal thoughts or depression.

I'm here now, about, 6 or 7 months after the fire, in my new home, still very very sad, and still wanting to die. I feel like if I go, the pain will stop. I just dont want to leave my pets. My cat and dog are the world to me. 

Sorry if I'm all over the place, and if anything's against the rules, please tell me. I read them like fifteen times but my heads just jumbled and scared for doing this. Thanks for reading, if you got this far.
