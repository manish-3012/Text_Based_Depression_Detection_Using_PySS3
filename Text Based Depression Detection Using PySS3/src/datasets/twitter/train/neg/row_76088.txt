Having a panic attack, just trying to make it to morning.Can someone talk with me? Waiting for 6 or so hours until I can see family, I'm going to ask for real help - I know it's getting to the point that I really need it - 14 story fall is looking really good right now but I'm just trying to hold out till morning. 

Can someone talk with me, keep me company? Trying to deep breathe, but hearing my own breath, or voice talking myself down, or meditation or Netflix etc, nothing is helping. I just don't want to feel so alone right now, but I feel like my soul is being sucked from me, and literally crushed, I literally feel like my soul exists and it is being crushed to death, and I just need a friend or something, anything, just want to stop feeling like my existence is just plain and suffering and that I can't escape the hell hole that is my mind and my own thoughts. 

Please, can someone chat with me?
