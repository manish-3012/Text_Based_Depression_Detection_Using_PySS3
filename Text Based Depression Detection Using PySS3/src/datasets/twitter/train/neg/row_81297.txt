I just want it to end.I'm too tired to even say what I want to rn. I just need this to end. I am beyond exhausted; fighting a battle I will never win. It's been too fucking long. Nearly half of my life just trying with no end in sight. I just want it to end. Please just make it stop, I'm out of fight.
