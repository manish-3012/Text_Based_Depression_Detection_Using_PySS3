Not sure how to helpSo my boyfriend failed out of med school in the spring and it has caused him to dive into a deep depression. I am the only one that he confides in and even after reading as many resources I could find I am still having trouble navigating the situation. What makes it even harder is that I am away on leave for work and the distance between us has definitely put more stress on both of us. More recently he has spoken about not being able to take it anymore, that he has nothing to live with, and he keeps trying to push me away saying that it will be easier for him to die if I am not in his life anymore. I have always just tried to be supportive of him and just be there for him as someone he can openly talk to without judgment. 

Additionally, this has taken a toll on me on the one hand I want to let him just push me away and cut ties but the fear of if I let go he will feel completely alone and will just end his life scares the shit out of me and I don't know how that would weigh on me for the rest of my life. 

Looking for any help this community can offer. Thanks.
