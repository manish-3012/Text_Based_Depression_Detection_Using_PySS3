No help this timeLet me start by saying I don't have a good reason for any of this. I feel like all or the bad in the world and everything around me is my fault. Most of my issues revolve around knowing the world would be a better place without me. I would feel like a selfish person to do something like this. It would hurt the people I'm close to. I'm sure with time they will realize they are better off. The last time I seriously contemplated this was about 5 years ago. By happenstance I got in contact with a fellow veteran(who actually had reasons for being fucked up) who also had issues. He talked me down and was very relatable . He continued to Check in on me for the next two weeks and suggested I speak to someone and perhaps get medicated. I tend to become a hermit after my depression so naturally I didn't contact to many people until I felt a little better. At my next drill I found out the man who had helped me took his own life. How could someone be there for me.and I couldn't be there for him. Why didn't he reach out? What do I do now? Who do I turn too? Why can't I do anything right?
