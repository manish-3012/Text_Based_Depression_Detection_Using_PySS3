This is where I'd put a title if I cared enough to think of one.One time, years ago, my heart was broken and I ran out of friends and I called a suicide hotline and felt dismissed.

I stayed alive and things moved up. I fell in love with someone new and made new friends and graduated college and lived successfully by myself.

But now things are like before except I can see how I've changed. I have a few friends until I tell them how I feel. My heart was broken again and, unlike last time, I don't care enough to fix it and let anyone else in. I planned to kill myself about six months ago and didn't and I can't remember why I didn't.

I think this is a funk. A long one, but a passable one. But I don't get out of bed and I don't care that people forget I exist and I see the backs of heads of people I know and avoid them because I can tell I'd be a bother.

I'd like to never wake up and I know if I didn't very few people would even realize I'm dead where I lie.
