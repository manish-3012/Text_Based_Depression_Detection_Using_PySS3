Say I were to actually go through with it - how can I make it easier on the people around me?Been thinking about this all weekend, I know I'm running out of juice and have been on-and-off suicidal for a while. I won't go into major details, but this weekend has basically sealed the deal for me and I have started putting the ball in motion.


People often talk about how suicide is the coward's way out and how selfish it is. Maybe it is cowardice because I don't have the courage to face the rest of my life and the difficult times ahead, the selfish thing I don't fully buy into. But at any rate, I know it would be most difficult for the people around me.


I've lost many family members in the past, including my parents, and I know how difficult post-mortem stuff can be. I'm updating all my online account passwords and writing them down to make it easy for people after me, removing all my monthly subscriptions, deleting accounts I don't need, making sure all bills are up-to-date. Most of my affairs are completely in order and I'll have money set aside and accessible for my funeral as well.


The big concern is loved ones, what can I do to make it easier for them? My marriage has been falling apart for a long time, but I don't want to drop all this on my wife. What could I even say in a suicide note if I were to leave one? People generally write something, what do they even say? I don't even have any words, I just want to go away and not be part of this anymore, but I have to leave something behind.


What can I do?
