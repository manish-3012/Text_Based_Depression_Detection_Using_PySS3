Suicidal IdeationI'm a 27 year old female and I just got married about a week ago. I've been thinking of killing myself ever since I was 8 years old... I cannot live by society's standards. I have a full time job (ironically at a mental hospital) and I find myself calling out a lot due to severe depression and anxiety. There are days where I can achieve anything and then there are A LOT of days where I cannot get out of bed. I was a loner from 3rd grade through my Senior year of high school. Literally had no friends and painfully shy... My parents are extreme hoarders and I felt ashamed of my living conditions. My brothers and I should have probably been taken away by DFS because of the dirty conditions we lived in-- Animal feces, dirt, trash,  etc. I slept with gnats in my bedroom...and I didn't know any better.  Don't get me wrong-- I love my parents and they are good people. They just didn't know what clean was. I struggle visiting my parents now and I feel so much GUILT still because now their hoard is even worse... I try to help them, but I mentally cannot and physically become overwhelmed too easily. I want to die because I cannot stand the way I feel, but I want to live because I cannot stand the thought of my husband losing me and my family losing me and pass the guilt I feel onto them. I hate working full time. I hate that money is so important yet I cannot afford anything outside of our bills... Yes, I've been medicated. I've been on 4 types of antidepressants and Cymbalta helped me until January of this year where I became extremely suicidal and got myself off of it. The withdrawals were awful.  I felt better off of it and now here I am again feeling like I need to take my life.  I don't understand people who have never been depressed. My husband is very supportive but he admits he doesn't understand someone being depressed. Am I chemically imbalanced or do I just think too much ?
