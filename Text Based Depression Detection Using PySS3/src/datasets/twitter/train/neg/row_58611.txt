3 months worth of morphine and vicodinIn front of me right now. Been saving it up.

4 years of chronic pain. Fiance left me because he didn't want to take  care of a sick person his entire life (despite the fact that I financially supported us for 6 years). Disability harassment and mobbing at work while taking care of dying father/former abuser. Dad dies. Fiance leaves. I make it a year and then tried to off myself. Opiate overdose overturned with narcan. Friday I lost my job. They said it was due to "downsizing" (my performance was unassailable) but I was the only one downsized and right after I returned from an approved FMLA leave. They are trying to make me sign paperwork stating my job ended in May, before I took leave, before they will release my final paychecks. Oh, and my poor elderly mother had to become my physical caretaker, but now I am going to be both a financial and physical burden. My brother comes to visit 8/08. I figure if I off myself now he'll be there for here somewhat.

So broke, alone, and in constant pain. Tired of fighting. Afraid of failing this time. 

Staring at these bottles for two hours makes me hate myself even more. What a coward I am...
