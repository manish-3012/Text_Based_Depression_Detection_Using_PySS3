I miss my friends already. I don't want to be alone.It's been one day of summer vacation and I hate it already. I want to die even more than before. I just want to be my friends but that's not even possible because of my parents who don't even care about me. I've been alone forever and I won't even be able to contact my friends through my computer. I will certainly die alone in the next month. I guarantee it. I'm not going to last without seeing anyone I care about. I've always been suicidal but nothing like this before. I wish I could be back in school. 

I'm ready to kill myself tonight, even. Yesterday I saw the girl I love for what I know will be the last time. I saw her smile and it made me happy for just a second. It's not worth it living without her. She means the world to me and doesn't even know it. It's just that if there's anything that will make her smile, I will do it without thinking. Nobody understands that I'm in love with my friend's girlfriend. It's not like anyone would care. I could disappear off the face of the earth today and nobody would even give a fuck. I want someone to talk to. I need someone to care for me more than ever right now. I know she'll never be my girlfriend or whatever and that doesn't matter to me. She is still the nicest person I've ever met and I just want to be her best friend. She's the only reason I've been living through the past few months and I'll never see her again.
