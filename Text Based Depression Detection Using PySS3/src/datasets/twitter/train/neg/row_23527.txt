I want to tell someoneBut my anxiety is keeping me from telling certain people that I want to end my life due to not being able to find the love and affection I need. My body craves it. My mind requires it or I just get unhinged and want to just wither away and die from loneliness and starvation. That or just hang myself. Long story short. Growing up I got sent to timeout a lot. Rarely got detention but got bullied from kindergarden all the way to high school until I out lifted a football player. From that point on no one fucked with me. Still don't know how I pulled that off. Being 220 and a little soggy around the midsection. You would think something like that would make me happy but since my surgery 3 years ago to remove 2/3rds of my right lung I can sometimes barely lift a 32 pack of diet soda. All I want is a loving woman and some affection   Call it touch deprived if you want to. But I'm at the point where if something doesn't improve soon I am going to relapse on alcohol and then just fucking end it. I hurt and this shit must END. I can't deal with it any more
