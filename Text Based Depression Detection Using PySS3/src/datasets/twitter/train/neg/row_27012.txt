I'm afraid if I break up with him, he'll kill himselfI've been in a long-distance relationship with someone for several months and I'm unhappy. He wants to stay in this relationship with me forever, but I'm not exactly mentally stable myself right now, and I don't think I can commit to that when neither of us are really on solid ground mentally.

The thing is, he's expressed suicidal thoughts to me countless times. I'm legitimately one of the only reasons he's alive and he expressed to me that if it weren't for me, he would probably have killed himself by now. (He didn't do this to manipulate me into staying with him, before anybody brings that up; he was discussing his suicidal thoughts and the conversation turned to that.)

I'm terrified that if I break up with him, he'll try to kill himself and I won't be able to stop him because of the distance between us. I have no idea how to proceed. I don't want to be in a romantic relationship with him anymore, but I'm terrified of losing one of my best friends in the world. I can't stand much longer of being in this relationship, but I couldn't bear to be the cause of somebody taking their own life.
