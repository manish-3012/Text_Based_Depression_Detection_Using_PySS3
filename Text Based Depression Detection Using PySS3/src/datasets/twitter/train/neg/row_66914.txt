Life sucksI had a clean streak for like a week and now everything has crashed back down to hell. I want to be a boy, I hate being in this body and being called a girl and she/her all fucking day, I labeled myself as NB cause I thought people would find it weird if I was out as a boy and now all of this shit is making me 10x more suicidal and I got a new blade and Iâ€™m cutting deeper. I do dance and every time I go, I want to die, Iâ€™m to feminine to ever pass, I hate it so much, my dance dress is sleeve-less and now everyoneâ€™s gonna see my fucking cuts/scars and now I canâ€™t receive help mentally cause everyone is fucking booked out and I just want to fucking die and not have to deal with this anymore.
