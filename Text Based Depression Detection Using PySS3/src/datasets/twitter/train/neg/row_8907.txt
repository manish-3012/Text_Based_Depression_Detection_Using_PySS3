I just need this to get out thereIâ€™ve been feeling lots of terrible thoughts for the last few weeks. Not long ago, my girlfriend was raped by someone she thought was a friend. Weâ€™re in a long distance relation so I canâ€™t be there for her. Iâ€™m distraught that something so bad can happen to someone as pure as her. Iâ€™ve been trying to give her the support and care she needs, it just hasnâ€™t been working.
A friend of hers was there and he could give her physical support. I canâ€™t do that. I was happy that she wasnâ€™t alone, but it just broke me when she stopped talking to me. She told me that sheâ€™s gained affection towards him. Itâ€™s broken me. I canâ€™t be there to support her, and this happens. Weâ€™ve to still talk to each other and try sort things out. All my life, Iâ€™ve had nothing but ups and downs, mostly downs. Not too long ago, I was assaulted and Iâ€™ve had ptsd from it. I will often wake up in the middle of the night crying because I canâ€™t stop reliving the moment. I donâ€™t want her to leave me because sheâ€™s the only thing keeping me going. Iâ€™m not an idiot when it comes to realising that yes, sheâ€™s had an extremely traumatic experience happen, and Iâ€™ve done nothing but try and support her. Iâ€™m just scared for my future. Is she leaves me, the one reason to keep me pushing and going will be gone. I donâ€™t want to end it but if it happens, I just might

Iâ€™m sorry that this has to be read by some poor soul, Iâ€™m just at my end
