My last thoughts.. I wanted to come on here and tell my story, of when it was the beginning of the end.

When I was a baby, I was rapped by a family member. I donâ€™t really remember what and how it happened but I was told later on in life, when I was about 4/5 I was rapped by different family member. And this time I did remember but wasnâ€™t sure if it was a dream or something that actually occurred, which just about 2 years ago was confirmed it was real. When I was in 4th grade I was sexually assaulted by a different person, and then my dad was murdered. Which took me into a great Depression because he was all I had, after his death in 2010, I was rapped AGAIN by yet another person from 6th grade up until 8th grade. and if that didnâ€™t seem like enough my freshman year it happened for the last time.. 

So I been rapped and sexually assaulted my entire life , from different people. And I know itâ€™s sounds very dumb to say but it felt kinda normal.. like if this happened to everybody, until I was asked about it at school because a counselor noticed some red flags, I told them who it was at the moment and that person is currently in jail. And because he was a family member, my mom hated me for it. She treated me like shit and proceed to make me feel like it was all my fault and that I was in the wrong. I started looking for alternatives to escape my reality and started doing drugs , and running away.. typical teenage things. But I ended up pregnant. At 15. My mom kicked me out and the father of my child took me in..

He cheated on me my whole pregnancy, but I had no where to go. So I forgave him, and he has cheated on me the whole 5 years we have been together if Iâ€™m being honest, but I stayed. I didnâ€™t finish school, itâ€™s quite difficult to find a job and I stay home and watch the kid, clean and cook ect. A couple of months back we talked it out and he said it would be his last time cheating and I believed him.. 

On Friday, I had a mental breakdown, I cried and cried and cried for hours about how much I hate my life and how bad I wanted to end it , because I have no family, no friends and I canâ€™t stop reliving my past, Iâ€™m still heart broken about my dads death And to top it off Iâ€™m constantly worried about him cheating on me and he hugged me calmed me down , and did everything he was suppose to do to and reassured me that I have him and thatâ€™s all that should matter, â€œOur little familyâ€ 

Yesterday night, he fell asleep with him phone on, and I felt like I had all the right to look threw it.. and he was indeed still cheating, not with 1, not 2, not even with 3 but 5 females.. ðŸ’” and Iâ€™ve havenâ€™t stopped crying since.. idk what to do anymore. After he sat there and watched me cry for hourssss he look me straight in my face and lied. And now Iâ€™m on the edge, all I was fighting for was â€œusâ€ and I didnâ€™t even have that.. 

These are my last thoughts. And I canâ€™t wait to end the torture that is my life once and for all
