A Numerical Model for MoodI would like to explain how I view my mood and life as a whole.  I tend to think of matters mathematically.  Imagine a scale from -10 to 10, with -10 being the worst I could possibly be feeling, 0 being neither happy nor sad, and 10 being the best I could possibly be feeling.  Now, I'm not going to lie and say that I'm always at a -10 because that's simply not true.  However, I am almost always somewhere in the negative range.  Sure, there are those rare occasions in which I may jump up into the positive range temporarily, but the average value is deep in the negatives.  I have not just been feeling this way recently.  What I am currently describing defines how I have been feeling for as long as I can remember.  Now to suicide.  Suicide would remove me from the scale entirely, as I would be unable to experience neither positive nor negative emotion.  Because this can't really be quantified, let's call it the closest thing: 0.  I think we can all agree that a negative value is less than 0.  So committing suicide would increase the value of the way I feel according to this scale.  Many people claim that suicide is the result of an irrational, emotional outburst, but I have been thinking this through for a while.  I would like to hear other peoples' opinions/perspectives on this model or anything else that I have expressed above.
