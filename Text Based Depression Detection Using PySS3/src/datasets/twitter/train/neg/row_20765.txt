Depressed and now starting divorce.Long story short wife cheated by flying to another state to meet what she told me was a friend. I checked her phone and found more than just friend talk. We have been together 8 married 6 years. Have a medically complex child.
My parents are on one coast and my wife and I and child have been on the other where her family is. I've been dealing with depression most of my life. It's not controlled. I'm off and on my meds due to forgetting or lack of money.
She wants a divorce. Doesn't want marriage. Doesn't want a separation first. Wants it all right now. I don't know what to do.
She says she doesn't want child support and wants me to do what I want live there or move back to my parents. I can't leave my son but I want a family. I don't a want to be a part time dad but she's leaving me no choice. It's all her way right now.


Also will post on suicide watch later. The thoughts have been more pronounced. I just don't know what to do.  I've only thought about driving off the road. That's always been there prob since high school.
