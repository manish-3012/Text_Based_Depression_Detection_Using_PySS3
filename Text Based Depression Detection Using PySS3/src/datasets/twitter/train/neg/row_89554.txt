Having a painic attack, gun in mouthI've wasted my goddamed life doing nothing, i've got nothing to show for anything. Why have I neglected everything I could've done? I could start now, but the world is too competetive so it's far too late.  Death is inevitable anyways, no more alarms, early mornings, idiots, or time to worry about wasting.
