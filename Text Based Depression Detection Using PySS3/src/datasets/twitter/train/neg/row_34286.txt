I donâ€™t know what to do anymore.I keep telling myself that I would never kill myself, no. I couldnâ€™t do that to my mom, my friends, any of that. Now, though? I donâ€™t know if thatâ€™s the truth anymore. My life is shit. I have chronic health problems that make just everyday living hell. I can hardly leave my house. I canâ€™t sleep, I can never sleep. Iâ€™m so overwhelmed with everything in my life and I canâ€™t cope with any of it. I stopped self-harming a few days ago and Iâ€™m trying to stick with it but Iâ€™m just so sick and tired of everything. I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m telling the truth when I say Iâ€™m not going to kill myself or if Iâ€™m lying to myself. Every day is the same old thing and it gets worse and worse. I donâ€™t want to be here anymore. As soon as my momâ€™s gone, Iâ€™m out. I canâ€™t do it. I canâ€™t keep going like this. Iâ€™m so tired of everything and all I want to do is go to sleep and not wake up. I canâ€™t handle this anymore. I just want to be a normal teenager again. I never asked for any of this. I donâ€™t want any of this. I just want it to stop and it feels like death is my only out. I try to live for the little things but itâ€™s starting to stop working. I want to be free of all of this.
