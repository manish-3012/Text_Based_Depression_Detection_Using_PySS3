Parents rejected me for beings trans. I want to give up.I just feel so empty inside. I came out over a year ago and thought things were getting better. But then, 2 nights ago the told me to take off my girl clothes because it makes them uncomfortable. 

Thats when I realized they will never accepted me as their daughter and idk what to do. I just feel so hurt and sad and I just wish i had been born right so I wouldn't have to deal with this pain
