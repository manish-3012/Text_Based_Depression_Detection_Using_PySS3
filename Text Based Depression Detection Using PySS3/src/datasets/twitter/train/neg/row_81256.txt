Questions for a suicide survivorHey everyone, first off I'd like to say how sorry I am you're in the SuicideWatch subreddit. You're in a very lonely place and Im sorry for that. Please know I have felt your pain, I myself have attempted suicide four times, and have obviously survived each time. Im going to be making a youtube video where I answer questions any of you might have in regards to surviving suicide, how I felt during and after my attempts, and what steps I took to get better. So please feel free to leave a question, any question and I'll either answer it in my video or directly here on Reddit. Thank you and stay alive.
