(15yo) I don't think I will make it through the end of the year.  I dont think I will see the ball drop in NYC.  I don't think I will ever see my friends again, my life has turned to shit and it is all because of the pressure put on me by my parents.  All they care about is if I get good grades or not, and this semester like a few before I fell short by 2 points.  Now they are saying to me "no more school for you"  'we aren't going to pay for this anymore".  I have let my parents down yet again and I see nothing left to live for.  I think the easiest way is just to end it all.  I don't think the grass is greener on the other side.  And I doubt it will be.
