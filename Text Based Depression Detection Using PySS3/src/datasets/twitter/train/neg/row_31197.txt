Today i was given the opportunity to shoot a gun in the middle of the woods. I wanted to put it to my head so badly but i didnâ€™t.I held my first gun, i shot my first gun. In the middle of the woods. The other person looked away while i had it in my hands getting ready to shoot, and i wanted to put it to my head and pull the trigger so fucking badly, But i didnâ€™t. Iâ€™m proud of myself for that because it was the perfect opportunity and i still didnâ€™t do it. I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s keeping me here but something is, and i hope itâ€™s worth it.
