No plans just fantasiesI told my therapist the half truth I had been thinking about suicide. The truth is I think about it at least once a day. I think about it all the time. I think about how I would do it. I told her about my suicidal fantasies. Yet my mom still won't take me to the psychiatrist. Our insurance doesn't start til next week I'm dying inside.
