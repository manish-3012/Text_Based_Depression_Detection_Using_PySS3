I don't want to kill myself, but I do wish for death a lot.I don't know what it is, maybe it's just the idea of a a guilt free death or something. I'm not really sure. I sometimes don't wear a seatbelt or do other kindof of stupid things with a small hope that maybe something will happen to me. I don't think it makes me suicidal, I think it just... I don't know what it makes me. Life has been incredibly difficult for me these last couple months, I haven't been this bad since I attempted two years ago. To summarize why everything has sucked, a lot of my coworkers hate me because of a rumor that is totally unfounded and was never true in the first place, that I was stalking someone, ironically enough started by a girl that I actually had a fancy for, and to top it off, she's the first person I've had feelings s for, like legitimate feelings for, since my ex girlfriend 2 years ago. Next up was that I nearly failed all my classes last quarter because my depression was so bad I couldn't get out of bed, I passed by some dumb luck miracle. And thirdly, I just am alone all the time. My parents and I lead separate lives, my sister lives away from here. Right now I'm struggling in particular because I'm home alone. I'm just trapped with my thoughts. If you actually bothered to read this whole thing, thanks... It feels nice just knowing that my message got out there.
