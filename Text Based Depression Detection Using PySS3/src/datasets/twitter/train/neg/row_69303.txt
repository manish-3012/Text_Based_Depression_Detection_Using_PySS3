Tired of being a single struggling motherToday my twins turned four. The past few months have been hell. We lost our home, our storage unit, and went through a parental abduction. Iâ€™m slowly rebuilding, we have a roof over our head now after being homeless but not much else.

A few weeks ago I was able to get both girls a toddler bed and a blanket each after all four of us were sleeping on the floor. When they saw the beds my sassy twin made the comment â€œno take our beds we be good girlsâ€. I took it as she thought we lost everything because they were â€œbad girlsâ€.

Fast forward to today and we went to get balloons (all I could afford) and to the park. She started talking about all the toys she used to have and how we used to always have food in the fridge, â€œmemba we always had foodâ€. And then she got really quiet and said â€œoh but we bad girls nowâ€. That broke my heart!

The last few months have been a huge shock to all of us, itâ€™s a night and day difference. I've never once told them they were â€œbad girlsâ€. The only time they havenâ€™t been with me is daycare and when their dad took them a few months ago resulting in an amber alert. We donâ€™t have a tv so I have no idea where they picked it up from.

Iâ€™m trying my best to make things work but I don't get monetary assistance or food stamps. How can I make this transition period easier so that they don't think they are bad?
