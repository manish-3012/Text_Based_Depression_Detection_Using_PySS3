Feels like every single possible horrible thing that could happen to a person, happened to me.Growing up in an immigrant Muslim family poor as fuck. Parents were abusive with mental issues and had no money, social skills and behaved like toddlers. Got bullied in school constantly for being the only person of color and not fitting in with my peers. Had to start working at 14. Parents took all my checks. Could never leave the house during my teens/college years. Got forcibly married off at 18. Had to drop out of college and move to the other side of the country with my fat ugly boring fob husband. Watched everyone else enjoy college while I was a housewife and spent every weekend at home. Cry myself to sleep every single night for the past 5 years. Now Iâ€™m too fat and old and ugly and mentally ill for anyone to love me. Life is pointless and I will never be happy. I just want to die. Watched someone get engaged on Instagram and realized I will never have that kind of love because no one cares about me.
