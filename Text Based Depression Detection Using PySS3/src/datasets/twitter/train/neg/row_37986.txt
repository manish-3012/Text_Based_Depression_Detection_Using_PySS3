10/29/2020 - ThursdayIâ€™m gonna start logging and writing about how I feel when I see fit, i think it might be healthier, since i donâ€™t feel comfortable talking about these things with anyone I know. Itâ€™s 6:33 AM as i write this. I feel all empty and hopeless again, probably because I didnâ€™t sleep last night. My sleep scheduleâ€™s been really fucked up lately. I donâ€™t remember when it started, maybe when I got back from Dadâ€™s. I donâ€™t remember when that happened either. Was it three weeks ago? Maybe, every day looks the same. My sense of time iâ€™s fucked too cause I sleep whenever I feel like and itâ€™s destroying me. Maybe iâ€™ll get it together hopefully today, iâ€™m gonna drink coffee and hold my eyes open with bobby pins if it comes to it. Not really though. Iâ€™ve got no shirt on right now, just pants and socks. Theyre the pants i got from the shop at college. Fuck. right now i could be hanging out, no i could be WORKING and getting a career or something instead of sitting here on my laurels. Okay so hereâ€™s what i do when i get up (if i get up) if itâ€™s dinner time iâ€™ll eat dinner and maybe hang out upstairs, but mom and nicholas usually watch TV together, sometimes the dogs are out and sitting with them. they â€˜ll just sit and watch. I think my mom is watching some crime show. I remember seeing an episode where a guy jams a screwdriver into the barrel of a gun, he was trying to fuck up the spiraling tracks inside the barrel that score the bullet when it gets fired. He was trying to make it so forensics couldnâ€™t identify the gun. It was smart, but he only screwed up the tip, so forensics found it anyway. Iâ€™m not using my head. Ive never felt stupider in my life than these past few months. I donâ€™t do shit for anyone. Whell sometimes i do chores. Iâ€™m on citalopram. 40 mgs. It somewhat helps. But it;s the difference between salt in a wound and lemon juice in a wound. Everything sucks, and itâ€™s fucked, but less so if i take the pill. Iâ€™ve been listening to some piano music these past few hours like avril 14th and nanou2 and merry christmas mister lawrence, which is probably just making things worse, but itâ€™s comforting in some weird twisted way. Have you seen the ads on youtube by the presidents? Donald trumpâ€™s ads are all colorful and they have text in ALL cAPITALS and thereâ€™s dramatic music and stuff. YOU WONâ€™T BELIEVE WHAT BIDEN DID or SAID, ITâ€S CRAZY. Holy shit man youâ€™re marketing to LEGAL ADULTS not ten year olds, calm down. Heâ€™s trying to tap into the lowest common denominator, the people who sit and drool. Bidenâ€™s ads are more mature looking, like they were meant to be seen by the people old enough to actually vote. I lost my train of thought, damn it. My cat can probably tell iâ€™m upset right now, because sheâ€™s sitting here with me and being all cuddly. Actually no sheâ€™s just being needy. Sheâ€™s reaching out and tapping my shoulder and then licking me. It really hurts after a while, but try explaining that to a cat. They donâ€™t hurt when theyâ€™re licking themselves cuz they have fur all over their bodies. I briefly thought about killing myself earlier, it wasnâ€™t super detailed, just like â€œHey, everything is fucked, i donâ€™t really wanâ€™t to be alive, maybe i should just get it over with because i canâ€™t see any way out of this mess.â€ I recently thought of something, maybe this is all in my head, the whole universs. What if i just made it all up in my head and nothingâ€™s real? These people are suffering because i created them and created a world that sucks, and iâ€™m sorry for that. Best case scenario if i kill myself then everything will cease to be. There will be no happiness, but no pain either. I felt just fine before i was born. I have no way of proving this. What a crock of shit. Iâ€™m 19 but i feel like iâ€™m 59. Itâ€™s 7:01 AM now, someone is probably awake. Actually nicholas probably already left for work at six-ish. Iâ€™m gonna shower now because i feel gross. Physically i feel gross. I also feel gross emotionally but a shower canâ€™t fix that. I might write more when i get out of the shower, maybe not. Iâ€™m not real sane at the moment, showers calm me down so i might not write until THE NEXT EPISODE.
