I want to kill myself for no reason at all.I feel very stupid for posting this here because a lot of people here actually have reasonable problems.

I use to be depressed for 5 months, even tried to kill myself 6 or more times, but now it's just different. I'm not depressed at all, in fact, I am very happy. My family doesn't abuse me anymore (weirdly abuse didn't affect me) they actually love me. My school life is doing great, I get good grades. I workout and love my body. Basically, life is going well but I have this feeling that I don't want to exist anymore. That I just want to be gone in a single second. It's not a sadness fit or anything, I feel like this every day. When I'm on Reddit, reading posts, laughing, I feel the same. I feel like life is just an endless circle. I want to get a good job but deep down I know that I'm not special, I know that this won't happen. I am always pessimistic but I am still happy. I know that I should get a good job in order to be happy in the future but I know that I should just enjoy the moment too. LÄ±ttle things in life don't see to make me happy anymore, it's just there.
I'm sorry If I phrased myself really badly, my first language is not English. Please ignore the grammatical errors as well.
