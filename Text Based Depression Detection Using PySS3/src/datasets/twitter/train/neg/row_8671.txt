I want to kill myself but no one would look after my petsI want to kill myself. I've wanted to do this since I was 11. My family life is killing me and I can't get out of it. I want to end it. 
But I love all my pets so much. No one would take care of them if I'm gone. I want to die so badly but then I look to their eyes and I can't. I can't hurt them like this. They truly do love me. 
What can I do? I just want this to end...
