I donâ€™t know how to deal with my suicidal thoughts.I have PTSD and go into fight or flight mode whenever Iâ€™m outside. Iâ€™m under constant stress and feel underdeveloped for my age. Iâ€™m supposed to have a job and travel independently, but canâ€™t drive and struggle to leave my place. Iâ€™m ruining my sex life by being scatter brained. The planet is dying and Iâ€™m contributing to its destruction. The future looks pretty bleak and while I love the people around me and having a good time, I burden people by depending on them too much. Iâ€™ve been suicidal for the past couple of weeks because I feel like Iâ€™m wasting peopleâ€™s time and money.
