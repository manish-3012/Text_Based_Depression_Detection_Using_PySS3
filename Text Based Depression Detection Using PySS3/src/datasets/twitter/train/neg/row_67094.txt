I canâ€™t go on like this anymore.Everything is falling down again. After being depressed for more than 3 years, Iâ€™ve got a period of around a month, of complete happiness for myself. I could exercise, cook healthy food, draw more and focus better on my studies... But Iâ€™m here again, thinking about suicide and being all sad. 

Thereâ€™s something I canâ€™t take, I canâ€™t face it off: I have no true friends. 

I mean... I have friends, but nobody would talk to me more than 1 time in the week if I donâ€™t do it. People just donâ€™t like me because I have a strange attitude and Iâ€™m immature. 

I really do miss a friend that talked to me for a month after a period of around a year that she did not talked to me. She told me that she really likes me as a friend, but she had reasons to stop talking to me, very deep reasons... And, she did it again. She left me, without knowing why. Iâ€™m here again, I feel worse. 

I would always listen to peopleâ€™s problems, I would give them advice, I would tell them that Iâ€™d do anything for them... But anyone tells me that back. 

And... Anyone could say: Donâ€™t worry about having no friends, that does not define you. But... Having friends mildly defines you. If youâ€™ve got friends, youâ€™re someone that people likes. If you donâ€™t have friends... People does not like you. Conversations with me are uncomfortable and shitty, people just donâ€™t like me. 

I canâ€™t face off my poor ability to exist in a society and thatâ€™s my reason to be suicidal. I always tell people that I donâ€™t understand why Iâ€™m i so depressed (when I have friends because thatâ€™s surely a reason nobody likes me). Iâ€™m so afraid of telling anyone about this, because it is just so DEPRESSING. It  

I donâ€™t have nobody to talk about this, and I know why.

Iâ€™m blocking anyone that once abandoned me and treated me bad. Iâ€™m getting away, I donâ€™t care about my emotional outcome but I prefer to  have dignity.
