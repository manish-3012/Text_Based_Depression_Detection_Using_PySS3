I didnt hang myselfBut I wish I had. My life is falling apart. Everything is flavorless. I am waiting until everyone is asleep and I'll try lefthanded slits into my scarless right arm. I'm so worn out - where's the joy? After that, maybe overdose on a month's supply of 1800x30 mg of gabapentin. Maybe...if i can swallow them each fast enough. I dont care, i dont know. All I know is i have no place to put my pain., and people cant help. People cant - im going truly and tangibly insane soon. And by then neither you nor I will recognize who I am. Good(maybe)bye, and all that sadass jazz. ðŸ•›
