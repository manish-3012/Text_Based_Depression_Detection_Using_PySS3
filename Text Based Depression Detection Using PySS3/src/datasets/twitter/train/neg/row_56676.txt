Idk what to think about anymore other than ways of killing myselfSo I met this guy and we started dating for about two weeks. Everything was fine until the past few nights (including tonight). Lately when he's been wanting to play a certain game or sext and I would tell him no (cause I'm not feeling up to it) he would get mad and tell me that I would do as he says because I'm a "good, obedient gf." I'm kinda embarrassed to say this out loud but I feel like it might be some good info on what's going on: I enjoy being submissive and he enjoys being dominant in the bedroom. He knows that I like to be controlled and used since that is part of my fetish but during our argument I told him that I wanted to only allow it in the bedroom. It seems like the only thing I'm good for him is to please him and obey his commands like a slave.. he says that's he's been acting this way since he lost his job and has been getting into fights with other people and I guess I can understand since he didn't act this way before but... I feel like it's a trick. Idk I just don't wanna be alone again and I wanna die but I also wanna tell him how much I love him...
