My parents want me to give them my phone at nightI feel petty writing this, but I donâ€™t know what other sub to post to. Iâ€™m not an overly suicidal person, but I do have bad thoughts most days, but theyâ€™re not super serious. I have them most notably at night. When Iâ€™m trying to fall asleep and I have nothing stimulating me. So I watch YouTube videos with a sleep timer so they turn off after x amount of time. I got my phone about a week before summer break started, so my parents didnâ€™t start any routines or anything. But since school is starting soon, they want to. They want me to give them my phone at 9 pm and keep it until I wake up in the morning. My mental health declined a lot this summer, and they know that and Iâ€™ve been in counseling for the past month or so. The main thing my counselor has told me is to stay stimulated, so I donâ€™t think about suicide and all that. I want to keep my phone so I can sleep. Sleeping is hell for me when I canâ€™t use it. I just canâ€™t fall asleep, my head filled with terrible thoughts and itâ€™s just terrifying. They probably wonâ€™t let me since my siblings are ok with it. I didnâ€™t go into too much detail about why I use my phone while trying to sleep since I was in front of my whole family and didnâ€™t want to get upset. Iâ€™m just distraught and not sure of how to go about this. Iâ€™m sorry if this isnâ€™t the right sub.
