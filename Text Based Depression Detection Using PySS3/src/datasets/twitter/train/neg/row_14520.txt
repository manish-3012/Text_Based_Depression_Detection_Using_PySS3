I'm closer to 30 than 20....And I have nothing figured out yet. The aspects of your life are:
1. Family
2. Career 
3. Finances
4. Roots

Most of everyone has at least one thing on that list. Sure Joe may not be working in his dream job or have enough money to live on his own but at least he has a great wife who he will plan to have kids with soon and plenty of friends in his area. Dan may have trouble finding a girl he clicks with or finding an ideal location but at least he has a promising career in his chosen field. 

I have none of that figured out. I jumped different fields finally settling on engineering but I guess I'm not meant to be an engineer if I can't find a relevant job after almost a year of searching. Other than that I am at square one and hate that I am so behind everyone else in life. 

By 30 Most have 3 of those figured out. On the bright side at least I can afford a gun.
