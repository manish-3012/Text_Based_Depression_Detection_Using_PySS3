Bullied, again. Self harming again. But I'm old and tired.It is happening again, I am getting bullied and mobbed by my co-workers. Just like the high school bullies, oh and my parents. I need death. 

31 years old and everyone that meets me has the instinct to bully until I cry. To kill the pitiful thing. I am never safe. OH and I am on meds, I just had them increased earlier this year. Doctors don't care, they would be happy I'm dead too ofc

So go on then tell me that I am disgusting, worthless, stupid "There is no excuse" for it. There is no justification for it. Just like what my boss told me today. CANT I FUCKING DIE!?
