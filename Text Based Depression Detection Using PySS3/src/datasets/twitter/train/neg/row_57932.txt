I love you. Yes, you and you and you *Hugs*I love you. I care about you. I want to help you. Yes, you reading this not thinking this is meant for anyone specific. I've been there, I've hated it and sometimes you just want a hug. So *hug* I'm here. 

Feel free to PM me. I have AIM and MSN too. I am though in Europe and in morning therapy every day, so my hours might be weird, but I'll try to chat as much as possible if you need me. I'll probably send you something offline occasionally so you get a nice little message.

We can chat about anything. We can be friends. Or I can be a sound-board; something to rant at. No worries, I'm fine with all that. Honestly, I promise. You can tell me anything, and I'll try my very best to help or point you in the direction of help.

As for who I am? Well, let's see. Roman Catholic, so I hope that doesn't scare you off. I shan't chat about religion if you don't want, but I'll probably offer to pray for you. I'm a fantasy/medieval/mythology geek- love the clothes, read the books, write stories too. Also into anime and anime OSTs. Plus Doctor Who, can't forget that. ^^ Ooh, and I'm a girl. :) I've been dealing with OCD, depression and anxiety. Some of that includes not being able to make friends and keep in contact with people. So I'm trying to fix that somewhat. As mentioned I'm in therapy, which is going well, and on meds.

I care about you. I love you. I'll do my best to help. Take my hand, we'll find our way out of this dark scary forest together.

My AIM is: "O Notturna"
