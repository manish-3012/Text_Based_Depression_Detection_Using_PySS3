Why?This year Iâ€™ve taken a step back and started thinking about how our society operates. Whatâ€™s the point of it all? To make the most money? To buy the most stuff? To mindlessly waste our lives away trying to keep up with the next best thing? Society tells people to do good in school go to college get a good job. Then what? Spend the rest of your days a slave to the system. Iâ€™m just rambling at this point but I just donâ€™t understand this bullshit and why people continue to buy into it. I donâ€™t want to live in a world where we canâ€™t actually fucking live our lives they way we want. I donâ€™t know maybe Iâ€™m overreacting.
