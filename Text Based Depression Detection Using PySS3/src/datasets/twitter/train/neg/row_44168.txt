Flashes of thoughtsI didn't think I'd be here still honestly, at this age. I've had suicidal thoughts since middle school. Didn't think I'd live to high school. Didn't think I'd live past college. And yet. 

I have started to think lately "what if I don't end up killing myself and live a long time?" And that's honestly terrifying. I don't want to get old and in poor health because I didn't take care of myself when I was younger and now. 

My mind still gets so dark so fast. Thinking of work and my manager asking for a meeting, my first thought is I'm getting fired and what then? I would kill myself. The meeting was for peer review feedback. 
But I slept all day instead of work. I feel I should be fired. And even tonight I was randomly like "you should just kill yourself." It's been my latest default thought, "I'm going to off myself." 

Thinking of my boyfriend who I feel like is the only good thing in my life. If we broke up I'd have nothing here for me. I'd probably try to move states to where I went to high school. But even that's not a guaranteed fix. 

I know it's hard right now to change anything. Can't meet new people. Can't go out. 

My new thought is that if I do end up trying to do anything drastic, it wouldn't be planned and carefully thought out like I thought before. It would be just "yeah let's do it." And 99.9% chance I wouldn't go through with it and would end up sobbing alone. Cause it's always "yeah I'm fine" to other people. But that 0.1%? What then?
