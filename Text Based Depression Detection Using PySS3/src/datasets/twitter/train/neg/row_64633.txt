Lamentations of a wasterThis life is whatever we make out of it. I know what I need to change if I want results. The pain of loneliness, from losing every friend and family relation to a drug habit that took my life from privileged to complete waste, is the price I pay. Although I'm so fucking miserable that I can't recover. As I soon as I get some money I'm high. I can't enjoy this world sober. Everything I try I never stick with because my heart is in nothing I do. I see snakes in the eyes staring at me in the mirror. I want to drift off. There is no place in this world for a sensitive, overthinking junkie. I don't connect with anyone because of my self-hate. It locks me in a prison of atrocities I commit against myself. Never resting, incessant thoughts about the life passing me by. Lost in my own dark hell I made inside my skull. The drugs turn off everything as if I were dead. I hate the selfishness. But my suffering has helped no one. I've tried, but ultimately I'm more lost and empty than I've ever been. I want to finally die.

*Am I not trying hard enough? I should wait out the pain until I have a revelation from God. Waiting for a savior because I can't do anything beyond exist at this point. It's mind-numbing insanity how I live. I've cut myself off from the world at 19. My dad lives with me, but leaves me alone because I'm erratic and violent sometimes. I hate everything I've done, who I've become, and life is so bleak I really don't know what to do.

*I happened upon an emergency stash, which is good enough for now. Suicidal thoughts on hold. Life is bearable. I don't know what I was thinking posting here. The only advice I might get would be along the lines of "get help," or "stay sober because it gets better." I could be on suboxone, but my dad doesn't want to pay for anything to do with my "treatment." I've been to rehab three times in one year.
