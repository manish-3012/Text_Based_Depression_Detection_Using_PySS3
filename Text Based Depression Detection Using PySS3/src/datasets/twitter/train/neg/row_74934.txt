i just wrote my suicide noteim certain im going to need it soon and i  figured better to write it cohesively now than impromptu when the time comes. i have one more good time planned and unless i find a whole new meaning for life in those 2 hours, this is it. ive tried too hard too long, i dont see myself coming out the other end with this one.
