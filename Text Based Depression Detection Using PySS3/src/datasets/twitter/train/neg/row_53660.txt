i always think it canâ€™t get worse and it does . iâ€™m almost good with Godhow do people carry such heavy burdens on their shoulder and not show a thing? i am 20 and  so far away from my roots i donâ€™t know who i am. i always feel my one best friend abandons me and i feel like the world is too much and i will never ever be prepared. my timeline of events for 6+ years is not promising and iâ€™m the most jaded and gut wrentching misery iâ€™ve ever felt. iâ€™m bipolar so life is literally only good FOR IT TO GET BAD AGAIN. iâ€™m waiting on that constantly. iâ€™m almost good with God.
