I lost my life to my insecurities and failureI lost my job because I lied 
I lost my car because I couldn't afford to take care of it
I lost my husband because I became so insecure I started lashing out at him and not trusting him anymore 
I lost my marriage because I couldn't trust the truth of it being so good 
I lost faith in myself to do anything right. 

I cannot live like this anymore. I am the reason for my husband's misery and he's divorcing me. I am the reason behind my own misery. I have no where to go but a mattress in the living room of our 1 bedroom apartment. 

I cannot do this anymore
