i want to kill myself. but i dont want everyone else to crumble.i want to die. im so tired. im so sick of the memories. the flash backs. the desperation to feel. the desperation to stop feeling. i am done. i am just so tired.




but so many people rely on me. what will my autistic sister do if she has no one to turn to? how will my depressed mother react? my codependent dad? my partner?

i want to die.
but i am alive to keep them afloat.
and i think im at my breaking point.
