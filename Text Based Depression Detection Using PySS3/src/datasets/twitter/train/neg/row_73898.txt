cant hold it..advice please.I have never planned it,but ive been constantly thinking about ending it all or escaping the reality.Ive been giving myself tons of chances but my procrastination has been getting really serious that i cant bring myself to study anymore.I live in a city where grades are everything and theres only one shot/one exam that determines if you get tertiary education.
So revision is really everything...Actually I've been a fairly top student one year ago but shit happened..it may sound trivial to you but trust me it hurts...i got bullied by a teacher and my allergy was exacerbated that year...i missed some exams and my confidence was crashed...i cant bring myself to study effectively or productively anymore..i really tried but i just cant...fyi my family is somewhat middle class tho the relationships are no good at all(no violence or sexual harrassment but moms constantly scolding relatives and dads very inconsiderate) and i have no social life(have two or three frds that i talk to in school)..and ive quitted church bc ive been feeling aloof there..also im quitting piano to seize more time to revise but i didnt make good use of the time which makes me very guilty...
.
I swear ill be very happy(somehow i dun care abt my interpersonal relationships if i achieve my goals but they do exacerbate my depression when i cant work productively) if i can revise productively, get good grades and get into my dream dental school but my procrastination,self-doubt,ocd(negative thoughts),etc have been getting more serious...i really want to go back and change..i can take no more.
.
I need to bring myself to study again if i want be accomplished.I dont know if i have any mental problems(pls read my background as stated above)..pls gimme advice and cure my procrastination...also...i cant concentrate during revision that leads to difficulties in memorization..
.
TL;DR:pls gimme advice on ways to overcome procrastination given the above situation and ways to memorize faster and harder..i will be forever grateful
