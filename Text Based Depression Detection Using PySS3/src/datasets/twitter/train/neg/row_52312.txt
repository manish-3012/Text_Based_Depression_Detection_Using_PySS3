Would it be wrong if I were to just drive my car into the sea, with my favourite songs on and the doors locked? I can't deal with this shit anymore, I've tried ending it a few times, got back on my feet, but no. I can't go on anymore.I work a shitty job, for a shitty wage, shitty hours, about to start studying at a shitty uni because my parents didn't want me to go to the uni I wanted to go to, I don't have a fucking C in GCSE maths. 

I'm just a fucking failure, with no fucking friends, the only friends I had are going to different universities miles away from me, my "bestfriend" has now fucked off completely because he has a girlfriend. 

My ex girlfriend won't seem to GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY FUCKING LIFE!

I'm fucking ugly as fuck so it's no wonder I can't keep a relationship going or find another. 

Parent's fucking treat me like I can't do anything for myself. 

I had a car crash two months ago, was settled in my fault, wish I was wrote off with the fucking car! Fuck this shit. I just want a bottle of Jack, a pack of cigarettes and to hit the road in my car.
