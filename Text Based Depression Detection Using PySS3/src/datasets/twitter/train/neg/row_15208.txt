Why Can't I Self-harm?I really wish I self-harmed. 

I'm in so much pain it feels like pulsing adrenaline, I hate myself so much and the burden that I am to others. I want to hurt myself, I want to punish myself, I want something to focus on--but I can't quite bring myself to do it. Why not? Is it because I'm really not that depressed? Or because I'm a wimp who's afriad of pain? 

I feel like such a scam. "Wanting to self harm" is nothing. I have no proof without scars, but I can't quite make myself do it.

So i guess that settles it. I must not be really depressed. I'm just...who knows. Fucked up.
