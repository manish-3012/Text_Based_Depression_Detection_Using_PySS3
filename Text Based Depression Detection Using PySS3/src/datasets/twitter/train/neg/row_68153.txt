idkive been feeling really down lately. ive been searching for the easiest way to die without being in pain. i feel pressured by my studies. im a student nurse and in the brink of dropping out but i ended up fighting for it again bcause im already 2nd yr college and i only have to study for remaining 2yrs. my mom told me its okay to stop for now bcoz she knows and understand how hard it is to study during pandemic. but i feel like she only said it  for me to feel better. She knows that one of these days i will probably kms. 

i just dont see the point in anything if i finish this degree i dont think ill be happy about it. i dotn even see myself working at the hospital.

it feels like a burden and i want to escape. and killing ms seems like the only way out.

what make it worst is that my country is so fucked up rn.

im not the only one who is struggling here more students want to have academic break bcoz we've experience so much crisis this year yet our government cant seem to hear us.

i want to leave this country too. and if im going to die or kms not in here.

Philippines really sucks. ousts du30.
