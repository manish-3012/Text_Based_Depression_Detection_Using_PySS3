I'm not.I'm not the sweet, determined girl everyone makes me out to be

I'm not patient or kind. I blow up at nothing.

I'm not someone who has everything figured out, I'm terrified of the future.

I'm not soft-hearted...I'm just desperate to have someone to hold on to.

I'm not innocent, I literally sell my body to pay for things.

I'm not genuine..I don't say half of my feelings towards people because I don't want to risk losing what little I have. 

I'm not a good friend..I'm just good at making people happy. 

I'm not good at balancing people. I can't make everyone happy.

I'm not a good student, I just know how to do my homework.

I'm not talented. The most talent I have is being able to blend eyeshadows together and piss people off easily.

I'm not a good girlfriend. I get jealous, cause guilt, and I'm borderline abusive. No one needs that.

I'm not a good daughter. I take advantage of my mom and don't try hard enough with my dad. 

I'm not strong. I think about miniscule things way too much and they drive me insane. 

I'm not a good person. 

I'm not cut out for this.
