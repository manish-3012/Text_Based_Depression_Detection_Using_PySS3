I can't take this anymore. I have the bleach bottle in my hand right now.I just can't fucking live like this. I was always an outcast for liking anime and other shit, but things have gotten so out of hand since last week. I came out to my parents as trans and otherkin and they absolutely flipped their shit. They're very religious and feminist, so  of course I expected a bad reaction, but they hit me with the fucking belt until I bled. Then they told me I would never be a real woman or a real hedgehog. The next few days were nothing but screaming matches and beatings. I have no friends. I have nowhere else to go. I've been popping pills and cutting to cope with the pain. There's just no escape from this. I want to die. As I said before, I'm locked in my closet with the bleach bottle in my motherfucking hand. Someone please, for the love of god, tell me why I shouldn't drink it. And no comments saying I'm a troll, this is fucking REAL and I can't do this much longer.
