I'm a motherHi there, 
I'm in a situation that I can't talk to anyone about it.
I'm 38 weeks pregnant, I already have a 2yo girl that I absolutely love more than anything.
I had a lot problems with my husband through pregnancy and I'm having them again.
He yells at me, calls me dumb, bitch etc... 
We just had a argument and be pulled my hair.. 
I'm so so sad, that all I ask is to God take me away from this, I feel like I'm nothing, that I don't deserve anything... I just want to hurt myself so this pain on my chest can go away ...
