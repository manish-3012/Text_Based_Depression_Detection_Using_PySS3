Canâ€™t even get up for school anymoreMy depression is getting the best of me and Iâ€™m letting it because I kinda want it to. Iâ€™m hoping for an easy way out and not to be on this hell anymore. Been suicidal since 5th grade I am now 15 in 10th and I donâ€™t see a point and people say find your peace but what if Iâ€™m so lost I canâ€™t even find a way out itâ€™s just dark for me I donâ€™t see any potential in a future. Iâ€™ve given up on god because I was given a terrible conditon CRMO (look it up) only happens in a one in a million kids and itâ€™s been a struggle and I canâ€™t keep up anymore. Help
