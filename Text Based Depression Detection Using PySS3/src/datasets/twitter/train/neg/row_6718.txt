I am the Happiest Person Most People KnowAnd I am so tired of it.

I work really hard to be this big ball of light for my friends and family. I emanate happiness. I laugh constantly. I smile all the fucking time. I also want to fucking kill myself.

It's hard because I don't know if I am an imposter or not, you know? I really *am* happy a lot of the time.  But I also really just want to die. I feel like I'm stuck in certain situations and there's no way out of them. I don't even really know where I'm going with this.

My point, if I have one anyways, is that I am both so fucking happy and so fucking sad. I can have 10/10 days every single day and still want to blow my brains out. I am confused and I am tired.
