What will happen to me if I go to the hospital after taking a bunch of pills?I need help very badly and I'm not getting it because the people around me don't understand how immediately I need counseling. If I don't fake a suicide attempt very soon then I will continue living in a miserable helpless blur.

I want to take a lot of pills like Advil. I know it won't kill me and I don't want it to. I want to take a lot of pills and then tell my dad I need to go to the hospital because I tried to kill myself. The catch is that I never actually intended to die, just to get help.

What will they do to me? Will they pump my stomach? My only fear is pain. I don't want it to hurt but I need a way to get into a hospital and I don't feel comfortable just asking to go to one. I am underage and living with my parents.
