Iâ€™ve never felt worthy of anything and I donâ€™t know how to change it.It doesnâ€™t matter how many people sit there and tell you that you are, even if itâ€™s every day, somewhere sometime my brain was hardwired to make me believe Iâ€™m not worth anything at all and I do not know how to change it. Reciting shit to yourself in the mirror honestly is the dumbest thing Iâ€™ve ever heard. It doesnâ€™t work. I donâ€™t feel good enough. I donâ€™t feel worthy. I just donâ€™t want to be here anymore. Iâ€™m so tired.
