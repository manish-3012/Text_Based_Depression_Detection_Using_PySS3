whatâ€™s the pointiâ€™m 17 and i donâ€™t see the point of going on. i constantly hurt my familyâ€™s feelings and i have no friends. my parents always get angry at me. ive never had an actual boyfriend or a bestfriend. ive tried to do stuff to make me happy. i feel nothing but anger and sadness. thereâ€™s no reason for me to even be here. once i graduate high school i have to go into college, but im not even good at anything
