I knew it was a bad idea to try to talk to my mom about my darkess.nessknessThe last few days have been hell for me. I figured to try to reach out to my mom just as a cry for help.I have been debating if I should talk or not. Kept hinting I wanted to talk. My mind was in a very dark place. We eventually get onto Facebook after texting (too deep to talk on person). I had briefly just mentioned i was in a mental dark place. Thats all I said. I didnt say anything about suicide. Supposedly that was too much. She goes on and just doesnt say anything. Now I feel like that was not a good idea. Now I remember why I keep all my feelings to myself. It sucks. I cant talk to my wife either.
