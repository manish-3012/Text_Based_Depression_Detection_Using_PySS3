Legal highs to CitalopramHey guys been through a rough year but hopefully things are looking on the up. Started citalopram about 6 weeks ago now which made me feel like I could achieve anything plus calmed down my stammer quite a lot. Last week I got my face punched in by a gang of lads and ended up like this http://i.imgur.com/dk2ozhC.jpg .

Ended up with a fractured eye socket, cheek bone and a bleed behind my eye. Just been lay in bed all week really. Nothing is getting me out of bed because I feel like nothing's going to entertain me and if I do something it's just going to be a waste of my time (even though I'm lay here doing nothing) plus everything costs money, I'd rather be doing something that will make me money.

I really just want a purpose or meaning in life. Like a career to engulf my life so there's literally always something to think about in my head. At the moment it seems that the hard-working, honest and polite people end up worse in life.

I don't know Reddit, feeling pretty shitty.
