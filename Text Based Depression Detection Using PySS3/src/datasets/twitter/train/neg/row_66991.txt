i'm burnt out, can't find any reason to continue...oh gosh i don't know where to start, i don't even know where to start, or whether this is the right place to post this  

i am a 20 year old guy, born and raised in a third world country, somewhere where depression and suicidal thoughts is seen as taboo and/or evil's works.  

i am your typical neckbeard/nerd i guess, currently in second year majoring communication degree and i cant, for the life of me find any reasons to move forward/ go along with my life  

i cant find any reason to continue this underwhelming life. with sub par scores in college, nonexistent date life (i never have any girlfriend in my life, 20 years and never once have i been able to ask someone out), i cant find any reason why i have to continue all of this.  

yesterday my friend (the big joker in the class) pointed out that nobody will miss me if i'm not attending the class anymore, that really put things in perspective, since he's aboslutely right.  

the only thing that keeping me going is the fact that my mom is currently in bad shape, she's been sick for the last month and it will absolutely wrecks her if anything were ever happens to her dear son.  

i cant talk to friends (because they all have a big mouth and e  extremely judgmental) and my family is too religious for all this suicide nonsense.  

well, i don't  know what to do anymore reddit. maybe life is just too overwhelming for me. maybe im not cut out for it.  

sorry for my English reddit, not a native speaker.
