I just wish I could give all the days of the life I could have left to someone elseIâ€™d rather someone worthwhile, who enjoyed living could have the remaining days of my life given to them. Itâ€™s such a waste on me. 
I almost feel selfish being alive while people die to cancer and diseases and stuff like that. Thereâ€™s so many better people who could live for the these extra years and do real good in the lives of others and to the world.
