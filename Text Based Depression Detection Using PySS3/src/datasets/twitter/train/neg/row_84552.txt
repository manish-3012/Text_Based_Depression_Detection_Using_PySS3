I feel like I'm drowningI just got rejected after my fourth job interview. I've been searching and unemployed for a month. Stuck in a house with emotionally abusive and controlling parents. Desperate to make some money and leave, but I can't.

I dont know what I even want out of life anymore. I have no aspirations, and my self confidence is completely shot. I have no friends either, never have, never will. I really dont want to kill myself because I am too scared. I also think I still love my parents and my brother (who constantly berates me and blames me for arguing with my parents, instead of being completely obedient like him) and dont think I can do this to them by taking my own life. But the longer I live, the more I see no way out of this pain. 

I sometimes think I was just meant to eventually do it, cuz I am a waste of effort and resources on my parents. Maybe I'm too stupid to realize that yet.
Anyways thank you all for listening
