I don't even know if this belongs hereI'll cut to the chase immediately.

My best friend is on the verge of killing herself. I've tried so much to try and stop her but she seems to ignore everything I say. It seems like she's already made up her mind but I cannot deal with losing that much. I don't want to lose her. What do I do, do I give up on her and start moving on? I don't know how to feel.
