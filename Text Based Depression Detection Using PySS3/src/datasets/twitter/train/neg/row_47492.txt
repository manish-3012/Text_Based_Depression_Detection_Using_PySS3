Just a couple more days.I'm in my late 30s. Was in a relationship for 16 yrs married 4. My wife left me &amp; my 3 kids 1 is by her. This is the 3rd time in our relationship she has done this. Once when my kid was 3, 2nd time when he was  6 &amp; now at 11. I was the fool who took her back because of love those times. This time tho is different I'm beyond hurt. My wife let us during all the madness going on right now. She is currently in another state as of Sunday with a guy she has known since the 6th grade (we are in our 30s now)  she just started talking to him again 2 weeks ago. I found out because I looked in her phone. this is killing me badly I trapped in a house with all of her things. Our memories she won't even answer my calls or my sons calls. I have put everything I've had into her and this relationship. I'm devastated,  embarrassed,  shocked,  &amp; confused but most of all lonely. She returns back to my state on the 1st. I know she will cause drama because she is going to want to see my son. I'm going to just give him to her. I'm going to send my other 2 kids back home to their mother &amp; then I think I'm finally going to put a end to all my pain  I've been depressed for yrs &amp; this just made it worse. He words to me Stay strong for the boys no remorse for her actions I'm to blame she said. Her family is telling me to suck it up. I have no family or friends just my wife &amp; kids. This is the only life I've known since age 22. My life is ruined. Just waiting for the 1st of April
