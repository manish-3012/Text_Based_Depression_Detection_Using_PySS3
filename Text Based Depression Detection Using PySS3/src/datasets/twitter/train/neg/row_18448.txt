It's not quite Suicide, But I guess it's close...So, I have this new mentality after my life feels like it's now awful and with not really any good outcome in sight. [This](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/zvzm3/me_16m_and_my_ex_girlfriend_15f_broke_up_a_while/) is what's going on. And now, whenever I drive steep or winding or generally dangerous roads, I go way too fast when I'm alone. Just because I just wouldn't care if something were to happen to me. Not so much an attempt to kill myself, but just realizing the possibility of a fatal accident and dismissing it, saying to myself that I wouldn't care if something did happen. I Guess I'm just looking for a little guidance or help.
