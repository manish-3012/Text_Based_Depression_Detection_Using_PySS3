Iâ€™m 21Iâ€™m 21 and Iâ€™ve wanted to kill myself since Iâ€™ve been 17 years old. My whole family is completely numb to this whole issue because they donâ€™t understand it. Iâ€™ve been dealing with suicidal thoughts everyday, but the only thing holding me back is my family. Iâ€™ve gotten to the point where Iâ€™ve had the noose around my neck. Iâ€™ve written multiple suicide letters, Iâ€™ve done my research but the only thing holding me back is the fact that I will destroy my little sisters potential to be successful, and completely diminish the possibility for my mom to grow old, happy and peacefully. Pls help
