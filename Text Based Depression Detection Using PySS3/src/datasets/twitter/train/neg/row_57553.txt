Why is it like this?Why is it this way? Stuff around me is going well, amazing girlfriend, really caring grandparents, i'm in college, have a home to live in, physically im well. but yet I still feel so fucking shit, my heads so fucked I actually hate it so much, I don't even know why i'm making the post literally just to vent I guess, idk tbh. I have psychosis symptoms and am really depressed and I fucking hate it so much. I literally just wanna make my girlfriend happy and be able to live a nice amazing life with her. i'm sat here like a complete fucking loser, all alone crying on new years eve. Nice one. i'm actually so useless jesus christ. Nothings even happened im just so fucking down and I hate it so much and just want it to go, it actually feels like i'm being absorbed or that im fucking drowning in this unexplainable, horrible feeling.
