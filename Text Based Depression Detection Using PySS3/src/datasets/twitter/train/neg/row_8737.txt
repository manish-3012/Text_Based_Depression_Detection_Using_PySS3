I am not cut out for this worldI dont know where else to go. I thought I was doing so well. I have been seeing a therapist and taking Zoloft, but it doesn't seem to have worked. I recently got a very easy job while in school, but I just do not feel like I can do it.

I have terrible which in turn, causes my depression. Yesterday, not only was I called out in my class for ding something stupid, but right after class I was screamed at someone my friend buys weed from for being a fucking idiot. He's right.

I know I am an idiot. It doesn't bring me any peace knowing I am not the only one dealing with these issues because I still feel like shit. Yesterday night I wrote a suicide note and grabbed a knife to slit my wrist, but I couldn't do it. I was sobbing the whole time. Knowing I have a way out if life becomes too much to handle comforts me. I think it has finally become too hard.

I don't know why I was born like this. I don't know why I'm still alive.

Thank you for reading :)
