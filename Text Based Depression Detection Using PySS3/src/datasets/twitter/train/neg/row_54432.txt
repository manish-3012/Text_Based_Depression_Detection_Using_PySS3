I just want to dieI canâ€™t take living with my paranoid and over-controlling mother anymore. Iâ€™m 18 years old and she still monitors me like Iâ€™m 12. She goes through my phone, has restrictions on it so that I canâ€™t do anything on it that she canâ€™t see unless itâ€™s on an app that I can delete later that she doesnâ€™t have my login info too. She controls who I can see, what I wear, where I work, when I go to bed, and wonâ€™t give me any respect or privacy. Iâ€™m a college student and Iâ€™m not allowed to meet up with friends unless sheâ€™s met them and thereâ€™s an adult chaperone that she knows there. I feel trapped and alone. I just want so badly to escape from her but I donâ€™t have a way too. The only way out is suicide but she doesnâ€™t leave me at home alone and she has all the knives and medicines in a locked cabinet. I just want to die. Why canâ€™t it be easier to just end my life so that I donâ€™t have to suffer being treated like this anymore?
