girlfriend of 2 years left me over facebook and im very insecureshe emotionally made me and manipulated meinto being solely dependant on her, i've had a long 4 years after my mom died of guilt and grief and i had nobody until she came around, i'd notice little things like when she'd tell me "nobody else cares" and a bunch of other things that were along the lines of "nobody will care about you other than me" and i slowly started to fully believe it and recently she's been blaming me for her stress while im going through psychtherapy and trying to better myself as best as i can. she broke up with me today over facebook for asking her to tell me it'll be okay when i woke up from a nightmare. (I get night terrors or really bad nightmares because i have possible ptsd and other conflicting illness) and i feel really suicidal and right now im starting to comprehend maybe i shouldn't blame myself for all of this but I do because if i hadn't of pressed the issue of her typing a few simple words into a box this wouldn't have happened. I'm lost and i really don't want to live anymore.
