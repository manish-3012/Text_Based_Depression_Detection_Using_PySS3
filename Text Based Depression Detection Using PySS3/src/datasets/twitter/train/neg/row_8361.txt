Maarch is a month I'm dreadingI have a HUGE project due that my entire career hinges on, and there is no way I'm going to have it done in six weeks. Thing is, I've been stringing my boss along, plus his boss, and the boss's boss's boss. They might even be forced to shut the doors on the company when I drop this bomb.

I'd just like to off myself now and leave a note so they can at least have a chance fixing things. I don't have anyone at home, so it almost seems like the right thing to do.
