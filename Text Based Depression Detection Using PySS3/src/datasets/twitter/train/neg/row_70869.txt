tylenol odwell, 2 nights ago i tried to kill myself using tylenol. when i woke up i was shivering, had a stomach ache, and later on in the day i ended up throwing up, only a bit. i took 10-15 tylenol extra strength pills, and i am around 95-100 pounds. when i woke up today, i felt, fine? iâ€™ve felt some pain in my stomach but it really hasnâ€™t been much. i donâ€™t know what to do. i donâ€™t want to go to the hospital because iâ€™m afraid of being admitted into a mental hospital or anything like that..
