.I've for the past 20 years had suicidal thoughts. Now they're overwhelming. I can not have a good time without reverting to a visualization of shooting myself in the head. I've experienced life and death situations. Everytime I'm sitting in my house in near complete euphoria I cannot help but wish tomorrow wouldn't come. 

Does anyone else experience this from a similar situation? 

Tomorrows stressors will be minor and easily overcome. Nothing extraordinary will happen and I am capable of accomplishing the tasks in front of me. There is nothing wrong in my life and my wife is more than accommodating. 

What has helped you rid yourself of suicidal visualizations?
