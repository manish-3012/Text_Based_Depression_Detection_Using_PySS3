What the fuck am I doing?Iâ€™m living the same day every single day 
I feel like iâ€™m just something from the background.
I feel like iâ€™m not meant to be here.
I donâ€™t feel like I am living.
Iâ€™m cycling through a cycle of pain sadness and numbness. 
I feel like anything I do to change is powerless. I have no motivation. 
I canâ€™t do anything meaningful. I Always think that everyoneâ€™s gonna die at one point and that at one point enough time will pass that iâ€™ll be ultimately something that never existed because everyone has forgotten me like they have now although I donâ€™t think anyone has acknowledged me in the first place.
