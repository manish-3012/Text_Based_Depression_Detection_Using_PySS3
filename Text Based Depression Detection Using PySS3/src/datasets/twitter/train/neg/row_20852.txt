Seven years of depressionI'm just 20 years old and I find this life extremly boring and pointless.
Not a single thing is barerly interesting for me. I can't stand doing something for more than twenty minutes or so.

I'm completely socially awkward. I hate humanity and every single human, because many of my so called friends and family members caused a lot of pain. I don't trust anyone besides strangers. 

I'm was in this state for seven years and I really think that ending my life is the only option. I've tried different forms of medications and talks, but nothing seems to work. 

English is not my primary language, sorry about any mistakes.
