Need support with alcoholic mother, please...Hi SW, I'm sorry this isn't related to suicide (although she has thought about it in the past) but I can't find an active addiction subreddit. My mother has been an alcoholic for 5+ years now and I've known about it for 2 or 3 years. My sisters have been abusive to her in the past because she wouldn't let them get their own way and she feels like a failed mother which I think is quite a big reason for her drinking (and her father dying who was her rock and her mother's death will make her feel alone). Whenever she gets money she will buy vodka and drink it till she falls asleep (although there have been times when she's stayed awake and drank....once she nearly burnt the house down and today we went shopping and she took a drink with her and hid it in her bag). She's seen a counsellor and they couldn't help, she's been to support groups and she said they don't help, I've tried to support her and be there for her to talk to and inspire her and it hasn't really helped at all. We've thought about rehab but we can't afford it.

tl;dr: My mum has an alcohol problem and I really need help...

Thanks for any help you can offer! I'll answer any questions that may help you to understand a bit more if it will help.
