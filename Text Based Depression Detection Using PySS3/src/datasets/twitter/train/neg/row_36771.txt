Don't know what to do anymoreSo I'm in high school, grade 9.  For the longest time, I've been feeling depressed and suicidal, I've been self harming a bit and I don't know what to do anymore.  I don't want to live, life is just too difficult to continue on.  Going to school, being around so many people just stresses me a lot, my grades have dropped a little in math.  I do not see a professional about these problems I've been having, nor have I ever been to a professional for any diagnosis.  A couple weeks ago, a therapist of sorts employed by the school approached me, so I assume the school has been catching on that I might be having problems.  She told me that if I wanted to talk, that I could go see her.  I've been debating whether to go or not.  I do want to go see her and get help, but I'm scared that my parents would be informed, and I really do not need that to happen.

I'm scared I'm going to attempt something stupid and I just have no clue of what to do now.
