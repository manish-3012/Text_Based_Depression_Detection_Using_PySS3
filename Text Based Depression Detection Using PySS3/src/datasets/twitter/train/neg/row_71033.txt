Suicide on my mind all dayAll I do is think about ways to kill myself everyday. I just cry and think about dying all day long. Wishing and hoping my life will get better next day. Donâ€™t know if I have the actual mindset to kms. This is draining me mentally and physically though. Does anyone have any advice for me from any angles. Thank you.
