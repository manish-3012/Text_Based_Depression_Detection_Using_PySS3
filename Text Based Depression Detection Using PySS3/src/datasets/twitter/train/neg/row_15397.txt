I'm done 18/fI've struggled with suicidal thoughts for as long as I can remember. I pretended to be happy because to fit in. I've reached my breaking point. My life has turned to absolute shit and I have no one. I stopped making an effort to contact friends or family. No one thought to talk to me. Everyone just forgets about me. I'm not doing well in school I'm already 20k in debt and I can't even afford to come back next year in hopes of getting a degree so I can get a good job. I had someone who used to motivate me to do better and helped me through the rough times but my petty problems broke him. Now he's depressed and suicidal. I'm a failure of a daughter, sister, friend and girlfriend. I'm not gonna make it past this weekend. I'm already far gone and there's no bringing me back. I'm not going to make past this weekend and all I want is to see him one last time. So if you're reading this, please, tristan, I want to say goodbye. I'm not going to change my mind but I just want to see you once more before I go. I'm sorry.
