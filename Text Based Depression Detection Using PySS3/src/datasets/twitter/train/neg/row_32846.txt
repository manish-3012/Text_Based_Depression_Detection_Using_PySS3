I hate it when people says " don't do that ".They don't clearly tell me why I shouldn't do this.

* " It'll be so bad "
* " are you a loser? "
* " you're coward "
* " get some job "
* " f\*ck it dude "

No solutions. No empathy. Just a useless piece of words that annoys me.

I'm telling you how I feel. I'm sharing my true feeling with you and all you say is " don't be a cry baby, you make your family sad ". Thanks idiot, like I don't know their life will ruin after my suicide.

I won't f\*cking suicide but I don't know how to deal with these kind of people. They're everywhere. First they say " Why you don't talk with people " and when I do, they just don't like it. And not only for suicide, this thing goes on for any topic. I'm seriously tired.
