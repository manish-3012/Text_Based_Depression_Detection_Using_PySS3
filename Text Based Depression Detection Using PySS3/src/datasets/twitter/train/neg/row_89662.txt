I think I'm a danger to myself; I have an intense desire to be hurt or killed.(not a sexual desire. just a deep, visceral longing)

I don't really know what to do, and r/SuicideWatch seems to be the most relevant place to put this. 

To get something crucial out of the way: I am NOT going to commit suicide. Not tonight. Not anytime soon. Most likely not ever. 

But I still find myself wanting to die, to be in an accident, to get seriously hurt or wounded or sick. I get excited thinking about possibly dying. I've been reading and watching nothing but horror lately, thinking about the different ways I could be murdered. 

Sometimes I feel like I'm being cowardly. That I actually do want to kill myself but just don't have the guts to do it. Other times I'm appalled at my thoughts. Still other times, I feel like all I want is attention and this is just a fucked up way to get it. 

I don't know what to do. I seem to be thinking rationally right now and I'm worried that I might be a genuine danger to myself (I've been contemplating going on Craiglist and paying someone to mug me and shoot me). I saw another thread on this subreddit about someone wishing they were the ones killed in news stories instead and I'm like "YEAH SAME." 

Maybe I'm just a sick fuck, who even knows. If anyone has a kind word of advice for me I'd really appreciate it. Should I check myself into a psych hospital?
