Opened up about my suicidal feelings and all I got as a response was "Ok ðŸ‘"I've been helping a friend of mine deal with her shit a lot. Not going into details but she's had it rough for the past few months, and I've offered a helping hand whenever she's needed it. But the moment I open up about my feelings and wouldn't mind someone hearing me out, all I get as a response is just an ok and a thumbs up.

Honestly, I'm not even mad because that shit was mad funny for some reason.
