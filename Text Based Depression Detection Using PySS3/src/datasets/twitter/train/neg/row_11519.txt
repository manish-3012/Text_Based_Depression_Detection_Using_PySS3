I figured it out.A case for suicide.

Born into the world preprogrammed by our forbearers. Environment, upbringing and experience then mold us further at an incredibly young age. As a slave to our desires, we act. And desires are not chosen. What compelled me to write was truly not of my choosing, but the result of a complex amalgamation of the above. It did lead me to an unsavory conclusion, however: our purpose as a species is to procreate and endure, nothing more. That is the most fundamental *meaning* for all life. Many seek wealth, power/status, sex. For what purpose other than the former? Pleasure alone? No. Truly it is due to the implicit survival advantages that were learned and continuously reinforced throughout the time humans have existed. 

Endure and procreate. Is immense suffering worthwhile for those who will do neither? So what option remains for these unfortunate, hopeless beings, other than to spite the root cause of it all? 

That cause is **existence** itself.
