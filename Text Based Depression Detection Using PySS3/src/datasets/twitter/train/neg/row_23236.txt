I can't rememberThere is only one period in my life where I haven't dealt with suicidal ideation. I have had a couple attempts, but have always stopped myself. But every single day, I had to learn to reason with suicidal ideation because I didn't have a sense of purpose for myself. I've been on multiple medications, been through a bunch of different life events, but there was only one time in my life where I isn't feel that way. That was when she was in my life. Without her, I can still function, move about, do tasks, etc. But I'm not present. There is no joy. I can't remember a time before or after her that I didn't have to think about suicide, with or without medication. Anything I do is empty without her.
