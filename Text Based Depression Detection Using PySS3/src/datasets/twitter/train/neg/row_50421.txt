How can I get better if I can't get help?19f here. 

I've tried expressing my major depression and suicidal thoughts to two friends in the past.. they felt awkward and walked away - from the situation and from our friendship.

I tried to kill myself about 3 months ago through painkillers (had a lot of strong ones left over from previous operations) but failed because I was vomiting for days afterwards. I tried talking to a doctor but all I felt was pity and I hate talking to strangers, especially about personal stuff. I was on citalopram for 7 months but if anything it made me feel worse!

So what am I supposed to do if I can't talk to anyone about how shit I feel? I just keep feeling worse each day, and honestly I don't know how long I can keep talking myself out of another attempt.
