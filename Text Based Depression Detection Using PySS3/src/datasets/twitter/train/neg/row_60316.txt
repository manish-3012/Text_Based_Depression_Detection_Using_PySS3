Living up to my expectationsFor the past 7 years have had a visions of what I wanted my life to be, and now is a important part. I'm taking the ACT tomorrow and I've come to terms with of I do poorly I'm killing myself, plain and simple. I cant live on knowing that I failed so badly. If I cant pass a simple test, who am I to waste oxygen? Who am I to think that I'm worth anything? It's simple to me and I've come go turns with this fact, but I'm scared that I'm so matter a fact wit this, im so far down the rabbit whole, I cant sleep eat or function like a normal human. Do I deserve to live? In my opinion, why waste everyone else's time
