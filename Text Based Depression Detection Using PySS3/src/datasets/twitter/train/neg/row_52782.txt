I want to end so badEvery evening now I'm consumed by dark thoughts for hours and hours.  They won't go away.  I have so much happening in my life but I'm convinced I don't matter because the world is shit.  Everything I hear makes me convinced resistance is futile and life is hell for everyone from now on.  Nothing in my life matters and I feel unsafe talking to anyone ever since a therapist called the cops and got me involuntarily sent to a psyche ward.  I just have to die.
