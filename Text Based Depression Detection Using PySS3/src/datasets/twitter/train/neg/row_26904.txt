Guess I just needed to put this out in the open.So I've been preparing this a while and after typing it, I sound like a whiny bitch. I'm going to make this tl;dr version instead. 

I'm lazy and I've always hated revising. I want to go to University to do something along the lines of science, but I feel that isn't realistic because I never have any motivation. I think I just want to leave home instead. I don't know what I'd want to do as a job though, I love computer gaming and would love a job in some sort of IT industry like programming or software/hardware development. My chosen AS levels (I'm 16 and I live in the UK) won't be suitable for this job I think - I do maths, biology, chemistry and psychology (irony hahaha).

Although all of what I just wrote there is irrelevant because I just feel like I could end my life here and now. A tiny part of me wanted 21/12 to happen so I wouldn't have to worry about my future. Now I worry more than ever. 

Yes I'd cause my parents/family/close friends depression on somewhat severe scales but I don't really care anymore. I don't have any straightaway methods of killing myself apart from stabbing or jumping so I'm not really in that much danger I suppose. 

I don't know what to do anymore. Do I just end it now or do I look up other options? My parents always seem to make out that without going to Uni that I'm going to fail life and not suceed and be happy. I want to know what my options are. At this moment in time and for a while after, suicide is going to be one of them. I know that even thinking about not commiting suicide is a sign I shouldn't but it's really a 50/50 split and they both seem a viable choice (life and death).

Any help would be greatly appreciated. If you think this is long then you should've read my last one which I didn't submit.

-Anon (hopefully if I selected the right options)

Edit: Grandmother just handed me some clothes she just ironed for me. I could barely smile at her. I hope she doesn't notice.
