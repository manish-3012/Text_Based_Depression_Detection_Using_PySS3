i need help with my best friend!!!!!so to start off, we are a small friend group of three but super close. neither of us have any other friends which is fine coz like i said we are super close. we used to have a larger group but recently it all kinda fell apart and now the three if us are â€žleftâ€œ. but now one of my bf is on vacation and the other is doing miserable. she wasnt doing well before but things got way way worse over the course of two days. sheâ€˜s at great risk of suicide right now and i really dont know what to do. she has a lot of trouble at home and life in general is just so fucked up for her in any way possible. we are so concerned and worry about her. we decided i should ask wether she wants to meet up in the afternoon or in the evening and i asked her if she wanted to stay for the night. she hasnt answered yet even tho she was online all of the time. what should i do? call her? wait? i am really worried and concerned, this is seriously terrifying. i need some advice please !!! thank u in advance
