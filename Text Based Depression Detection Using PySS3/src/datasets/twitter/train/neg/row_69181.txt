I just want to dieI graduated from college with more debt than I thought I would. I didn't get a good degree. I'm not good at anything I want to be good at. I'm really ugly, and have a disability that really drains me. My life is worthless, and I'll never accomplish my dreams. My disability makes most things hard and unattainable. I thought no if I wasn't disabled, my life would be much better. 

There's a gun in the next room, and I think I'm going to shoot myself sometime next week. I'm just waiting for my parents to go On vacation. I hate myself. 

I'll admit I'm a little afraid I'm going to fuck up and damage myself more, but I can't take it.
