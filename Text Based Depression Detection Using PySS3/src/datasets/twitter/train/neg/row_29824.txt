Getting everything in order before I goIâ€™m starting to organize all my art projects, files, clothing, and little nicknacks. Whatever I donâ€™t use/isnâ€™t representative has already been donated. There are still some things that need to be sold so that little burden will be put on those getting rid of my stuff.

Next is making a proper list of account passwords. Leaving behind a complicated mess requiring asking around and showing documents wouldnâ€™t be ideal for my family and friends.

Ultimately, I hope the footage Iâ€™ve spent my teen and adult years collecting will be ripped apart, rebuilt, given new context, by those I trust the most. Cleaning up will make accessing and sharing this material as easy as possible.

Going to make a timed post/email to those most important to me outlining whatâ€™s been left and for who (although Iâ€™m aware that none of these requests would be legally binding). Iâ€™d rather not leave behind a rushed note, I feel it wouldnâ€™t properly represent me very well.
