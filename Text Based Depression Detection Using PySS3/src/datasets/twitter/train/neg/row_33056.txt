Goodbye. Iâ€™m done.I canâ€™t do it anymore. I have a plan. I hope after all the suicidal thoughts Iâ€™ve had Iâ€™ll actually go through this one. Iâ€™m only 18 but I canâ€™t do it anymore itâ€™s not fair. I hate myself too much to even care at this point. 

Thank you for being the sub I went to when I felt lonely before. Iâ€™m sorry you are all in this situation. I understand your pain. I hope it gets better for you.

Goodbye.
