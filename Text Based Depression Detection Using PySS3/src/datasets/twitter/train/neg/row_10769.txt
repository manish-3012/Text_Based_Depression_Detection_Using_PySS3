I can't think of a compelling reason why I should keep goingI'm in my late 30s and have suffered from on-and-off depression for the last 25 years. Throughout the years, there have been brief moments where things were not too bad. But the overwhelming majority of my life since adolescence has been dominated by a cycle of numbness (at best) and utter despair, self-loathing and hopelessness. I've tried therapy and drugs. I've tried to "fake it 'til I made it". I've tried exercise and taking up new hobbies. Nothing has had any lasting effect. I always come back to those familiar feelings of worthlessness. Of feeling like I have absolutely nothing to offer anyone. Of feeling the guilt of having squandered the advantages I have been given in life and knowing that I have no "right" to feel so bad when there is so much "true" suffering in the world.

I know that, if I decide to continue living, there will probably be the occasional "happy" moments in the future. But I don't know if I can continue to fight through all the internal suffering to get to those moments. I am not at all confident that I am strong enough to slog through this current cycle of depression. I'm not even sure if I want to. Even if this passes, I know there will be another round in the near future. Why keep going through this over and over again? Why not end the cycle once and for all?

I don't know why I'm writing this. I don't know what I'm looking for here. I guess I feel like I owe it to my dad and my sister (the only people I feel genuinely give a shit about me) to at least make an attempt to get through this one more time.
