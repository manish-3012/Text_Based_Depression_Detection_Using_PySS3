It is timeI've been wanting this for decades,  (I'm in my 40s). Since I was a small child. Then in my 20s I got diagnosed with a plethora of psychiatric conditions which had plagued me for I don't know how long, maybe since my head injury at 16? My behaviour since that injury has been severely disorded. I gave up different drugs over the course of 23 years. But now, I feel the desperate need to get a needle up my arm. Sooner the better. I'm afraid of telling someone who knows me, for obvious reasons. Also, I'm not sure how to get hold of the shit. I should use a throwaway account for this but I don't give a fuck. Btw, I was violently 'raped' by someone I shouldn't be involved with but I'm obsessed with last week and he's the only friend I have.
