Depression hits backTherapists and psychologists can be very good, very useful, very helpful. Yet depression is a bitch who always tries to hold on to its prey. Today it makes me feel useless, without any future plan. Without any interest for a longer life. I remember how miserable I've always been. I think deeply about how I ruined the only non toxic love I could have had. How I used to be at my worst. The people I hurt. The opportunities I missed. Days like these when I want to die. Perhaps today, perhaps another time. I always have the feeling it will not end well for me. I want to kill myself today. And I'll want the same tomorrow, once the meds aren't strong enough anymore.
