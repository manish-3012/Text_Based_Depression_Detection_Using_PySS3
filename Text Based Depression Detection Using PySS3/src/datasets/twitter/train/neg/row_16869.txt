overthinking and constant worrying.hello everyone, i am 16 this year. 

nowadays, i have a problem which is constantly ruining my day and my chance to go out and socialize with my friends, and it's driving me crazy. i constantly worry about messing things up, and i overthink it till the point i think that it really happened, and no matter if i succeed; i just can't be happy because i would still worry about the next thing. 

 for example, i recently passed my major exam with decent grades, which made me eligible to go into a college. and when i was submitting my form i got into a little argument with the office staff, but i still handed it up nonetheless. when i went back to look at my form again because i was worried if i wrote something wrongly, the staff said it's not here. but when my friend went to check, the form was there. this led me to worry that she might purposely misplace my form. that's not all, i constantly worry about if i wrote my number and details correctly. i can't check with them now because they gave it to the school already.

this is ruining my life because i would constantly overthink the issue and i can't do anything else. i can't be happy about my success no matter what i do.  what's wrong with me?
