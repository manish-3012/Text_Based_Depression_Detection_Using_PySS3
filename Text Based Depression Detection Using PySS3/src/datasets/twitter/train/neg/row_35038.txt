Whatâ€™s the point of it all?Why do I have to suffer for decades? Whether it be work or illness or just life in general. I was given all the wrong cards and if this was poker you just fold and give up those cards, why canâ€™t I do that? I canâ€™t see this getting any better at all. And if it does, it stays that way for two seconds and goes right back in the shithole.
