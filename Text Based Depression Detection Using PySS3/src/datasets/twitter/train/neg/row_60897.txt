I just want everything to end, all is meaningless.My friend just left me. She was the only person I've could tell everything. The only one I felt accepted by. When we've met over an year ago, she was just like me. Shy, depressed, fragile. And now she leaves to become an adult. Leaving me there and telling me that I need to grow up too or it'll become too hard to handle to grow up after few more years. But I never wanted to grow up. I had my own beautiful world, with people I loved and cared about. The time took them all away. They all have their own lifes and had forgot about me. I feel like trash, which nobody even wants to pick up. I just want it all to end. I have nobody to live for and I'm unable to live alone. I just want someone to be there for me, just as I will be there for them. But as I see, nobody wants me to be a part of their live. I never wanted to kill myself as much as now. Last year was the hardest in my life, and I survived only because of her. And now even she left. I'm left all alone. Left to die here, in the ruins of my little world.
