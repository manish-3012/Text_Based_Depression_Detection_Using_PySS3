Fuck this!!!!I'm just gonna say that I'm 18 years old I'm in college and I've already fucked up two semesters I never feel anything nothing makes me happy anymore! I wasn't taught in high school how to write a fucking thesis and now I'm expected to write one for every fucking essay I write in English class I've got like three friends one of them is my boyfriend! I feel like I fucking hate fucking everything and everyone I come accross I fucking hate my job and I hate my life and I hate myself!!!
