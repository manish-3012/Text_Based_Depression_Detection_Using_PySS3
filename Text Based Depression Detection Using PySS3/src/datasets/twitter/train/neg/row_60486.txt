I can't walk further, you have to leave me here.Hello SuicideWatch,

Here I am again.
I feel so dead and empty since years. Years that went by like there is no future, but only day after day.
I just try to live this life one more day every day. Can you relate to the feeling when the sun rises, and you know you 're still here. Every evening I hope I'll be somewhere else and someone else... i fucked up my school when I was younger and now I'm working for minimum wage as a slave. I mean I feel like I am a slave... i really hate my job. But i want to do something and don't want my family to think I am a failure.

I don't live for my own. I live to pretend for others I am a normal happy person, but right now I'm crying. I am a man. What is wrong with me... I have a breakdown... I WANT TO BREAK OUT BUT I CAN'T DO IT ALONE ... PLS is someone out there... someone help me... please... oh god why...
