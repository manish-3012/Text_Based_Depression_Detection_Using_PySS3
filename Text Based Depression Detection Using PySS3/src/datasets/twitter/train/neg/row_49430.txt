The only person helping me see a reason to live completely broke my trust.. And immediately the reason to live is gone. The hope he gave me is gone. I don't know what to do anymore because the guidance is gone. 

I'm not saying necessarily that he *was* my reason to live. But I'm a young woman and he's got quite a few years on me. He has no idea how much I looked up to him. I told him everything about me and as soon as he was given the chance, he spilled the darkest of my secrets to a girl I sent to talk to him when I was in the hospital briefly. I had wanted her to explain the story to him and be there if he needed to ask questions about it. But instead she awkwardly entertained a conversation that consisted of him spewing confidential information to someone who I'm not even close to.

I guess you can say I've given up, Reddit. I have given up on the reason to live, the hope, the guidance. He took it all away just as fast as he gave it to me and I feel worse than I've ever felt. I have the tools to end my life relatively quickly and painlessly. I just miss him.
