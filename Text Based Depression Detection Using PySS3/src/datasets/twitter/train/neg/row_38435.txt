I guess my dad's been going through my room because the shotgun shells are gone. Fuck.And the guns been moved. I don't know where it is anymore. If it weren't for that I'd say I misplaced them. At least now I know that on top of everything else I have absolutely no privacy. I feel more trapped than ever. Suicide was my way out. The one last ditch effort I had in case things got too bad. Now I'm scared shitless. Oh and there is no way I'm letting them put me back in the hospital. If I go back it will be involuntary and I won't go quietly. I suppose I'd better get a rope and hide it better. I really didn't want to hang myself though. The gun was going to make it so easy. All I fucking had to do was shoot myself yesterday at lunch. I had everything, but no I chickened out and now it's too fucking late.

Edit: If I had just hidden those damn shells better I wouldn't be in this mess. More evidence of my utter incompetence I suppose. I shouldn't have even bought them until I was ready to use them.

And I'm getting the hell out of this house even if it means I'll be homeless. I won't live like a damn prisoner.

Edit 2: Turns out shotguns are cheaper than I thought. Yay.
