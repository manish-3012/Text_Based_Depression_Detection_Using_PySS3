I don't deserve to liveI almost slept with my friends brother and she hates me now. I can't do anything right no matter what I do. I'm the failure child- my sister is the married one with a good job, I just live at home and am still in school. I only make bad decisions. I drink and make stupid decisions. Yeah my pets and mom and sister will miss me but they'll get over it. They'll be relieved they don't need to take care of me anymore and stress about what other stupid stuff I've gotten into. I hate myself and everyone around me does too. It'll be better when I'm gone.
