i dont know what to doI havenâ€™t contemplated suicide in quite a while but will say im pretty damn stressed right now. I want to chase my dreams but Iâ€™m afraid of failure and what my grandfather will say. My grandfather is a big part of my life and i have nothing but respect for him and want to make him proud. But college and school in general is depressing and monotonous to me. I almost dropped out of high school for these very reasons. If anybody has any advice please let me know
