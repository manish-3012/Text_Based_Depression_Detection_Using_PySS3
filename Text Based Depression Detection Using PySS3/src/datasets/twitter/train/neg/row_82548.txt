This one might be a little different.Lately iâ€™ve been feeling so alone. I donâ€™t have many friends besides my gf (relationship is a little messy) but i have a really supportive family which makes me think i shouldnâ€™t feel like this. I feel like iâ€™m not depressed and i havenâ€™t told anyone about how i feel. But most days i just get this feeling in my gut like i wanna end it. I always tell myself thereâ€™s no way i could be depressed bc i care about people and i just feel like thereâ€™s no way i could have it. The thing is the only way i would do anything is if i had a gun but luckily my family locks thereâ€™s up and hides the key (probably a good measure). I also donâ€™t go out seeking to end my life or anything but if i happened to stumble on a gun i feel like i would actually do it. Iâ€™ve never told anyone about how i feel and i donâ€™t know if i ever will, mainly because i feel like people would think iâ€™m using like a â€œdepressed angleâ€ for attention or something like that. Honestly i canâ€™t tell if thatâ€™s what it is and thatâ€™s the main reason i donâ€™t think iâ€™m depressed. I just donâ€™t know what to do anymore. I canâ€™t tell if my head is actually messed up or not.
