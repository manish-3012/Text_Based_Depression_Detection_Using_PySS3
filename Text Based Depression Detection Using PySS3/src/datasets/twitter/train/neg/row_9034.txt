I hate the thought of just being aliveSo I'm 26 I've dealt with depression since a young age, all through jr high and high school till now. I've been to therapy I've done the meds I've tried having positive outlook,  ive tried being selfless and letting my good deeds make me happy.  I've even responded to a few people on here.  It's not like I want to die, I have things that's I want to achieve on my life.  But and I mean a huge but I don't care about any of it I don't care about people I don't care about having money I don't care about having fun. I just wake up and want to die,  I go through my day and want to die, I go to sleep wanting to die.  I am very very suicidal, I might not do it today,  tomorrow,  or even months from now but I will do it because I hate hate hate humans, society, life in general. I can go into more details about things you want to know but this is just me typing as I think so bad punctuation and thoughts all over the place.  I am posting on here cause I have no one to talk to at the moment
