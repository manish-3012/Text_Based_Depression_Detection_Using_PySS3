Why?I don't know exactly why I want to do this. I'm not really depressed. I'm a smart guy, I should know better. But why shouldn't I? I'm 16, I don't like my life and I don't see it getting better. I don't like the person I am and I don't see him changing. Why continue if I'm unhappy with everything?

When I realized I was going to do it tonight I got an amazing mood. I felt great. Not a care in the world.  I plan on hanging myself sometime in the next half hour. But that could change. I've done this 4 times in the past. I can't keep this up though. Sooner or later I have to either snap out of this or murder myself. Hopefully the latter. 

I don't know why I'm typing this...

Also, what should I put in a suicide note?

Edit: looks like it won't be tonight, but I think I need help. How do I go about that?
