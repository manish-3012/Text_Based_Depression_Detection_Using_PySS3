I don't want to wake up anymoreIt's been so long since I've woken up feeling anything other than dread or anxiety. I'm so tired. 

I find temporary happiness in other people but at the end of the day, when it's just me and my head, I see nothing but dark in my future. Either occluded by despair or nonexistent. 

Tomorrow isn't a new day for me, it's just another empty waking life. So what's the point of opening my eyes anymore.
