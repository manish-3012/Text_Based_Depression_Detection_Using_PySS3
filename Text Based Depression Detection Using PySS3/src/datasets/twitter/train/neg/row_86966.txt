Writing a suicide letterI decided to leave, but I do love my family and close friends, donâ€™t want to leave them without any explanation. 

I decided to write a kind, beautiful letter, as my last gift. 
I try to explain them a few things, it will maybe save them huge money in therapy.
I am telling them I love them, that I been happy overall, but it is your current situation that I canâ€™t stand. I Lie a bit if necessary. I Tell them I will look after them from above, even if I have some doubts about that. It may help them with their pain and loss. 

I decided to leave my Â«Â valuablesÂ Â» prepared for each person, and also do a will, so they have less to worry about. 


I must go in a horrible way, because the country I live in it is not easy to find the Â«Â painlessÂ Â» tools. So I do owe them leaving at least 

I hope you get to be stronger then me and choose to live
