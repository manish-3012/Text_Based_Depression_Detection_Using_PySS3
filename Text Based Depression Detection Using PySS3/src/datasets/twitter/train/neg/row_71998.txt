Iâ€™m done doing whatâ€™s rightMy whole life Iâ€™ve always done the right thing, but why? No one else does. Most people are selfish and only care about themselves. Well thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m going to do for awhile before I end my life. Iâ€™m going to smoke more, drink more, and lie more. I am going to be more selfish and less caring. Iâ€™m going to fuck off at work and stop being the perfect employee. Iâ€™m going to walk past trash and not pick it up. Iâ€™m going to put random items where they donâ€™t belong in the grocery store. And Iâ€™m going to enjoy it all.
