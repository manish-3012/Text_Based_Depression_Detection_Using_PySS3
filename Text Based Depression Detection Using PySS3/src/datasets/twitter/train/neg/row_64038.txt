Friend is talking about hurting themselves and I don't know what to doMy friend is talking about hurting themselves and I'm trying my best to keep talking to them but I'm worried it won't be enough. I know they live in New Zealand but I don't know where and I don't know what to do if they seriously hurt themselves.
