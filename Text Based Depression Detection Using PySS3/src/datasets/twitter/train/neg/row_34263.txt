Only one other option. I'd kind of like to go with the less humiliating one.So, unrequited love, financial castastrophe, inability to spell catastrophe correctly, resources completely tapped, hair falling out and memory fading from meds that don't even fucking work (obviously), can't provide for my daughter at all and ridiculous self-loathing have brought me to this. I've been here before, but at least I had a job then. I'm down to nothing. It's gonna be hard to get a job while living out of my car and that's only until it gets repo'd. I've taken the final step into becoming another homeless, disabled veteran. I'd rather be a fucking corpse. I should have just gone through with it before instead of asking for help. I could have saved myself the humiliation. I can hear people now... "Why don't you just get another job?". Take a look around people! The only jobs are shit jobs. I know engineers who are working at fucking Wendy's because there is nothing else. And even if I did get a job today, I wouldn't get paid for a couple weeks and that is plenty of time to get evicted. Might as well get a new necktie and request that my former employer, (who first fired me and then made sure I wouldn't get unemployment) clean up the fucking mess. I'm done. I've had it. Kiss my ass! I've suffered enough for one goddamned lifetime. Yeah. Only 34 years you might say. Over 3 fucking decades is long enough to live in this fucked up skull. Think about it... Bipolar, bisexual, former military, twice divorced... do the fucking math. Fuck this. Pah! Am I human? Go fuck yourself captcha
