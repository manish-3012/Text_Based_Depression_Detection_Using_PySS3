The more I research suicide the less I actually want to kill myselfIâ€™ve spent about 3 days researching suicide to the point where Iâ€™m quite knowledgeable about the subject but now I just donâ€™t know. Donâ€™t get me wrong Iâ€™m still very suicidal but like they say in the army the quickest way out is through. I guess I just feel like it would be faster for me to die naturally then if I accidentally fuck up the noose or somehow survive the bullet or something.
