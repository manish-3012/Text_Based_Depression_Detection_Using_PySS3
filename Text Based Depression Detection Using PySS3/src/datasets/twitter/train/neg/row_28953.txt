Step father assaults me (17yo m) I am now homeless and have no where to go.I have had long list with issues with my step dad, I will wrap it up simply with we just don't get a long. This morning before college ( in us terms last year before uni). I have a job at a supermarket but I don't make enough to be able to afford to rent my own place, I don't own a car so I can't sleep in that and my genetic father is away on holiday . I have no where left to go academically I am subpar despite my intelligence and the only route I can see is to die, I doubt I will be able to maintain my job for very long homeless. Advice needed 
Edit 1: after speaking to my counsellor she referred me to a hospital, I have found accommodation from a family friend until Sunday. Sunday I will be able to stay with my father ( he is currently in Copenhagen)  until the hostel has room for me. Police have currently taken my step father into custody to the distress of my mother. Not feeling much better really.
