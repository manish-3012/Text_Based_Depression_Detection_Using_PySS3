Please help meI have so much going for me in my life. I have so many things to look forward to and consider myself lucky to have the life I live. 

Why do I feel so suicidal? 

Depression and anxiety has been a major battle for 6 years, and Iâ€™m so tired of it. I have been on medication for months, and have been on different kinds of medication previously. I go to counseling and I have been trying to open up more about this with my close friends and my boyfriend. I have been doing everything youâ€™re â€œsupposedâ€ to be doing to get better for years, yet here I am. 
I am suicidal and have been for the past 6 years, but have known for the past few years that it isnâ€™t something I would attempt again. 

Iâ€™m sitting on my floor with this overwhelming feeling of wanting to just end it all. Iâ€™m tired of feeling like this. My life isnâ€™t that much of a shit show, Iâ€™d say itâ€™s pretty normal with the normal amount of fucked up shit thatâ€™s happened in my life. 

The past 6 years I have known nothing but depression and anxiety, and I honestly donâ€™t know what itâ€™s like to live otherwise. I donâ€™t even know if the medication Iâ€™m currently on is working because I have not known what genuine â€œhappinessâ€ and â€œcontentâ€ has felt like. 
I want to live, but I hate living this life with these constant feelings. 

Please talk me out of this. Iâ€™m fucking tired and these feelings are so overwhelming right now. I feel like I have no control over myself and my actions right now and Iâ€™m absolutely terrified.
