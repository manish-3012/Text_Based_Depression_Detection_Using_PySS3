I feel so betrayedFor three years I have devoted my life to one person, and we loved each other, or so I thought.
He was there through a horrible stage in my life where I was sexually assaulted and hit at home and had no way to cope.
My life has been so difficult and he has always been my shoulder to lean on. I changed all my future plans to be with him.
As it turns out, he never loved me, and he's had a girlfriend for the majority of the time, even though he denies it.
I've been wanting to die for six years now. I don't know how much longer I can go on without him by my side anymore. I'm scared and alone and confused. I don't know what to do anymore... I don't even know how I'm supposed to be living my life either; I don't see the point in it. I've been walking around like a zombie for the past week. I see no point in living. I hurt all the time.
