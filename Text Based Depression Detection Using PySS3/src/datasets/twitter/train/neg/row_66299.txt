Does life get better?Iâ€™m 28 years old and Iâ€™ve been wanting life to end since I was 15 pretty much. I thought life would have gotten better by now but it hasnâ€™t. Iâ€™m still friendless, Iâ€™m still bullied, and I still have no reason to live.  Whatâ€™s the point anymore? Does anyone care? I know people say its a selfish thing to commit suicide, but Iâ€™m trying to think of people who would actually care if I was gone or at least come to my funeral.  

I hate my life. When does it end?
