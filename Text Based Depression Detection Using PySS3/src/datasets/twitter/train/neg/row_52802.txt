roses are red, violets are blue, my heart is dead im such a foolI feel so dead inside. I lack emotion. It hurts. I'm just going through the motions. I have no drive or motivation to do anything. Life's not worth it. The sky's are gray and the people are fake. Depression sucks + social anxiety and paranoia = meaningless existence. 
if you know the song that's cool but im a fool.
