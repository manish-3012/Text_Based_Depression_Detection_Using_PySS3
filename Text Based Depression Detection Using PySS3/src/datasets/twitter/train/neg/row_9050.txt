Nobody understands my chronic pain and depressionThe pain is getting worse and worse. It hurts when I open my mouth. It hurts when I talk. My face hurts 24/7 because of a surgery. Iâ€™ve been eating very unhealthy lately and I have acne on my left cheek. It fucking hurts. My period came today and itâ€™s unbearable. 

Doctors dont know why and wonâ€™t prescribe me any painkillers. OTC pills donâ€™t work. Iâ€™m trapped. What did I do in life that i deserve to live with so much pain? I want to continue living, I want to travel, I want to go to restaurants, I want to fucking explore the world but Iâ€™m in so much pain and I donâ€™t know how much longer I can stay alive. I donâ€™t have a choice.
