I'm tired, and I'm done.It's far too long to explain and I'm not exactly sure I'm going to want to ever start. I thought I did things right this time but I guess it turns out otherwise. It's been since October I've contemplated this. I'm currently in a city that I used to consider one of my most favoured + beautiful... There's a nice new bridge that just got completed here that offers a pretty nice view of the horizon.

No one on this Earth knows, or has ever known how sad I am.

If I'm not here reading this later, thank you Reddit for just existing; Thank you for your time reading when my own best friend wouldn't.
