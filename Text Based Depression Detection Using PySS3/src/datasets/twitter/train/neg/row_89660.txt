aaaghhI realize the repercussions those around me would face were I to die, and I realize how lucky I am in general, and though I appear normal and healthy to those around me, I still am tempted. It is such a simple answer. I have depression &amp; anxiety. I tried before, and I was hospitalized. 

My main reasoning right now is that I worry that people around me don't really care about me, although I'm sure everyone would pretend as though they did if I were to die. I worry about what people think about me; I seek validation. It is hard for me to believe that people like me because of how much I don't like myself. I feel insignificant and I feel like I am not really that important to my friends. I know that this would affect those that do care about me immensely, yet, things just feel not worth it. I'm going to post this now without re-reading it before I decide against it.
