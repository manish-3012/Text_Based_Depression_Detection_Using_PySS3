Letâ€™s be real we havenâ€™t did it yet cause of fearA failed suicide means an even worse life. Check ins at a mental institute. Organ/brain damage. Family and friends looking down on you. I couldnâ€™t even imagine that life. 

Not only that but no one wants a painful death as well. People think odâ€™n on pills is easy but no itâ€™s not. Thereâ€™s a high chance of survival and the after effects would make you hate life even more.

Then you want to think about a gun. Do you really want to blow 500-600 for a handgun just to take yourself out? 

All these thoughts is what drove me away from taking myself out. For the mean time Iâ€™m planning on a career switch which should happen next year
