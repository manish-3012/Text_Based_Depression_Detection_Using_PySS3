Hope is now goneI'm 17m and I'm considering taking my own life. This isn't the first time I've posted here, I was naive enough to use my main Reddit account which later lead other people to find it and make fun of me for posting on here. I've been diagnosed with clinical anxiety and depression since I was 10 years old, and I'm sick of constantly having small sparks of happiness followed by long periods of sadness. Going to a same-sex catholic school and announcing myself as gay was a dumb decision that I can't change, i can't switch school either because my final year is coming around. I would go into more details of the events but I'm anxious about other people tracking this post and linking it to me somehow. I look at other peoples posts and I view myself being so naive, worthless and stupid compared to the situations others are in, which is another reason why I should give up.
