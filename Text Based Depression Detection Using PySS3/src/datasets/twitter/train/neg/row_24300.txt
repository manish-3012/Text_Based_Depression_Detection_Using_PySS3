I'm so unstableOne moment I'm fine, the other I want to kill myself. No matter how much I try in this life, things never end up going the right way. I want to end it all so badly tonight, yet I'm fighting as best as I can the desire and feeling, because I want to live for the person I love. But at the same time, I might have already lost the person I love, so what's the point in living anymore? I'm so confused, conflicted and scared, and I just want peace, and the peace I start craving more and more is the one of death. I'm so fucked in head.
