Killing myself is the only thing I can think about.I'm at work right now and the only thing I can think about is to go to the back of the storage building behind the office and hang myself. Pretty sure I wouldn't be discovered for a few days. Next Friday will be my 31st birthday and that was enough living for me. I'm not particularly sad, just empty and tired and lonely. I'm not even sure why I'm posting this. Just to vent I guess. Sorry for my English, it's not my native language.
