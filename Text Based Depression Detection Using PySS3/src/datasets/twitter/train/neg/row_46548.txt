I think Iâ€™m only alive now because I love my son.A bunch of shit has happened recently. In the past year and a half actually. Itâ€™s been one thing after another. 

And then something big happened in October. And then a few weeks ago something big happened again. And last week, the worst of all. 

And for the first time in my life Iâ€™m not depressed or anxious about any of these bad things happening. I feel nothing. Nothing at all. 

Iâ€™ve felt happier I guess? More upbeat for the *most* part. But I think thatâ€™s only because I know i wonâ€™t make it much longer. I know I canâ€™t keep going. I just have no energy to. I just want it to stop. Everything. 

I think if I didnâ€™t have a young child, Iâ€™d have already done it. Heâ€™s all thatâ€™s getting me through. But now Iâ€™m having a hard time believing that heâ€™s benefitting from me being here anyway. Thatâ€™s the only time I get sad. I just think Iâ€™m failing him whether Iâ€™m here or not. 

Iâ€™ve always struggled with mental health but for the most part, I cared so much about my future and success and family that I wouldnâ€™t have gone through with killing my self.

Now I just donâ€™t care. Not about anything really, except the love I have for my son. I hope that even if I have to go eventually, he knows how hard I tried not to for him.
