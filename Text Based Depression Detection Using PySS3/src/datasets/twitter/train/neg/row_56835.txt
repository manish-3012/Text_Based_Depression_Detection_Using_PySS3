I had a bad breakdown today.[Background info here, posted on r/depression a week ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/50lqq2/ashamed_and_embarrassed/)

Today my job hunt made me sadder and sadder, plus I found out that the chiropractic treatment after the accident isn't covered on my car insurance because I was using my car for work purposes. I went into my ex-SO's room for a cry and a hug. I have messed up so much and had other things mess up my life so much that I've dug myself into a hole and can't get out except by dying. I'm tired of fighting and struggling all the time only to lose and miss the mark.

At one point I begged for my ex-SO to kill me or just let me die so I could be free from all this. He wouldn't let me but he did keep saying "No, don't say sorry" whenever I apologized for being such a wreck.

I would go to the ER or seek in-patient treatment but I have a court date on the 14th, a medication visit the day before that, and 2 job interviews tomorrow. **I just want this all to stop ASAP.**
