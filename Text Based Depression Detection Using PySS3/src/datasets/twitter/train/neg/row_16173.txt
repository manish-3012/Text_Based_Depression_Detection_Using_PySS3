I am only living for my momHello,

So as the title states, the only reason i haven't killed myself is my mom. Her love for her children is endless, she even panics when i miss a call from her or i'm late, since she immediately suspects something might have happened to me. So if i or anyone of my siblings happened to die, the resulting stress would most likely kill her considering she suffers from diabetes and hypertension. 

But i can't bear life anymore, i'm stupid as hell in everyday life, can't think for the love of god, have no common sense and will probably work a minimum wage job for the rest of my life, if i ever even find a job. 

 Even beyond that i'm a social catastrophy. I have only two friends i barely do something with because socializing drains the little brain energy that i have. I am also unable to make new friends since this pile of shit i have in my head, made it impossible for me to develop any interests or hobbies. Thinking about the simplest things overwhelms me. I will never find a partner as well because i'm hideous. On top of that i'm male and short. From a evolutionary perspective i'm the last person that should procreate. If it wasn't for my mom, i would have already ended this pile of genetical garbage that is me.
