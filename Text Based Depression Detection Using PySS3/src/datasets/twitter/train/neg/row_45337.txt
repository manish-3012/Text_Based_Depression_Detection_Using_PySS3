i see no good reason to be alive.i've been having a lot of thoughts lately, about life as a whole--just the nature of the beast, so to speak. i've pretty much always suffered from major depression and a lot of recent life events have driven me to think in very negative manners, namely towards suicidal ideation. i like to consider myself a rational person and as such i tried to put this into the most logical frame i possibly could and, all things considered, i can't really see a reason to continue being alive.

i would've like to say i hit some big revelation that told me exactly what i wanted and that everything would be okay but instead i've revealed to myself this much bigger mountain. to put it in some form of list.

- i suffer from mental illness that does not seem to be significantly impacted or aided by medication. this makes normal life function very difficult and leads to my inability to maintain or obtain meaningful personal relationships, be they platonic, romantic, sexual, or etc. in effect, i exist in a strange limbo where either someone does not know i am mentally ill, in which case i must put on a very tiring mask of deceit, or they do know, in which case my value as a person will most likely go down.

- i am gay. obviously, there's nothing wrong with this and you'd have to be some form of sociopath to suggest otherwise, but in the society we live in, this is a factor that adds an additional factor of strife and difficulty and lowers my societal value even further.

- as a result of this--and due to depression's effect on my previous schooling and work experience--it will be nearly impossible for me to obtain any sort of work that is in any way emotionally fulfilling or interesting. menial labor is neither of those things and, at present and for the foreseeable future, it is the only thing i could qualify for.

- i have nothing to offer as a skill, regardless of it's viability as an economically driving factor. i do not write well; i do not have any performance talents; i am not particularly intelligent or able to hold an interesting conversation or comfort someone off of a ledge. i am effectively a null factor on the earth as a whole; i will not have a major impact, i will not affect any sort of influence. my existence is minute, both in the grand scheme of things (in which case one could argue that any life is minute) and on a personal level. my existence or lack thereof would not change the world.

- due to mental illness and a general apathy towards the world at large, i am nigh-incapable of enjoying anything, which takes away perhaps one of the other reasons for living, which is sheer hedonistic pleasure. 

- i am an additional drain on the already limited resources of the world, my family, and any temporary friendships/relationships i may forge as a result of proximity or lack of other options.

- i have tried for years--since the teenage years, where i was told 'it gets better'--to improve my mental illness through just about any means possible, be it chemical, physical, or through 'the power of positive thinking'. it has not. it will not. there is no light at the end of the tunnel, nor is there any reason to believe that there will be reprieve. every day will simply be a new and further low.

i apologize for the length of this--i don't mean to suck up any more time. it just hit me recently the sheer meaningless and worthlessness of my life. i am simply a spot that could be filled by anyone, and perhaps i should leave it to someone with something more to offer.

i don't know if there's a greater point to this. i don't think there is--it's not cohesive enough for that--just feelings that i needed to disperse like miasma before i reach my hopeful expiration.
