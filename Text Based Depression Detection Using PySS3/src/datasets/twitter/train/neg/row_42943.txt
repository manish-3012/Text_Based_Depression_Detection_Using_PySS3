Chronically Ill Young College Student - help please?I'm 22 years old. Four and a half years ago I got diagnosed with a chronic condition, which has completely changed my life for the worse. I was the type of person that could have really made a difference: changed the world for the better. I had the intelligence, the drive, and most importantly the opportunities to follow through. This disease has broken me. Everyday I'm plagued with pain on many fronts. I've lost much of my physical dexterity and mental quickness. Worst of all I've lost the drive and motivation that's let me push on despite the pain...despite the long hours of true agony.

I've been beaten into submission, and I yield. I can truly take no more. My condition will only grow worse as the years go on. I'll try one experimental treatment after the next, putting my family in tremendous debt. They won't work or at the very best they'll prolong the inevitable. I will die of this affliction in some manner provided something else doesn't kill me sooner.

I've always considered myself a religious man. I've spent my life, as short as it's been, in prayer and good faith - not to say that I haven't had my missteps along the way. However, I'm apparently doomed to an incontrovertible thought process: if there really is a god, why does he let me suffer? Either he can't do anything about it, he refuses to do anything about it, or he doesn't exist. Inevitably this can only lead to the conclusion that God, if he exists, is not worth worshiping. But if there is no God than there are no consequences, and I won't be doomed to hellfire eternal like I've been taught, if I take matters into my own hands and end my pain.

Am I so wrong, either in ethical or religious ways, for wanting an end to what appears to be a lifelong promise of anguish?
