At this point, I don't trust anybody else to help me.I'm going to try to get to the point as fast as possible, but it's sort of a long and complicated story, so please bear with me...

I've dealt with clinical depression and generalized anxiety disorder for years. Ever since early high school, I guess (I'm a Freshman in college.) Things have been getting progressively gotten worse.

 The college transition was really rough on me; I constantly forgot to take medication, was having trouble with my long-term girlfriend(who I went to college with) and academics just weren't falling in place. 

On September 12th of 2010, I attempted suicide via overdose. I was admitted to the hospital for a couple of days, which scared me out of my suicidal ideations for a few weeks, but it didn't take long til I was back to where I was in the previous months. Less than a week after my attempt, my girlfriend had sex with one of my closest college friends. It wasn't completely unwarranted, because we had sort of agreed on an open relationship, but it still pissed me off, because he swore he would never do anything with her.

I took a leave of absence from school following these events. 

I was admitted to a hospital program in November and was there daily for a month, working out my issues. I felt great there. I was happy. I had hope. Then I got out and started feeling like shit again.

I've been back at school for about 2 weeks and I'm getting shitty grades in class. I never remember to take my medication. I rely on my girlfriend when I become suicidal, and that burden is wearing her thin. 

Bottom line:
I feel worthless. I feel like I'm leading a messed-up, unhealthy life. I feel like I'm a burden to everyone around me and I would be better off away from this world and that other people would benefit from that in the long term, too.
It would just be so much easier to end everything and not have to deal with this bullshit.

What do I do, Reddit?
