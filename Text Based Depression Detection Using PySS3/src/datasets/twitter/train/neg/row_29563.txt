I have allmost no hope for a better life anymore.What prevented me from ending my life yet, was my hope that i can turn my life around. I have no friends, never had a girlfriend at the age of 24, never had a job. I have huge social anxiety. I started going to school again, to get a better graduation and more important to socialize and get friends. But all the people in class are absolute idiots and i lost my hope that i can actually get friends here pretty fast. But at least there was one girl that i find attractive and also gave me hints that she likes me, but i never could show my interest in her because of my social anxiety. So she must thought that i have no interest in her. Now she has a boyfriend and my only hope for a better future is crushed. I have to go to school whith this class for another year and i wont make friends here, so i think my life will be most likely the same mess for another year. I thought going to school again would be the easiest way to get in touch with people, but i was deadly wrong. And now that think that my social situation will stay the same for a long time, i think about to end it all.
