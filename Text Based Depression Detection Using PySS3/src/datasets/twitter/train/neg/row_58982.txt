My wife died and now i am dead tooI am a 36 year old man. Last sunday my worst nightmare became a reality. My wife got killed by a drunken driver. We were married for 11 years and she is the love of my life. I would do anything for her, i would give my life for hers. She was the only family i had. Lost both of my parents at a young age. I can't live with this. As i am writing this i have my pistol on my desk. So when you read this it's too late. I will already be dead. Thank you reddit for entertaining me for countless of hours. But this is just too much for me to handle. Emily i will always love you and i can't wait to see you again
