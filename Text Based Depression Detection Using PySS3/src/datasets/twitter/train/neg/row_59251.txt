Dead endGrew up in a broken family with my mom. We've always been middle class to upper middle class. She worked as a flight attendant for 18 years but she claims she retired to take care of me and I lived a normal life preforming well until we had financial problems. I went to a different school due to finances and got incredibly bullied cause I only spoke english and my academics suffered. She managed to sell our second house and managed to enroll me in a nicer friendlier protestant school.

Few years ago she left Manila to work in New York.  and she went to New York so that she could pay off for the house and I could continue studying in good schools. My relationship with her hasn't been perfect but ever since she left to work abroad I began living with a classmate's family, living by myself and a helper, living in a dormitory and after that living by myself eventually having a homeless Bangladeshi  friend of my dad live with me and a helper. I just turned 18 a few months ago (Well it feels like a few months but I turned 18 december of 2019).

I spent my last school year in a big urban school. I was culture shocked again but determined to succeed. I was doing well for myself. It is a big scar for me that my roomate in the dormitory was into being a tough guy and causing a lot of fights. He was a 23 year old repeater studying the the level of 17 year olds. He would randomly harrass me for being gay since I wasn't good at tagalog and he would harrass girls as well. I had a crazy school year for 2018-2019 and i felt it was life changing. My trouble maker roomate eventually got kicked out but I began acting tough trying to avoid the harassment i received from ever happening again.I made the wrong friends after he got kicked out, I hanged with the bad kids and had flings and got drunk atleast once a week.

I tried to change. I opted to leave the dormitory and come back home. I wanted to repeat the school year to get higher grades and it worked. I went to the rival school of the school i grew up in but instead of protestant christians they were baptists. I heard about the school because when I was in the big urban school my orgmates from there explained their educational system called Accelerated Christian Education. So i became the kid who lived alone who enrolled in ACE. My moms friend who was a neighbour was acting like  guardian provided food and did the chores but wasn't always around because she had her own family.

Everything went well for my redemption arc until 2020. 2019 was strong. I did well in the ACE school, didn't drink a drop of alcohol (except for once or twice during occasions), started going to the gym and became more active in my sport. The only problem was my classmates realising I lived alone and didn't have any parents representing me. I would go home after a long day of school to an empty house. I feel like a lot has been stolen from me. Mom and I didn't have a nice relationship but we would occasionally watch movies together and go to nice places maybe once a week or at least once a month. But I really felt the pain this year, the fourth year without her. Going to movies by myself or eating in restaurants alone or my new classmates slowly figuring out that i lived alone because of no parents coming to events or representing me.  

&amp;#x200B;

But towards 2020 my relationship with my classmates crumbled it feels like history repeating with my roomate, sometimes i question if im the one with the problem. We have this classmate that is the son of a school director that has always been a bully in the school. When I first arrived in the ACE school he and his best friend were my instant friend group. They would invite me to outings and they were great lads. But as I became close he would tease me like how he teased everyone else, he's an asshole to whoever he can tilt. 

&amp;#x200B;

I would mention it to the therapist I started seeing and to my sister. My sister eventually helped me out by complaining to the school (she is 18 years older than me). I didn't want her to complain about it to the school but she did thinking it was for the better. The bully who used to be my close friend and his best friend were shocked my sister would complain about them. My adviser just advised them to ignore me and so they did. I was outcasted. One thing lead to another and I  and everyone that came to my birthday party were all suspended for drinking alchohol. Everyone hates me now and my academics are suffering.

It's the last 3 days of school and my requirements and piling and homelife is terrible. My mom in newyork can't call for over 5 minutes and my sister always preaches about coordinating better but my problems at home are practically disfunctional. The food is terrible. I've been kicked out of many group chats and i feel like I have barely anything left
