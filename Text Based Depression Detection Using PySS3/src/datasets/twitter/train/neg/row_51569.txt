I apologize for the wasted time of those reading this.It's been over a year now since I got broken up with and about 6 months since it's stopped bothering me at all. I've been in new relationships, one specifically that's going unnaturally well. So why do I still feel disappointed every time I open my eyes in the morning? I started smoking weed a lot, facilitated by me being a skate rat and hanging around stoner guys, which helped a bit but now I'm just high and sad all the time. Over the last year and a while I've had my ups but the baseline is always here, buried in the sand. I don't like being around my friends, but I also don't like how they've stopped wanting to be around me. I don't want to do anything, but I also hate the idea of doing nothing. Skating is my paintbrush, I live for that shit, but I can't even get myself to film a trick or go have a session anymore. I've lost any sense of fulfillment that anything used to give me. I've lost all sympathy from my friends, last January everyone was asking if I was okay, but when it became clear that the "time heals all wounds" rhetoric wasn't going to miraculously slingshot me out of  my hell brain they acted like it was me who had done them wrong. I got told by my best friend of several years yesterday that we don't hang out anymore because I'm no longer enjoyable to be around and I agree, I don't want to be in this shitshell either. Now I just sit in one place all day, exhausted, trying to muster up the courage to huck my carcass off a canyon or boil my own head or something. In all seriousness though something's deeply wrong with me, even though I have no idea what it is, and every second I have to live in this broken head is one more imagined bullet in my brain. i'm tired. i'm really tired. i think i'm gonna head out soon. i wish you well and i hope to get reincarnated perhaps as some sort of animal that makes your life better somehow, like a cute dog or a tasty fish.

Thanks,
