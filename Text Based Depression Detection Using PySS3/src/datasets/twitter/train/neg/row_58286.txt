I'm just trapped...I'm always just waiting and i don't know for what. Now I think it's death. Most of nights I fall asleep crying. I am a student and I got exams after this corona shit is over but I just can't study, i can't focus. I got no one to talk to. I have family, but all this does is to add to my depression. I'm just lonely. I don't want to kill myself cuz that means eternal burning in hell but sometimes i just think I'll be better off like that. I've cried and prayed but got no answers. All this stuff can anytime make me abandon my religion too. Now my only chance is to get coronavirus so I can die without killing myself.
