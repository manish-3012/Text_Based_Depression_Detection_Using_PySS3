Ive been feeling down for a very long time about my break up and dont know what to do anymoreI had a girl friend for 5 years that I loved to the end of the world and same for her. Long story short, we wanted different things for our future and thought it was better to break up now then do it 5 more years down the line. It ended well at first but then we kept in contact and it got progressively worse until it ended like a terrible brake up. 

Ive been try the dating scene online. I have a weird personality that most probably dont like, I dont like to dance, crowds bother me after a while, I'm shy, I'm an introvert. This has always depressed me; especially because my brother is the complete opposite and meets new people all the time. 

So I finally connected with someone that wanted to grab drinks with me. She had seen my photos online prior to giving me her number. The day of meeting each other, she asked me to snap chat each other which I agreed. I sent her one of me, which looks exactly like my profile picture, she opened it and never responded; unmatched us in the dating app and never texted me back. 

I got stood up after all this, after she saw a photo of me. I feel more alone then ever, more depressed than ever; and my suicidal thoughts are coming back. I feel like ill never find someone. 

I just want to talk to people and get my mind off things; is there a website that people go to, to just have conversations about anything? Not expecting a hook up but to have 1 on 1 conversations?
