Been thinking for a very long time nowI have lived a very unhealthy life, mentally speaking. I have thought about suicide since I was only seven years old. I've tried talking to my friends about it, but all they do is tell me not to do it. They never give me any reason why. I guess I'm just looking for somebody who can give me any kind of support. 

I lost my grandpa, whom I loved deeply, about a year ago. My girlfriend, whom I had every intention of marrying, broke up with me because she got bored with me. I feel like I'm not good enough for the world and I want out. If I do it though, I wont cut myself. I don't like pain. I will probably buy a bunch of prescribtion medicine and overdose. 

I really don't want to be here. I have seen how awful people in this world can be and I hate it. I'm a simple person, I think. I spend a lot of time trying to make other people happy. My ex in particular because I love her with all my heart. I'm not afraid of death, so it probably won't be too hard for me. I think I'm still here because of my mom, brother, and ex. If I killed myself it would scar them, and I don't want that. Maybe I will go to Oregon and get uthanized (I think it's legal there). 

I'm not going to give a day and time that I will do it, but I'm saying it's a possibility. I hate the way the world is and I hate the way my life is. Can anybody relate to this? I'm sure out of the 7 billion people in the world I'm not the only one like this
