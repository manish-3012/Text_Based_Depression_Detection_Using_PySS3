One step to ODI had an exam today that I was freaking out about. I had really bad panic attack so I considered taking my clonazepam except that I took more than I should have (supposed to take 2 mg per day but took 3 mg at one dose). I felt really woozy and just off balance. I ended up going to the hospital and got discharged instead of being admitted in the psych ward but I think Iâ€™m going to have to admit myself soon. Just not at this hospital. The last one I stayed at was good but they donâ€™t take my insurance. All I know is that if I donâ€™t do anything about it now, Iâ€™ll end up taking a fatal dose sometime in the future.
