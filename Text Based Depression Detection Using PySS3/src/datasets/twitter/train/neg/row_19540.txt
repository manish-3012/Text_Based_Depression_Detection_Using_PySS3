I don't feel like I belong anywhereI have no job and no friends IRL to do stuff with. My family is shitty and I have no chance at getting away without a job, and I can't even manage to do that much. 

I'm on my dad's insurance and he doesn't like paying for co-payments for my anti-psychotic and anti-depressant medications, and I get super anxious about it because everyone expects me to pay up while I don't have any income. 

I had to drop out of college because I couldn't afford it and financial aid wasn't helping. So I'm a college drop out who can't get a job and doesn't have any friends, who also has no hope for their future. I don't see myself anywhere in 5 years. I don't think I'll even have the will to even reach 5 years from now. The area I live in has a bunch of rich private university students and it makes me feel like absolute crap that I'm not able to attend and finish college.

I'm not good at anything. I write fanfiction hoping to improve as a writer but I only seem to have 2 recurring readers who give me feedback after each chapter. Otherwise I'm just a waste of air, since nobody wants to hire me to work for anything. I tried using the suicide hotline's online chat but it just stops at like 7th in line and stays there, not moving at all.

Why can't I succeed like everyone else? Why doesn't anyone want to hire me? Why can't I start living my own life away from my family?
