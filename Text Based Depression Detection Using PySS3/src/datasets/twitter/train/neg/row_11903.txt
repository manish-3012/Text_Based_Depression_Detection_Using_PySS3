Please helpI'm not sure this is the right subreddit for this, but I'm going to the er tomorrow to finally get help for my depression and suicidal thoughts. By the sounds of it they will probably transfer me to a mental health facility and I'm scared to death of what to expect, does anyone have any positive experiences they can share? I'm freaking out over whether this is the right decision or not....
