Whatâ€™s going on with me???Iâ€™ve started to slice my arms with pencils, I know it sounds weird and it is, but for some reason the sting of it makes me feel better. Every time I have a bad thought or Iâ€™m really angry or sad I slice my arm a bunch then the stinging gives me an emotional pain relief. Do i need help?
