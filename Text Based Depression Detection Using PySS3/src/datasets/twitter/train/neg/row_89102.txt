Theoretically as a minor: If I told my psychiatrist/therapist that I tried to commit suicide, would they have to tell my parents?I swallowed a bunch of sleeping pills last night and it didn't work. Woke up the next morning, nobody's the wiser. I'm pretty sure it'd be a good idea to tell my therapist, but I don't want my parents to know.

Also, should I be worried about any liver or health problems as a result of this?

I guess for some background, I've been suicidal or had suicidal thoughts everyday for about 5-6 years. I'm also almost 18 too. And a bad conversation led to the attempt. I don't want to get more specific, but I'm still worried I'll try again.

And, uh... To the mods, I don't know if saying something I've already done counts as talking about explicit methods... But I think it matters because I'm worried about any health problems that may arise later. If that's still a problem then I guess I can edit it out...

I send my thanks to everyone who replies
