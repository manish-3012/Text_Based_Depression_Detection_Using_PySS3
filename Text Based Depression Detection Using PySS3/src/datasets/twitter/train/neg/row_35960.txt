I need helpI want to commit suicide right now, but I can't find anything quickly lethal in my house. I don't own a gun, and I only have a bunch of OTC pills. I know it will be very painful and slow, and it might not even kill me, but I feel like I'm eventually going to swallow all the pills in my house along with 230 27 mg iron supplements. I've also been considering maybe slitting my wrists, hanging myself, and a plastic bag. I don't know what to do. I need to see a therapist, but I can't right now.
