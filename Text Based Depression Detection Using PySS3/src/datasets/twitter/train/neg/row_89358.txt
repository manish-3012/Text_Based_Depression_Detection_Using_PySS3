I just donâ€™t want to live any moreMy dad has heart problems and might die very soon and my mom is already tired of all of this Iâ€™ve always been a failure in life, my family has always.been poor.Iâ€™ve always been bullied, Iâ€™ve always let people down, nobody likes me, Iâ€™m ugly, I have arthritis, the only thing preventing me from killing my self right now is my younger sisters and the temptation to kill my self is getting stronger. I can end it any day now if things just donâ€™t get better for me. Iâ€™m writing this in tears. I donâ€™t know who any of you are. Iâ€™m just looking for someone to talk me out of this cuz I rally do want to kill my self. Itâ€™s all my life Iâ€™ve had bad luck. A month ago I barely graduated high school, but I realize now that if I live out the rest of my life i will be a failure. If my dad does I will kill my self then my mom might die and I donâ€™t know whoâ€™ll take take of my sisters. Iâ€™m just lost. I donâ€™t know what to do, my family just needs a break. My name is Isaac, Iâ€™m 18 years old. I just want to end it all.
