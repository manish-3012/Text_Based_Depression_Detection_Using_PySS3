Anyone else feel like they are simply not meant to find happiness?I was 12 when I started having suicidal thoughts, and now that I'm a grown-ass adult I'm still deep into severe depression. It doesn't matter how many professionals I see, how many pills they give me, in the end as soon as things seem to be looking slightly better I get left to my own devices and fall back into despair. People around me are growing, achieving things while I'm still the same bitter little shit I was 6 years ago. There is nothing particularly terrible going on in my life atm, things are looking better even, but I feel empty nonetheless. As if there were no use in dragging out an inescapable situation just to fall back further behind, y'know?
