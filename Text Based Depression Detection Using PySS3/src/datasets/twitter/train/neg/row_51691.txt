i've never wanted to die so badlyi think i'm hitting rock bottom. i have a very small support group and i can't seem to stop overlooking them and focusing on the (very many) people who don't like me. i'm crying out for help but people just shut me down and tell me my feelings are invalid. i've been part of an internet community that has been very unhelpful to my mental health for a while and just got out of an abusive quasi-relationship with someone i met on that site. but i can't seem to leave because i barely have anyone else. i'm so lonely. i'm so empty. i feel like i have this naturally unlikable personality and that i'm just meant to kill myself, i'm meant to not survive. i want to be done, i want to end this all. people would be happier if i did, i wouldn't be in their way. i'm not that important to anyone.
