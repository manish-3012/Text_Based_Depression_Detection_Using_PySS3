Just want to fall asleep and not have to wake up.I'm almost 40. No kids. Going through a divorce. He was my best friend and I trusted him. But he simply doesn't love me anymore. I cry at the drop of a hat. The only way I can sleep is with a bottle of wine a little weed and a couple sleeping pills. It would be such a relief to fall asleep and not wake up. I don't want to face this pain. My job is blah, I have only two close friends, I'm so unsure and scared. They keep saying it gets easier and you just have to keep moving and trying. I'm too tired. I'm too hurt. I just don't want to do this anymore.
