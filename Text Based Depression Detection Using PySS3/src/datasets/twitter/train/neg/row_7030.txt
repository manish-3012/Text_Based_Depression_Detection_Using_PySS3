SpeedingLately Iâ€™ve been feeling depressed, and alone. I canâ€™t physically bring myself to commit suicide, maybe Iâ€™m scared of it. Idk, but Iâ€™ve decided to increase my speed on the roads where no one else is and I find myself hoping to crash and die. I figure if it came off as an accident maybe I couldnâ€™t hurt those around me as bad as confirmed suicide news would. I hope I donâ€™t live to see the end of the year.
