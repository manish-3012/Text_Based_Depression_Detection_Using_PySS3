I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m suicidalI (F15) got out of sexually abusive household 5 months ago. I live with my dad and stepmom now and things are good but I feel worse than I ever have. Iâ€™m so miserable and empty. I have no friends here. My mom hates me for reporting my stepdad. I feel disgusting and used and tossed aside from what I went through. 
I want to die every single day, but I donâ€™t have a plan to hurt myself if that makes sense. I lay in bed all day thinking about dying but I would never try. Idk. I just feel like trash and I hate myself so much. I feel like things would be better if I wasnâ€™t around and I want to not hurt like this anymore.
