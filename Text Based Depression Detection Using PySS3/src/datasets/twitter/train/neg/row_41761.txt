I'm feeling pain everydayFor almost 4 years. I'm too tired to think. I'm tired everday. It'll always be there and no one believes me. My psychologist want to do sports but I'm too tired and sad and I don't want to take effort because I'm gonna lose it. Nobody likes me and I just want to kill myself.
