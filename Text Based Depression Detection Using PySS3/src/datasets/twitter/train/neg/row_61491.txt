Tinnitus, its changed meThey say it gets better with time. I got it August last year and I still feel terrible. I haven't had one single good nights sleep, literally. Not one single good night where I can just rest my head on the bed and zone out and sleep. I have to put music on, alternate putting whichever ear against the pillow, scratch my head, do whatever to distract myself enough or exhaust myself just to fall asleep.

Then I wake up a couple of hours later to this racket in my head that just won't leave me alone.

I have no more strength left. I'm so mentally broken I can't cope anymore. I can't imagine a whole life of this. Suicide use to scare me but now it's almost like a relief. I am going to hang myself. I've already tested the extension cord in my closet. Ill have silence finally. No more of this torture.

I don't know why I'm posting this. It's not like anyone can help cure this. Sigh. I'm so tired, so tired. Please end this. This life has become exhausting, there's not one second of respite left to be found.
