the suicide hotline doesn't even answeri have access to a gun. its just in the other room. my ex-bf that i still live with is 2 hours away visiting our hometown. i could do it now. i figure if i get in the tub and close the curtain that would make cleanup a bit easier.

i cried all morning but now i'm done. i haven't really accepted what i'm going to do yet, but it doesn't matter if i accept it or not. i'll be dead. i won't have to think about it.

i have so many people who care about me in my life. it's what kept me from doing it so far, but i think this is as far as their love and support are gonna take me. i tried calling the suicide hotline three times - first time i hung-up to go buy smokes, second time they disconnected me, third time got a "the person you're calling hasn't set up a voicemail box" message and disconnected. so much for all that spamming the national suicide hotline number. 

i tried looking for some kind of crisis center or inpatient thing, but haven't got any results. 

i tried to take a sick day today, then my employee called off. i can't get away. my girl just called me and said she'll work the whole shift by herself if i just come see her. she's so sweet. so many people care about me and are trying to help. i've reached out. i've told people what's going on. i just can't do this anymore.
