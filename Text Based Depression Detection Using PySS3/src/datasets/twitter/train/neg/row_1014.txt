I just dont want to be hereI feel like I'm born in the wrong body and wish I was male, I have ptsd, anxiety and depression, I havent brushed my hair in a week, I cant even do drugs to cheer me up coz I have seizure even on just weed. 

I cant find the effort to clean anything I just sit and eat biscuits nd a sandwich when I feed my guinea pigs.

My animals is all that gets care anymore, I cut my leg 6 times kinda badly and I wont clean it coz I keep hoping I catch something n die.

I felt constantly sick and exhausted. I just dont see a point in life anymore

I live in homeless accommodation, unable to work so on benefits. I hate myself 

I'm 17, female and idk I wont do anything immediately I'm not that close yet ig
