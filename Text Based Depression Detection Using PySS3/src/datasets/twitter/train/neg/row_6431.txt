I'm not even really living...I'm not sure why I'm posting... It's 4am and I can't sleep as usual. Just like every other second of my life I'm in pain. 

I'm not going to bore you with the details, but I have a degenerative diseases that is eating away my spine. I tried to make peace with my pain, I really did. The last 2 years have been me trying to learn to live with this.... And I was doing good damnit. I found a medication regimen that keeps my head clear, I've worked on my depression, and learned to get by.

 But now I'm fucked...

 I have been having intense migraines, muscle spasms in my neck and back, and sudden bouts of vertigo so bad I vomit and can't even walk to my bedroom by myself. I ended up getting such a sudden onset one day I was brought to the ER... and they found brain degeneration on my CT scan. Still working on the cause

Oh great... Another health issue to deal with. 

I could deal with the pain. At least I could still take my daughter to the park and clean my house... But not now. I can barely get moving anymore. Just making stir fry tonight was so hard I nearly threw up. 

I cannot live the rest of my life in bed throwing up dizzy and in pain. What sort of life is that? 

I feel like such a burden on my family... I basically can't be left alone or run errands for fear of passing out alone somewhere. Sometimes I wish I hadn't gotten married so he could have a real wife, not something to take care of, and my daughter could have had a real mother who could walk her to school again.

I love them so much, but if I didn't have them to worry about I could have an out. 

I'm just tired. So fucking tired.
