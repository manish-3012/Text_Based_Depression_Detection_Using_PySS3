I can't live with myself anymore.I can never be happy without hurting someone else. I'm aggressive and overly physical and angry all the time. I have vivid sexual fantasies about torturing and killing men, and they're impossible to get rid of. They're in my head 24/7. I masturbate to them and they only get stronger, but when I ignore them, they get stronger too. I've been told by comments that I'm a psychopath and at this point, I don't know if they're right or wrong. I just want to be alone and keep people away from me so I can't hurt them. There's no fixing me. I'd rather just die alone.
