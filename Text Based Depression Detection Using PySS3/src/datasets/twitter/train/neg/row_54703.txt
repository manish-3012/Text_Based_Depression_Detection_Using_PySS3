efforts that are useless and that are stupidhere i am going a rant, my english isnt very good sorry.
many years i tried to work at this. many years past that i start in this, at a very young age thats vulerable and weak.
practice the skills, it isnt good enough. debut, fail. debut, fail. cover my tattoos is no good. nose surgery, no good. eye surgery no good. talk different, ok? no good. change hair, its no good. the ugly tattoos are no good, cant be on a broadcast for then until now because it will have to be edit. can i remove skin off?

theres no suceess in a place that there is no happiness. even now success is with no meaning at all. what are dreams? what is doing a good job?

a few fun times i have, it was good but is it worth suffering? no. my jaw bone broke and now biting is not center and eating food is painful

i am look like a dirty person, a hooligan, why do you do this they say to me. you come here already dirty and broken, you are expecting to be cared for even though its like this? ugly? no, change your eyes next your nose and your jaw will break next

i will tear tattoos fro m my skin, die and become reborn someone worthful
when iw as younger i visited some in america, i remember feeling the world then like it is open and there is many opprotunity, but now i cant see any of that

thank you
