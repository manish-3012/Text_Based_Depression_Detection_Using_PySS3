The longer I have these suicidal thoughts, the more pathetic it getsWhy arenâ€™t you over it, move on, who cares, get on with your life. I canâ€™t sit around and continue this life. Iâ€™m sorry to those who loathe me with all their hearts and canâ€™t stand me. Iâ€™ll be smiling when the lights go out as I flop like a gasping fish, this is the fate I deserve. I canâ€™t be a burden to those in my life anymore
