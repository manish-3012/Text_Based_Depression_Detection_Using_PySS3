Bye and good luck everyone. Hope things turn around for you, but I've waited too many yearsI'm so incredibly near drinking and smoking myself into oblivion, followed by blowing my brains out. I've posted here and deleted so many times already, because I get zero upvotes or responses. Nobody understands me, even in a place like this (which frankly feels like home to me). I was just hoping I could find someone in the world to relate to, but it's legitimately over for me now. Seems the only way for me to get attention, even on a suicide forum, is to just convince people how determined you are to do it. This world is sad and disgusting and I am so so done with it.
