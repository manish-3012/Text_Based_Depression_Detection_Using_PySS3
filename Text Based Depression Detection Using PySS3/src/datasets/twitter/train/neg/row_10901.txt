Constantly thinking of killing myself, againIt has been going on for a while. My close friends just think I'm joking around because they know that I also have a dark sense of humour. They also have a dark sense of humour too, hence why they think it is all a joke. I don't even know how to even tell any one of them that I'm actually serious when I say that I don't want to be alive anymore. 

My life is absolutely meaningless. Im pretty sure my death would not cause any impact for more than a week. After a week, I would be long forgotten already.

I feel like I have no future. No one that will love me in a special way. Nothing to build towards too. I have absolutely no purpose. 

But there is a bigger issue here. I am a coward. I'm terribky afraid of pain. Which is why I want my death to be an absolutely painless one. The only way to kinda guarantee a painless death would be shooting myself in the head. Messy, yes, but painless. The problem is that it is absolutely difficult to get a gun where I live (obviously I dont live in the USA lol). There are tons of paperwork for licensing and a pretty hefty fee, plus a gun itself is absolutely expensive here. Yes, they have made it so that the only people who get guns in this country are the ones who absolutely have a necessity to protect themselves specifically with a firearm. Maybe USA should learn from us lol.
