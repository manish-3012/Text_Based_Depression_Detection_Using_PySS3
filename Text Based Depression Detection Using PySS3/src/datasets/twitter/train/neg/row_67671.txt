Do you have ten minutes to take part in a research study?Hi /r/SuicideWatch. I am a trainee clinical psychologist undertaking research in relation to thoughts of suicide. The study is concerned with how people that struggle with low mood do or don't develop thoughts of suicide. In that regard, I am hoping to recruit people that have **and** have not experienced thoughts of suicide, so anyone can participate.

I have received permission from a moderator of the forum to post a link to my study. It is a questionnaire that takes approx 10-15 minutes to complete. The study is entirely anonymous and a draw for one of four Â£25 ($36) Amazon vouchers will be made for those that take part.

I would really appreciate your participation and thank you advance to those that take part. The link is below:
