So closeI'm so close. SO close! I got everything lined up and ready. But I can't do it. Why not!? Why can't I just do it? The thought of abandoning all my future dreams and wishes is so painful. I can't take it. I'm crying endlessly right now. Have been crying for 4 hours straight and it won't end. It won't end until I finally do it. But I can't do it. It's so hard. 

Why can't I just die. Why. Why. Why?
