Endless cycle of bad jobsI have continuously accepted crappy jobs due to needing a job because I need money. Every job Iâ€™ve found has ended up being terrible whether it be pay, job security, management, or all of the above. Currently stuck in an all of the above job. Iâ€™m so stressed out Iâ€™m not sleeping. They wonâ€™t even let me take unpaid time off. My health and well being is suffering but I desperately need whatever little money the job provides. I see no way out other than death to get out of this revolving door of misery.
