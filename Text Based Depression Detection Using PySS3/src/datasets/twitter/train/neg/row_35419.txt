What's the point?Hi there. Been a while since I've posted anything here, but I guess you could say things have gotten a little better. Not much, though. There's just one question that fills my head every day that I get out of bed; why?

I have a job at a grocery store about 30 minutes away from my home, with managers that want someone to take pride in their work. How can I do that if I can barely take pride in myself, period? I have to fake it. I haven't been there more than two weeks, but I highly doubt I'll take pride in anything. I've become too apathetic about everything.

Kind of just want to disappear, to be honest. I'd like to just stop existing so I don't have to bear the pain of living. But at the same time, I'm too lazy to do something like that. I'm caught in a very odd place right now. Stuck between crippling depression, and possible happiness. I can't even explain it that well.

It's like some days are fine, others are just absolutely horrible. Is that normal for people like us?
