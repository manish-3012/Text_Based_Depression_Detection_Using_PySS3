I have found myself dead insideIm not exactly sure what response will help. My life is a hamster wheel of never ending low points. I go to work almost everyday. Im flat broke. I can barely afford to eat somedays. Im hypoglycemic so im secretly hoping that goes ahead and whisks me away. I have my own apt, 2 cars, a cat and a dog. My ex lives with me because i cant fathom putting someone out on the street and making them homeless. Ive had 3 almost kids(that really fucks with my head). By almost kids i mean i actually got a girl i loved pregnant, had a good job, and she was in school. I wasnt worried about life or any issues. She left me and got an abortion under her moms whim. The 2nd one was to a girl i had known a few years who was raped and became pregnant. I fell pretty hard for her. She abandoned me when her son was born. She even named him after the son i lost to the abortion. Then the third child i lost was to my first love stepping back into my life and we reconnected. Turned out i was just a side guy to her man and the pregnancy was a lie the entire time. Now i just look for attention and any kind of romance or even sense of affection from literally anyone. Reasons my ex is my ex. I have no real emotions left but depression and self hatred. Im at a loss with life. I lack any sense of enthusiasm in any aspect of my life. I just want to cease existing. I want to go to sleep and slip away. I dont want this life anymore. This life was meant for someone with a more ironclad will. After years of abuse, molestation, and being almost a social outcast this is the result. A non living person that just exists to survive. At one time i had dreams and aspirations but now those are gone and i dream of the day its all over. The day that i can finally have peace and quiet in my own head.
