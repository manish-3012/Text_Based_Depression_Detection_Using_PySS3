Lies finally caught up with me.Hi guys, thanks for reading this, and before I get started I completely realize that everything I did is my own fault and no one else's. I don't really know how to even get started so I'll just jump right in. I earned my bachelor's in psychology today, which would normally be a cause for celebration, its the nail in my tombstone. For the last 4 years, I have been telling my parents that I have been working towards a master's degree when in reality I was struggling to finish my bachelors(took my useless depressed ass 8 years to earn what normal people do in 4). My mom is convinced I'm going to go to medical school, but not only do I probably not have a good enough GPA, but I also don't have several of the prerequisite classes, so even if I somehow managed to accidentally do good on the MCATs I'm still fucked. 

I honestly don't know what I can do at this point and I feel like I have ruined enough lives. I can only see one way forward and honestly, I have been thinking of doing it for years now. I know how pointless it is to say sorry after all of this, but I think if anyone out there deserves to kill themselves it's me. I hope anyone who reads this is able to learn something from my stupidity, please don't try and lie about your life, it always catches up eventually.
