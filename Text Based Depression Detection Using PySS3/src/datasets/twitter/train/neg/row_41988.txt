Seriously messed up my life..need help getting my life back on track.For the past several years I've been dealing with anxiety (mainly social anxiety) and depression. I was suicidal at one point of my life. Nothing has gotten really any better in terms of the social anxiety and depression. The depression seems to come and go. I was bullied severely bad in school. I used to have a good amount of friends but they've all left me. When they left me they (and the rest of the school) bullied me to the point where I would want to end my life everyday I came home from school. I was harassed outside of school too. After that school year I never wanted to go back to school again. I was severely socially scarred after that year. Because of that I've been homeschooled ever since. My life has gotten severely messed up and I can't get back on track no matter what. I've been trying to make friends as of lately (past year or so) but I've been failing miserably. One of the biggest problems I have is that I have extreme trust issues. I don't trust ANYONE. I have a hard time trusting my own relatives. It feels like if I do trust someone that they will probably end up betraying me. When I don't have trust issues my social awkwardness kicks in. Then people think I'm weird and will probably never talk to me again and will know me as "that weird kid" for the rest of their life. I have a hard time getting out because when I get in a room or place with more than 10+ people I start getting extremely nervous and end up nearly having a panic attack. I have random depression moments where I will ask myself "what's the point of living?" or "why am I still here?". Most of the time I wake up feeling like shit just thinking it'll be another shitty day that I will probably screw up somehow. It's hard to be positive about life when I've fucked mine up. I just want to fix my life..
