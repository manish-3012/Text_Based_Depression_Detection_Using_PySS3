Why keep this up?I've always been kind of overweight. Not obese. But a big guy. And I've always been depressed. I guess the two kind of go together because I eat junk when I feel bad.

But two months ago, when an ER visit told me it was affecting my liver, coupled with family history, I resolved to be better. 

I changed my diet. I haven't had fried food or sugar at all. I exercise daily. I've been really really good, and it was the first positive change I've ever resolved to make. I was proud of myself.

This would be it. I'd start losing. I'd get more confident. I'd feel better because I was moving. Maybe even I'd work up the courage to ask someone out. 

But during today's weigh-in, I weigh just about the same as I did when I started. I've lost maybe a pound. I don't know what I'm doing wrong. It's been two months. 

And it all came rushing back. I'm just going to always be this big, miserable, lonely person, aren't I? And I'm fooling myself into thinking I could make that better. 

Why keep it up? Why try to make the change? If I'm going to end it anyway, why not just give up and go back to coping? That was easier, and I don't see the point.
