I don't know what to do.I feel like I'm making everybody upset. I keep having suicide thoughts, but the only thing I have to live for is my friends and family. I have friends, But I feel like they just get annoyed whenever I try to talk. I don't really wanna stop, because it will give me a reason to kill myself. I don't have courage though.
