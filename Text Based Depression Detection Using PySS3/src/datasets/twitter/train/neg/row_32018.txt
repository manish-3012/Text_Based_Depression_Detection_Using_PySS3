I just don't see the point anymoreI don't really know how to go about this so I guess I will explain what's going on with me. I will be graduating from grad school next May. I am trying to find a job and finish up my work here but I just feel like none of it matters anyway. I have been having some trouble with my health (knee pain) and I feel like it's just going to get worse. I love to exercise and I am trying to lose weight but I've been having a hard time doing anything because of my knees. I know there are so many people who have it worse than me but that doesn't comfort me any. If anything it just makes me feel selfish. I haven't dated anyone in years and the friends I've made since coming to graduate school are awful. I never feel like I'm included or one of them. I always just feel like an outsider and a reject. I've been feeling really shitty about everything lately and it's only getting worse. All I've done today is surf reddit. I was watching a movie trailer and it said "coming this Christmas" or something and I just started bawling because I thought that I would like to see it if I haven't killed myself by then. I've been thinking about how I would have to sell all of my things and send the money to my mother if I killed myself. I don't think I would actually do it because it would hurt my family so much but I don't know how to deal with feeling like this. I eat and drink when I feel shitty even though I know it will make me feel worse in the long term. What keeps people going when life happens? How do people go on so long with failing health and shitty jobs? God, that reminds of this young girl at my school in a wheel chair. I walked by her the other day and she gave me the sweetest smile. I feel like such a jerk for whining about my life.
