I am confusedI am confused. I hate what I've done in my life, but I'm only 18. I am incredibly angry at myself for making the decisions I have made. But I know I shouldn't do it. I know I have my whole life ahead of me and have no real reason to even consider ending it.

 I have it all planned out: walk into New York City late at night and visit my favorite places. Then take all the my savings from selling drugs and fly to Sydney, Australia. I went on vacation there and never wanted to go back. Then, take a cab to Bondi Beach and sit in the sand until I'm ready. Climb up to the top of a cliff and just jump. It's a devastating height. 

But I've thought about this for so long and yet every night I stay. I will hear back from my dream colleges soon but I am almost positive I will not get in. I have a large group of close friends both in my school and around the greater New York area. No One has any idea how feel. 

I  am undeservedly privileged with an undeserved future. I have opportunities people would die for. I know I shouldn't end it, but I still have the dark, anxious, stomach turning feeling that I should. 

And I guess that's why I'm posting. How do I get rid of this feeling?
