December 12 is the day I go.I'm in love with a woman that no longer seems to care for me. I'm in a new city alone and the only human interaction I've had in the past four days is 6 or so hours with her and talking to someone through the drive-through window at a restaurant. I'm sad, lonely, depressed, and broken. I don't have a job and my credit cards are reaching their limit. For a couple of years now, I've felt my life is useless, I'm a burden on anyone around me, and that my future looks just as shitty as my past. My birthday is in a month. It's going to be hell and I'm not sure if she's going to even remember it. No one knows I'm experiencing deep depression, not even her. I've hidden it well. I would do anything just to have my head rubbed as she tells me she loves me. I wish she'd help me through this. I've set a day for my departure. December 12. I'm ready for this pain to end.
