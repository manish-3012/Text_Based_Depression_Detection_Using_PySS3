Is it just luck saving me?I was hospitalized for an overdose when I was 16. I'm 20 now and yesterday I was almost hospitalized again if my mum haven't discovered I had stolen a bunch of paracetamol. Sometimes I just don't know if there's any reason left for me to keep trying. I really want to give up sometimes. I really don't know what to fight for anymore.
