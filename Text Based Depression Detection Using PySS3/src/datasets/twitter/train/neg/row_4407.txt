Suicidal without being depressed?Is it possible to be suicidal without being depressed? For about a year now I've had this feeling inside that everything would be better if I was dead. Most of the time I just feel like a load to those around me and I can't really help it because I'm not really good at amything and usually end fucking things up. I get to thinking that if I died right now, I don't think anyone besides my mom would care and I'd be doing her a favor in the long run. 

All that being said, I don't think I'm depressed. I can see the beauty in life and I would really love to travel. I can still laugh, joke, smile, feel good. I have a couple of friends that suffer depression and I really can't compare myself to them. I still go out, I have a normal social life, and nobody not even my closest friends would be able to tell that this is how I feel. 

I don't think I'd ever attempt to commit suicide but it's just the thought of doing it feels so tempting. I can't really trust this to anyone, my mom would freak out and I don't think she'd be of any help, and I don't want to worry or shock my friends, and most of all I don't want people to think I'm doing it for attention.
