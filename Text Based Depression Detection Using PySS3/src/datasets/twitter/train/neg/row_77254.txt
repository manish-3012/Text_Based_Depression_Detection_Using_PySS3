I've come to realize that the only thing keeping me alive was cardio.I don't really care about anything in my life. I never had. When I was a kid I played video games to distance myself from my shitty childhood. I have never been a social person. My parents divorced when I was 17. I played world of warcraft for five years and gained a lot of weight. When I graduated high school, my mother kicked me out of the house. I moved in with my dad in a different city. While away I had time to think and I realized that I was discontent with the way I was, a 280 lb fatass. I started working on losing the weight, and made it down to 138 before I realized that I was bulimic. Not the purging type, but the binge/restrict type, with the excessive exercise. But this year I hurt my knee, so I couldn't run any more. So I started swimming. 2-3+ miles a day. I did it so much that I hurt my elbows. And now here I am, unable to do any form of cardio and almost no lifting. I'm losing it, day by day. I can't live like this any more. Running kept me sane. Swimming let me eat. But now I have nothing. I just want to wake up so I can go on a run and then eat like a normal person and go to sleep. But I cant. So I spend all day obsessing about when I get to eat next and praying that soon I'll be able to run. But even six months after the injury, it feels like there's a razor blade inside my knee. I can't do it any more. I just want to die.
