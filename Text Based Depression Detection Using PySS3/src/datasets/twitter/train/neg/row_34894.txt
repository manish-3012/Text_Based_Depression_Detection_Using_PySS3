There are so many people on here who want to die ...Do you want to die because you became depressed?
Do you want to die because someone left you?
Do you want to die because someone else died?
Do you want to die because you are ill?
Do you want to die because you are in pain?
Do you want to die because no one wants you?

I want to die because I hate being a life. 

I hate being part of this cruel fucking world.  Not just the people, who are fucking selfish turds (no offense) who then call you selfish because you want to die just to never see these fuckers again, but the planet in general.  Just parasites killing each other to feed off of each other.  I hate everything about it.  I hate everything about life and being alive.  Existence, I would never ask for you.  

I am an ugly man.  Women hate me.  Always have.  I used to try to have fun.  I don't even try anymore.  I don't even jerk off anymore.  I will be dead soon.
