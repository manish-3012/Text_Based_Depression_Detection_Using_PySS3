Not sure what to doA few months ago my long term GF left me for another man she met on a video game she played. I know its one of those "there are other fish in the sea" kind of thing but after so many years this girl was my life and its hard to live it right now with out her. I have never been a man of drinking but thats the only thing that gets me by now a days is drinking and looking at her picture in my wallet. Some days i think im getting better about her and start forggeting but then when I am on facebook I won't realize im looking at her profile and seeing that guy comment on all of her pictures and flirting with her the way I used too. Some times I feel like just ending it. After she left me my life was a living hell I had no home to go too no real job too many bills to pay for by myself and most of all. I have never felt more alone in my life laying in bed some nights ill reach out for her to have my hand hit nothing and I will just start crying. Other nights I will just stare at her side of the bed and wish she was next to me to hold hands again. Other nights I just think I should go down to the town bridge jump and maybe then I can be with her forever..some times I dunno
