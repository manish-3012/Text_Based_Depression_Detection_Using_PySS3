Just need to get this outIt has been at least seven years since I have been seriously suicidal, but I feel it coming back. I am living in constant depression and anxiety. I am trying to do all the right things... Counselor, support meetings, exercise, eating right, sleep, activities with friends, self help books, medication. But deep inside I am still so broken. I am giving up hope that I can ever get better. I am just so tired of fighting. I just want the pain and sadness to end.
