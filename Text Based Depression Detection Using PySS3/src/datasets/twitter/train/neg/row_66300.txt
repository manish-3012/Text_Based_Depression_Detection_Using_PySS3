I can choose suicide or death from neglect of my dementiaI have rapidly deteriorated over the past year and accumulated many serious health issues, including polycythemia, shortness of breath, chest pain and light headedness. Fatigue, digestive issues complete inability to gain any weight.

neurological= memory loss for 4 years now, insomnia for 3 months I have been incapable of sleeping 1 normal night, learning difficulties.

I was always very smart so despite all my memory loss and dementia I am still in college, I have made a few friends in my chemistry class 1 of them has an apple watch and took my heart rate with it and said "How are you even alive? I cant believe your heart rate is so high while resting!"

My other friend will talk to me after class every day and he said that "handwriting doesn't matter as long as your brain is still good" he is unusually friendly to me it reminds me of the character Gerasim from the Tolstoy novel about terminal illness. He knows I am very very sick and it compels him to be kind to me.

anyways my family is unwilling to recognize that the illness is real they claim that all my physical pain and health conditions are a mental illness and that I will need to be involuntarily committed in a mental hospital if I continue with my delusion of being sick.

they call the police and tell them I am delusional about health problems and have me handcuffed and put in mental health wards, for being in physical pain they claim its a delusion.
