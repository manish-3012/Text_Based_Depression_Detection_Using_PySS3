Literally cant wait to die17m Pure OCD and bipolar

so for the last couple of weeks my daily dread has gotten to the point where im fuckin livid that im still alive. Mood swings up the ass and intrusive thoughts haunt me daily, like can i GET A FUCKING BREAK. Yesterday I graduated from high school (somehow) and i still feel like a walking tumor. I really dont fucking care about the future and i have only a few things to live for. I got shotgun slugs coming in the mail and one of them will lead me to my end. Finally i can get peace at last and im fucking excited just thinking about it.
