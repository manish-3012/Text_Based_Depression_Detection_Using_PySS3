I don't know anymoreI'm at a crossroad in my life and I want nothing more than to be laying on the floor grabbing my chest in agony. I'm 17 years old with absolutely no ambitions or close friends. My father died when I was very young to a drug overdose, and my mother lost me to state custody when I was 2
3, and then she stopped coming to visits a few months later. 
I was in foster care for a while, and then my grandparents got me out. However, the past couple of years have been nothing but downhill. My grandmother was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer a couple years ago, and my grandfather hurt his back and has been addicted to opioid painkillers for a while now, he also has pancreatic cancer. What this means for me is that in a couple of years time, I will have no family. My grandmother is the only reason I haven't offed myself yet, and she's on the way out.
I had an amazing girlfriend that motivated me and made me see a different side of life, but a few months ago before school started, she sent me a text telling me that she had come to an agreement with her family and they were moving across the country, and then she blocked my number. 
I guess I'm an annoying person and I've never really found myself with any good friends. Every day I wake up and muddle through school, and then I come home and head straight to work. I have no social life at all. I'm at the point where I don't to be alive anymore. It takes every ounce of everything in me not to down the bottle of muscle relaxers and assorted benzos/opiates I've collected over the years and finish the pain. I don't know what I'm looking for on this sub, whether it be a shoulder to cry on or someone to tell me some cliche thing about how my almost dead family would feel or whatever. Thank you guys anyways for taking the time to read my story. I think I'm gonna kill myself tonight.
