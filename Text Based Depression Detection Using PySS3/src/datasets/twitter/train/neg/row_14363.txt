Overheard my mom talking shit about me on the phoneI canâ€™t say Iâ€™m surprised. As soon as we get into a fight (or even in the days after), she always feels the need to call people up and tell them how â€œawfulâ€ and â€œselfishâ€ I am. She just loves making people feel bad for her and making herself out to be the victim. 

Hereâ€™s the part I heard (talking about me): â€œ(My name) just wants me to spend the rest of my life alone, and she doesnâ€™t care about my feelings.â€ 

Why did she say this you might ask? Because I told her it was pretty shitty of her to leave me at home alone all weekend every weekend (and sometimes during the week) when I was 15, so that she could go visit my (soon to be ex) stepdad. He lives 1.5 hours away, so itâ€™s not like she could just come home if I needed her. I was completely and utterly alone so many times, and wasnâ€™t even old enough to drive. Also, this took place only a year after my father committed suicide and went on for maybe a little more than a year. 

Apparently me pointing out how badly that hurt me is â€œbeing selfish and wanting her to be alone for the rest of her life.â€ No, you fucking dumbass. Itâ€™s just kinda hard being 15 and being abandoned by your only parent right after the suicide of your other one. I think anyone with half a brain and at least some love for their child could see that. 

Whenever I bring it up, she blames me or deflects to something else. In the past, she was pretty physically abusive and I can recall her choking me on two separate occasions, and sheâ€™s hit me more times than I can count. Sheâ€™s constantly insulting me and tearing me down, and Iâ€™m sick of it. 

Iâ€™m just done. My dad was the best parent when he was well. He was such a good man. And now Iâ€™m left with this uncaring drama queen of a mom whose whole life revolves around having a pity party for herself and not giving a shit about anyone but herself. 

The only thing keeping me alive right now is the fact Iâ€™ll be 18 this month. When I turn 18, Iâ€™m going to inherit a decent amount of money left to me from my grandpa. My mom told me that I should give her the money to help her with her divorce right now, and sheâ€™ll pay me back later. Well, thatâ€™s not fucking happening. Iâ€™m taking the money, and Iâ€™m leaving to go somewhere. I canâ€™t be around this toxic woman anymore. Maybe once I blow through it Iâ€™ll take my life, but weâ€™ll just have to see. 

And if I do take my life, Iâ€™ll make a detailed account of all the horrible things she did that contributed to my suicide so that everyone will know how awful she truly is. That way she wonâ€™t be able to milk it for more pity either. What a heartless bitch.
