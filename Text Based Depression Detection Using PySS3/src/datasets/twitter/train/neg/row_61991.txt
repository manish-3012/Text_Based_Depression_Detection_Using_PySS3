WhyI sometimes question the meaning of life, where some anwser joy and fulfillment I see no needs for these. I think of myself as emotionless, as in I just donâ€™t care and I really never have. I feel empty inside, but I am not sad, I am content with the emptiness because having everything really isnâ€™t that different from having nothing. You exist either way. Yet I find myself at odds with this, where I will miss school because it offers nothing that I want, because I donâ€™t really want anything, yet I still find myself forced to go onwards through my family and their emotions and concerns. Emotions are stupid, they control how many act and are never really beneficial to the individual. Why would I care about the future when I donâ€™t even care for the present. I find myself faced with this situation, where suicide seems to be the only export to this dilemma. I guess at this point life just doesnâ€™t seem worth the hassle, yet as I type this I find tears running down my eyes, yet I donâ€™t know why. I donâ€™t feel sad, or angry, just not content with my current situation, and why struggle to live a 5 - 9 life working at minimum wage when the blank abyss tempts me ever further towards my end. I am not looking for consultations, just perhaps reasons I should not end my life, because as of now I do not see any.
