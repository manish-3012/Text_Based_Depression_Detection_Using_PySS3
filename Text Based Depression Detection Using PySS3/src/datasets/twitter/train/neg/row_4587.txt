Antihistamines??I've heard that antihistamines are an effective way to kill yourself but does anyone know how many you'd need to take for it to work?
I'm not suicide myself and I could crack a joke about asking for a friend but I probably won't incase that comes out rude.
Anyway, I'm just curious and want to know how many it would take,
Thanks.
