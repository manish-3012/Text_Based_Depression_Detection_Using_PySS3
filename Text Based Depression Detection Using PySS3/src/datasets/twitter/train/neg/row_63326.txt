Is suicide my destiny?Help. I have thought I would kill myself since I was 12 years old. I am now 28 and have had a couple attempts and been diagnosed schizoaffective bipolar type along with anxiety disorders. I am getting married in 6 months. I left a career in IT and have yet to go back to school but I am working as a barista right now and it's honestly not that bad. I have little to no motivation to do anything though. I'm talking about socializing and hobbies. It is an accomplishment for me to watch an episode on Netflix or read a chapter of a book. I have tried learning guitar, I have tried painting, I have tried spending countless evenings with friends....it is never satisfying. As for the guitar and painting, I am just an idiot and feel like a 6 year old could catch on better. I feel so empty. So untalanented. Such a waste of space. I am extremely shy and quiet unless I am manic. I find it so hard to relate to people. I also don't keep up with cleaning or laundry or showering. I just find it so hard to function. I don't know how to explain myself I just don't want to feel this way anymore. I've been to countless therapists and none of them have helped me. I am medicated but that doesn't seem to help either. I feel like after all these years of feeling the same way my only option is suicide. What can I do? I am desperate
