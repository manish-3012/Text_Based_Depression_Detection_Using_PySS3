I'm not meant for this world.I wish I could kill myself. Yet, it's so hard to accomplish. How strange...

 I don't belong in this world. Nobody wants me here. Excluding my few family members. But they only care because it's required that they do. And please, don't tell me otherwise. You're not in my shoes.

All anyone has ever done was either ignore or make fun of me. I've never belonged with any group before. I was always an outcast. A lone wolf. All I've ever wanted was to be close with someone. To have a connection.

My life is completely devoid of meaning. I'm just a failure at everything. I'm failure in academics. I'll never become the psychologist that I want to be. I'm a failure at relationships. I'll never have a close friend or even a girlfriend. I'm a failure at life. I'm just a waste of oxygen. Hell, I'm even a failure at death. Five suicide attempts and I'm still here.

I could blame my dyslexia, ADHD or even my depression. But they're just excuses. Nobody wants or cares about people like me. If only I had a firearm...
