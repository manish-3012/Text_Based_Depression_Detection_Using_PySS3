I'm so ashamedI can't even cry anymore, I'm so empty and yet in so much pain. Everything that could've gone wrong lately, has, I'm hurting so many people, I'm losing my best friend of five years, malicious people from my past have set out to ruin everything that's left of my life. I'm desperately holding on to things I love but I know it's futile and the joy they bring me is dishonest. I have no one to lean on and I'm so tired of loneliness. I don't see a future for myself and I no longer want the present either. I don't even know what I'm tying to achieve with this post. I'm just so lost and in need of... Anything. At all. My body is full of wounds and I want to finish the job. There are few things I wouldn't do for a way out.
