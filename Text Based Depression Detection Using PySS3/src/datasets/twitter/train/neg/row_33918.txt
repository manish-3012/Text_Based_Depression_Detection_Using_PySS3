So college happenedHi i am 20 year old male who just started college and it has been awful so far.Depression started as soon as I began thinking about future and what will happen if I fail at college.                                    This feeling I have wont go away  and is keeping me from functioning well .I cant sleep,eat,or study because of this.On top of that I have social anxiety.I have met some decent people in college but nothing is helping me get better.                             I don't want to drop out but staying will just make me feel worse.I just wish this constant feeling of depression would go away but its always there.Walls are closing in around me and I'm afraid I can't break them.And on top of that I'm gay in a homophobic country just lovely.
