HospitalisationHas anyone here ever gone in for hospitalisation, and if so... What's it's like? I've been suicidal my entire life. My first attempt was at 7. I'm 38 now. I'm just so tired. My panic attacks are becoming more and more frequent and severe. I don't want to be here anymore. I see no point in living. Life is pointless. I'm constantly in pain from various disabilities, and in mental anguish without reprise. 

I'm considering hospitalisation, but I don't know if it's worth the effort.
