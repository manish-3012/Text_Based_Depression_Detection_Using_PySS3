Idk, first time here as everyone else has given up on meSo...im a still a kid and most people are like "oh no children cant be suicidal or be depressed, they dont have the right understanding of it blah blah blah" ive heard it all, and even though im in counselling i just feel like everyone has given up, my friends, my family, everyone i know...

I've been dealing with this since i was 11 (yr 6) and  thats when i first started cutting, i was completely alone and i got bullied and i heard from somewhere that cutting helped with the pain so i did it and now here i am, 13 yrs old, going into yr 9 and still being the same depressed child but its gotten worse, yeah i have a boyfriend but he's slowly giving up on me, i just know it, my friends dont listen, they just tell me to man up and deal with it or tell me to stop faking it for attention and whats even worse is that I'm also trans so ya know, just gotta have that dysphoria sprinkled on the top...

Ive tried to stop cutting but thats made me turn to medication misuse (basically i take a paracetamol pill for every time i feel down and if I've cried i take two, but i take no more than 4 a day) and i know its really unhealthy but i cant use any other kind of coping method becuase my parents dont allow me to have sharps in my room at all so i cant cut and other stuff doesnt work, and i haven't even been diagnosed with depression because (people that r British will understand) the nhs is shit, well, for me it is, because i have autism, that hasnt been diagnosed yet but i was diagnosed in wales but they lost the records, so thanks welsh nhs...and they've literally done shit for me, i mean i almost died before they even acknowledged the possibility i have asthma...so im probably not gonna get diagnosed with depression until im at least an adult and yes, like i said before, i am in counselling but tbh its just shit because its not working, like i think its mainly cuz im trans so thats like a whole other level to deal with but yeah...

Oh and also cuz im trans, i dont get acceptance from my family. my grandparents r major Christians and r homophobic (which sucks cuz im also gay) and transphobic and then im not too sure about my nan cuz my uncle is gay, so i might come out to that side of the family first but idk...and like even my own siblings dont really accept me...so ye....im just kinda giving up at this point and i know i need to live for my boyfriend and my family cuz i honestly dont wanna hurt them...but the pain is becoming more and more unbearable...

Oh! Annnnd (sorry im going on but this will be the last major thing) im a curse or i am cursed

Right so basically ever since i was born, no even before i was born, bad things happen to me because of me, like my twin died before we were born, then i got moved to wales at 3, i dont really remember the move but after that i moved back to England at 7 and had to leave behind all my friends and i have no possible way of finding them or talking to them ever again...i started cutting at 11 and my dog died literally the weekend i was going to go into yr7...and i got bullied throughout yr7 and yr8 and if im still alive by the time i go into yr9 ill probably get bullied...and the reason im so sure im either a curse or cursed is because whenever something good or things seem to start getting better at all gets worse again and thats how its been since before I was born...looks like god made a huge mistake by making an autistic, trans, gay, depressed, anxious and cursed child...so yeah... thats all imma say for now, sorry if there is spelling mistakes and for going on for too long its late and im tired so ye...bye i guess?
