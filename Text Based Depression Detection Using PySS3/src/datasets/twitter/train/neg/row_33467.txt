I can't remember the last time that I've been happy. I'm spiraling into a deep depression. I'm lonely all the time and am undesirable to females. I am always stressed about school. I want to blow my brains out but I'm too much of a pussy to do it. I'm horrified by the concept of death, because you don't know whats on the other side. Heaven and hell could be real; or it could be an endless void. Either way I'm screwed. It would also ruin my family. I don't want to hurt them. I love them so much and can't bear to think about what would happened to them if I did it.
