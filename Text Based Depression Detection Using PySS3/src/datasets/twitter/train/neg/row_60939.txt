Its so unfairWhen you see someone wearing a 21k dollars jacket, or someone with a new car and when you look at your own life, saving cents one by one to get a good education, seeing your mother cry and having no father.  Its just. Its unfair. Im sorry but i think there is no god too. Why this keep happening i dont know. My country has a shitti education system where you have to take exams after exams to get into uni. I dont think i'll able to do that too. Im fucking tired and it may be sounding edgy sorry for that too.
I tried to find reasons, my lover helped me alot but she is tired too i guess. Everyone is tired. and i cant take it. i just cant. so i ugh. i dont know.

wish i could paint to leave some stuff behind. guess the only thing im gonna leave at this planet is sadness.
