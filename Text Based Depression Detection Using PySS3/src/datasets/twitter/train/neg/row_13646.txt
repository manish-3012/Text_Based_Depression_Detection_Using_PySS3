Who cares?I always feel like shit when I think about all the assholes I've met in my life who have family and friends who love them, general luck, and everyone's praise when they do the smallest thing. I feel like I've tried so hard to make a life for myself when at the end of the day I realize no one gives a shit. I don't even give a shit. I try so hard to do the right thing - be nice, try to be successful, do what I can to help others - but it doesn't matter. At the end of the day I'm just a loser who no one would miss. What good is trying if you're alone? I feel so fucking worthless and the older I get the more I realize this isn't going to change because it's true. I am worthless and I was a mistake. I mean, I have to vent to reddit because no one else gives a shit. I give up.
