I dont knowI'm 16 and have not been happy for 3 years. I have no friends, I dropped out of school a year ago and I sit at my PC 16 hours a day. I will never get a job I want because of mental ilness. My parents are rich and loving yet I'm still a massive failure. Why should I not just get it over with instead of living off welfare for the rest of my life like a degenerate.
