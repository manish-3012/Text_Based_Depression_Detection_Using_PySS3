Its so hard2 years ago i was kicked out of college because of bad grades mostly due to the stress and sleepless nights of having to live with 9 people in a small 2 room apartment. Afterwards, my depression gotten so bad that i just couldn't do anything, this lasted for about a year. My father came to me and told me to move in with him (he lived in florida and i in new york) because ill have my own room and space to focus on school but ill need a part time to pay for car insurance and phone bill. I decided to go.

Due to my lack of work experience and maybe age (23 at the time and i wanted to focus on scbool. i know im too old to be still doing this) it was hard to find a part time and i was only able to find seasonal jobs that lasted 2 months. After 10 months of desperately trying to change my life around and failing, i just felt more useless then normal and with my father and siblings always looking at me with pity and disappointment, i just couldn't take it (wasnt helping that my father would sometimes humiliate me in front of my siblings). 

I told him that i need to see my family in new york and think about what i should do. I also just needed some time away from them. So i left to new york.

Now i need to make a decision in a couple days to either go back or stay, and just thinking about it makes me nauseous. I still think going to florida is my best bet in making it in life, but i feel so destroyed. I'm afraid to fail and have my family there hate me more then they do now. If i stay in new york i feel like ill never get anything done.

This has got me feeling the worst ive ever had and i was so close to ending it yesterday.

I never posted anything like this. I just dont know what to do.
