Is there any point in living when the love of your life stops loving you?She used to make me so happy, we spent time together...I felt wanted, and loved.  But now I ask to spend time with her and she refuses, we only have a brief handful of hours a week that we could spend together due to work schedules and child care and she elects to give those hours to someone else...when I ask for that time Iâ€™m met with â€œI deserve be able to hang out with me friends too!â€.  These friends want to bang her...these friends are either former lovers or someone who recently claimed to love her....she swears sheâ€™s not cheating...but I no longer trust her...

I asked if we could see a counselor and her response was â€œok fineâ€...I really donâ€™t feel like I matter to her...Iâ€™ve chambered the round and put the gun to my head multiple times....4 times in the last year...I want to pull the trigger so much...but Iâ€™m afraid to die...life isnâ€™t worth living this way but I canâ€™t get out....
