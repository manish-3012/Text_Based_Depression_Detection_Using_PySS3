I don't care about anyhtingEverything just seems so dull, and pointless. I don't have any hobbies, All i pretty much do is browse reddit, watch youtube videos and television, and smoke weed. The only thing that makes me feel anything is getting high. I just dropped out of school last semester, so i'm not getting any student loans, so I have no money to pay my rent and I haven't been able to find a job. I have about $12 in my bank account and $600 on my visa because I had to pay last months rent. No clue how I'll be able to pay that off, or next months rent. Even if I get a job tomorrow I will still be fucked. I really can't picture myself being happy. I have no clue what I want to do as a career., I feel like I will always just be miserable.
