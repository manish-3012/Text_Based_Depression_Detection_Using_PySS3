My brother tells me to become a more stricter / disciplined sister to him, but how can i when he continuously abuses me / takes the mick ?
The actual reason why am venting this, is because my brother keeps on saying "its not hard to make me listen to you!" When infact it is. Because how the hell can i make you respectful when you are rude and laughing about my weakness, i just lost my confidence because now i just see my brother as a bully, more so the bullies at my school.

When i used to be younger it was acceptional of me beating him up
But now as him being taller,
And stronger.
It just made him so full of himself

I asked him why do u love to fight me? I thought he does because of what i did to him in the past and he is seeking for revenge. But no.

Its because he just wants a fight
At this point he always complains that having a sister is such a pain just because I refuse to fight.
