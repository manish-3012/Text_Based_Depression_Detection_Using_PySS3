Should i be worried?The last half a year ish has been extremely difficult for me. Many ups and downs but mostly downs. Even if i dont want to admit it or not. Most days go by with me not doing anything. The only ones i talk too are people online while playing games and my parents from time to time, but i can go days without talking to anyone. I really shouldn't complain since ive got a nice life in general. Everything i need like amusment, financial stability and there is no real reason for me to be unhappy. Yet i am. I havent slept a good nights sleep in a very long time and as hard as i try to brush it of and tell myself its just a little fase, a new month begins and im just as down. The only place i have shared this info is on Reddit and breifly in convoes with people who i bearly know. I try to not show that im so sad all the time cuz when im with people i want to make them has happy as possible.

I really dont want it to go any further as strange dreams and thoughts have been starting to occupie hourd of my day. I really want it to stop.
