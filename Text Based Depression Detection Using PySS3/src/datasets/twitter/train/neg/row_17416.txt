Thatâ€™s itI canâ€™t continue to live anymore. Iâ€™m scared if Iâ€™m actually going to do this, but I just donâ€™t want to live. I want it to be painful, everything I do is hated. I hate myself. Whatâ€™s the point, anyway. Iâ€™m never going to get any of my dreams. Itâ€™s stupid, anyway. Thisâ€™ll probably be my last post, even if I canâ€™t say the right stuff. Sorry for wasting your time, not like you already read that. Iâ€™m nobody compared to actual people that deserve help, half of this post is selfish, anyway.
