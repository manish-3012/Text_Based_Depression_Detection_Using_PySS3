The onlyvtging I have left to lose is myselfMe parents kicked me out,
My ex wife took my daughter
And filed no contact.
My fiance is cheating on
Me my brother won't answer
My calls for like 2 weeks now
And the only two friends I have
Moved 6hour a away.
I know its kinda cheesy when
People say "I have no thing else to live for"
But I really dont at this point.
