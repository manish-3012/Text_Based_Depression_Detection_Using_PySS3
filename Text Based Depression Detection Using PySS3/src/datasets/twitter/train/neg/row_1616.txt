I'll probably be dead in a few daysI really don't know what I'm doing anymore I'm lost and tired I'm ready for it to end I'm working on a note and I might have something I can tie a noose with but I might pussy out again who knows and who really cares it might hurt people but I'll be forgotten in the end
