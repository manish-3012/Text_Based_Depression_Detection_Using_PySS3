'if you kill yourself your passing your pain to someone else' pretty sure i wouldn't care if i im already dead.Im sick and tired of going through the same fucking thing over and over again I'm at my limit where one person telling me not to kill myself just makes me wanna do it twice as bad.

You wanna stop me from doing it? Give me reasons to live don't give me reason's to not die we're all gonna die one day so what's the point? 

At this point even though im only 16F not even in my adult years life really doesn't appeal to me anymore. I get people telling me not to take medication and some even yelling at me to stop it.

I mean..Even the people who tell me life's worth way more then i think it is they can't explain why I've been hurt so many times over the years. 

I even had people believe im just faking this because im one of those "attention whores" people usually like me when im not venting.

I even had someone tell me they see potential in me even though i can't even see it in me and they can't even explain it. 

Oh well..Basically today i learned I'll probably not make it to my mid 20s because im getting weaker by the day.
