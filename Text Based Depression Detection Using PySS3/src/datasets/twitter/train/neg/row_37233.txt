What's the point?My family is abusive, my friendships will end after highschool, my beliefs are constantly ridiculed, I am only here because my dad forgot to wear a condom, I am only here for the continuation of the human race as a species, my life is meaningless, and I will be forgotten when I die.

I'm feeling a strong wave of emotion right now and suicide just seems like an option. These thoughts keep crossing my mind and the past few months I've been thinking of suicide. I don't know if that makes me suicidal. Maybe I'm just a selfish asshole because there are people who love in third world countries with no food dying of starvation. Who the fuck am I to think of being sad?


Idk man
