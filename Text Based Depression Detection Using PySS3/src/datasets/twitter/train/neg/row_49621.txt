I keep getting fired for being too depressed to turn up lolLife requires money. Money requires being a slave to the system for most of your waking life. I don't want to be a slave just to stay alive on this shit planet that's already been destroyed by the generation before me. It's not even worth fixing anymore the damage has been done and can't be reversed. There's nothing left.
