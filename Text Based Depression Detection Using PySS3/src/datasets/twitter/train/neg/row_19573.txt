I considered it last night.It was raining and you saw me at Starbucks, itâ€™s a small town and weâ€™re bound to run into each other.
You stormed out and I felt bad, maybe I should have said hi but I just didnâ€™t know. You said you needed space.

I ran out and tried calling you but I realized you blocked me. You drove off angrily.

Then it hit me, my abusive ex before you was right. I am a monster, and people are happier without me. I know sheâ€™s doing great, sheâ€™s in a happy relationship now and on a human level Im objectively glad.  Iâ€™ve seen her with her slit wrist and now sheâ€™s in a better place in her life, I donâ€™t love her anymore, but on a human level it makes me glad.

But when I realized I was blocked a terrible feeling overwhelmed me, people are better without me. Iâ€™ve seen it, and when I do care about people they always want me to leave or they leave. 

It was raining last night and I smoked a cigarette in the woods. Reminded me of training in the Marines, I wanted to die in that spot. Realizing this world, the people I care for are all better without me.

Today I slept all day, and everything feels like a dream, like none of this is real. Iâ€™m going back overseas to do some contracting, I need the money and I need to go back to Afghanistan, I left a part of me there that I need back and Iâ€™m disappearing like you want me to. Like everyone wants me to.

Iâ€™m just exhausted.
