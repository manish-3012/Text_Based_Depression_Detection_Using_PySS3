In desperate need of helpMy best friend is suicidal/depressed. 

Details:

(In her early 30's/Has big fights with her mom every now and then/Is heartbroken over past relationships/Failed business and a few more that she won't talk to me about.)

Earlier this week i got a call from her and she told me that she wants to kill herself. I tried to talk her out of it and succeeded &amp; i've been trying to keep in touch ever since but i'm worried 24x7 that she might be thinking about it. 

I usually invite her to play multi games to keep her engaged and we usually chat on discord/whatsapp. Now the problem is I've poor social skills i do usually check up on her with How are you doing today?Are you alright? I'm here for you but i feel like these kinds of q'ns are just repetitive and bland and at some point are straight up annoying.

**What comforting words can i actually say to her?**

I want to let her know that she's important and she matters to so many people but i'm always at a loss of words &amp; yes i did tell her to seek professional help or visit support groups but she has made up her mind that they wont do her any good..

P.S: English is not my first language sorry! Still convincing her to seek professional help.
