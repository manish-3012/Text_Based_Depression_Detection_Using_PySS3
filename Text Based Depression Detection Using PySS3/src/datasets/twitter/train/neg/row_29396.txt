i canâ€™t do ititâ€™s not worth it anymore. iâ€™m alone. i have nothing. iâ€™m only seventeen and iâ€™ve already destroyed my own future. i canâ€™t make friends, and when i manage to they always leave. iâ€™m so tired. i donâ€™t want to die but i have nothing else left. it feels awful. iâ€™d rather be dead than live like this. to think that i was finally getting happier too. i guess this just goes to show that iâ€™m not meant to have good things. iâ€™m not meant to be happy. and lifeâ€™s unfair. lifeâ€™s so unfair that iâ€™m not strong enough to deal with it.

iâ€™m just so tired of being alone. i just want to go to sleep and never wake up. my head hurts. iâ€™ve been bawling my eyes out all day. and just when the day was finally getting better it got awful again. everything hurts. iâ€™m tired. i canâ€™t keep going on. iâ€™m done.
