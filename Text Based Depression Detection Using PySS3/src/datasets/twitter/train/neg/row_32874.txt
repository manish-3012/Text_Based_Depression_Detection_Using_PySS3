Every path in my life is a dead endI try, I try, I try, I try. Just to have anything resembling happiness. I try to improve my situation. I struggle to improve any aspect of my life. Instead of doors I find walls. I slam into the walls and become so deeply hurt once again. I am in some sort of solitary confinement. There is no door, there are only walls. All I have is myself and the walls. There is no escape. There is suffering. Then there is death. It waits for us all. Lately it feels to be closer. Feels like it was always there. In the end the last embrace is the embrace of death. The only embrace that matters. No matter how safe one feels in someone else's arms, they will bring pain. You don't expect it from them. From death you do. Death does not lie to you. Death does not hide the pain it will bring you. The pain it will bring others. Death will not lie. People will come and go, yet Death will always be there, waiting. In the end, it is the only one you know will be there at the end. 
I am so exhausted by life. I crave the embrace of death. Life is ongoing and full of disappointments. Death is final and brings an end to it all. I want the pain to stop. I so desperately want the pain to stop. I have hung to hope so many times..hope is a liar. I just want to stop hurting. Forever.
