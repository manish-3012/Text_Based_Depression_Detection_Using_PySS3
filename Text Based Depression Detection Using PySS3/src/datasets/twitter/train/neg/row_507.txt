All my life I've been lonelyNo real friends. Never had sex or had a girlfriend, never kissed, never smoked or drink. I'll end up being 50 years old not accomplishing shit and will look back when I was 19 and wished I did what other normal people could do. Party on fridays, sit on the beach after midnight kissing girls. I can only dream. Fucking fucked off about how other people are luckier then I am. Cunts. Fuck them all.  I've had it, I have no groups, no friends to turn to, cause they're all fake assholes. Never ever ever ever ever chat to me on facebook, nothing, no likes, no friends no nothing. Must as well end it now.
