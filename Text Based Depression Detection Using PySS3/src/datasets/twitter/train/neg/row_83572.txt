I'm done. I'm stuck in my own lonely world.This is my note for everyone to see.
I've been a lonely person all of my life of 16 years. I watch kids grow up beside me, and they flourish with their friend groups. 
I'm stuck here 24 hours a day in my house. Nobody is keeping me here by my will, it's just I have no interests. The only thing that keeps me alive is video games. Other than that, I'm a waste of space. I feel like I'm being selfish, because my family loves me. Yet I can't go on. I am tired of living in my own bubble, getting cast aside by teenagers my age. I'm homeschooled now, and everyone wants me to return to public school. Essentially, my heart is torn, and I can't take the stress anymore.
I plan on overdosing until I pass out on the floor. Goodbye, and I will see you on the other side.
