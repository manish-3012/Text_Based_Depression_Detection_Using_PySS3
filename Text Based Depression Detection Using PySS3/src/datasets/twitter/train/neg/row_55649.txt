Need a good reason not to end my lifeHello, /r/suicidewatch. I'm 14 years old right now, and I'm thinking about killing myself. Life is just sadness and stress. My parents don't think I'm good enough. They always want more. My "friends" are always trying to get rid of me. I feel worthless, sad, and hopeless. I'm not enough for anybody. I really can't think of any way to escape this torture other than suicide.
