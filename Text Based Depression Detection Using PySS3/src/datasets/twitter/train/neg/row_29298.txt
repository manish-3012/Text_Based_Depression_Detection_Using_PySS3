Death by dehydration, is it Possible?For a healthy person living at home, without access to parenteral medications for pain and sedation. Do you think someone's will to die can be so strong, they can go for a week without drinking or eating, and even seeking medical Attention?  I'm thinking of doing it, but feel I will fail unless I sedate myself. But my only options are pills, so I will have to take a sip or two of water every 6 hours or so, to take sedation meds. Maybe also caffeine pills. One caffeine pill should offset any water gain, everytime I take sedation meds. They say after 3 days or so, the desire to drink and eat goes away and it gets easier.
