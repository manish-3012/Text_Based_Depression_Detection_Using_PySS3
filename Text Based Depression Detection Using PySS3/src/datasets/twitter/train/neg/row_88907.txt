Promised myself to try to get my life together next yearMy life could be worse right now, but it still could be better. I think 2017 has been my worst year so far. As an 18-year old girl i'm confronted with the 'career choices' topic, which is very difficult for me. I still don't know what job I want to do. (Well, actually yes, I want to be a photographer or an author, but it's difficult to reach that goal if you don't have enough motivation. And i'm not even sure about these options.)
I have anxiety and depression phases for 3 years now and i'm still fighting against them, without medication. 

But it calms me when I think, that I made it so far. So I chose to try to stay alive another year. 
I don't want to loose this battle without a fight. 

I even told my therapist, that I want to try meds, because I just feel that talking doesn't really help (My biggest problem is that I can't start things. I want to do stuff, but I just can't. It's like i'm tied up to my bed.) She gave me an appointment with the doctor , so he could find out if meds are necessary. 

I really wanted to avoid meds, but none of my problems can get in my way right now. 2018 is going to be a very important year, and if I don't get my life together then, I never will. 

For now, I also wish everyone else a fresh new start. 
A new year is a new chance.
