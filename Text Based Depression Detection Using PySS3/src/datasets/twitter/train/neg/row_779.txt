ExhaustedIâ€™m so tired. Physically itâ€™s hard to get out of bed. Mentally itâ€™s hard to focus on work. Emotionally itâ€™s hard to be in any relationship. I skip school and practice because Iâ€™m sick. I call off work because I want to lay in bed even though I need money. I let the phone go to voice mail because I donâ€™t want to talk. Living is eating me alive.  And honestly Iâ€™m not loving Iâ€™m surviving doing the same thing every day for what? I donâ€™t want to get better. I know I have to but everyone thinks Iâ€™m fine so I canâ€™t even get help if I wanted to. Iâ€™m so tired of this.
