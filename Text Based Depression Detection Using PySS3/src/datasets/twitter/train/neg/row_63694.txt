An odd request at an odd timeI don't know who would be on this subreddit on today of all days, but I just want to get this out there and see if anyone responds.

I'm scared. I'm scared of embarrassing numerous times again. I'm scared of speaking to the point where I want to become a mute. I'm scared of telling my family and friends how I really feel. I'm even scared of going out in public due to all the fears that come with it.

But at his moment, what I'm the most scared about is how for the past 31 hours, I've had the same vision of my body hanging from a noose. I've thought about it, planned it, and even dreamed about it in my sleep. I can't shake it off because it feels so right.

So what am I requesting for now? All I want is for someone to hold me and tell me that I have nothing to worry about. I know that the feeling is temporary, and that I'll just turn into my same, pussy, Socially Awkward Penguin self. But it just feels good.

Please, SW. I'm on my final streak. If I make it by the start of 2012, it will be a miracle.
