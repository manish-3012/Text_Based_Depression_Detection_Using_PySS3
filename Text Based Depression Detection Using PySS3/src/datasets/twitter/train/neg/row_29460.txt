I can't take my relationship anymoreOK so obviously I love my boyfriend and everything but that is just the thing. It seems like everyday we have some kind of fight. I always say hurtful things which I know make him upset and seeing him upset is one of my least favorite things to see. I have hurt him so much, and I don't know if I can live with that. I tried to leave him to save both of us but he threatened to kill himself if I did, which just made me want to kill myself more, I then proceeded to cut which made him really upset, which made me upset and I don't think I am able to carry on much longer...
