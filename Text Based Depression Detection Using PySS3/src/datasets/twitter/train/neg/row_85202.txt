I feel 100% unlovable and undesirableFuck my stupid brain. I've done all the things people are supposed to do. I went to school. I got a degree. I got a job that uses my degree. I work out. I have friends. But all I can think about is how I don't feel like anyone loves me or cares about me. About how any time I get close to a girl she pushes me away. I don't understand how to date. I don't understand how to fall in love, or be in love, or even how to be loved. Every day I put on the same stupid smile and every night I cry myself to sleep in bed alone. I just want someone to hold.

The worst days are the ones where I forget how lonely I am, and I have a few hours of peace of mind. Then the wave of self-hate comes crashing back in and I would do anything to shut up the stupid voice in my head. 

No, I'm not going to kill myself tonight. But I thought about it. I think about it every night. The only reason I don't go through with it is because my job makes a few people's lives better. If I have to suffer through another 40 years of this bullshit before I retire and shoot myself, fine. It's worth it to make a few people's lives better.

But my first thought every morning is "I want to die" and my last thoughts before bed are "I want to die" and I don't know how much longer I can hold on to my soul.
