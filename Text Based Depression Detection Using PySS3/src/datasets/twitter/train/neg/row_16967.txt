I give upLife seems to be meaningless to me Ive done everything people and family have told me to do to have a good life nothing good has happened Im 35 and still live at home making shit money and I have tried for so long. I tried ending myself several times but someone always manages to catch me. Not this time. Im sorry to the people I have disappointed in life, I just cant take it
