I don't know how to help my friend.I have a friend who goes to school with me- L.- who is very unstable. She has been battling depression and anxiety, as well as fibromyalgia (sp?), back problems, and that's just the stuff I know about. She has expressed suicidal thoughts before, usually saying stuff like, "I wish Bob (fiance) would just take me out to the desert and leave me." She is aware that her depression is causing these thoughts, but has said that she just has trouble dealing anymore. 

A few weeks ago, she went off her meds, saying that they weren't working and she was tired of all the side effects. Things seemed to be going well; she told me that she was changing psych doctors because her PCP felt she was being overmedicated, and she was starting to lose some of the weight the meds had put on.

But when I texted her to update her on the class she was missing tonight, she told me that she found her fiance dead on the kitchen floor this morning. They're not sure what exactly happened- the autopsy is tomorrow- but they think maybe a heart attack. 

So now I'm concerned that she will become even more suicidal as a result of this horrible, horrible tragedy. She's got two kids and some pets, but it was always Bob who took care of her when she couldn't cope. Right now, she and the kids are staying with her mom, but I know that won't go on forever. 

How can I help her? I know I can't be with her 24/7, but I am afraid that if she gets left alone for too long, she might get even more suicidal. Any advice will be appreciated, thank you.
