Sometimes Iâ€™m sad and it scares meI have a diagnosis for PTSD, anxiety, and manic depression/Bipolar disorder. I am graduated from high school, and have recently dropped out of college because of COVID-19. 

 When Iâ€™m â€œsadâ€ it means Iâ€™m either having an episode of crying randomly and having thoughts of wishing I was dead and then going back to completely normal after that. Then I can switch again to being super angry if someone bothers me about things like even little things then just completely a-okay with whatever happened because I probably donâ€™t remember. When Iâ€™m sad I donâ€™t know what to do I pace and shake and hide in corners of the room. I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s wrong with me.
