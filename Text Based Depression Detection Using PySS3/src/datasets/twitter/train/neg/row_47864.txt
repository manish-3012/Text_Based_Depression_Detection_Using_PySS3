pretty sure the only thing keeping me alive right now is that i don't have the willpower or courage to cause my own death* i'm non-binary and my parents are never going to understand or respect that
* i have horrible gender dysphoria but it's like half of my body is fine and the other half isn't so medical transition is a complete 50/50 for me and i'll never be comfortable in my body
* my school's disability resource center just opted not to approve me for auditory processing accommodations because my audPD is documented as "mild"
* i'm behind in literally every single one of my courses and one of my professors has been hostile to me ever since finding out i'm queer and disabled
* i have borderline personality disorder and i know everyone including my own partner is fucking sick of me literally bursting into tears at everything remotely negative
* this is like the 15th time this semester i've slept through an entire day of classes because i keep procrastinating until 5 minutes before class, getting anxious about being late, then giving up
* i can't go on medical leave because it means going back home which is even worse than all the shit i'm dealing with now, and it would mean leaving my significant other
* i just told my parents i'm going through a major depressive episode and they responded with "okay well you have to make sure it doesn't affect your schoolwork too much that's important"
* i don't even have the fucking strength to be honest with my parents about missing classes anymore because i can't handle getting yelled at on the phone and being forced to try to come up with a bullshit recovery plan that i know i can't follow through on
* the only non-binary-friendly therapist i could find just scolded me a lot and reminded me of my parents so now i'm out of a therapist again and have no idea where i can possibly get another one
* i keep making plans to recover and i never follow through on them and it feels completely pointless to keep trying
* basically i just really want to not be alive and i hate that i can't do anything about it
