I can't overcome it...I've always been alone and depressed throughout school. Now I have no social group, I don't feel an emotional bond to my family, I don't feel an emotional bond to anyone. I don't play hard. I traveled once to deal with this and it helped for the time being but now I'm back home and I feel trapped. Though, I probably created that trap. I don't know how to organize my time and spend money on things that matter to me. So I'm just living passively. I wish my life was working out, but it's not, and now I can continue living with a roommate who's egotistical and doesn't give a damn about me, quit my job and travel on my savings again, or quit everything... but honestly I just want life to work out instead.
