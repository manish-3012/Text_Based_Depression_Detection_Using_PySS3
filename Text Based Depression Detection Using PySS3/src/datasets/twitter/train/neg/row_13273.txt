Whatâ€™s the use?You know, I did the therapy thing, the med thing. I finally realized that no amount of meds or talking will change a shitty life. Itâ€™s natural to be depressed in an actually depressing life.

Husband lost his (very good 32yr) job nearly two years ago. I had to go back to a (grueling) job.

Daughter (with three grand babies) moved in cause she had to (Iâ€™m her mom, never turn her away!). She contributes what she can.

29yr old son with me now, his step mom threw him out in the dead of winter two weeks before Xmas. He too has a job and helps a little. Sleeps on the couch.

We live in a two bedroom apt.

I have NO way to change any of this. Thereâ€™s no extra $ to move to a bigger place. Husband stays home and babysits grandkids. He canâ€™t just get a new job like his old one. Heâ€™d been there since he was 19, fired for cause at 52. Who is gonna look at that resume.

Itâ€™s all on me. Iâ€™m tired. I simply canâ€™t go on like this. No amount of meds or therapy is gonna change it.

Oh yeah and Iâ€™ve now accumulated a cardiologist who says my heart is failing and I shouldnâ€™t work 12 hour shift. He gonna support us?

And the stack of medical bills and collections from medical bill.

Seriously, whatâ€™s the point? Iâ€™m tired.
