I cheated and I donâ€™t feel worthy of livingThatâ€™s it, I just canâ€™t deal with the pain I caused, I saw a girl days before I asked my gf to be my gf, the girl I cheated with told her everything and now she is unresponsive of any attempt of me contacting her. I donâ€™t see myself without my gf, Iâ€™ve never felt so comprehended and loved and cheated just because, I didnâ€™t even want to to begin with. Even tho she wasnâ€™t my gf officially we talked about being exclusive while knowing each other, what type of scumbag am I to betray her like that? I just want this all to end
