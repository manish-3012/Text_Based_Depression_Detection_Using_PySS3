I hate it hereIâ€™ve been thinking about it off and on for a long time but every time those thoughts come back, I get a little closer to actually doing it. I donâ€™t really care about how anyone else would feel if I died because if they really gave a shit then theyâ€™d care while Iâ€™m still here. 

Iâ€™m honestly struggling so much.
