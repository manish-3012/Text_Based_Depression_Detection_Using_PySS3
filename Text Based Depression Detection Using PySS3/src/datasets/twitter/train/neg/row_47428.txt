i dont know why im bothering to postlately ive been very depressed. i'm falling behind on bills, i have court soon in which i may go to jail. i'm a realist though; i know the 3 months max i'll spend in jail won't be all that much.

my girl and i have been together on and off for 5 years. she left me last week though we're still living together until the semester is over. that's my fault, of course. i don't know what i'd do without her.

i normally keep all my feelings of sadness to myself. i always feel like if i talk about them, i'm just looking for pity or something, and i don't want people to change any opinions on me based on my depression and thoughts of suicide.

there was a party over the weekend. and an easter dinner (yes, very much past easter; don't ask me) . i was originally going to go with her because it's her family, but since we broke up i didn't want to go to her family dinner and i didn't really feel like going up there with her to the party either (the party wasn't her family, it was a friend of ours from years ago that lives in the same area as her family)

she said she wouldn't go to the party, either, so she went off to visit her family with just herself. and our son, who is really the only reason i haven't just gone ahead with uh..suicide.

she ended up going to the party after all (she left our son with her family for the night, so that's cool) but she got drunk and ended up making out with some other dude.

i'm still very much in love with her but now she's talking to this other guy still.

i feel like my life is crashing and i don't know what to do. i'm not religious. i just don't know.
