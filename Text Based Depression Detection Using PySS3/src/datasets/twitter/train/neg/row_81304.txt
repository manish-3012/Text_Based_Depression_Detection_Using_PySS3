Future? Suicide? Depression.I've constantly had issues seeing a real future for myself. When I do see a future for myself something happens and it doesn't work out. And I get depressed and don't want to do anything when I know I should and then my brain goes down a rabbit hole and i think of self harm and suicde and can't tell anyone because I feel like I'm dumb or looking for attention or.. just a lot of other negative thoughts about myself... I probably won't keep this post up long because I will probably feel even more dumb telling people all this. But I was hoping maybe someone felt the same way or I don't know...sorry I exist
