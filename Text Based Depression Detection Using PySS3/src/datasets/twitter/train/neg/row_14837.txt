I feel like I've tried everything to try to keep myself afloatHi. 26 year old male here. Depressed since high school, severely depressed since beginning of college. I still think about suicide on most days. The problem with telling myself that things will get better is that I always turn out to be wrong. Things might get better moment to moment, but not in any general way, which is the way that truly counts.    

I always find myself asking, 'Why didn't I just kill myself last year?'...or last month, or 5 years ago. 

Nothing has made me want to live since. I've always felt an impending doom about my future... i.e. insecurities. They say that's what depression gets you to unreasonably think. But sure enough, I am currently experiencing that doom in a gradually more intense way (over the years), just as I always feared. What happened to everyone telling me life gets better? All I've learned is that I was right. I hate sporadic periods of hope because they only end up disappointing me. Hope is a curse for me because it convinces me to stick around longer. 

I've tried therapy, meds, talking with friends, gym, sports. It's like I build a tolerance to all of them and they simply have no effect anymore. I don't know what else I can do.
