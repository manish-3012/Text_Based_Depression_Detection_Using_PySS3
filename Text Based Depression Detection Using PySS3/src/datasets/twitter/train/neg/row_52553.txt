I just donâ€™t know what to doHi. Iâ€™ll use my middle name- Iâ€™m Trinidee. I donâ€™t post to reddit much, and I just found this. Itâ€™s currently 3am for me and Iâ€™m feeling really alone, so why not post this? 
Iâ€™m 15, and Iâ€™ve been dealing with severe anxiety and depression since I was 10, due to personal/family reasons. Iâ€™m on medications, which do help with panic attacks, but nothing else really. 
I have friends, they care about me, they have their own problems that help them understand how I feel sometimes, but I canâ€™t talk to them. Theyâ€™re always telling me Iâ€™ll be okay, they say that theyâ€™re always there, the usual. Itâ€™s great to know that they care, but it doesnâ€™t help me feel any better at all. Iâ€™m in a relationship as well, but any time I mention my bad feelings or anything, they get really worried and start crying and again, itâ€™s good to know that they care, but it almost makes me mad for some reason. It bothers me how they cry because of how I feel, I donâ€™t know why. I guess I feel bad for hurting them? I donâ€™t know. 
In 2017, my oldest brother died of a previously unknown heart problem. He was much older than me, but it hurt and it still does. Now itâ€™s just me and my other brother. My mom hasnâ€™t been great since then, and she talks about how sheâ€™s â€œready to go and be with (my brother)â€, which really hurts me. Just because heâ€™s dead, does that mean she only cares about him now instead of the children she still has? My parents donâ€™t really love me, I know that. I hate my dad. Heâ€™s not abusive physically, but he is emotionally. I cant do anything about it, because I canâ€™t put my momâ€™s stability at risk. My mom knows about my depression and anxiety, she knows Iâ€™m on medication, and yet she doesnâ€™t understand. She says that I can just â€œget over itâ€, like itâ€™s a light switch I can just turn off. And yet she constantly says she wants to kill herself to be with my brother. 
I feel really lonely. Iâ€™m really shy, and most people think Iâ€™m â€œweirdâ€ because of how awkward I am irl. I donâ€™t have anyone to talk to that understands and helps. Iâ€™ve told my mom time and time again that I need real help, I need to talk to a professional, but she never does anything. I donâ€™t care for most people, and at this point I donâ€™t see a point in living life because Iâ€™ll just die anyways. 
A year or so ago, after my brother died, I met someone who really helped me feel better. I didnt â€œloveâ€ him like that, but I loved him for his support and friendship he showed me. I was selfish then, and I didnâ€™t realize how rare and special he was, and I messed up and lost him. He hates me now for my selfishness, and I havenâ€™t talked to him in months. I miss him so much. He made me feel real happiness. Itâ€™s like, at the moment I lost him, an already-dim light was shut off for me. Since then I just donâ€™t know what to do. 
I think about suicide a lot. Iâ€™ve never self-harmed, Ive never done anything like that, but my friends know that I think about it. I feel like Iâ€™ll always be too afraid to actually do it, but I consider it. I donâ€™t know how Iâ€™d do it, but I think about doing it and what would happen. I think everyone would just move on after a while. The main reason I havenâ€™t done it is my partner, I know that if I did it then they would be broken, and theyâ€™d probably do it as well (they have a history of self harm). I donâ€™t want that. 
I just donâ€™t know what to do anymore. I feel so alone.
