Nobody cares about meI have nobody to seriously talk to anymore. I donâ€™t have anymore super close friends that I can talk. My family doesnâ€™t gaf about me and they basically ignore me and donâ€™t want to do anything with me. I might just OD on meds tonight because I have nothing left in my life. It doesnâ€™t get better.
