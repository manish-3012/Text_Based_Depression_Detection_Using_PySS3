Please helpDo you know that feeling? No? I will explain:

Life is good. I got friends, family, money. I can study whatever I want. For free even. I just moved to an awesome place with loads of cool people. I get things done. I read books. I sing, I dance, I laugh. I party, I celebrate. And I write, like this post. But still, there's just something missing. Seeing your friend kiss his girlfriend sends an invisible hammer  more powerful that Thor's crushing through your chest. The facebook message not answered. The call ending in the voice mail. Every little dissappointment is felt much more badly than it should. It feels like pain. Heartbroken, malicious pain. A pain so evil you do not dare to feel it. You fear it will destroy you, burn your life into ashes. Maybe it will, maybe it wont. It's like a constant flame. As the wind temporarily can make a burning torch fade so can happiness extinguish my fire once in a while. But the glow is still there, always there. I need help. Once and for all I wish to destroy my burning heart and recover whatever is left.

I need to talk.

Please help.
