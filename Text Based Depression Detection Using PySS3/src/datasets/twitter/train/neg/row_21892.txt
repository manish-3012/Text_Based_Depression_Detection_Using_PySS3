What should I doI've been in the hospital/ward for two years following a severe suicide attempt...... I just got out. I thought I was doing better. I thought things would change. But now that I'm out killing myself is all I can think about. I just searched for 2 hours how to kill myself painlessly. I'm in so much pain right now. I just want to die. I thought I was over this. I dont know what to do. Im really scared :(
