dead endfucking hate myself right now iâ€™m sorry if this is incoherent as hell iâ€™m just angry at myself and i have been for too long and god 

i remember being younger and promising myself iâ€™d kill myself when i hit a certain age if i was still unhappy and it felt so far away at the time and now itâ€™s just four months away and iâ€™m still miserable as shit

i hate myself i hate the way i look the way i sound the way i talk to people the way i dress the fact i canâ€™t do fucking anything worthwhile except leech off other people 

my lifeâ€™s not gonna go anywhere iâ€™m a fucking dumbass i hate myself and i wish i never dropped out and shut myself off from everyone now everyoneâ€™s forgotten me and itâ€™s too late to go back and i just want to be happy but i never can be and i hate it and i wish i could open up to people and i hate the way i act but i canâ€™t stop 

iâ€™m fucking stuck here and itâ€™s gonna be like this forever and iâ€™m sick and tired and i wanna fucking drown right now
