Iâ€™m brokenI donâ€™t care about throwaways anymore. I donâ€™t care if this goes on my main account. Iâ€™m fucking broken. Every part of me is shattered. I donâ€™t want to live. Iâ€™m in so much pain every single day. To the point where Iâ€™m curled up in a ball on the bathroom floor sobbing so hard I canâ€™t breathe. I donâ€™t want to hurt this much anymore
