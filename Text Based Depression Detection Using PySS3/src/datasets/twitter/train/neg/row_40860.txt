I've always been depressed, but now it's much worse for no apperent reason. Any ideas why?So, I've been suffereing from depression for about seven years, but for the past few months, since I started senior year, it has been much worse. I have no idea why, other than this girl I like. However, it seems much more intense than just liking a girl kind of depression, this feels really bad.
