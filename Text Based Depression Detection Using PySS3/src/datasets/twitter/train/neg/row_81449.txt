The first time I'm actually calm about suicideI was just raped recently. And it's changed my life for the worst. I see no way out, I feel like no one loves me or enjoys being around me and that I deserved this rape for being a stupid piece of shit.

I don't want to go home and I don't want to pursue a future anymore. I'm calm about dying. I want it more than ever now. There is no hope. I can't be happy and no one would care if I died.
