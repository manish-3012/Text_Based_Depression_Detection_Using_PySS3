don't know what to do anymoreeach day it just get harder to make it through. I'm tired. I don't feel well. I just don't see the point anymore. The urges are so strong. I can feel the inner "crazy" bursting to come out. yeah, I know...sounds nuts, but that's the best way to describe it. I don't know how much longer I can contain it. Today was so rough..... :/
