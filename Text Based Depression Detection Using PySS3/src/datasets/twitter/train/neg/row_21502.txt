If you're thinking of suicide...Seriously think about it. Don't do it because you're sad or depressed. Take your emotions and others opinions and thoughts out of the equation. Take a good, long look at your life. At life itself. Match up how you fit into all of it, and seriously do a lot of reflection and conclusive analysis on your life. Take a truthful look at your life and be brutally honest with yourself about whether or not it's something that is working for you. Is it worth it to continue living? Have you done everything you could to try and create the type of life you want? What is the likelihood of your life changing for the better? What is the likelihood of life, itself, changing for the better? Really sit and ponder things like that. I'm amazed at the clarity that comes from doing this. So, please think deeply about it. Because, the right choice for you will come from within. And listen to the choice made, because that will be the right choice.
