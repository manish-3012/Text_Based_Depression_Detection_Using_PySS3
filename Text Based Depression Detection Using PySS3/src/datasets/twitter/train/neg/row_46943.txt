I keep thinking back to a few awful things I've doneOnce during a concert someone wanted to move forward, but I didn't move out of the way and she became angry. Later on I started elbowing against someone's back for no reason at all. I did that like 3 times. She turned around and said 'sorry, but are you doing this on purpose?' and I felt soooooo embarassed. This is such an awful thing I've done. I feel like such a maniac for doing that. I just hate being packed together with a bunch of people and turned into an asshole because of that. My ex saw that we were arguing. It took me a very long time to finally forget about this.

I contacted my ex a few months ago and she blocked me. I made a new account to continue the conversation. She engaged and blocked me again. I kept doing this like 6 times. In the end she lost it and reminded me I was being fucking irrational just like during that concert and insulted the shit out of me.

I feel soooooooooo bad about myself. I keep thinking back to what a monster I am. I really, really, really wish I hadn't done those things. The guilt is completely swallowing me up. I keep wanting to kill myself because I've done things that I can't live with.
