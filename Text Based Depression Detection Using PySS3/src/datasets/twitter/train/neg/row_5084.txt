I dont know how much longer I can take this.I feel like im drowning and I have been for awhile... its just starting to swallow me up and I cant take it any longer. Im a trans guy so I have the needles to inject anything into me at any time and honestly its so tempting. I dont know what to do anymore between work and school and money and family I cant live the rest of my life like this.. I dont want to. Posting here is ckidr to my last resort..I want help but.  I also just want everything to stop..
