Help! my friend is thinking about running away and committing suicide in a month.What should I say? What can I say? She said it's final and nothing can change her mind. She said her parents are so controlling, and that she has no control on her life. She's 16. I can't go to her right now because of my job and she live like 800 miles away from me. Please help.
