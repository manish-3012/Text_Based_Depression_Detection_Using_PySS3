I think im fuckedIm self centered. Oblivious to a lot of things around me. I cant hold a relationship because i think im too selfish and i dont even know how to stop it or when im even doing it. 

Like i want to give someone all my love and affection but then im so reserved with it when it comes time to show it. Like im scared it may be too much or maybe im just manipulative. Like sometimes i think im a psychopath but then i feel so many emotions and loneliness. 

Like when i speak to someone i know what they want to hear and what to say to make them like me and say it even if i dont agree with it. And i dont know why i just do it man and it scares me because i dont understand my self. 

In my head im one person then when i look at my actions and complex web of lies i see multiple different people that are not the me i think i am. Now i dont know who i am or what i want. 

I know im too proud so that has an influence on me alot, even though i hate myself this pride is there like a never budging mountain. Left over from a time where i was super confident and flying high. 

Is anyone else like this or am i just a broken human because im driving myself crazy right now.
