What future?You know, when people ask me what I want to do with my life, I have a hard time picturing it. I usually just say that Iâ€™m still not sure and that I want to travel a bit because I know this is an appropriate answer that doesnâ€™t require more questions. Sometimes theyâ€™ll go on to ask me where I see myself in 5 years and I usually canâ€™t answer the question. Then they go on to ask where I see myself in a year and yet again, I feel like I canâ€™t answer. So out of frustration and the person just simply wanting to get an answer out of me, they usually ask where I see myself tomorrow. I usually can give them a simple answer of what I have to do within the next 24hrs which typically entails my work schedule for the next day. Most of the time theyâ€™ll be satisfied with my response. After answering these questions I try to play it off as saying the reason I donâ€™t know what my future looks like is because I like to live in the moment. Thatâ€™s a lie, the reason I canâ€™t see a future is because I truly donâ€™t believe that I have one. One day, I think Iâ€™m going to get so fed up of my pathetic life that Iâ€™ll just end it. I donâ€™t make anything out of my life because I donâ€™t see the point. I donâ€™t see it getting any better and I donâ€™t think I can be helped. I guess Iâ€™m just hoping something will come along, like a wave catching a piece of drift wood in its current and carrying it somewhere safe, like a beautiful beach. I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m still hanging around. I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s keeping me here. I feel selfish taking my own life because I know how much it hurts to lose someone you love but at the same time, nobody understands how much Iâ€™m hurting. If people could only see why I feel the way I feel, they wouldnâ€™t hesitate to make the decision of ending it.

Iâ€™m pushing people who love me away because the further they get from me the less I can hurt them. The lonelier I am, the better. I destroy these relationships and I am always to blame which is good, I guess. The more you hate someone, the less you care about their life. 

Sometimes I get the feeling that I want to make things right. Itâ€™s like cleaning a dirty car window. I feel relieved when I do it and I can see where Iâ€™m going but after driving a few kilometres, the window is dirtier than before and I havenâ€™t got the tools or energy to clean it. So why do I even try anymore. Why drive the car and why clean the window? I know that it will always revert to being dirty. 

So in the end, I stay alone, hidden in my comfort zone where nobody asks any questions. Eventually I think my low self esteem and lack of purpose in life will become so unbearable that I will realize that I simply can go on living like this...
