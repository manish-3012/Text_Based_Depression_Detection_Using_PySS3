Gunshot to headNot sure why I canâ€™t bring myself to end my life. Iâ€™ve been pining for it since I was at least 16 (23 now.) I make excuses constantly, currently itâ€™s that I will only be able to do it if I have a gun. Iâ€™m afraid of taking pills or crashing my car because I do not want the chance of living with brain damage, then Iâ€™m really trapped. A gun would most likely be able to end my life and then I can finally be done with all of this. I live in NYC and my family isnâ€™t close, they are most likely clueless to my feelings. Iâ€™m just alone everyday and I just need to stop feeling anything at all. I have an eating disorder and smoke almost exclusively because I know it is horrible for me. I just want to die. I just need to die. I havenâ€™t used this account in years but I signed on because I feel like I just need to write this out.  I just want to lock myself alone in my bedroom and put a gun in my mouth. Maybe if I visit my parents I could turn my car on in the garage and die from carbon monoxide. I donâ€™t want them to have to see me like that though which is why I would rather shoot myself in the head, alone in my bedroom in my apartment over here.
