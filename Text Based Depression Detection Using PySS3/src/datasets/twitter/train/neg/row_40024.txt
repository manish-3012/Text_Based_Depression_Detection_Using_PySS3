What to do when you made a big mistake with long lasting effects ?I really want to hang on a little longer for my mom and my little sister but I just can't. I feel like I have no control over the outcomes of my life anymore. It's just not worth it to try to get better while knowing that the mistake will come back to haunt me eventually.
I'm sorry, I'm scared and I needed a place to vent.
