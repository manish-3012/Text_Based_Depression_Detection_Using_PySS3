Tried to kill myself last night.Everything is going well financially, socially,etc. But I miss my ex.

We were together for 7 years and then we stopped seeing each other. 

I havent talked to her much since but i tried texting her last week and she hasnt answered. 

I was coming back from work last night and I was alone at the train station listening to cowboy fringants. It was blistering cold. Just saw the tunnel, the sad song, the cold -30c wind, and no reply from my ex, and just sorta thought "why am I going through all these motions without her"?

Then I texted a suicide note and prepared to send it to her when the train comes(its not your fault, etc.). I was going to press send, drop the phone and do it.

Don't know why I didn't but I got scared when the train came... 

I'm only 26... Id like to keep on living as long as I can, but I dont know if ill be able to live without her... What do I do?

I've been with other girls this past year but sex does nothing for me if its not with her. :(
