Weighing my optionsDo I wait until college, starve myself, and get the body of my dreams (a.k.a skeletal figure)?

Orrrr do I kill myself sometime this year so I donâ€™t have to go through 4 years of living with my ugly, fat self while everyone around me goes swimming in their skimpy little bathing suits that enhance their skinniness?
