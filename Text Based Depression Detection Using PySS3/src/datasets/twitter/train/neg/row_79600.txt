Idk if this belongs here, just ramblingIâ€™m basically too afraid to commit suicide. I am afraid of what it would be like for my parents to find me dead, what kind of affect it would have on my young niece and nephew. So instead I just cut myself. Usually just once, in some inconspicuous place on my body. But I hate these scars that I have leftover. I donâ€™t want to cut right now because of a new scar. But I feel so fucking sad idk what else I can do right now. This current wave has been going on a few days now, Iâ€™ve been binge drinking daily but finished the bottle last night. Just left now with my thoughts and stresses and a razor blade.
