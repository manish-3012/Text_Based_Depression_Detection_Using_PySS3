Alone, NYE and who knows...I am all alone couped up in my apartment, just sitting here coding and sadly cant shake loneliness away. Messaged some friends today to see how they were doing they didnt reply back, have nowhere to turn, Sometimes I just feel like no one gives a cahoot about me and just honestly been thinking on just ending it all. I am 29 single and jeez still in college NYE was supposed to bring something new to the table but to me it brings pain and coldness the future is what i feel just grim and just awful. I lost friends this year that had to return to their homes because of covid (they live in different countries) and just I am left here all alone. Idk what to do next I am on my 3rd beer can and trying to go to sleep I really tried my best to see something positive in 2021 but I just see the same constant result. I miss my international friends they probably dont care much as they didnt answer me back. Nothing left to do right now but sit and wait in front of my computer coding random stuff and drinking myself to sleep. Suicide has been something Ive been thinking of but today feels like something very real, I just started thinking of ending it this week but today the feeling really is strong. I have no more hope and I feel just tired of it all. Hope you all have a great year though may 2021 bring you many good things to you all.

Stay safe
