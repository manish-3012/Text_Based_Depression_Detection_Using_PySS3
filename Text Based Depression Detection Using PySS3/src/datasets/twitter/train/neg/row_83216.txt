I feel like I'm the cause of a murder-suicide.Check my post history for more details.

I haven't been able to sleep for 72 hours now due to guilt and I feel fucking awful. I've been vomiting up blood once in a while and my eyes are bloodshot. I can't see a doctor due to financial reasons (yay, usa). 

I taunted him, I was the last one to speak to him and he shot and killed himself family and himself. If only I was nicer before that. Maybe they would be alive today.
