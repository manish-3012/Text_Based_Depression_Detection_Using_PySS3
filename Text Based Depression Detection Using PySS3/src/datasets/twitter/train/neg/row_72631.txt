I may have molested someone, and I can't cope with it.I'm using a throwaway for obvious reasons.  I was at a small highschool party last night (everyone is underage) where I drank and smoked enough to make me lose almost all memory of the night.  All I knew is that I ended up throwing up on the carpet, and that they paid for my uber.  I contacted them this morning to offer to pay them back for their kindness and the uber, but I was met with a different response:  a text from one of the girls there telling me that I had molested her without her consent, and that she doesnt want to talk to me.  I have never had an urge to do those types of things, let alone enact them with one of my friends, so I'm in shock at the thought that I would ever do something so disgusting and opportunistic (even in my intoxicated state).  While I am scared of the consequences, my greatest fear is that I will never be able to look myself in the mirror again.  Is there any way to cope with this and apologize for my inexcusable behavior?  I'm only on this sub because I couldn't find anywhere else to seek help for this issue, as I am clearly the bad guy in this scenario.  Right now I feel like the most disgusting guy on earth, and I don't even know what I did.  


TL;DR: Got blackout drunk and high at a friends house, then got a text the next day from a girl saying that I molested her and that she doesn't want to talk to me. I feel disgusting and dont know what to do or how to apologize.

I understand that my behavior was completely inexcusable, but please dont rip me apart in the comments.  I only feel complete remorse for my own actions, and do not need a dogpile on me.
