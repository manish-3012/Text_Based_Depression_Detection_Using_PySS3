LIFE NEVER GETS BETTERI've been depressed for years and the last time I thought about suicide was 2014 but I held on thinking it could get better and it did for a little while but here I am again just wanting to fucking end it. Everything is fucking useless and I'm gonna be depressed until I die. Everyone has someone to fall back on but I don't. I was forced to move out at the age of 17 and now at the age of 20 I'm in so much debt that I can't even afford to live so why the fuck should I?
