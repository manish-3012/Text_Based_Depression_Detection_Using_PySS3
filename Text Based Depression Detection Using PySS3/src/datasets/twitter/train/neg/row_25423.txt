Tired of being too terrified to live my lifeI'm a 20 year old university student and I've been having severe panic attacks for two years now. I've had an anxiety disorder since I was 6, but lately it's gotten so bad that I can't make it to class, I can't take a bus, I can't go out and see my partner or my friends or go to the grocery store. I had to move back in with my parents and I'm about to drop out of school. I can rarely go a day without having a panic attack, and I often end up on the floor screaming and completely freaking out until someone calls an ambulance. I have done virtually everything I can do, I've gone to therapy, seen counselors and therapists, taken almost every medication, tried all the "self-help" stuff, and none of it is working. My father is on unemployment now because I can't be left alone. I frequently consider killing myself when I'm having a panic attack because I'm so terrified, and lately I've been thinking about it even when I'm not. I used to be a really happy person, I have plenty of friends and a girlfriend, I was doing good in university and had a lot of plans for what I wanted to do with my life, but now I'm pretty much confined to my house living in unimaginable fear of absolutely nothing at all. I can't control it and I just want to stop being afraid. I don't know what to do.
