First time I've thought like this, but seriously thinking it.Posted in r/depression, but stumbled upon this area. Seriously thinking about committing suicide because of how worthless I feel. Never in my 18 years, and hopefully 19 soon, have I ever thought this. At first I considered getting into alcohol or drugs (which I'm huge against), but then it finally grew into suicidal thoughts. 

Here's just some things that are really pushing my depression/thoughts:

First, the love of my life, or what I seriously thought was, finally told me that we can't be together, ever. 

Second, my family and I have been getting into it about financial issues and how working a volunteer position right now isn't helping. 

Third, I feel ashamed for having a friend that I seriously care about, break down on me because I told her I'm having these thoughts. It's gotten to the point where it seems as if she doesn't want to talk to me now.

And lastly, I keep having these visions of me eating a gun that is in my house, or staring at a belt to hang myself with. I'm scared that I'm having these thoughts, and it makes me sick to even know that I am, but I'm seriously considering it since I'm a worthless piece of shit to people. I feel that even the littlest thing will push me over the edge.

TL;DR: I'm having visions and thoughts of suicide and I don't know what to do.
