I'm breaking downI promised a bunch of people i wouldn't kill myself, but they are 2,000 miles away and i feel so alone and empty. It just feels like the only way to end my suffering and i think about it more and more as the days go by. I need help.

EDIT: To make things worse, the one that truly mattered to me told me not to talk to her and then unfriended me on facebook...
