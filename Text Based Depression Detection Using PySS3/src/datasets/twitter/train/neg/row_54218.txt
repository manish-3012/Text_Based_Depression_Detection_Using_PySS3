I cant take it anymore. I don't know what to do and no one can helpI just wish that the beatings would end. I want to eat everyday and eat well. I want a safe place where I can be safe. I wish I had enough fiat money to have a decent life. I hate living I just want to live. Life just keeps getting worse. I'm tired of reaching out all the time and getting nothing. Life is so hard and I want a solution to my problems in it. I just want to live in peace. Its like no one on earth has suffered on my level to get it and those that have don't give to the have not's. I just cant take it anymore. I wish I got something for reaching out but nothing happens. I'm just not good enough to exist and nothing can kill me. I live in content pain fear and starvation. How do I move forward?  I'm thinking of suicide because I don't think I can.
