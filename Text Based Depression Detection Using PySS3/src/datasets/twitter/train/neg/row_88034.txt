Give me ideasI've struggled with trying to stay alive and pretending to enjoy things long enough. I don't want to inconvenience people around me anymore. Even though they say they don't want me to do it and they love me, I know they will be so much better off without me and will never remember me. I am so far from my family it will take them days to find out. 

I just want to know what I can do with regular household objects that have the lowest failure rate, and are found in a bedroom. Discreet. I don't want my flatmates to find out. I've seen good ideas on the rest of this page but I always fall short of what is needed because it is outside my room. I need to do it in the next four hours before my boyfriend wakes up. I have tried hanging before and this room does not have any ledges to tie the rope.
