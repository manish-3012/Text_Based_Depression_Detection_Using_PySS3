You.â€â€â€â€I feel I deserve nothing. How many lives has it taken for me to be here? And of that, to make something for myself? I never asked to be born.

I feel the waves of guilt crash on these lonely shores. Everything I did wrong. Everything I left behind - all I will leave behind. We matter to no one until we die, all to have that one stitch of sympathy and attention. 

I feel I stole all these lives, all this time wasted - truly giving meaning to 'potential'. 

I stare at this horizon and take my first step that will see me free or set not only me in ruin, but those I love. 

All alone. 

At this point, I have an advantage - recklessness. I don't care about my life, so I will do what needs to be done. I make time only to secure a future for those around me. One way or another, this guilt will die and my pain expire, all while giving my work to the future, if it may come to that. I will take the long route to suicide - stress, overwork, starvation. 

Please hold fast, and let's hope our paths meet. Let me hear what ails you. My eyes are those of a dead man, but my ears and heart remain tempered by hope. 

I want to help you. I'm sorry I can't do much. All of you are always on mind. 

And it hurts knowing I cannot help you more. From when Dawn breaks and night wakes, you are always in the back of my mind. Always. I wonder how your day goes, how you feel, your hobbies and interests... 

Every single one of you. Even those lives unknown. This is for us. 

For you.
