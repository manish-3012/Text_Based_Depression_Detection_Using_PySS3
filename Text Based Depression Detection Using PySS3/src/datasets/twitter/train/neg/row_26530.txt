Everyday I feel like I am getting closer and closer to deciding to end it.Everyday I feel like I am getting closer and closer to deciding to end it.

I have rampant suicidal thoughts everyday nothing enough to act on yet, or maybe it is because I don't want to leave my younger brother alone. My significant other left me after 7 years, sold our house and moved across the country. I'm drowning in debt and honestly don't see a way out. I'm in this weird head space where I know I don't want to do it, I told myself I would never put myself in a situation like this but I just can't seem to find a better solution. I'm afraid to call the hotline because I've heard they just contact the authorities to send you to a mental institution. 

Day in and day out I just lay in bed really contemplating how it will effect my brother. Him being my only family I know he will be hurt so I try and stay strong for him. I just feel like everyday there is a new reason driving me to that point and now I can't tell if I am actively looking for those reasons or if they are merely coincidence.

 I'm definitely scared because I never thought I would feel like this but I'm more scared that I'm not afraid of the outcome anymore.
