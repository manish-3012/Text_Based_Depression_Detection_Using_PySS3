I'm so overwhelmed by my life that suicide feels like the only optionMy life has been on a steady decline for what feels like forever. 

I have no family. I'm a child of the system but not the kind that was ever loved. 

I have only 2 friends and I rarely see them. I'm so lonely all the time it's unbearable. 

I hate my job. I cry before, during, and after work every day.

My grades are plummeting at university and I don't see the point in even trying any more. 

I need extensive dental work i can't afford (bulimia and former sugar addiction). I'm in pain all the time and I'm so insecure about my appearance that if I could, I would wear a mask in public. I haven't looked in a mirror for months. 

I have spinal and joint conditions that cause me constant pain and are only worsening to the point where I will likely need a wheelchair soon.

I'm broke. I've been broke my whole life. My entire pathetic paycheck goes towards renting my dismal flat and paying bills. I can't afford hobbies or socialising. I can barely afford to scrape by. 

My cats just died. He was the only thing keeping me going. 

I have an eating disorder, depression, anxiety, BPD, and PTSD relates to childhood abuse and rape. 

I've attempted 3 times before. My failure put me off trying for a long time but I think I'm ready to go again. I don't have any reason to stay.
