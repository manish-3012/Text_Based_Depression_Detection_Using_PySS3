There is a pit in my heart, and it's all my fault.I cheated on my quizzes for a university course; just the one class, everything else Iâ€™ve done on my own. I spent last week panicking internally, now Iâ€™ve just been feeling dull, unmotivated and empty. But mostly I feel absolutely sickened by myself. I canâ€™t even look at my parents in the eye and all the confidence Iâ€™ve built up is gone. I betrayed the values I stood for, told myself to not cheat again after doing it in my previous semester, and when things got overwhelming, I started doing it again. Yes, Iâ€™m afraid Iâ€™ll get caught. Yes, Iâ€™m afraid of what will happen. And yes, Iâ€™m afraid of what my family will do when they find out. The quizzes were on Canvas; I ended up watching online lectures posted on Canvas while doing them along with reading the textbook. It was the stupidest shit I ever pulled.

The fear and the guilt are killing me. I canâ€™t focus, I canâ€™t study rightâ€¦ I just want this all to end. My life is fucked, and my future is fucked. Iâ€™m a coward, a liar, and I canâ€™t fucking take this.
