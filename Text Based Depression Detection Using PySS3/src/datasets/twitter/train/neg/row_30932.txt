Here's my post about the futureNext year will be the biggest year of my life. I'm going to graduate, will have to move far away and before that pick what programme to attend at university. I'm going to move away from my abusive past and will have to make decisions which will shape my whole future. Is it right or wrong to take the decision to leave a whole family behind who have nurtured but also neglected. My whole past is unwanted and now I don't even know if I want enough to walk away from it. That past is what shaped me. In all endured shit, at least I had the shit. 

Everything new will be met on my own, not even a drunk to help me. The greatest fear I have is the fear of myself, that the work required not to become a disappointment of myself will break what strength I have left. The year 2017 is the year that will either slay or resuscitate me. It's scary and it only takes 5 minutes to never feel this way again. What's stopping me is the fear of what I'll miss. I just don't know if I'll get there or if it 's even worth it. 

Thanks for reading. I hope you have a good new year.
