Keep thinking about itI dunno, I just posted in r/depression. This is my throwaway. 

The only thing thatâ€™s stopping me right now is my daughter, but sheâ€™s so young she wouldnâ€™t know any difference.

Seems so appealing right now, more than ever before. 

Iâ€™m not a selfish person, but if I was I probably wouldnâ€™t be in this position Iâ€™ve been too kind, too too kind.
