I'm so useless and see no point of living.I'm constantly debating whether or not I should just fuckin kill myself. I use people and am such a fuckin backstabbing dumbass. I've done such horrible things and I'm only 18, some which I can't even admit to, not anything like murder or rape though. I feel like shit all fuckin day and think of death most of the time. I feel ugly as shit and have no real friends and alone most of the time. My teacher once asked me what's wrong and I told her the truth. I talked with her two weeks straight, but I felt so guilty afterwards because I wasted so much of her time. I stopped talking afterwards because which type of fuckin human being passes on pain to others and places a unessacary burden on them. I think I should just kill myself so that I can stop being such a useless pathetic human and benefit others.
