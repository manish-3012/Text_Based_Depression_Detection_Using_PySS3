I'm a shitty human and I deserve to die.Hi, I didn't know how to say what I wanted to say so I decided to write it on here. I know most of you are going to say, "No, you don't deserve to die!1!1!1!1!1!" But the thing is I do. And every single hotline and whatever I've talked to says, "Oh, you should tell someone how you feel," yeah but if I told someone I wouldn't get away will killing myself if I decided to. And now I've been going off track of what I wanted to say originally. Great. Like I said, I'm a pretty shitty person. I'm not very nice to my mom. Over anger about things she did, I've just been downright rude and disrespectful. I should get the shitty daughter award. I also struggle with anger. Sometimes I'll go on these rages and it's horrible. Like I'm not even myself when it happens. I just yell and slam doors. I know it doesn't sound bad, I don't hit anyone or anything, but it feels bad. Like I'm just thinking, 'What the hell is wrong with me?' And no, I don't think I am bipolar since I don't exhibit the common criteria. And I know I'm a burden to people. I'm too needy and annoying. I honestly hate my personality. If I could just shut up and die that'd be great. I just really hate myself. And my depression, anxiety, and eating disorder is getting too much for me handle anymore. I can't keep up with school. So that's great. Well, if you've stayed to the end of my miscellaneous rant, thank you for listening. I appreciate it. I don't know what else there is to say.
