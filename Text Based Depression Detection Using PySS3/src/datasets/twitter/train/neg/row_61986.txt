How many more straws can this camels back take?I spend every day in utter turmoil, I go to work 5 days a week working with shitty people for a shitty boss who lives to drain the wallets of old people. I've got nothing from school I can go on, and the one chance I had to make it into game design I passed up because I didn't think I'd have the drive to complete it. I've spent the past year of my relationship almost dead silent, don't think my girls even seen me not-high in almost 2 years, she's not been fucked properly in half that time (not by me anyhow, part of me just wishes she'd fuck someone else and find them better.) The truth is if I wasn't able to get high, I would kill myself. I won't touch cocaine and heroin because I'd probably like them too much.

Everyone around me is playing an act, I'm the only audience member to a play the size of the Earth, and every dumbfuck is taking humanity off a cliff and patting themselves on the back for doing it. I drift through each day with a cold, heartless stare that frightens anyone that makes eye contact with me. Rooms literally go silent as I walk in. Not that I really care, the small part of me that's still here enjoys watching the world burn around me.

A few weeks ago my father got drunk, broke down and let out all his darkest secrets to me, including murder and the fact my mum is messing around on him. They had a big argument that evening, I went down to stop it and he pulled a nice big kitchen knife on me. I've barely acknowledged him since, but around me my family is still playing out this oh-so-friendly act. I can recollect about 2 weekends from my childhood (shopping with my grandparents), everything else is blank.

I thought writing this out would help, but it's only confirmed how fucked I am and how much I just want it to end.
