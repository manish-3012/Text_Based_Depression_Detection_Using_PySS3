Anxiety is killing me... I want it to end.Its been about 6 months since I had a breakdown at uni and developed severe anxiety and panic disorder... my life changed drastically as I could no longer handle the capacity my so called extroverted self could take and had to drop many things... even staying home from university, getting extensions and almost not graduating my final year. 

I have and did seek help immediately once it happened and sought counselling.... it took a while to take effect and after a suicide attempt (after not being able to deal with the constant 3 panic attacks a day) I was sent to my doctor who put me on suicide watch and prescribed me meds...

All in all the anxiety has calmed down in regards to how many panic attacks I get but it doesnt make it any better. When I get anxious I just cant think and my emotions spiral out of control and I have to let it last for however long it does and I just don't know if I can continue anymore like this.

Its like im going crazy, my emotions tell me one thing but I know its not true but it feels so real... no matter how hard I try to logically dismiss it or take my mind of it... the pain is there ... the fear is there...

I just want to end it all, the thought of suicide keeps coming up, im just getting tired of fighting it and I cant really see how the future will be like if Im still anxious like this... I can't live like this, I just want it to end. Im waking up in the middle of night now and sometimes head out to find places to die... cause the thought just keeps coming back. 

I've tried dealing with this and still open minded to try new things but I just don't see how it'll get better if im still anxious. Im so insecure now... can't even talk to my best mate about this anymore... im broken and don't think I can endure this. Im weak.
