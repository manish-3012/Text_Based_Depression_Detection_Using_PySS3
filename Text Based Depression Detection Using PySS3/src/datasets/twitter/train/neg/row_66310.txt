There doesn't seem to be any other option left other than suicideI have been dealing with depression and OCD since my teenage years. Through the years I have taken SSRI, SNRI, NDRI, Tricyclics, and 5 ECTs. None have worked. From what it looks like, my situation will only get worse. Like 1 year ago, I could not imagine that I would be in such a terrible place that I am now, or that I could feel so shitty, and I had already tried to end my life 2 times back then. It's like, the sadness in my chest is exploding, I can't contain it anymore. I have to wrestle with the idea of suicide every morning that I wake up and every night that I go to bed. More than a decade of dealing with 'mental health professionals' has resulted in nothing but disappointment. I had to quit my last 3 jobs in the last 5 years. About 4 months ago, I had to completely give up on working since it's impossible to deal with sadness while working, hell it's impossible to get out o bed. Dealing with friends and family also has always made things worse. Whenever I show a sign of depression they can't help themselves but to call me a loser or spout something to the effect of  "why are you like this, what the fuck is wrong with you". Through the last decade I have tried everything that my idiot friend have suggested: yoga, psychedelics, working out, hiking, traveling, etc.. through all of them I feel incredibly bored, stupid, disappointed and sad. There doesn't seem to be any option left other than suicide. I just want this sadness and disappointment to end, I don't think I can take any more of this.
