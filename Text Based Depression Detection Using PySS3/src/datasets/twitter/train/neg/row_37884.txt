I donâ€™t know what else to doI donâ€™t know what else to do in my life other than give up. I got hurt 3 years ago at work and now am unable to do my old job. All Iâ€™ve know. Is manual labor. My girlfriend and I struggle every month. Almost lost our house to taxes, so I borrowed the money from my aunt and uncle, which was supposed to be paid back from a workers comp loan that for some reason was ultimately denied. Itâ€™s hard to find a job because if I take a job making less than I do on workers comp, we will be in a worse position. She says I donâ€™t care about her because I donâ€™t know what to say about the situation. I try to express my feelings about everything and Iâ€™m told Iâ€™m a cry baby. I try to do what I can for extra cash, but itâ€™s not enough.  My family wonâ€™t talk to me because of the money from my aunt and uncle.  My ex wife wants to control everything so I havenâ€™t seen my daughter in a year now.  Everyone has said what a great dad I am, but my little girl is kept from me. Iâ€™m just ready to give up.  I feel completely alone in this world, I have no one to go to.  No one to talk to.  No where to go.  No money. Even if I leave here, I canâ€™t afford to live by myself or even with a roommate Iâ€™m 36 and I shouldnâ€™t be in this position. I just think itâ€™s best if Iâ€™m not here anymore.
