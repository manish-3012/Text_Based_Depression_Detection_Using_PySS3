Not enough energy for emotions? Can someone relate?my first post here, i'm not exactly sure why i'm typing this out but heck it, maybe some of you can relate

a few months ago I used to scream and cry and cut myself. I had episodes where I really felt like i was one push away from just ending it all and that made me panic so much i would spend nearly hours screaming and hyperventilating in my bed. 

I don't why but strangely enough i miss it a lot, everything's so dull now. I just spend all day moping around and feeling nothing except tired. Often i want to cry and can feeling clogging up in my throat, but nothing comes out, like i don't even have the energy to cry half the time. I kinda wish I could scream and throw a fit and feel something like I used to

Is this a sign things are getting better or worse? I don't even know what i want anymore. I still think about suicide but it's more feeling it's vaguely coming and less thinking i'm right about to do it
