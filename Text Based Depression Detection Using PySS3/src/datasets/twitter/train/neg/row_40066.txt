(TW) And I relapsedI had been 39 days sh free but now I have cried on the bathroom floor for the past few hours and contemplating whether to live or die. I have no one in my life, no professional help as they donâ€™t see me bad enough, no family, no friends. Iâ€™m just alone, all alone. I donâ€™t belong, I do everything wrong, I canâ€™t do anything right anymore.. Iâ€™m useless and unworthy. I donâ€™t know if I have the will or the strength to stay alive
