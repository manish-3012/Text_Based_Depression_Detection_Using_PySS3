I'm not in danger tonight, but I don't know how to make a plan.I was already struggling when an event I don't know how to deal with changed everything a few weeks ago. Two days later I blacked out and in the morning I found my pistol loaded. A couple days after that I drank again and a friend said I called her at 4am saying things that really scared her, and she made me promise I'd go stay with a relative right away. I did, and I feel safe here,  but my family doesn't know whats really going on. I need to get a doctor, but I don't know what kind. I don't know what to do with my guns. I don't know if I need treatment for alcoholism or just to deal with this other problem. How do I put together a plan? What do I do next?
