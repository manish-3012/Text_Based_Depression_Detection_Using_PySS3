I need to get this off my chesti cant stop thinking about selling everything I own, and disappearing to a far away country to commit suicide in a manner where my body would be unidentifiable. 

I am 33 years old, and have been fighting a war against myself my whole life. Since May, I have been unable to fight anymore and feel like I'm just waiting for a miracle or death. I was recently put on SSRIs but I don't feel like they are doing anything. 

I can't tell if it's my depersonalization talking, but sometimes late at night I am really good at convincing myself that whatever comes after death can't be worse than what I'm living with right now. 

I just wanted to say this out loud, thank you for reading.
