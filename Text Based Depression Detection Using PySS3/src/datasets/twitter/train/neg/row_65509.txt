Is this rock bottom yetI don't remember a time in my life when I was ever happy or felt like things were going to be ok and its just begun to be to much tomorrow I lose everything ive worked my entire life for all because I fucked up 10 years of being sober I slipped up one time one fucking time and I have been in a downward spiral for the last 9 months and it feels like I hit rock bottom but I know I'm not there yet and I don't think I can handle falling any more its to hard I'm clean again but there is no way I can climb out of the hole I dug no way possible the only thing that has kept me here this long is my kids ive been a single father and the only stable person in there life but that's not the case anymore I cant find a job despite haveing 60 applications in dispute being at my last job for over 5 years and military background I'm fucking unhirable  I cant keep the bills on I can't pay the mortgage tomorrow I can't go on like this I'm so sorry daddy let you down 
Sorry for the random wall of text I just had to vent I guess
