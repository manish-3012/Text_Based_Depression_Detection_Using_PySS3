I feel so alone. (Long sorry)Ok. Iâ€™m a 28 y/o white male in the south in the us. Iâ€™ve moved several states away from my family and even further from my only sibling. 

I constantly think about ending it. Almost every day. Sometimes multiple times a day. 

I grew up in a Georgia southern baptist household where dad went to night bible college and worked a corporate flooring exec job during the day. 

Dad was suffering from severe depression and transgender issues. Later fully transitioned to female. 

During the time before and growing up in the 90â€™s with limited access to the internet it later became apparent that all of dads weird hospitalizations were due to depressive self half. Of the genitals. 

Flash forward and I realize that all the verbal and sometimes physical abuse I received were a direct result of the mental problems my former pops ha(s)d. 

To this day I still feel worthless. Empty. Lost. 

I dated a girl for collectively about 5 years. Lost it. Bc I canâ€™t keep my shit together. I canâ€™t stay sober for more than 24 hours. Off anything. 

I hate myself. I hate everything about me.
