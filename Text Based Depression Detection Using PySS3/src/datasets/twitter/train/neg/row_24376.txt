"Running" away from home at 19I always had mental health issues (depression,anxiety,OCD,insomnia). Unfortunately my parents were not very supportive on this. I have been extremely suicidal for the past 3 months (for extremely I mean seriously considering hanging myself , bought a rope and even found a good place to do it in). But depression and other problems were a thing for many years.

I am having a lot of trouble completing the second year of college due my poor attendance and inability to sleep and focus properly.

Failing this year is most likely what's gonna happen. Unfortunately I can't drop out due my parents putting pressure one me and not allowing me even to work part time once dropped out.

I plan on "running" away from home today. Can they do anything? They only partially (or very little) know my mental health problems. I did go to a psychiatrist before. Would these factors put me at "risk for myself" and the police would take me back? I plan on dying/killing myself soon but they do not know.

I tried to post this on r/LegalAdviceUK but they just removed my post (was right maybe , but still , this was legal advice). Maybe someone here knows the answer,
