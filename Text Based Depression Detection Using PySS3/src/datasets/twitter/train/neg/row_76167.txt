im a walking fucking shitstainin my 26 years of living i accomplished literally nothing

i keep lying to myself with things like youll do it tomorrow and spend all day on my phone instead of doing even the slightest bit of work

i spent the last 7 years smoking weed like it was my fucking purpose and even lost relationships over it because i chose the weed instead of the person

quitting weed showed me what a piece of shit human i really am 

i feel like ive cornered myself into this tiny space where the only escape is through a noose

i need to stop lying to myself

i dont want to become a better person

i just want it to end
