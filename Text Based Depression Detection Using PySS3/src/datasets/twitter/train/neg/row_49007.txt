Am i the only Latino who hates their own women. I personally have an extremely hard time communicating with them and tried to be friendly without angrily ignoring them and calling them racial slurs and anti-Catholicism sentiment and in return i received death threats to the point i was considering a Columbine style massacre in a roman catholic church to send them a message but i backed out at the last second to calm myself down and to think about my mental health issues but i still don't latinas and i still have trouble talking to them without verbal abuse thrown at them and lose my temper.
