Need someone to chat to about deathhhhhNot to help me or anything just someone I can generally confide in, because all the stuff Iâ€™ve posted on here about 10% of that Iâ€™ll actually talk to my mates about and even then, I still donâ€™t talk about it. 

Like they donâ€™t know the deep shit and honestly I donâ€™t want them to know so they canâ€™t even try be there for me if they wanted to. 

Itâ€™s cus Iâ€™m too fucked up and if anyone I know personally would know about this plan or how deep into it I am theyâ€™d look at me differently and depending who it is, they might even tell my parents (I have a small circle and my mates all know my family pretty well) 


So literally wanting someone I can talk about suicide &amp; depression with, without them getting worried, telling me â€˜no u donâ€™t need to dieâ€™ or â€˜awww donâ€™t say thatâ€™ or bs like that. I donâ€™t need sympathy or help just need to say whatâ€™s on my mind and actually have someone listen bc I have a lot of shit in my notes that Iâ€™ll type out instead of talking to someone..

I feel like no ones gonna read this but heyho. 

&amp; ofc Iâ€™m here to listen to anyone if they wanna rant without hearing the bullshit, generic sympathetic replies lmao 

Sorry abt the layout I bet thatâ€™s annoying af to read and with all my abbreviations cus I canâ€™t type like a normal person loool
