i have been talking 3 of my friends out of suicide for months and itâ€™s starting to drain my mental healtha couple days ago one of my friends attempted. My other friend said it looks like they tried to hang themself, which really hit me hard. I couldnâ€™t sleep because it was all i could think about. I thought i was going to loose them and they were in such a bad state that i almost started crying, and i barely cry if at all. 

And for the past couple months iâ€™ve been constantly trying to talk one of my best friends out of suicide but literally nothing seems to be helping them. Itâ€™s hopeless telling them that this sad feeling isnâ€™t going to last forever and i just want them to get better and start thinking about the effect their suicide will have on others but i canâ€™t see them coming to terms with it any time soon. 

The other friend - i just have no idea what to do. Theyâ€™re in a very similar situation as the previous friend but theyâ€™re a lot less open about it. Literally nothing i can do to help them. 

All of this suicide talk and almost loosing 2 of my close friends is really taking me down recently. Iâ€™m not suicidal and will never kill myself, but it makes me very upset for long periods of time when these things happen.
