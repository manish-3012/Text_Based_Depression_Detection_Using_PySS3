Thinking of leaving this lifeIve been forced to live with my mum and wasted my 20s. Ive been trying to leave and now Im 29 I feel hopeless. Career is fucked. Im broke. Alone. Everytime I finally can leave shit happens. All my life I jst wanted to start over abroad far away in new place. Now this covid shit happened. I should jst leave this life. So tired of feeling trapped.
