what happens when you lose your only chance to get help?a month ago, I had a plan to kill myself. I went to the local crisis center instead. the people there were kind and all, but they didn't take me seriously.

the counselor I spoke to told me he doesn't think I'm depressed and kept telling me that killing myself would be stupid because it wouldn't solve anything. which I know is technically true, but it felt so dismissive. like he thought I was stupid for feeling the way I did.

we set up a time for him to call the next day and check in, but he said he wouldn't be concerned if I didn't answer. that hurt. I felt like he didn't believe my situation was serious. that or he just didn't care.

before I left, he asked if I still wanted to kill myself. I told him yes. and he just sent me on my way.

he called the next day, and we set up a time for one last check in the following day. but no one ever called. and honestly, that hurt. I'd had a really bad night and was counting on that call. which I guess was stupid on my part. I know it was a free service and I shouldn't complain. I just feel so hurt.

it took everything I had to ask for help. I had never asked for help before. and they wouldn't help me. because I guess I'm not "sick" enough. I go to work every day and I take care of my responsibilities and that means I can't really be depressed or in crisis or deserving of help. I left the center feeling like I had taken resources away from someone who was more deserving.

I'm suffering so much and I want to die and I asked for help but it wasn't enough. that was my only option. my only chance. I don't understand what I did wrong.
