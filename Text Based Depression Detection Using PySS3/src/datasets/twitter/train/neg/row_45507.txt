Craving deathI've reached a point where i no longer only want to die i crave it. I want the blade on my skin, i want to feel the noose on my neck ot the cold barrel on my temple. I know i don't deserve to live. I can't stop myself anymore. My whole life has been just holding out one more month one more week one more day. I just keep coming to the same place the same pain.. It hurts so much why i can't keep going.  I have to. I'm just so so sorry. I hate this. I wish i could just wake up and it all be gone.
