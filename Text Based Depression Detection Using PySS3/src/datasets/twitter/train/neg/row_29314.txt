10 Reasons Why I Want to Die1. I can't really find anything I'm passionate about. Everyone else seems to have that "One thing" they love to do but...I just *don't*. Whenever people talk about having a good time doing the thing they do best I just feel empty inside. 

2. I'm so stupid. I can't even talk without something dumb slipping out.

3. I hate life. I hate driving, I hate school, I hate more people than I should, and I hate the prospect of working some 9-5 zombie job for the rest of my life. 

4. People are cruel to me. My old boss was nasty and put me down every chance she got. One of my teacher's told me I would never have a successful career. Even some of my friends use me as their personal punching bag if their having a bad day. 

5. I'm bad at things I'm supposed to be good at. I can't talk on the phone without freaking out, I can't do any sports without making a fool of myself, I can't even drive! Nothing makes me special. I feel like a dud of a human...Just screwed up from birth.

6. Everyone is better than me. I live in a crowded place, the northeastern USA to be exact, and everything around here is a freaking contest. I swear every online job application has a 200 person waiting list. Don't apply online? That's the only way to do it nowadays. Besides, I'm introverted and slow, so why would anyone hire me when they could hire a outgoing, smart, ambitious person? The northeastern USA has a surplus of those! 

7. My dog is getting old and he'll die soon. I'd rather not stick around for that. Why do dogs have to die? 

8. I'm bored. Nothing peaks my interest and I feel like a blob. 

9. I can't sleep. Unless I take a sleeping pill and it actually works, it's another sleepless night full of tears for me! FREAKING YIPEE. 

10. I'm miserable. I just want the pain to go away.
