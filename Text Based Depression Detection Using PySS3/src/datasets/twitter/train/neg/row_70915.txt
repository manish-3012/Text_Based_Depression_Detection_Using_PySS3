This might be my final sorryI am hurting everyone who tries to help. Abigale, Haylee,and Diego. Abby, you have helped me through this please live life to the fullest. I have hurt you and i cannot live like this. Haylee,you always took my knife when i tried to end it. I guess you couldn't take them all.Diego, you always made sure i took care of myself. I guess you can rest now. You took me in when i was all alone. You gave me something to live for. Life is just too much. Abby you said there is always a reason to live. You just haven't met them yet.I have, they just don't realize that they are the last reason i live. I am just going to say it. You are the best friend i could have had. You are my reason for life. You cared about me. You gave me new life. This is my farewell. Love you. Goodbye.
