IdkI donâ€™t want to be here anymore, I have so many problems in my life and they will never go away. I have no energy or motivation to do anything. I hate myself but have no desire to put in the work to change my situation. I tried to end my life 9/27 of this year and failed so now I owe the hospital/psych facility $2,000+ for â€œsavingâ€ me when I didnâ€™t want saved. I have no friends, my family doesnâ€™t accept me bc Iâ€™m trans, I have no confidence and no self-worth and I have no hope left. Things never change no matter how hard I try. My family doesnâ€™t get it. They tell me Iâ€™m wrong and sinful for being who I am. I give so much to other people just to get nothing back from them. I want to die so bad but I donâ€™t want to hurt my family. Which is ironic Bc I shouldnâ€™t fucking care if they get hurt since they hurt me all the time. All I want is to be accepted and loved and I want someone to think that Iâ€™m worthy of good things. I want to have a person. Someone that I can be myself around and not be afraid. And Iâ€™m scared to die Bc if I die now Iâ€™m going to be forever a boy (barely started on my transition) and I donâ€™t want to be remembered that way. But at the same time I canâ€™t hold on any longer. Idk.
