Is this normal for you?As a foreign student lived life to the max, partied every other night, travelled, had huge circle

Fucked my attendance got kicked out of university visa expired got kicked out of country 

Cought girlfriend having sex with someone else

Lost touch with friends, local friends wont connect 

Got a shitty underpaid job, for past 6 months my routine hasn't changed 

I have started to feel like robot having no one to talk life 

Realised I am so alone when not a single person wished me on my birthday

At times i would cry for hours and fall asleep, feeling better afterwards

I feel I have no reason to be alive wish i never existed
