I'm supposed to be the strong one.I need someone to hear me. 

I'm not suicidal. I want to die, but I won't ever take steps to make it happen. I'm trying to find a way to express to you why I feel it's appropriate for me to post this in SuicideWatch, and I find that I'm at a complete loss for words. I find myself wanting to apologize for posting here, except that no place else seemed to fit. I really, really need someone to hear me.

I'm assumed to be the strong person in pretty much every relationship I have. I'm the one who copes. I'm hurting in a way I have never hurt before, and I need someone to listen to me. I can't lean on my real life people right now, because they all need me. I'm not looking for advice or even a sympathetic response. I need someone to let me *not* be strong.

Is anyone willing to hear me? To let me lean?

(It probably goes without saying, but this is not my main account. I'm trying not to apologize for that too.)
