A Broken Heart And Attempted SuicideTrigger Warning: This post deals with mental illness, suicide (obviously) and self harm. 

I (18 Non Binary) recently found out that my ex and now close friend (17 F) is dating one of my other close friends. Me and my ex broke up about a year and a half ago and I've still had feelings for her ever since, even though I didn't tell anyone till recently. So it hit me pretty hard when I found it out. I ended up parting ways with her because I needed some space to try and heal and get over this situation. It didn't end on hurt feelings or anything, it was clear that I was doing this for my well being, not because of any ill will towards her. But it's only gotten worse and I'm stuck in a never ending depressive spiral. I've had a history of mental illness and suicidal thoughts, but never to this extent. I last attempted four days ago and I've been harming myself for a while. It hurts. It hurts a lot. But I don't really know what to do. It's gotten to a point where I'm considering admitting myself to a ward because I am a risk to myself with the amount of harm I've brought to me. And, to top it off, I feel guilty because no one is really at fault here. She can't help the way she feels but neither can I. I'm sure this isn't the only reason I'm so unstable currently, it just appears to be the trigger. I guess I don't know what to ask apart from what can I do? Is there anything I can do? I want nothing more to be able to feel better so I just hope some helpful input can be given &lt;3

TL;DR - My ex and close friend is dating my other close friend and now I'm incredibly mentally unstable. Is there anything I can do to try and improve my well being?
