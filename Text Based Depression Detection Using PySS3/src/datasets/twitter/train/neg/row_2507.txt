I HATE myselfThere's nobody else in the world that I actually hate, except myself. There are people I don't like and people whose actions and beliefs disgust me, but I don't hate them. Yet I hate myself with a burning passion, like my chest is on fire and I want to destroy myself because I deserve it.

I want to die because being alive hurts, but also because don't think I should exist. I'm stupid and horrible and inherently worthless and I can never change that
