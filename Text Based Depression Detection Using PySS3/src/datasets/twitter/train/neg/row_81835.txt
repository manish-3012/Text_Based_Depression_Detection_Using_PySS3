Just straight up sadI have a great family, good friends and good grades in high school. My junior year i met this girl that changed my life and took me to my peak in life. things went downhill and we broke up. 7 months later things have only got worse and i legitimately do not feel happy at all. iâ€™m sad all the time and really the only reason iâ€™m still here is because i know how many people is hurt if i did. i donâ€™t know what to do
