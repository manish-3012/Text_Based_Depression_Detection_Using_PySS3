It's been a long time comingI've been depressed on and off for years and for a while I was happy but this past year has just ruined me. 

&amp;#x200B;

My ex left and was going to be friends with me, but now isn't talking to me. I don't have a lot of friends because most of my old friends were female and she was jealous of them and I stopped hanging out with them as often.

&amp;#x200B;

I've messed up both my work and my apprenticeship by being depressed. I can't do anything but lay in bed crying, I can't eat or go to the store anymore, the most I can do is take my dog out for a few minutes. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel as though no one will ever truly love me because I'm trans and no matter how many surgeries I get I will still be worthless and not good enough for anyone. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's not my exe's fault even though the break up is a large piece of my motivation, it's just one of those things where enough things added on top of each other that I finally have lost all hope.

I've ordered a helium tank to do the deed. I'm waiting on it's arrival. I'd like to have a nice last day, but have been so down lately I think I'll just do it when it gets here without any send off or anything. Hopefully, it gets here before the weekend.
