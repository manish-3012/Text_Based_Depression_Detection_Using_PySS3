i am just sick of lifemost things i do to make a day pass are boring and simply make me angry even to the point i hurt myself , and the fact im always feeling sick isnt helping either

why shouldnt i just end it , it would be so much easier and i know there wont be another way to be painfree anyway , im still debating right now but im pretty sure ill do it either next year or within the next few years
