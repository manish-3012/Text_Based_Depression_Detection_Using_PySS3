I tried to kill myself 5 days agoI'm allergic to a common over the counter medicine.

I filmed a video saying goodbye, popped the pills and called a suicide hotline so I could speak to someone while I waited for the reaction to take place.

I changed my mind. Drove to the hospital and got treated.

Still not quite sure what to make of it all. I feel numb and it's like I'm living on borrowed time.

None of my friends have seen me since my attempt. Yeah I got a couple messages the day after asking if I was ok. I arranged to meet one of them and they cancelled on me on the day.

Idk man.

The hospital phoned my GP and told them about my attempt so they've gone and booked an appointment for me tomorrow.

A big part of me wants them to prescribe me diazepam or something that'd be easy to OD on.
