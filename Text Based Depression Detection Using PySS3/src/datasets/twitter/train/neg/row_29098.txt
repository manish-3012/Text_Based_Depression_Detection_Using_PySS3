I donâ€™t know what to doOne of the few things keeping me alive is my cat. I feel guilty at the thought of me dying and sheâ€™s left alone for an undetermined amount of time. I live by myself. I donâ€™t have any family here or friends that would come check up on my place. Maybe my work would check up on me if I went missing. I also would feel guilty about leaving all my things behind. My apartment is disgustingly messy. I canâ€™t even motivate myself to clean it. I am afraid do die though. Iâ€™m afraid of the unknown. But Iâ€™m just tired of feeling like a loser. Iâ€™ve had depression since I was about 5. I can distinctly remember myself changing. I have had some great times in my life though. I am able to be happy for only short periods of time though. Why would someone want to live if for most of their life they want to die? I feel grateful for all my blessings and know I should be happy because I have a good job, home, food, water etc. But I always get so far down that I end up feeling worthless. I donâ€™t know what to do. I hate therapy. Itâ€™s been good sometimes. But itâ€™s more a hassle to go I feel like. I hate the trial and error of finding a good therapist. I hate the trial and error of meds. I have no motivation to work out, cook, clean, or shower often. Iâ€™ve been skipping activities I once enjoyed. I have vaguely told some friends that Iâ€™m going through a depression. But I hate hearing myself complain about my feelings when Iâ€™ve done it so many times before. I promised myself I wouldnâ€™t become suicidal again. But I failed. What should I do?
