I want to goApologise for the over dramatic title, but put simply, I want to go. I don't have a tragic backstory or anything but for the longest time I've known that I don't belong in this 'realm'. I'm just counting down the days until I'm gone. I know its selfish and all the rest, and that they won't understand why I wanted to do it. But I know its gonna happen. It's all I think about.
