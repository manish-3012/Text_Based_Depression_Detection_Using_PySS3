I am not suicidal, but I don't want to live.The love of my life ended things with me a few weeks ago. It wasn't a hostile break-up; we still love each other. Long story short, she wants to see if there is anyone else out there. Wants to live her life, and whatever. We're still good friends, and she wants me in her life as her friend. I want to be a part of her life.

Seperately, my parents have no confidence in me as an adult. Ever since I was little, my Dad berated me when I failed, and I just took it to mean I wasn't going to make it, and so far, I've just proved them right.

I dont feel suicidal, but I want to die. Like, I really want to. I don't have the courage to do it myself, never will, but I seriously don't see a reason to get up in the morning. My parents have no faith in me, and think lowly of me. My confidant, my best friend, my partner, my love doesn't want me. I feel so barren. like I'm just a shell of a person. I can't even get into conversations right. sentences arent forming, i stumble over simple tasks. I'm nauseous half the time. 
No one shows interest in me in the areas I need them to. Someone thinks I'm funny? Great. No one wants what I want to give. 
If I were to have a heart attack, or get in a car accident, I wouldn't bother to call anyone.

as I type this, I'm feeling dizzy and far away. 

EDIT: Thanks everyone. Your words all helped, and I'm going to get some help. I had a good night tonight, and that's a first for awhile, so I'm gonna try to remain positive.
