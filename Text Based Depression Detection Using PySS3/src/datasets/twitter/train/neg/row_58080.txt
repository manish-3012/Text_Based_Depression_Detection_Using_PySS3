I think I'm about to snapMy perspective of what I believe in has changed significantly, and I'm so depressed. I'm an INTJ, I don't know if this MBTI thing is bullshit or not, but I think it perfectly describes me. 

Was a devout-borderline Christian fanatics, now it's easy for me to say that I'm an atheist, I don't believe in god or whatever deities out there. Was largely influenced by my parents believe, they are what I would call ultra-conservative, no-sadness, always-positive Christian family model.  
My father is pushover, timid and anti-social, but my mother is a chaotic, guilt-tripping, manipulative, emotionally unstable woman. They are so co-dependent with one another.

Was physically, mentally and sexually abused by my two older brothers when I was a kid, and sexually abused by my mother's brother too. This what I believe caused most of my adult mental problems. I don't trust people, twisted sexual behavior, and lack social skills. 
 
I always tell myself that it's just my past, if I keep on dwelling on that, I would never be able to move forward. But the urge to end my life is just getting stronger, I don't even want to kill myself, but the voice.. it keeps coming back. I'm afraid that I going to snap anytime soon. 

I have so many things ahead of me, I have plan for life, I have stuffs that I love to do. 
On the other hand, I'm not afraid of dying, I see no point in life, everything will die in the end, me and my life are worth less than a speck of dust. 

I started as nothing, and I will end as nothing, why bother?
