I want motivation.I want to live, but I can't find the reason.
I don't have money, future is not so bright. Cuz I'm an mediocre artist and don't even have a job.
I want to move out. My family HATES me so hard. I have no friends at all. I was always alone and will be.
I'm broke.. I want to work hard and live but I just don't see any advantage of me being alive.
