Need Advice on Invasive ThoughtsSorry, not sure if this is the right subreddit for this but I need some advice. I went through some pretty serious depression about three years ago and was addicted to cutting for a bit, but it eventually got better and I've felt fine for a long time. However recently things have been going downhill for me; I'm more stressed out than ever and feel awful. I can feel the depression coming back and I denied it for a bit but now I can't stop thinking about cutting. I haven't hurt myself in years and I don't want to start again. I'm having more and more invasive thoughts. Please, if you have any advice on how to distract myself from this or get rid of these thoughts I'd really appreciate it. Thanks.
