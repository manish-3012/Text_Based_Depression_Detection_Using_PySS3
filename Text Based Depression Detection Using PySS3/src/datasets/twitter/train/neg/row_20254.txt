I've been saying this for so long that I don't think anyone takes me seriously anymore but I really don't think I can last much longerUltimately there are no solutions to my problems, so I either do this or accept a shitty life for another 50+ years and that really is not worth it. Not everybody understands that but sometimes you just have to weigh your options and decide if a lonely, meaningless life is worth living. Some people might say it is, but I don't think so.



I always say Iife is a scale, with the good on one side and the bad on the other. At this point, at only 21 years old, I already have so much on the bad side that I'll never be able to recover. No matter what the bad will already always outweigh the good. Unless the rest of my life is absolutely PERFECT and every dream I've ever had comes true then the net effect will still be that my life is bad.
