I hate seeing disabled peopleThose with mental and physical impairments. Not to say that I think they are lesser or broken or something to that extent. But they obviously struggle with some sort of issue that complicates their life. Seeing them brings me discomfort, not for any vain reason, but because I am healthy. I am physically and mentally (maybe) fine. However, I want to die. For months, maybe years I have wished desperately for my life to end. I take everything for granted, I am spoiled, selfish, and disgusting. And when I see someone who is disabled, I feel guilty. What would they do to be like me? Again, not to insinuate that they are worse, but it would be easier for them to be like me. I feel like shit. There are so many who just want to be healthy, to be average. But here I am, wishing the worst upon myself.
