I have nothing left to giveI'm tired of trying, all I want is to be happy. That's all I want. One day where I wake up and I'm not in agony, one day where I don't have to take all of my pain meds, one day where I have the energy to get through the day.

I just have nothing left to give, I don't have the energy or the mental capacity to keep going anymore. I'm just don't know how much longer I can keep going, I'm running on empty in every sense. I can't even take it day by day, it's hour by hour. Always trying to ignore the noise in my head, always trying to put on a front and look happy. I'm tired of it all now.

I'm just done.
