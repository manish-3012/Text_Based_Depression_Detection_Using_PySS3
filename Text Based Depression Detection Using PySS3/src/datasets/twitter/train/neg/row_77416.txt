I'm a 28 year old English man.Last night I met two beautiful German girls who she English and they literally said the words "we love English guys" to me while batting their eyelids but to no one's surprise I woke up alone and didn't make any effort to even kiss them. And now all I wanna do is kill myself. I really fucked up. Also I punched the screen of my new laptop and broke it for some reason.
