Just came back from the hospital. I now fucking hate doctors.Just came back from the hospital after a failed suicide attempt (drug overdose). And luckily i've managed to get out of it without any complications. But let me tell you, the first thing that happend was the doctors coming smiling and saying "hey how are you?" and "what happend?" Only for 1 hour later they announcing they would be taking me to a Psychiatric hospital

I've always tought that what i've seen in movies and series about hospitald and  Psychiatric hospitals and being forced agaisn't your will inside one was too much drama, but it's all fucking real, everything. They treat you like human garbage, like if you had no control over your actions and put you on a puritan rotine that makes school look like a trip to Disneyland.

And on the bright side, when you get out, you will be mostly cured of depression, not because their methods worked, but because you will be so full of hatred on your heart that you will want to come back and fucking murder the nurses and doctors alongside the entire trash of this system. None of these people understand suicidal people and depression, absolutely no one. Only someone who had live trought this stuff can actually understand it, most hospitals and mental instituitions want to label you as crazy and just find a way to fit you inside what the capitalism society deems as "normal".
