I donâ€™t see the problemIâ€™m not trying to encourage donâ€™t get me wrong, but I just donâ€™t understand why people find suicide so bad. If I have a gene in my body that makes me feel this way would it not be better to off myself rather than have offspring get it and have the same issue? So I guess from my point of view thereâ€™s no reason not to do it.
