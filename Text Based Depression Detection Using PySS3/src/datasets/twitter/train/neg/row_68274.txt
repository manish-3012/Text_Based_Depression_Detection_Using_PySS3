Suicide by Hypothermia + PillsWould this be a good method? I live where it gets to about 12-16 degrees fahrenheit at night, I was thinking the most peaceful way to go out would be take a ton of pills to knock myself out for a few days while being out in the woods where nobody can find me. FYI Iâ€™m not looking for any "life is worth living, don't give up" advice. My circumstance is subjective to the point where there is no helping it. Thank you in advance.
