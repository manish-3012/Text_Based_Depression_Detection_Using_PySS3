What do you do when the last person who cares is gone?If I disappeared tomorrow, no one would miss me.  That is not an exaggeration.  No friends, little family.  If I died, no one would notice until I began to stink up the place or missed rent for half a year.

This realization hurts me physically and takes my breath away.
