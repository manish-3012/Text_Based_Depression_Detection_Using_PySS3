Destroying all of my memoriesI'm 26 years old. I have kept all my notebooks, letters, tickets from museums and events I went to ever since high school. 
I've just destroyed them all and threw them away, I just want to erase my life.
Honestly it feels like the ultimate cleaning session before ending it all. I have big events to look forward too but I only feel pressure and anxiety. I feel trapped.
