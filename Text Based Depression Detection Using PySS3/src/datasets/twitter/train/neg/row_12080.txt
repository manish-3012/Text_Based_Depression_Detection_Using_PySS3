What makes it wrong?I don't have any first hand experience with suicide, so I was wondering if you could help me out. 

I don't frequent this sub, but each time I poke my head in there's at least a thread proclaiming that *they* care, and how bad suicide is for everyone around you, to the point that it can *ruin entire lives*. 

This got me wondering, what makes suicide so effectual? What makes it worse than, say, dying in a car crash? 

Why is it taken so personally? Why does it shake people's worlds so hard?
