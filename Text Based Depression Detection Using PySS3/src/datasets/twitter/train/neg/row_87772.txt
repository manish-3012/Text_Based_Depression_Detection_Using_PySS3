All of my passions are dead. I have nothing to strive for or work toward.Iâ€™m 19. I donâ€™t know what the hell Iâ€™m supposed to do with the rest of my life. I donâ€™t want to do anything. With work comes exhaustion and entrapment, with not working comes boredom and isolation. There is no version of life that I can come up with that doesnâ€™t sound totally miserable.

I donâ€™t have any passions anymore, theyâ€™re all dead. I just stay at home every day and do nothing because Iâ€™m too pathetic and miserable to make changes for the better. No will. No energy. I have nothing to offer this world, and at the same time, this world has nothing to offer me.

Iâ€™m sorry Mum and Dad, but these next couple of months will be my last. I turn 20 before the end of July, but I donâ€™t want to turn 20. Iâ€™d prefer to go out at 19.
