Just look at how many insane asinine hateful bickering conversations go on on a daily basis over nothing on redditNo one cares if you are alive; people care far more about whether they are right about some asinine fucking video game mechanic than your life. It is absolutely absurd to think otherwise in the face of all evidence despite the lame comments from the sycophants that only care about "feeling like they helped someone today" that come here as if they "care" about the cries for help posted and offer some lame hackneyed response like "please dont kill yourself I saw a flower today and that was just one more reason to realize how much life is there for you and how god exists" xD j
