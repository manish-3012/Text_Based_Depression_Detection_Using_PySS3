Is suicide wrong if I just don't think life is worth the effort?I've recently realized that I'll never have the life I want. Realistically my life is just going to be: work, sleep, repeating with eating &amp; hygiene in between, all so I can barely afford to stay alive. I don't want that. There is absolutely zero appeal in that, yet that's my only option, I'm not smart/driven/lucky enough to get a job making a shit ton of cash, so I'm just going to end up poor like my parents. I just don't think life is worth working for, seems like a lot of effort required for minimal return. What am I meant to do in this situation?
