I just unloaded a life time of trauma onto my online friend of 2 years.Iâ€™ve been a really shitty fucking person. Iâ€™ve been rude for no reason other then to put others down and make them feel worse than me because Iâ€™m a loser who has self esteem and worth issues. One of my friends called me out on my shitty behavior today and Iâ€™m glad they did so I can grow but I still went ahead and unloaded all my shit onto them. I feel so fucking worthless all the time because Iâ€™m constantly degraded by the people who are supposed to care about me. Now my own friends think Iâ€™m shitty and I promise to grow for them and I want to so bad but I just want to fucking end it all. Iâ€™m so tired of feeling worthless and Iâ€™m better off dead. Unloading all that trauma shouldâ€™ve been good because I finally got it out but now I think my own friend hates me. And I did it so fucking unprompted. Iâ€™m so fucking stupid they didnâ€™t want to hear all of that and Iâ€™m crying now and I canâ€™t stop and I really just want to die. Itâ€™s almost 1:30am for me but I could just leave my room and take a walk and never go back. Thereâ€™s a park with a creek near my house. A small shaky bridge over it. I think iâ€™ll jump. Iâ€™d break my promise of growing as a person though. I donâ€™t want to do that. I promise my friend Iâ€™ll try to be a better person and I canâ€™t do that when iâ€™m dead. But Iâ€™m so tired
