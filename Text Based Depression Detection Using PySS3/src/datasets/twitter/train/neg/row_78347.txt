I'm tired of breaking down and I wish I could forget the past three yearsI've yet to go a day without mentally breaking down. The feeling of tiredness is so familiar to me and yet I can't sleep. I wish I was brave enough to end it already. It's been three months of endless tears and suffering.

I'm going through a breakup with a guy who I thought I would be with for the rest of my life. I don't know why I care for him so much because he's emotionally cheated on me with his ex and still talks to her to this day even when we were dating. 

He's done nothing but insult me calling me manipulative, controlling, and cold whenever I talk about anything that I was uncomfortable with him doing. Its sad but I believe it. I still care about him and have feelings for him even though he's hurt me so much. I don't understand what's wrong with me.

I wish I could forget him and maybe I wouldn't think about killing myself everyday because I feel worthless. I'm not good enough for a scumbag like him how would I be good enough for anyone. I don't believe what people tell me anymore because I just feel like they say it because it'll fix me and they don't mean it.

I'm also a coward. I'm too scared to do it so I just fall asleep to the thoughts of drowning myself or hanging myself.
