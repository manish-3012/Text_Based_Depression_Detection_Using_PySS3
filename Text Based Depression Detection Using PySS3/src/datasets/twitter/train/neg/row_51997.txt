I'm ready to end it.I think I've been enough of a burden to my family to continue to live any further than now. I am a disappointment, a failure...in all aspects. I'll never graduate and get that degree. I'll never make my parents proud. I'll never have true friends. I'll never be happy...so what's the point, right? The way I see it, my future is nothing but a blur of wishful thinking that will never really happen. I've made my parents suffer enough. I hope they find happiness after they've moved on.
