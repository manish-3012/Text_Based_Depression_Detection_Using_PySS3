I just broke up with my Girlfriend and I want to live?I'm back, if you don't remember, I posted on here about a month ago because I just needed to post something and let it out.

Ive done a lot of contemplating and I broke up with my girlfriend 10 minutes ago because I realized my mental state and what I'm going through is not healthy. A week ago I said I was gonna work on myself and be better but I haven't gotten the chance because of all this happening around me.

My mental state at the moment is crowded and even my physical movements are being overtaken my depression. When we broke up, I started to feel a sence of hope, like I did the right step. A step into a greater chapter in my life that can be better than what is right now.

Still, this is still a lot to bare for me. But I don't wanna die, I actually wanna live for once because I realize I need to work on myself and power through what I need to do to get better.

Thanks for all of the support, I appreciate you guys!
