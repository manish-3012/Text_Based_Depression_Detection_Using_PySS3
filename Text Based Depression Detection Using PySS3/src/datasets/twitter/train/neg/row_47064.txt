Last bastion of hope crumbles.. What to do when your Rock stabs you in the back..I've been hosed over my everyone. You name it. Lovers, friends, family members... And I mean hosed over HARD. Like, "I know what I did, and I know I can never look you in the face" kind of stuff.

I always thought I could count on my parents though..
I had recently accepted a promotion at work, but wanted to explore other career opportunities.

My Mom offered to take me into her home again, and I agreed after two years of putting up the fight, but realized it'd be a good time for me to save some money so I could buy a condo/townhome, rather than the shitty apartment living I've been enduring for years and years.

I had asked her specifically the day after we solidified the plan.. "I just don't want to live in the house if the Grandparents are going to be there", to which she replied, "No, no. We're getting them the apartment like we talked about". Which we had.

She changed her mind without me. And at my Birthday dinner, my Dad says to me "Well, they're going to move in with us, so maybe you can take the basement..".

I had lived in a basement previously for $500/month.. 

I feel like no matter how hard I try to make my life better, I'm set back. I don't understand the point in even trying. Part of me wants to just pack up some clothes and food and just drive to Alaska and find a town to live in, and not tell anyone where I went or why I left. Just bolt. I've never been closer to this option in my life as I have been tonight.. 

My job is just a means to money. My family has pushed me to my breaking point. To the point where I have nothing. I need out.
