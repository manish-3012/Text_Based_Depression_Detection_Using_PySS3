i donâ€™tdonâ€™t know where to start-

past few years been shit... seriously contemplated suicide a lot. graduated high school a year later than my peers, barely crawled through but somehow???? managed to get decent enough results to get into college. when that happened i was thinking: am i supposed to feel like my lifeâ€™s opened up in front of me? and for a while it did seem a little better, because iâ€™d been so used to feeling like i really was going to be stuck in the same spot forever. whether i live or die never going to college or becoming anything, bla bla. but now college is starting soon. iâ€™ve been participating in lots of social shit and meeting new people... and iâ€™m a different person around every different group of people, weaving and unweaving my picture non stop just to get people to see me, to like me. when in reality iâ€™m nothing. so small, so shaky, so fucked up and broken. and i think, beneath it all, i still want to die. iâ€™m at the mercy of everything else, just being flung around, and for the first time in a while i donâ€™t think i want to be here anymore. itâ€™s all empty.
