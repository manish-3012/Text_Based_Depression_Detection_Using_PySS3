When the time comes for you to go, how do you plan on doing it?The two ways Iâ€™ve considered both involve going somewhere secluded because I donâ€™t want to hurt more people than I have to. Idea one is to lay down and simply stab myself in the throat with a massive kitchen knife but Iâ€™m not sure if that would even work.

Idea two is get a duvet sheet, cover it in an accelerant like gas, cover myself in it, get inside the duvet, do the buttons up so I canâ€™t get out. Then Iâ€™ll call 999 for the fire brigade so it doesnâ€™t get out of control and hopefully Iâ€™ll be dead before they get there.

Whatâ€™s your method?
