curse this survival instinctExplain why we have such a stupid thing?

I'm so ready to die. Pills are in my pocket. They almost killed me once (friend found me) and they will kill again. This time double the dose, and the family is gone on vacation. I too, will be taking a vacation if I can overcome this Survival Instinct....
