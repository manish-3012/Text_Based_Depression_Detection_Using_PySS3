Stages of DepressionBeen putting some thought into how I ended up where I am. I think it goes something like this:

1) "I've been having a rough time lately"

2) "I'm really struggling"

3) "I'm hanging on by a thread"

4) "I give up"

5) "I should die but it's scary"

6) "Death is scary but I really need to do it"

7) "I nearly did it but I freaked at the last second"

8a) ???

8b) "Why didn't it work?"

Currently sitting at a 7. I have a few people that love and care about me, but honestly I hate myself so much it doesn't matter. I can barely function and leave my apartment. I do everything I can to dissociate from myself. Envy is eating me alive. I don't understand why we can't just pop everyone into their own personal heaven and live happily ever after. Aside from god possibly losing his personal porn dimension and not getting to take pleasure in our pain and suffering.

Just throwing a few thoughts out into the void. Hopefully someone can relate to my pain.
