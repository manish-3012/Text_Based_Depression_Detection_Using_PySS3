I'm nothing but a burden to my loving fiance.My fiance is the most loving person in the whole world. He goes out of his way to make me feel loved. He asked me to move in with him after a previous suicide attempt and he took care of me when I was diagnosed with schizophrenia (schizophrenia is another reason I want to die) 

I'm just a huge burden on  him. I get disability but he makes most of the income. He even paid thousands of dollars to get me a car and go to school. 

I know, it seems like I have a perfect life with someone so supportive, but after all this money and time he has spent, I feel like a burden and I can't shake it. If I were gone, he wouldn't have to stress about finances. He wouldn't have to deal with my schizophrenia. He wouldn't have to deal with my harsh words when I'm upset. 

He want to get a plane soon but that money was wasted on me. I feel like he's in the sunk cost fallacy, you know, "already in deep enough might as well keep going" I doubt he would have even looked at me if he had known what would happen.

I recognize that this would devastate him, which is the only think preventing me from the next step. The only thing is though, I can't get it out of my head that it's no worse than being a burden. 

How do I live with myself?
