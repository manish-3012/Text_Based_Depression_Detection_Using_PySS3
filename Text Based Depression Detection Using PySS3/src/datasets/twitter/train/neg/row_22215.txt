I'm not ok.I get really upset when I'm stressed out, and normally I just need someone to talk to.

I want to reach out, but I don't know how. The people I want to talk to are already busy, and I can't see how to get their attention without looking like... I dunno. Someone not holding it together.

I just need a friend to listen.
