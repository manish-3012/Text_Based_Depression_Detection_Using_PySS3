Why livei have no reason to live, i just have reasons not to die. I don't want my parents to be struck with grief, i don't want them to pay for a funeral but i just don't know what else to do. I've tried getting help but it just doesn't help. I'm thinking of doing it tomorrow when i get paid so i can transfer all my money to my parents before i leave.
