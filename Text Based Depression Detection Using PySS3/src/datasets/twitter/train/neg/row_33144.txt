I've written my goodbye notes incase I choose to goI can't take it anymore tbh everyday is worse than the one before i had a period of time I was happy not too long ago where things was looking up after feeling like absolute shit and now I'm in this shit again I feel alone even though I've got people to talk to, I feel misunderstood, I feel like i don't belong anywhere and I feel that not existing is preferable to existing I hate my life I'm more or less a failure can't even keep up I school even though I have the grades to get in I can't focus and my thoughts are scattered but somehow always come back to "why don't I just end it all everything is meaningless" so what I guess the point of this is fuck life fuck it all and fuck myself
