I don't want to see the rest of this yearSo much shit has happened within the *first month*, that and on top of other personal issues honestly brought me here. I'm afraid of looking forward to anything, I don't want to go through this year anymore I'm afraid that it'll get worse. Almost everybody fear mongering definitely doesn't help but I can't just ignore everything around me. It's frustrating when the world is falling apart and you can't do anything about it despite living on it, it's like your house being destroyed beyond your control and I don't want to live like that any longer.

I'm kinda sorta planning on ending it on friday maybe? Perfectly fitting since it's the end of January.
