When to go?If you were 40 and
had totally fucked up your life
had 22K in cc debt (due to hard luck)
were afraid of bankruptcy because it fucks you over/screws your dating options
had only 4K you could take out of retirement 
werenâ€™t making very much money
have trouble living like a pauper because just having little extras here and there are all you have to keep you going 
were having a hard time finding a new job
hated the field you were in
had no partner or even a successful date
had become distant with family to where you could not share anything with them
lived in chronic physical pain
had no success with over a dozen antidepressants 
had no success with half a dozen therapists 
feel overwhelmed with the process of finding therapists that take insurance 
feel scared of what those anti-dâ€™Ã  are doing to you long term
had no success with non pharma treatments 
struggled with your weight
had no one you could tell it all to
had experienced the psych ward and were traumatized emotionally and financially by it- and thus will never ever return to be retraumatized (which would happen if you told people youâ€™re checking out soon)
were tortured with unrequited love
had all this going on to where you cry every day and can barely get out of bed
had been dumped by anyone you ever loved romantically 
had all of your creative endeavors fail
cannot be loved for who you are given the above 
I think I covered it all....

Would you still be like, â€œNOOO LIVE it out!!â€ 

Or would there be a â€œyeah, Iâ€™d get itâ€, and a case for checking out to  be free and clear of that mess? 

Iâ€™m aware of but-think-of-the-others. Iâ€™m also aware that people make choices best for them that hurt others unintentionally all the time- I myself have been hurt by others doing what they need to do. Cannot hold it against them. Im also aware that the others are all in good, stable life circumstances, and have strong support networks to lean on where they can share it all...so itâ€™s either one person living out the above and carrying all the pain as a martyr to spare the pain of others, or the individual getting to finally be free and the others then share the pain between them. 

Thoughts? PM if what you have to say isnâ€™t sanctioned.
