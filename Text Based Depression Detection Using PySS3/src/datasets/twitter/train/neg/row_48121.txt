I am cursed and I want to die to prevent the inevitable.I was born into an abusive family. I have autism spectrum disorder which makes me weird and terrible at interacting with people. I'm terrible at the sciences and life in general. Yet I decided to go into psychology because I'm very interested in the subject, it's the only thing I'm good at, and on some level I want to help people. But I can barely interact with people or relate with many of them. I can be a straight-A student but I'll probably be crap at the job of a psychologist or therapist. 

If the meaning of life is to help people (which I believe it is), then I have nothing left to live for. I can barely help myself. I can't confidentally say I could talk anyone out of suicide because I think of dying every day.
