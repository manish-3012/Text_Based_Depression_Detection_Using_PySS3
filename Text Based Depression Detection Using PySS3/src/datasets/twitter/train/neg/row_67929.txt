No one would come to my funeral anywayYou ever get the idea in your head that you  legitimately wouldn't be missed by anyone you currently know? I've been actively suicidal for about a week now and that feeling gets stronger and stronger with every fight, misunderstanding, squabble, or any other time I feel like I get in the way of those around me.  It makes it so, so incredibly tempting to just fucking do it, because I have nothing to live for, especially without friends (I have no family.)
