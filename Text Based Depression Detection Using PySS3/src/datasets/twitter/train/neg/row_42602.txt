Suicidal because I feel hopeless I can get better and don't know what to do.I feel so depressed today, and to be happy does not feel in my control. I have no friends and no self esteem. All of the suggestions people give to counter depression, I don't think would work, its like no matter what ill feel this way. I walked my dog, listened to music, went in the woods, had some food and none of that helped. I am having a lot of suicidal thoughts again, just because it seems hopeless. Something is wrong with me, I am not like regular humans anymore. Normal people don't wish to die, they fear death and are glad to be alive, they have goals and dreams. Problems in life are just obstacles to overcome, but for me, any problem is just a reason that I'd rather not exist.

Nothing seems worth it, I feel I can never love myself, never have connections with others, never have success. I am really hopeless, I don't believe in government, medications, I don't know what to do or if there is anything I can do. Meds will ruin me, doing nothing will ruin me, therapy is either too expensive or too useless and either way my beliefs/thinking is too ingrained, I am weak and don't have the power to do it on my own, so I really don't know. Honestly, I feel tired and I don't feel like working tomorrow and even just that makes me prefer death, how weak does that make me.

If I really am hopeless, then why drag things out and slowly let it get worse and worse, when I could end it sooner?
