Been thinking about killing myself a lot lately.Iâ€™ve never really thought about how I would do it, but whenever I think about the potential of killing myself, it always seems like things would be much easier that way. 

I know life isnâ€™t about whatâ€™s easy, but I feel like Iâ€™m going nowhere. All my friends are becoming real adults, with real jobs, and girlfriends who will become wives, and Iâ€™m just alone. 

This sound stupid. I feel stupid for typing it out. But it makes me feel better to say it.
