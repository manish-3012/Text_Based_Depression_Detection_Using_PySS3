The SAT wants to make me kill myselfOver the last 2 months I have tried so hard to study but I just can do well and my parents have given up on me and I just donâ€™t know if I can do it much longer. When your parents give up on you... your own family what do you have to live for. I just donâ€™t know if I can take the pain of them shouting at me everyday saying they have given up and theirs nothing else they can do. How many times they have told me I have fucked up and their just sad at how bad I have done
