Done!Playing that good playlist Iâ€™ve put together across years for this moment, sent over the last of my money to my family, walked around campus one last time before it shuts downâ€”and presumably, find my things and mail them back months from now.
This time, Iâ€™m doing it for those that love me. It will seem like everything but that, but if they truly know theyâ€™ll understand why. Iâ€™ve made it far enough. 

The prospect of oblivion is so coming. Even if it itself is not it, Iâ€™ve lived to need this moment.
