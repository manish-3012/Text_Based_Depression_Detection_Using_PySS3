Farewell !!22 , A dead boy from the valley of despair . broken dreams . tears . outcasts . lowlifes .

i dont see any hope . any light . i am angry . frustrated and anxious all at the same time . haha , i see my death already . i feel so low. i hate myself . 

why it is like taht ? why am i with toxic friendss? what kind of test is this . why am i being so weak like this . why cant i say fuck off and be strong . why do i depend upon friends who dont even care . why am i crying all day . why even everything is good i am not satisfied . why ?

&amp;#x200B;

i dont want to quit . but sometimes i feel so alone . hopeless . and dead . i wish i was happy and fresh .somewhere aling the line i was in the path of tronado . and it got me totally.

how can i change ? ppl dont care . close friends wont show up, ppl hate . i hate myself. i dont think i can get a job . learn something and all
