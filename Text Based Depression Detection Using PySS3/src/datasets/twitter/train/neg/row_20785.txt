Hey guys:&lt;um...dont worry, I'm not gonna kill myself(although the only reason being cuz I'm too lazy to get a gun) I'm just wondering, why do you people care so much about other peoples lives?
they have no relation to you, if you never typed the text in the the url box, you wouldn't even know about these people. so why do you try so hard to save them?
