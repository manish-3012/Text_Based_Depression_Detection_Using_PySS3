Whatâ€™s the pointMy cats and younger brother are the only things keeping me alive right now. It sounds stupid, but before I go to bed, I tell myself I need to make it through another day so I can feed them. I also know my little brother would be heartbroken if I killed myself. 

Life is exhausting and I just want it to end. Will I ever feel better? I canâ€™t remember the last time I went a full day without wishing I was dead.
