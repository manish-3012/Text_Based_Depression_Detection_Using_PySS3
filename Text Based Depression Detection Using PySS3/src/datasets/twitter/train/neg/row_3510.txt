I have ruined my life, wasted the time &amp; resources of people who cared for me.. I need to dieI don't necessarily want to die, but there is no other option left for me. I have wasted enough of my familys time and resources, and I think that it is time to acknowledge that I will never be anything and to just end everything. I am 28 years old, so this is not a conclusion I have arrived to because of teenage angst. It is simply too late for me.


I have seen the true nature of this world and it is not for me.


I pray for courage, although I am not sure anyone hears my prayers. I am very afraid of dying. I am not sure why, but I keep creating scenarios in my mind where I am cast to eternal suffering (hell), although the thought of non-existence equally frightens me. Dying should be the most natural thing in this world, but for some reason I can't get over the fear of unknown.
