April 1st is the day I kill myselfWeâ€™re 82 days into 2020 and while I shouldâ€™ve been had a job and I shouldâ€™ve been solved any misunderstandings I had with the girl of my dreams; and I shouldâ€™ve been made some network connections to help achieve my dreams, Iâ€™ve accomplished nothing so far. I wonâ€™t be able to anytime soon thanks to the coronavirus. So Iâ€™ve set my suicide date on April 1st. If nothing gets better within the next 10 dayâ€™s Iâ€™m killing myself. I wonâ€™t settle for less and I wonâ€™t allow myself to suffer anymore. Unless things get better by April 1st itâ€™s over
