Why keep trying ?So I moved to Canada last year sep and after struggling a lot I got a job starting Jan 2020 which was great but then the job was too fast paced for me so it was very stressful.  after getting high blood pressure a few times I decided to quit after 3 months in March. Since then I have been looking a job but due to covid there aren't any. I decided to learn data analysis and it's going ok so far I guess. But since the past few days I have been thinking why keep trying to do this and that. I have a fiance whom I love but honestly she be better off without me. My family would be sad but I have been outside my home for the past 12 years so they ll probably forget it after a few days.
I used to like so many things but I don't like to do anything now. So what's the point of doing all this ? Why should I keep living ?
