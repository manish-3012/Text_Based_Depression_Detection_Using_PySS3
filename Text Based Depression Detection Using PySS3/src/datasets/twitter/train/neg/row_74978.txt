I can't take this anymore. I'm from the UK. Can i call someoneI'm incredibly lonely. I don't see a way out anymore. A lot of my online friends are either suicidal too and can't talk or dropping me because i am.

I have the means to kill myself and I'm considering it. I don't know i just don't think i can be alone right now.

I promise despite how bad I'm coming across I'm not a bad guy. I'm very respectful and if you feel uncomfortable you can hang up. If you give me any rules or guidelines I'll follow them.
