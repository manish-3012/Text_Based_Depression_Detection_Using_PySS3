Graduating high school only makes me want to kill myself moreI got to be in public school for a month, I built such a nice life in that month, it wasnâ€™t much but I was finally socializing again and now its gone. I know what I want to do in life but this is the second time my social life has been ripped from me. I donâ€™t think I was ever really meant to meet people or have friends.

After being in quarantine, being isolated again I donâ€™t know how Iâ€™m gonna recover if I ever will. Everything just seems so broken and no matter what Iâ€™ve done it doesnâ€™t fix it.

Despite having some friends in that month I doubt they were real friends, by the time I showed up they all established close bonds and I felt like an outsider the whole time. Really that just sums up my life in general, an outsider looking in to a life he wants to have but is unable to get it.

With graduation I lost that chance I had to live a normal high school life, thereâ€™s so much I wanted to experience that I just wonâ€™t be able to now and will likely never will. Why would anyone spend their time with a freak like me.

The only reason I havenâ€™t offed myself is because Iâ€™m too weak/ am afraid of burning in hell for eternity if I do.

All this is awful, I donâ€™t want to be here rn
