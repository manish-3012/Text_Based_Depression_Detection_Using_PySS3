â€œPermanent solution to a temporary problemâ€œ lieIâ€™ve been dealing with depression for 30 years. I have manageable slumps every now and then, and then a really bad crash every 18 months or so. 

The bad crashes as individual events may be temporary, but the depression is not. The knowledge that once I get out of this mess Iâ€™ll be fine for a while before I end up back down the bottom again, thatâ€™s permanent. 

Every time it hits, I get a little closer to being too tired to fight.
