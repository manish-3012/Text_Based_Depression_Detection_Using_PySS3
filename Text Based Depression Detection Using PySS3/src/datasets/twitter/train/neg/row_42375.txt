100 xans and alcoholWhy is it so hard to kill yourself. Ive had 3 attempts now. 18 years old. Shit never gets better. Chronic pain, anxiety plus depression. It seems like im shit even at killing myself. Took around 100 xans and half bottle o vodka. Woke up in the hospital 3 days later. Had the flu for a week straight. 

What now huh? Im still suicidal. Still wish i was dead.
