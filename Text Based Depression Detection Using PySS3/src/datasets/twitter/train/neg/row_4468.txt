I feel the sameI feel the same as you. The only thing is, I'm not as successful. I have been searching that dream Career all my life. To the point, it's probably too late for me now. I suffer from chronic pain and although I continue working...I really feel like I can't and I'm making myself worse. I lost so many in the past couple of years. Some to violent deaths and others to unexplainable yet peaceful deaths. I sometimes feel jealous of the the ones I lost to peaceful deaths. They no longer have to suffer, stress, wonder...hurt . I want so bad to be happy. I have a large beautiful family that doesn't respect me much. They make me feel so hurt and aweful within. I try to communicate this to them bit they just don't get it. My spouse...is verbally abusive and controlling. It's been nine years. He just came home from doing a two year bid and. Seems so angry. I thought him coming home was going to complete me and make me happy...whole. instead, I feel a big hole in me. I fight angry, anxiety, depression every single day. I look at myself looking for what I am doing wrong but I don't seem to find it. I've tried different tactics and feel hopeless at this point. I wish God would come sit next to me and give me guidance. I believe in God with all i have which is why I haven't given up despite really wanting to. I need help
