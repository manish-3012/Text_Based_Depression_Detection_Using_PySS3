iâ€™m so tired.I told a lot of people i love them tonight. I just want to kill myself. I have friends and people in my life but thatâ€™s not enough. I am so tired of living. I want to stop being in my brain and i donâ€™t know how to just keep going. The only thing that keeps me alive is drugs but the comedown from uppers are even worse. I donâ€™t know how to stop being so tired. I want to die and finally be asleep.
