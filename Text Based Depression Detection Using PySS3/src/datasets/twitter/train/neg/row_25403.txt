I lost my father to suicideOn Sunday 8th December, I found my father in the shed, a cable around his neck, dead. Heâ€™d hung himself.
Iâ€™m one of the luckiest girls in the world, not only did I get to meet my father, but he was truly my best friend. I know that not everyone gets that in life, there are some who beg their fathers for a relationship only to be ignored. So I guess in a way Iâ€™m grateful. 
He knew me in a way that no one else ever will. He just understood me, always knew precisely what I was feeling without me having to tell him a thing.
When I was 11, I first purposely hurt myself. This escalated rather rapidly. My dad knew without even having to see a mark. He took me to the doctors. They tried to help. When I was 13, I tried to take my own life by drinking bleach. Luckily I was saved. When I was 14, I tried again by overdose. I was rushed to hospital. It transpired that the counselling, the medication, just wasnâ€™t enough. I was sectioned for two months. My father was the only one who ever came to visit me in hospital, the rest of my family just couldnâ€™t face me. 
I last hurt myself when I was 15, Iâ€™m now 18 and can honestly say I no longer have these thoughts. But if it wasnâ€™t for my dad I know itâ€™d be a different story. He helped me on a whole different level. 
I canâ€™t help but feel like Iâ€™m to blame for my fathers death. He knew when I was down, without any communication. How didnâ€™t I realise with him? I know I couldâ€™ve helped him, if only Iâ€™d have known. 
He left no note, no will, literally nothing. 
I hate to think of my father having those evil thoughts in his head, seeing no way out. He was always there to help not only me, but everyone else. When really it was he who needed help the most. It makes me sick at the thought of it. 
I know his death will be so hard to come to terms with, itâ€™s not something that can be understood the way a disease or physical illness can be. 
Any advice would be really appreciated.
