What should I do...Lately I've been feeling more and more hopeless, my mind is constantly drifting off to mistakes i've made in the past and I can't seem to think of a positive future. I don't have any faith in my abilities anymore and am becoming increasingly useless. I feel absolutely hopeless. I feel like a waste of space, potential, and money. I don't want to see a psychologist, I simply don't see what they could possibly do for me - and I've only seen anti-depressants hurt people I know. Increasingly, I am consumed with suicidal thoughts because I don't know what else to do. My existence feels utterly useless. I've always tried to help myself, developing my own philosophies to continue living happily, the best that I can. But it's getting harder, my periods of happiness are becoming shorter. I'm losing touch with myself and I'm terrified. I'm terrified writing this, I never thought it'd come to anything like this. It's not fair for me to feel like this; it's not fair on the people who have lived through harsh and cruel lives.  I don't want to feel this way anymore, I really want to be happy, I really want to cure myself!
