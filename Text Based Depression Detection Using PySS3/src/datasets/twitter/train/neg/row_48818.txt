Running out of ideas. Death by starvation/dehydration?And I havent drank anything all day and havent eaten for almost 48 hours so far.

How long should it take to die and will it be painful? I hope to die by the 10th Feb 

Note: I am going to end up on the streets and dying this way anyway since I have financial issues.
