Life got me f**ked.We broke up.  


yet he said let's be friends, and still said he loves me a lot.  


It's my fault, my mental issues are dragging everyone down.  


Some kid told me to kill myself, and that I'm worthless, blocked them they came back on 3 other accounts.  


I'm tired.  


I gave love another go, yet I'm stuck here back with one string holding me back.  
So thing so fragile, one push and I'll be de-tangled.  
I'll be dead, either way.  
All of you be safe, take care, you matter, it's hard to believe it but you're amazing!
