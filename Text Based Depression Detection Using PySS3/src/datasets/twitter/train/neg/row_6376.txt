It would destroy my family if I committed suicide... but I feel I canâ€™t go on... basically living for them. :(Eating disorder, depression, psychosis, failure, socially awkward... ugh.
I have the most loving family. But I am alone and I need to have my own life and purpose as well, but I donâ€™t like anything. Iâ€™m so messed up, lonely, negative, lost. Everyday I get out of bed for my parents just so they donâ€™t worry. Itâ€™s getting harder and harder to fake it.
