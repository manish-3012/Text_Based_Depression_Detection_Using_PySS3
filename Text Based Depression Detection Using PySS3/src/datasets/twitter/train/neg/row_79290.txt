Iâ€™m so tired of living.Iâ€™ve never posted anything on Reddit before, but I feel like this may be the only place I can talk about this with people who understand. 

I am so tired of living. It feels like every second of every day is mentally and physically exhausting. Compared to most people, my life is not that bad. Iâ€™m 25 years old and still live with my dad, but Iâ€™m healthy, I have a full time job, and a few really good friends. Yet I am still miserable. On the surface, I seem to be very happy. But my few friends and some family know that I struggle with depression/anxiety, but I have only talked to one person about ever being suicidal. I know that I can talk to my friends about anything, but I always feel like a burden when I do. Like everyone will be in a good mood, so I donâ€™t feel like I can really share these dark feelings/urges with them without ruining whatever good time theyâ€™re currently having. I am tired of always pretending everything is fine, just to avoid bringing anyone else down with me. I donâ€™t want to be here anymore. My life feels meaningless, and the only thing that has kept me from ending it is the thought of my friends and family having to deal with my death. Thatâ€™s a really shitty motivation to keep living. I have friends, but no SO. Iâ€™ve been single for around 5 years and I desperately crave intimacy. I donâ€™t mean sex, I want someone to even just give me a hug sometime. Iâ€™m so lonely and tired of everything. It feels like everyone in my life would be better off if I were no longer here to burden them. Iâ€™ve had a really awful week, and itâ€™s made everything in my head sort of spiral out of control. I really just needed to get all of this off my chest, hopefully to someone who will listen and understand how I feel. Maybe then I wonâ€™t feel so helpless and alone.
