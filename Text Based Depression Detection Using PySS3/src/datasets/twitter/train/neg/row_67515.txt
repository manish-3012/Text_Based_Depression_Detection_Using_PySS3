Itâ€˜s so depressing to know that youâ€˜ll die in the future because you will take your own lifeHello.
I just wanted to post my thoughts. Iâ€˜m 18 and i live in germany. I got diagnosed with depression and a personality disorder. Iâ€˜m in therapy but i donâ€˜t feel any better. I seeked help because i donâ€˜t want to live like this. Iâ€˜m crying every night because life is so painful to me. My mom died because of suicide too. She was a great mother. She got money and seemed happy. My dad abused her, cheated on her and took is away from our mom. At this point i didnâ€˜t knew that life is going to be awful. My Dad tried to control my life and abused me. He was very violent. One day he kicked me out with 17 years because of my sexuality. I lived at my Friends house for a month or so. And then i had to go into the childrens shelter, where i tried to take my life by suffocating with a plasticbag but i stopped because i started to cry because i Donâ€˜t want to hurt my brothers,my boyfriend and my aunt. After 3 Months i moved to my aunt. I was absolutely emotionally destroyed. Of course my aunt has stricter rules than my dad because she knows how life is. But iâ€˜m not used to it. iâ€˜m Already trying so hard to improve (especially for myself) but i canâ€˜t. Iâ€˜m a looser. My Grades are bad, because iâ€˜m so depressed everytime. I canâ€˜t cope with life. I have a lot of xanax in my pocket for an emergency. I know that iâ€˜ll be in a state of trance and depression someday thatâ€˜ll make me commit suicide. These Xanax pills hopefully will stop me from doing that. Itâ€˜s so depressing that my life will be over in the near future.

Idk if people will see this, but i had to write my feelings down and share them.
