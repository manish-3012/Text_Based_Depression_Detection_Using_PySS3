IN A TIGHT SPOTSo I am currently on the run from the police, for something that caught up on me from last year.. 
Only just got out of prison about 7 weeks ago..
I'm an active meth user, and I'm in a really bad place..
Ive got my shit together considering the circumstances, I still have money, my own place (well 2 different places, both on each side of the country), I don't have to work. But fuck its just so lonely and depressing. My family has basically disowned me due to my choices, which I don't blame them for, my friends I made are mostly jobless broke drug addicts, so I don't see then anymore. I seriously feel I'm running out of options that are worth pursuing, and I miss the life I had before I walked in to this one. I want i t back so bad, but its just no longer an option.. 
Ive seriously considered suicide for about a month now, ive even got items in my room to get the job done. 
Ive backed myself in to a corner and I can't break out. 
I refuse to go back to prison, even though its my own fault that its happened. 
Basically my two options right now are:
1. Hand myself in and go to prison,
Or;
2.commit suicide.
I'll tell you now, suicide is a much more pleasurable option..
This isn't a cry for attention, I just find comfort opening  up to strangers who don't know me personally for some reason, not like I have any family/friends to confide in anyway.
Anyway thanks for reading, I appreciate it.
I may not be here in 4 days time..
