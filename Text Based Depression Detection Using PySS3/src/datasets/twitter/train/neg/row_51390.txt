It doesnt get betterIt doesnt get better, im 19 and ive felt worthless and shit since i was about 13 had suicidal thoughts since i was like 16 ive just never had the balls to do anything and i was clinging onto it gets better until last saturday but like everything else in life im shit at suicide. I actually thought it gets better when i went to a festival in june met some amazing people and an amazing girl she is perfect i fell for her when i first saw her. Ive literally got nothing going for me in life but for the first time in my life i grew a pair of balls and spoke to her she said she liked me and we made plans to meet and for the first time i can remember i was genuinely happy. unfortunately for me though because im a complete retard i fuck up everything good that happens to me and now she's never going to speak to me again and neither are the people i met at the festival because they were friends with her. And now im back to having nothing to live for just waiting for the day i snap so i can finally end it i just dont want to feel pain i just want to sleep and never wake up. I have a free house for 11 days and a week off work next week so who knows maybe it will be then
