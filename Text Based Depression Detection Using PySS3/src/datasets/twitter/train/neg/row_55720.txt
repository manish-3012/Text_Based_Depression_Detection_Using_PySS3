I look like I get hurt on purposeI was playing a card game with my parents and my sister and my dad accidentally smacked his hand onto mine and broke a bit of my nail. Without even saying sorry, he just said to me: â€œSpoon!â€ (Since we were playing a game called Spoons.) I just tried to hold in my tears as I continued playing. I lost and I was laughed at. Like everyone forgot that part of my nail was bruised. I donâ€™t wanna suicide because I have some really good friends but what is it worth living for if Iâ€™m just a walking joke? Please help me.

I donâ€™t wanna die
