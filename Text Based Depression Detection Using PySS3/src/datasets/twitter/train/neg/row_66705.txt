It's odd. Right now I'm tired and tired of living, but not actively suicidal.Rejected, constantly picked on by people younger than me, over stressed. I'd do it if it weren't for my friends and family. I keep getting visions of me doing something detrimental. People know I've self-harmed and have seen me do it blatantly.

I'm told to always tell people but at this point I'd like to deal with things alone again. My depressive attitude basically got publicised and that's the worst thing. If I ever feel happy I look at everyone else feeling dejected while I know that eventually I'll be toxic again or will fall back into depression, I always do.
