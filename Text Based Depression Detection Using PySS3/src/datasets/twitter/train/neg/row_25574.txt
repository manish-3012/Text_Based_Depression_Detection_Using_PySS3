I just want to disappearI had a horrible day. Didn't eat the entire day, felt really tired, just thought about killing myself, unconsciously cutting myself and at the end of the day the only person I thought could listen to me got mad and left.

Life isn't enjoyable. I don't want to live anymore, but I'm not brave enough to kill myself. I can't do anything. I hate myself. I wish I was never born or that I could just disappear.
