I'm chipper about suicide.I find it interesting how so many people on this subreddit are going through so much mental anguish with their approach to suicide, and I'm over here just pleased as punch that I have a light at the end of the tunnel to look forward to. I'm not attempting to demean anyone, I wish I gave a shit about my life enough to have any significant pain when looking into the concept of suicide.

I've grown up hearing the phrase "You don't want suicide, you want an end to the problem." And I mean, yeah for the vast majority of people struggling with ideation, that's probably the case, but here I am like "Nah, I just really want to be euthanised." Does anyone else have this view? Does it ruin your relationships with other people like it does to me? Is there any short term hope for us in the time that we have left on this world?
