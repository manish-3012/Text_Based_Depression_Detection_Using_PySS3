I feel as though the only way my pain will be understood by the people I want to understand me most is to kill myself.I long to be understood, and I don't think I ever will be. I am hurting the person that I want to love the best, but I can't stop doing it.

I am sorry if this is pitiful or if it seems like I am asking for attention; I don't want to belittle this community.
