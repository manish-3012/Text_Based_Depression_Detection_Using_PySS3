i want to die but i also donâ€™t want toso much pain and traumatic events have happened to
me in the past year and in my mind i am constantly comparing myself to others. i just feel useless and like my time has come. iâ€™m never happy or satisfied, i just donâ€™t wanna exist anymore. i hate myself and the person i have become but i donâ€™t want to die. everyday feels like i shouldnâ€™t be here anymore. i just want to be happy but it doesnâ€™t look like an option for me .
