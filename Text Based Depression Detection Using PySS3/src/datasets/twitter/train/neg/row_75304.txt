hell, i just wanna take a damn break.....i dont look both ways when I cross the street anymore. I honestly wouldn't mind getting decked by a car if it meant i could take the rest of the semester off. 



I have been having some headaches that have been really worrisome, possibly something wrong w my brain rather than just regular old migraines. And my first thought was "oh, goodie. if a ct scan comes up positive for a brain aneurysm or tumor i can totally get a medical leave for this semester.



lately it's been less "i want to kill myself" and more "i desperately need a break so i DONT kill myself."



I purposely only took 12 units this semester to go easy on myself. And you know what? I'm still drowning. I feel like ive been stranded in the middle of the ocean during the tide, desperately trying to stay afloat. and now the tides dying down but i'm struggling even more due to pure exhaustion. 



I don't wanna die rn. But I can't fucking do uni anymore, I dessperately need a semester off. 1. that's all im asking. cause im drowning and i need to lie on the sand to get cpr cause i cant do this anymore and im getting pushed closer and closer to the edge cause i cant handle the fucking stress anymore but theres no way out unless i make a way out and if i die in the process then at least i wont be fucking crumbling anymore
