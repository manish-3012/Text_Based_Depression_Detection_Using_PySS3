I donâ€™t want to, but I think about it a lotHey everyone, 

So idk how to go about this but I think about ending it everyday. I canâ€™t be alone because I start to hate myself. I try to do school work but the effort is gone. I go on social media to distract myself from my thoughts butâ€™s itâ€™s almost inevitable to think about them before bed. I donâ€™t think I will go through with it, but I feel like itâ€™s getting worse and worse as I just sit in my room, and I just donâ€™t want it to get too far. Iâ€™ve tried talking to my parents about it but they blew it off only because they donâ€™t want me on pills if needed. I also talked to my doctor about looking into anxiety or depression but he didnâ€™t want to because the pills. I understand, but Iâ€™m tired of feeling sick all the time and why live when you can just you know, not exist.

Im at a university and thought about looking into their counselors they provide, but I feel like I canâ€™t share anything with anyone because Iâ€™ll receive the same neglect. Iâ€™m really tired.

Can anyone please recommend some methods or practices that help remove these thoughts. What steps can I take to help myself?

Thank you
