Don't know what to doLife is difficult.. it always was but this past few years has gone steeply down hill. From the time my mother died for years back, it is not getting better I don't know how much can I take anymore, I really wish it to end. I don't want to kill myself but it seems like the only way out I cannot take this anymore
I think it gets worse cause I have no one to talk to.
