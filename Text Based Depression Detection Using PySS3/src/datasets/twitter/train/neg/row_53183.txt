Friend threatens suicide over showing up in courtI have a friend who says they'd rather commit suicide than show up in court (don't want to give too many details). What can I say to console them/encourage them go appear in court? As the court date gets closer my friend appears more and more manic/stressed, but won't take their meds or see professional help.
