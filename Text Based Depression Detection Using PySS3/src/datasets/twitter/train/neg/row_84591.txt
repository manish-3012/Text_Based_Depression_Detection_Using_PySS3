I want to die but Iâ€™m scaredHi,

Iâ€™m a 24 year old female who has completely ruined her life within the last 6 months. Iâ€™ve gone from a straight A student in medical school with a loving family, boyfriend, great friend group, active lifestyle, and amazing dog to nothing. During the past 6 months I broke up with my boyfriend due to long distance which triggered a chain reaction of arguing with family members and a large depressive episode while quarantining with my family that I had daily arguments with. I ended up losing 30 pounds which lead to massive hair loss and a terrible self image. I became a 90lb â€œadultâ€ woman with bald patches who can barely muster the energy to shower. I havenâ€™t seen the sun in months because I donâ€™t even want to get out of bed. I am currently failing out of medical school due to my depression. Iâ€™ve accumulated so much debt with school I cry every time I think about not finishing. Iâ€™m losing my friends in the process because Iâ€™m literally so sad to be in a group without crying. I canâ€™t even properly take care of my dog. I donâ€™t get the point in living like this anymore and every day I wake up Iâ€™m truly upset I didnâ€™t die in my sleep. I want to end this all so badly. I tried therapy. I tried talking to others. I tried. Iâ€™m tired and Iâ€™m done. The only thing that is preventing me from ending it is that Iâ€™m too chicken to pull the trigger. Iâ€™ve written my note and even practiced laying in the tub with cold vs. hot water if I want to slit my wrists. I used to cut so I know I can do it itâ€™s just a matter of time and that final push.
