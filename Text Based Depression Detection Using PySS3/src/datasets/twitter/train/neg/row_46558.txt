I am finally going to do it.Suicidal thoughts have been in my head for more than 5 years now, and from what I can recall I haven't been left by them for more than 4 days in a row. Tonight, I am going to finally stop being a coward, like I have been about everything in my life, and I am finally going to end it by mixing alcohol and every single pill I find in the house.

In this post, which will be left visible on my screen, I am informing every single hypocrite piece of shit that helped led to my current state to NOT come to my funeral, especially my mother, who won't care too much and who will find someone else or something else to lay her sadistic behavior on. 

I would like to mention that I don't want a priest on my funeral, since the church has been corrupt since the 3rd century.

I wish a much more worse and painful life than mine to anyone who will pretend to have liked me, did good to me or similar after I am gone (the thing that this sentence implies that it would feel like I have existed in some point of time makes me chuckle)

My life could have never had a purpose, I am making this decision  in full consciousness, I will only use the alcohol to give me courage.

Goodbye, but I really wasn't here for a long time, taking into account how detached I feel from anyone, my body and my environment.

I am posting this from a throwaway because otherwise, in the rare occurrence of my survival, society will make my life even more unbearable.

Don't worry about me, I have done evil things in my past and I am not the kind of person anybody would miss.
