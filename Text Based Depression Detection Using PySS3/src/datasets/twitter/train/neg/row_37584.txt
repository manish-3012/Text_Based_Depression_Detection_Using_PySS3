Itâ€™s getting into my nervesWhenever I go to my apartment roof, I feel like to jump from there, my mind constantly keeps telling me to jump from the roof, It feels shit. I harmed myself, it felt good but I eventually stopped harming myself as it didnâ€™t help me. Almost every night, I feel miserable, I dream dark and bad things. I just canâ€™t take it anymore, Iâ€™m loosing my patience with time, Iâ€™m exhausted expecting something good and positive in my life. With time I feel more depressed and when Iâ€™m feeling a little good, something is there to end this little happiness. I donâ€™t know what to do, Iâ€™m hopeless right now. I have been thinking about doing it, but Iâ€™m scared about the life after death
