I am disassociating further and further from the worldI look in the mirror and I don't understand what I see. Is that really me? 

I am passing through life. I don't feel anything. Everything goes through me. Numb numb numb 

Can't study, can't write

I did cry today which felt good but I need to do stuff

Tomorrow I will go to the library and try to do something with my life ðŸ’œplease let me go to the library.
