6 months no self harm, although I tried suicide 2 weeks agoOne of my friends has been telling me all day that she has been wanting to kill herself and has been asking me for painless methods. From our txts it sounds like she is serious about it and I'm really worried that I won't see her again. All this anxiety has me cutting again, the problem is that I think she is dead and all I want to do is be in heaven to greet her as she enters.
I am a nursing student and have a basic understanding on where to cut, how to miss the tendons and hit the arteries. I have cut myself a lot tonight and each time I have been too scared to cut in the right place. Does anyone have any tips for psyching yourself up to cut fatally.
