feeling betterfor the past few days i have been felling better or more like hopeful that i am willing to stick with it no matter what happens. I decided that even if i lose everything that i am not gonna lose hope. No matter how many people look at me differently or ignore me or even tease me that i am not gonna lose faith and i know that one day everything will change for the better towards my direction. I decided to wait for that one happy day. Even if I fail classes i decided to re-take them and i decide to apply for more job. the only people that matter to me is my mom, grandma and my loving bf (who lives miles away from but still our love story started 10 years ago with ups and down) some part of me says everything will work out and that i have to wait for it sometimes longer than others.
