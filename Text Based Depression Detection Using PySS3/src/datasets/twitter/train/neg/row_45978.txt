Something is wrong with me. Hello again. I had posted a few days ago I believe? Well, it was about me slowly normalizing the idea of suicide in my own mind. Recently however, I have noticed that I am speaking less. And when I do speak, I can't make full sentences. It is almost as if I get very winded as a speak, and I need to drink a lot of water. It has been three days since the break up, and I feel as if I am moving on.

 Yet, I still miss her? Of course, as time is going by I have noticed that there was a bunch of red flags in the relationship. One of which was a good amount of double standards. I do not want to soil her name and say what issues I see now that I did not before. However, I still feel empty. The idea of ending my own life feels almost like a happy idea. There are other issues going on in my life, which are causing me to feel this way.

 I just want to know if this is normal for someone to feel this way? I took my grandpa's old revolver and pulled the trigger. Of course, it was not loaded. But, I did not even hesitate in doing so. No voice in my head told me to stop. It was just there, and before I knew it; or even realized the gun was on the side of my head with the trigger pulled. 

What is worse about this was the I was, and am, disappointed that it did not work. I even considered looking for bullets to load the gun with. I did not.
