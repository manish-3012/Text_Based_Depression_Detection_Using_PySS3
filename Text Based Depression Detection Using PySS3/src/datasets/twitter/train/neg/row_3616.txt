Looking for a redditor who replied to SW months ago...I replied to a comment in SW a long time ago, hinting at my own despair in not knowing what to do with my life. A poster replied saying that he had connections in getting english teaching jobs in china.

Well, I'm finally gotten myself out of a emotional hole enough to give that path a shot, but I am unable to find the post, or any contact info. I hope that person sees this and replies.

Thanks.
