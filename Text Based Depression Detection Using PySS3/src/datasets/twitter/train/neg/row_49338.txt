It's finally time. Lengthy post.It seems I'm leaving on Monday, not Tuesday like I initially thought. My name is Kong and I turned 20 on the 5th of may. I live in Sacramento, California. I never thought this day would actually come to pass so soon but looks like we're finallly here. I want all of you who've taken your time to read my posts to know that I'm grateful for all your support and not to worry as I am happy and content with my choice. I was lucky enough to make a friend on this sub Reddit. I haven't had a friend in 3-4 years now I think so it was really nice talking to her and if you happen to see this post, don't blame yourself. This was a long time coming, no one could've helped me. Continue to smile and stay strong and always remember to never ignore a person who loves you, cares for you, and misses you because one day you might wake up from your sleep and realize that you've lost the moon while counting the stars. I truly believe that we don't know what kind of people we truly are until the moments before our deaths. People either change or they die before they do. It's always one or the other. Thanks everyone for everything but I'm checking out early. See y'all later.
