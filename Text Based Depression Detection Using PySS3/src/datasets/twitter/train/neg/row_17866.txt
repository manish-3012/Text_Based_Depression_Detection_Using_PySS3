Please read if you have a moment.I donâ€™t want to reveal my age, but you should know that Iâ€™m a minor.  Iâ€™ve made an awful mistake over and over.  I never meant to send those photos of myself.  In every moment I thought that I wouldnâ€™t regret it, only to have it haunt me every single day.  I didnâ€™t know what I was doing and wasnâ€™t ready to be doing it.  Iâ€™m afraid of telling people of the mistakes Iâ€™ve made in fear of being persecuted or criminally charged for photos and words I wish I could take back every day.  I hate this.  I hate myself.  Iâ€™m an awful person for the things Iâ€™ve done.  They were all adults, I was just a kid, not that it matters.
