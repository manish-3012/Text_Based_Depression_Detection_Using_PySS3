This is the only place I can talk about thisUsing a throwaway account because I need to get this off of my chest but Iâ€™m scared of speaking out fully as people I know irl know my reddit account. 


For the last five years Iâ€™ve been slowly growing more and more sad and upset with life due to my own stupid mistakes. 

I have a loving family and sure we donâ€™t always get along but I love them all to pieces.

The stupid mistakes I made haunt me to this day, no one knows about them besides me and the people involved, and that kills me. I have so many passions I want to pursue, like my singing or my art however Iâ€™m terrified that if my face gets out there one day Iâ€™ll wake up to hear everyone I love knows what I did. 

I was so so fucking stupid and if I could go back I would have stopped myself. It was only five years ago I found out what I did shouldnâ€™t have happened, that I should have never done it and since then itâ€™s been creeping up on me and eating away at me. 

I canâ€™t tell anyone about it who I care about and if I went to see a doctor and looked for help, Iâ€™d be scared someone would find out, Iâ€™m scared Iâ€™d break down, Iâ€™m scared Iâ€™d lose my place in college.

Iâ€™ve thought about killing myself so many times, I even tired not taking my crohns and colitis medication for a while, hoping this illness would kill me slowly, but kill me none the less, but my mother soon found the full pill boxes and injections. 

It feels like a huge weight is being dropped on my head. I wasnâ€™t forced to do what I did, I was a stupid child who didnâ€™t know what they were getting into or how bad what they were doing was. I was naive and now itâ€™ll haunt me for the rest of my life, however long thatâ€™ll be anyways. 

Thank you for reading this strangers of Reddit.

This is the first and only time Iâ€™ll ever get to say these words.
