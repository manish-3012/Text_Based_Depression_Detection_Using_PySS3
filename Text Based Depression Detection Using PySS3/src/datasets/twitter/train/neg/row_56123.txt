â€œMaybe, but maybe notâ€Where to begin? I suppose that I can say that Iâ€™m 21 M in the US. Iâ€™m probably just a regular person like you people â€” attending university and doing surprisingly well. But it doesnâ€™t drive me and it surely doesnâ€™t make me happy. For many people thatâ€™s their drive, but I just donâ€™t think that a career one day will help. And so enters my mantra that Iâ€™ve adopted recently: â€œmaybe, but maybe not.â€ This, I have found is the only true statement. 

Maybe the other truth Iâ€™ve found is that people will disappoint you. About two months ago my GF of 1.5 years left me and that was the last time I had a meaningful conversation with her. Before that my GF of 3.5 years cheated on me and left after we decided to go to college together. But today I went on a second date with a new girl and everything seemed to be going well until at the end when she said â€œshe just saw us only as friends and that there was no chemistry between us.â€ I donâ€™t know. Maybe Iâ€™m meant to be alone or not. Iâ€™m not even sure why it hurts so much. I guess it all doesnâ€™t matter anyways. 

Oh, and Iâ€™ve tried to off myself several times in the last few months but this is the only place I can ever speak about it. I was locked up once, and Iâ€™ll never go back no matter what happens. 

A lot of people here have it worse so I know it may just seem like complaining but I appreciate it if you read this at all. 

Thanks,
M
