Too cowardly to do it myself...If I had a magic button that would just erase me from existence, including in the minds of those close to me, I wouldn't hesitate to press it. If my mother never found out what happened to me in would rest pleased.

Part of me watches shows about serial killers because I envy the victims. To disappear, never heard from again... that would be ideal.

I'm pathetic. Maybe I will get lucky one night and a meteor will fall directly on my pillow, obliterating my body. Here's hoping for a quiet way out.
