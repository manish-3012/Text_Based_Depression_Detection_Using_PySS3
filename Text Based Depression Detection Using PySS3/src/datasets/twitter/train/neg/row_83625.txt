What's the easiest and painless way to kill yourself?I think I've had enough time on this earth I mean
* I constantly say I don't wanna live past 50
* therapy doesn't help it makes me worse
* My antidepressant works but the second something bad happens to me it disappears 
* I honestly feel like everyone's lives would be better off without me 
* and I always ask myself "why am I here? What's the fucking point?" And I also ask "if I did....what would change?"
