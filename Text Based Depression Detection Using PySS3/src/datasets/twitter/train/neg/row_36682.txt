This is where I am.So here's the rundown: I'm 22, going on 23 in October.  I really can't see anything in my life changing for the better at this threshold or 23 to 24, or 24 to 25 etc.  In fact I see my quality of living spiraling downwards.

The short and long of it is this: I'm a lazy fuck, just like I've been told all my life and about to default on my college loans.  I have accomplished nothing and have little to no potential left to make any measurable impact on anyone's life anymore... Except to continue leeching off of those around me.

A lot of people point out most people tend to think about killing themselves when they are in the lows of their depression but when they are having those good days it seems silly that it even came up.  Not for me.  I think about it every waking day, even when I'm among friends and having a reasonably good time.

I have evaluated my situation and pretty comfortably deduced that there is nothing to look forward to.

I guess what I want to hear is if my logic makes sense to anyone else.  Honestly I want someone to tell me exactly what I'm thinking which is "what the fuck is wrong with you, you're exactly the type of shit that is draining our economy and ruining it for the rest of us." Because that's pretty much all of managed to do to the environment around me.
