I just canâ€™t hold it anymoreYes, new year, new me, but yet itâ€™s just a continuation to all the same burdens and weight that have crushed me for years. Itâ€™s just managed to compress onto me and suffocate me. Nights like this where I just end up letting the tears fall, my gun close by so that when I get the courage, I can just finish it. 
Iâ€™m so angry, so frustrated, lonely and sad. I just donâ€™t know what to do anymore.
