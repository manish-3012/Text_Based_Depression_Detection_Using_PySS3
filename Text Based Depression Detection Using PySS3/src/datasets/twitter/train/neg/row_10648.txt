I am nothing but a terrible human being, I have lost some of those who were very close to me and I have so much guilt I feel as though I have no futureHello, I am a 19 year old who has been suffering from a lot of depression over a variety of different factors and just feel like I don't know what to do about it. I feel like human trash over my past and I feel as though I don't have any future.

I suffer from a type of OCD where I am terrified of my own sexuality, I have been scared for several years that I could be someone who could cause harm to those younger than me, this was a result from videos I watched when I was around 15 and 16 relating to a fetish i had at the time, I watched videos of people wetting themselves and used to watch stuff with people younger than myself without fully realising the bad thing I was doing, I had eventually realised this but when into deep depression over it and developed my OCD, in recent times I became overly obsessed over my actions and become very scared over if I have done something terrible or feel I've done something that means I deserve isolation. I seem to remember after my realisation of my mistakes I remember finding another video involving that fetish I had (This was on a major adult video site) , I remember coming across that video again in the future and noticing that the people in the video looked young from the thumbnail (I noticed eventually the thumbnail was missing from the site like it had been deleted or something which only adds to my worries), I avoided that video and thinking about it recently has really made me worry because I don't seem to remember what happened when I found that video the first time, I don't remember when I saw it the first time, I know for certain it was over a year ago at least but my anxiety has really gotten to me over when it happened because I also don't seem to remember how I reacted to that video when I saw it first time, I keep thinking I just watched it for a few seconds, got bored and went away, but I worry, What if I'm wrong and I reacted in a disturbing manner to that image, I think when I did see it the first time I wasn't really paying much attention to the people in the video and didn't noticed they looked young until I saw the thumbnail of it in the future. These days if I find videos where I worry about the age of people and think they could potentially be dangerous I report them as I find any potential harm coming to younger people worrying and people who exploit younger people to be evil but with my OCD i sometimes believe I am just as bad.

There are 2 other things that make me think I am an awful person, one thing was when I was 18 I used to look up a lot of NSFW art of anime characters and heard that someone got taken to court in the UK where I am also from over having tons of that sort of art of young characters on their computer, at the time I didn't take the whole thing very seriously thinking it was weird since it was all fictional and I continued to look up art of anime characters (Granted I did have a rule that I'd look up characters only around my age either slightly younger or older) though eventually I did completely stop doing that sort of stuff because of aspects about the whole thing I found disturbing. As well as that with my OCD I would sometimes check art of younger fictional characters to test out how I feel as a form of reassurance, I don't find them attractive but my OCD keeps tormenting me.

Lastly I have been depressed over something from between ages 18-19 that I did that has me worried, last year I was sent a photo from someone I was really close to and in love with (They are 2 months younger than me), at the time we were discussing about how their hair was and the photo they sent me was really cute though they said the photo was old, admittedly sometimes I would fantasise about them and used that photo they sent me to get a good idea in my head of their face to help with that, at the time since we were talking about how their hair was at that point I assumed while they said the photo was old i was thinking they meant maybe a few weeks or months but as time has went on I've began panicking what if I was wrong and the photo was from when they were much younger... sadly I can't find the answer to that anymore because soon after we broke up and completely lost contact with one another.

Admittedly I'm quite scared to talk about my problems I used to talk about them to friends I was really close to but I fell out with my closest friends recently and have really had trouble discussing them with other friends because I live in fear that people will hate me, So I've become pretty lonely with my issues and I've been too scared to talk to a therapist, I'm just not sure what to do and sometimes I've just felt like giving up because I am just some horrible person.
