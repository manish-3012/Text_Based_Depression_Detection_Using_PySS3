This is it. My lifeâ€™s final chapter.Iâ€™ve written a note and sharpened my blade. Iâ€™ve said goodbye to my closest friend but she wonâ€™t see it until after Iâ€™m gone. My parents hate me and mock me over my cuts and problems with no help at all. My sister is going through the same thing except she has the perseverance to not kill herself, how brave she is.

Nothing brings me joy anymore. Video gameâ€™s, reading, art, music. Nothing excites me or gives me a reason to keep on leaving. 

So goodbye guys, thanks for looking out.
