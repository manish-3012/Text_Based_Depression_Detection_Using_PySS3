I donâ€™t really know what to do anymoreFor context, Iâ€™ve recently graduated from college and Iâ€™ve been home for the past few months as Iâ€™m sure most people have. Recently I was in a relationship with someone I thought I really cared about and I thought they cared about me too. 
We were doing just fine until she told me that she wasnâ€™t sure if she was ready for a relationship after dating for 6 months so we agreed upon taking a break but we promised each other that weâ€™d come back together when she was ready. And we set the ground rules that we wouldnâ€™t talk to or sleep with anyone while we were on the break. But not even a week later while I was at a party with friends I get a text saying â€œI may have gotten drunk and slept with someone at a barâ€. I was drunk and angry and said a lot of things Iâ€™ve never said to anyone else before. She blocked me on everything and I tried giving her an apology letter for the things Iâ€™ve said but idk if she ever saw them.
I feel disgusting for the things Iâ€™ve said and I feel confused and hurt by what she did but I donâ€™t even know if I have the right to feel upset by it. I donâ€™t really even know how to feel anymore.
Itâ€™s been months and I constantly wake up feeling miserable and angry at myself for everything thatâ€™s happened.
I just feel lost and hopeless and I donâ€™t know how to stop feeling like this and I desperately want to not feel like this anymore.
I just want it to stop.
