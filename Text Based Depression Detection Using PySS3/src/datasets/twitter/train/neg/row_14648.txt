Severe hypochondriac/health anxiety suffererI panic about the most rare diseases every day like rabies and cjd. I worry about rabies so much i have considered suicide to be free of my obsessive thoughts. I live in a country with only 3 domestic cases of rabies. So yesterday morning i woke up and walked to get breakfast and i saw my brother with a wound on his nose. I told him about it as it looked like he didnâ€™t notice. He didnt care but i started worrying that a bat bit his nose while he was sleeping (we never saw a bat in our lives) and i found a sticky gum like thing thats white. Its really big and i stepped on it a couple times it feels like gum. So i convinced myself that it was saliva of a rabid animal who flew in. He didnâ€™t worry at all. I later told him about my fears. He started panicking. I panicked too. I didnt really give a shit wether or not i had rabies because im going to kill myself soon but i REALLY didnâ€™t want him to get rabies. He later moved on and forgot about the fear because Of how rare rabies is in My country and the extremely small posibility that a rabid animal could have flew in without causing damage. I really wish there were cameras in my house so i can see what happened. I wont kill myself until i 100% know he doesnâ€™t have rabies.
