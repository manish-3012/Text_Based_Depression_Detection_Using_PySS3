I donâ€™t know what to doI had a real good week. Hit a real low point on Tuesday last week, but I woke up on Wednesday feeling genuinely refreshed and even a little happy. Done everything in my power to keep it that way. Iâ€™ve kept myself busy, been exercising, being productive, getting work done, etc. Iâ€™ve even been clean of a masturbation addiction since Tuesday night, which is the furthest Iâ€™ve gotten in a long time with it. But tonight it all comes back. The walls feel tight, I canâ€™t get out of my own head, I would normally go to sleep but Iâ€™m not tired, know I have things to do tomorrow but just the thought of it makes me even more tired. Iâ€™ve been thinking of ending things for a while now and even told my counsellor this and all I was given was a phone number, but Iâ€™m too nervous on the phone to call and donâ€™t want anyone to hear me talking. Iâ€™m so ashamed of myself and my emotions, of things that have happened to me in the past, and every night I take another step closer to just killing myself to get out of this rut Iâ€™ve been stuck in for years. Every time I try to dig myself out I just fall back in and it grows deeper. I donâ€™t know how long Iâ€™ve got left in me.
