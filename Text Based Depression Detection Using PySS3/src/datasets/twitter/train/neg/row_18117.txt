often nothing has any sensehappened to you? Feeling that no matter how hard you struggle to feel good you cannot, that everything is stronger than you, even your own weaknesses. Lately, since February 10 I have been crying every damn day and night, I am fed up, I hate feeling love, joy and affection for someone. I hate having to get up every day, go to work and see all those people, see her, the one I love so much and the one who doesn't care. clearly no one cares what I feel, I am never enough and I will always be mediocre. What is the sense of continuing to suffer then? Why despite all this do I still believe that one day it will improve? I am stupid.
 
I do not know what to do with me, I want to stop.
