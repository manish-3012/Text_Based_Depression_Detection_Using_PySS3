i'm tireddying is only scary because of this body, it's so difficult to escape it. so many options to try and do it, yet most of them can fail so easily. to kill myself i need to go through so much stress and fear, that i fear it more to the point where i cannot do it or face it. i'm scared to jump from 16th floor, i'm so scared and my legs are shaking and it's hard to breathe. i can't talk or explain anymore how i feel because i really hate myself so much, there is no words anymore to explain how i feel, i'm so tired of being this person and i can't even escape it anymore. it's a torture and nobody seems to know. i try and try to ask for help but that requires effort, to get better requires effort, to kill myself requires effort and i could fail way too easy. i feel like if i tried i would fail and would be forced to deal with more consequences, my life would harder much harder again. i'm tired to feel like i need to pretend, i'm tired of my reflection in the mirrior, i'm tired of seeing myself and hating every bit of it, my reflection is a reminder of how much i hate myself. i can't overdose i am scared. i can't find the rails i am scared. i can't wish my plane crashed as soon as i boarded because that simply won't happen. i can't wish tomorrow didn't come because if i want it so bad it won't be granted. i can only keep trying, keep dealing with being myself miserably till i got hit by truck or die by accident. but i know that would only happen if i didn't want to because life plays by shitty rules.
