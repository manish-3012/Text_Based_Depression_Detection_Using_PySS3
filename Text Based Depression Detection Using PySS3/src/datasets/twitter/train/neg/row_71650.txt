Tired of trying and having nothing to show for it but debt, shame, and guilt.This isn't the first time I've posted here... Hopefully it's my last, however that happens. Kinda feel like an attention whore for posting rather regularly though...

anyway, I took a seasonal job up in Alaska about a month ago. Last week, I quit, (it was that or get fired a few days down the line), because it wasn't clicking. I was living at the place I'm working, but now I have a friend of mine putting me up. I like them, they're good people, and I am unspeakably grateful, but I think you can understand that I'm not entirely thrilled about it. I'm going to be filling out a shitload of applications tomorrow to try and find some other work. Barring that, I'm going home.

here's the problem though: I've lived with family for the whole of the 22.5 years of my life, and they fronted over $1k to help me get up here. I haven't told them about losing the job yet; only my sister knows. I don't want to go home empty handed. I can't go home empty handed.

This isn't the first time I've tried to strike out on my own: I tried to go to college after high school, but I couldn't deal with the whole classroom environment. The following year, I enlisted in the Army, but that didn't work out either. Now I'm trying to find seasonal work, and I'm not 100% sure how that's gonna go anymore.

I don't have any contingencies if this doesn't work. I'm just so tired of trying so hard to overcome all the baggage I carry around with me only to get smacked down on my ass again. Sure, I've got some perspective and shit, but that doesn't pay bills, put a roof over your head, or food in your stomach. 

Long story short, I'm tired of living off of others. I want to be able to stand on my own two feet as my own person and do my own thing, but every time I try I get my ass kicked. Maybe I should just quit fighting and let it win by putting a bullet in my head and calling the whole thing a wash.
