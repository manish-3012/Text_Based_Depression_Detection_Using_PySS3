Life is one big joke and you're the punchline...This life is meaningless, but you must not live like it's meaningless. You have to give it meaning and find balance. 

If you reside living in a state of mind built on fear and self pity, it will only make your existence miserable, and yourÂ demons will come knowing at your door.

You have to accept every card you have been dealt and all experiences you have gone through NO MATTER how fucking painfull it feels, and not allow yourself to dwell on the past or the future.

If you become friends with your pain it will teachÂ  how to navigate the waters, if you become homies with your demons you can learn how to rise above your fears.

Human existence is suffering, and the natural state of the brain is to live in fear. If fear doesn't exist then there is no growth. Control the voices in your head or they will control you. You come into this world alone and you will die alone, you deserve to give yourself a blissfull and happy life within your mind through all the bullshit life throws at you.Â  So it's important not to beat yourself up and love yourself more.

Life is one big joke,Â and you're the punchline, you must laugh at yourself first to experience the beauty of it.
