Please read. I need help. I don't know what to do, my life is spiraling out of control. I'm 16 years old, and today my life has been turned upside down. I use drugs. Pot, and the occasional psychedelic. Today the school cop searched my bag and my phone and found everything. I've been expelled. I have possible criminal charges. They have notified the parents of my whole circle of friends. I don't know if I can deal with the hate spewing at me from every person with authority. I don't know if I can deal with not being able to see my friends again, friends who are more of a family than my family itself. We depend on each other and I don't know what I'll do without them. It all seems too much.
