Hot Air Balloon - One Way TripDown the rabbit hole I go!
Anyone care to join me for the Hot Air Balloon ride? It will be my last, doesn't have to be yours. 

I'm not encouraging anyone to take their own life, just asking if anyone wants to join me for the ride up. I'm going to jump once we reach the highest altitude possible. You don't have to jump, but I won't stop you.

I don't want to die alone. I'm 30 years old and have amounted to nothing in my life. I'm over it. You see people (kids) like Jake and Logan Paul making millions per year, buying mansions at 22 years of age. Yet, I work dead end, minimum wage job struggling to pay rent.

Fucken over it. I have no kids, no friends I can trust or feel comfortable with at what I've done with my life. I'm tired, tired of this life. 

Join me. Explore with me, journey with me. Let's go on an adventure quest. Once I die I will get all the answers to every question I've ever asked. Once I die I will choose a new body to be reborn in, but I will make it so that I keep all of my memories of every life I've ever lived. 

Join me, you've everything to loose, and potentially nothing to gain. I could be making a huge mistake, but I'm willing to take my chances. 

I was fucked over in this life, but will come back with a vengeance. Join me and If I have any power in the after life I will change everything.

Or, I could just be met with emptiness, nothingness. Or maybe some of us are time travellers, and when we die we wake up in our own timelines. 

I will venture into the next life regardless, anyone want to come with me up on this hot air ðŸŽˆ?  

Message me. Pay for your own fair though, I will not assist you in taking your own life. 

Adults only. 

This is my Journey through Wonderland.
