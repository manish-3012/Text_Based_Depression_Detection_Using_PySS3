Is this the end?(Sorry, my English is not perfect at all.)

This is the fourth time I've tried to write this. I want to make it clear that this is not a joke, it's not a game, it's something that's really happening. I no longer know how many years I have been in this state, a state of depression, anxiety and chronic and severe insomnia. You have no idea what it is like to live in a state of intense fear and loneliness for so many years in a row. But ok, maybe we were not all made to live, some of us are faced with a life predestined to suffering and injustice, but honestly, who said that life was just. My whole existence is a mistake, my life failed, now it makes no sense that I am still here. I will not waste time talking about everything that brought me to this point. If I write this here, it is because it may be my last post and my last written words. My parents believe I was healed of depression a long time ago, but it wasn't, that was just a little pause, then I fell back, I just pretended I was healed so they could rest. Sorry, my parents, everyone, but this has to stop and I think there is a way out...
