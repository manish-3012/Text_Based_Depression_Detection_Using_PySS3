F17 I'm lonely and really need a hugI'm only 17 and I can't recall the last time someone hugged me and told me everything was going to be okay. I'm lonely and insecure about everything but my lips. I hate everything about myself and my personality. I keep reminding myself things that said to me. Words hurt me more than anything. I bundle up my blankets an pillow to feel like someone is holding me. I want to wake up to up to someone's smile even if it isn't ever my own. I haven't ended my life yet because I have two toddler siblings that I feel won't remember me if I go. That's my biggest fear. I'm at that stage where  I want to die because of the pain but I'm too afraid of dying and traumatizing my family. I'm all alone and I hate it. How can I get passed this? I want to get help but I can't afford to do  it on my own.
