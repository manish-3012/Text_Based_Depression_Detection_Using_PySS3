I go from happy to suicidal multiple times in one dayRight now I'm in the middle of one of my daily "moan in agony and make your desire to die very apparent making everyone who cares for you uncomfortable" shticks. I'll probably be fine in an hour or so. I hate being fucking crazy. I want off this ride. I just want to succumb to the constant impulse I feel to die. I'm tired of having a good time then one little thing happens and all my internal monologue turns into is trying to convince myself to kill myself. I'm out of town visiting my best friend right now and she seemed annoyed with me this morning so naturally I'm convinced she wishes I would jump out of the third story window in her guest room and just be done with it already. I just feel like a loser. 

Two of my good friends committed suicide last week and all I'm seeing is people being supportive of people with suicidal thoughts yet somehow I manage to convince myself that everyone wishes I were dead and the world would be better off. I miss my friends. I hate knowing they understood this feeling.
