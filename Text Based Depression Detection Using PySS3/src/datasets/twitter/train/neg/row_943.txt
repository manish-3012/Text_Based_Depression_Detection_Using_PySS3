One Step Forward, Six Steps BackYesterday I was having a good day. And then last night hit and Iâ€™m right back to where I am now. Alone with nothing but dark thoughts and the extreme urge to just die. Or maybe not exist. Same thing, really. My stomach physically hurts and my stress is out of control. Iâ€™m actually ruined, a failing excuse of a human being. I have no motivation to do anything. Iâ€™d rather just lay here and pray that sleep is my only escape. But sleep causes dreams and I donâ€™t want any more dreams because theyâ€™re fucking painful. So instead I lay all night awake, with these thoughts clouding my brain. And morning comes, and itâ€™s just an endless cycle of the same shit. Maybe everyone is right, Iâ€™m too fucked up. I hate this.
