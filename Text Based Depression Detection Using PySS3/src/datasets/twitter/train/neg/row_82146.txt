I don't know how to live without being afraid. Nothing has changed.No matter what I try to do to feel a sense of strength &amp; courage, I always end up back in fear. Thoughts are always spiraling. Anxiety is intense. I'm always tense around other people. Ever since I've been living with these feelings, I can't express myself anymore. I'm awkward. Always beating myself up &amp; doubts flood my mind. Can't keep a job, so I'm broke &amp; on the edge.

I just feel weak. 

If I happen to live through this &amp; turn out to be at peace one day, I'll cry. Everyday since 2017, suicide has been on my mind heavy. My end feels nigh though because I just can't handle it any longer. My life has had it's ups, but moreso downs. It's honestly getting worse &amp; it seems like everything's falling apart. 

I'm just going to keep pushing through these days &amp; see how life goes. I'll do my best until there's nothing left inside me I guess.
