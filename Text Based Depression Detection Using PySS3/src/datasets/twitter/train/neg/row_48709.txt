It doesnâ€™t feel like an option so why do I keep thinking about it?I think about suicide all the time but really believe Iâ€™ll never do it. Itâ€™s weird because it doesnâ€™t feel like an option so why do I keep thinking about it? Iâ€™m just so sick of everything not working. I canâ€™t hold myself accountable to keep doing any of the things I know will make me better and am feeling so stuck. Therapy hasnâ€™t done a thing for me. Exercise helps but is hard. And meds are too scary for me (especially because Iâ€™m so unstable right now). I hate that so much feels out of my control. Unemployed and canâ€™t imagine myself happy or that great at any job, have really begun to hate most conversations, and am resentful of anyone who has any trace of my own insecurities. Have no clue how to make things better. Suggestions?
