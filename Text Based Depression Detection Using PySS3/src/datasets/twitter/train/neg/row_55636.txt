My sister wants me to commit suicideToday was the last day I tried getting a cry for help from my sister, because I made her aware through texts that I have no one left because my friends are not the type of people to talk about their issues.

I was always there for her whether she liked it or not. Whenever she went through a rough patch, I was there to shoot her a text asking her if she was alright. I was always greeted with a **NOTHING** or a **NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS**.

For some reason, I was expecting the favor to be returned, as I was making it obvious to her that I wanted to commit suicide. She told me to "fuck off" and leaving me a "so go away" as her last text to me before blocking me.

She was the last family member I had that would sort of understand what I'm going through, but I guess she has moved on from her little brother. Even if I made it obvious that I wanted to kill myself, she didn't care. I guess now I realize how little I matter to people, and that if I killed myself the only people who would react would probably just be my grandmother and my mother.

I still wish that a millionaire who thinks money can't buy them happiness would shoot me some Gs, so I can show them what happiness looks like when I escape this broke family just encouraging me to kill myself.
