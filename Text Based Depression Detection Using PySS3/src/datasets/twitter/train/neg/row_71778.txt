Suicidal Thoughts- HELP ME PLEASE!!I have a job but no salary since past 4 months, I have changed jobs from one to another and not been successful so far. I work in the food sector and I have 5 years experience in QA and I also have experience in Regulatory affairs. Currently I work at NSF International with no pay &amp; no job. I don't know how much longer I can go ahead with this, I have a wife and family to take care of and I am desperate to have a decent job if not a good job. If anyone out there is listening, please help me. #saveme #need job #desperate.
