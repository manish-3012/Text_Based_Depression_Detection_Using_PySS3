It's new year's eve. I'm alone. Again. This feels inevitable.I've been depressed for months. Meds work for a little bit, but then stop. It's feeling hopeless. There's some nights I just lay in my bed and sob myself to sleep. 

I tried asking my "friends" what they were doing, but no one wants to spend time with me obviously. I've tried talking to one of my friends about it, but he says it's all in my head, that my perceptions are filtered through my depression. But it doesn't change the fact that he doesn't want me around either. 

In fact, a couple months ago he and some others said they'd come out for my birthday. No one showed up. It was devastating. I almost went through with it that night. He acted apologetic, but I think he just doesn't want to be responsible for me. 

Cut to Thanksgiving, and then Christmas both spent alone. I'm slightly estranged from my entire family, except my mother. At this point I'm hanging on solely for her. I made the mistake of opening up to her about my depression, and she sounded truly concerned. She might be the one person who will miss me. I don't want to hurt her, but I'm tired of hurting myself. I'm so tired, all the time. Everything takes EFFORT. I don't know if I can go on. I'm scared, but I'm starting to be scared of living more. I don't know how much more I can endure. 

There's a lot more going on, shitty job, debt, bad at making friends, nothing interests me any more, etc, but this is already longer than I thought, and as mentioned... I'm tired. I think I'll go to work tomorrow, and then, while everyone is having a great time without me, I'll jump in front of a train. Or OD on sleeping pills and walk into the lake. If anything the cold will take me even if the water doesn't. That might be best, then my mom won't know for sure it was intentional...
