So overwhelmed, ashamed, and depressed.I didn't get into any colleges and I'm having to face that I'm going to have to go to a bad school.  All my life my parents have made it known they want me to go to a good university.  But now that I've utterly failed I feel so ashamed.

Disappointing them has been so utterly crushing to me, and the worst part is I feel like such a failure of a big brother.  I love my little sister so dearly and yet I feel I haven't set a good example at all.  The disappointment I've given to my family is so crushing to me.

I have such dark thoughts I just don't know what to do, I just feel like I don't deserve to live.  And everytime I speak to one of my friends and I hear their plans I feel worthless.  Why am I such a disappointment?  I just don't know what to do.
