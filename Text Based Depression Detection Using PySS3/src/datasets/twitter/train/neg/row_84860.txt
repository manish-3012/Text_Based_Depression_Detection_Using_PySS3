I keep reading it gets better but what does that mean?When you have no motivation or will to continue what will make things get better, life doesnt simply get better like magic. It this point of my life it will only get worse so why should I have to continue living when im already tapping out. My life could get better but I dont care about making it happen and going through that struggle. Im either going to get lucky or get worse until I build my pain tolerance to end it.
