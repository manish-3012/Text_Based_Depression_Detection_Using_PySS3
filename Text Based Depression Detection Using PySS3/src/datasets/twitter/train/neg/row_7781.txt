Losing itSo I've been getting this thoughts where I want to kill someone ( one person specifically). I'm fucked up in the head and I know, this is not me anymore but I can't help it. So now I don't only get thoughts about killing myself but also wanna hurt someone else. 
I see it as a way to take it all out on someone for all the misery I'm going through. In my head I see myself stabbing him and then probably killing myself right after. Or maybe not. But yeah somehow this thought brings some kind of relieve if it's only temporary. Please don't be scared of me, I'm not a bad person but I'm not the same anymore so yeah.
