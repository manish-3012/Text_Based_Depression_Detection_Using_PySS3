I'm destroyed.I lost a job that I really needed because of anxiety.  I couldn't ask for help until it was too late and I'd left; it was a phone center but it was something, it was work, it was insurance.  Now I'm here a month later (my birthday was last week) - and I can no longer live this life.  I'm 34, my work history is in shambles, I'm up to my ears in student loan debt, and I have no support network here around me.  I'm destroyed right now, and need help.
