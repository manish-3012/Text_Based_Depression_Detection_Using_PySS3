Sick Of The LonelinessI have been at an all time low these past few months.  I have always dealt with depression and anxiety since I was about 8 or 9.  I have had really shitty people in life including my moms abusive boyfriend who showed me awful things and put knives up to my neck, my mother who is now a barely functioning alcoholic because of that abuse and refuses to seek help, a father who wants very little to do with me (more on that later), and a functioning alcoholic of a step mother.  I was able to deal with this thanks to the help of my girlfriend at the time but we broke up 2 months ago.  This is when it all came crashing down.  I felt I lost the only person I could trust with these issues, she was the only person who didn't judge me for it.  We were together for over 3 years and she moved on within a week to new guy who she likes to tell me how he is terrible yet super good looking (that makes me feel awful).  A few weeks after we broke up, my step mother gave me no choice but to move out of my father's to live with my grandparents.  I had some friends over playing board games (they both knew this and gave me permission) when she came storming into the house drunk screaming at me for forgetting to turn the porch light on (every other light by that door was on).  I was sick of the constant mental abuse I received from her and how she treated my younger sibling so I packed up my things and moved out that night.  Ever since then my life has been a downward spiral.  I am not looking forward to college at all now thanks to all of this and I don't know what to do.  I feel so alone and helpless.  Whenever I try and talk to someone that isn't my psych (who I barely get to see because of work) I feel I am being judged by them.  I just don't want to deal with this anymore.  I am sorry this is a jumbled mess but I just needed to say this.
