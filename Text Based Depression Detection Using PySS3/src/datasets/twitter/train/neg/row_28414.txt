Thereâ€™s no one in the world who loves meNo matter how hard I try I just canâ€™t find a reason to keep going... no one in the world loves me... there are people who say they do but treat me like shit. No one seems to care until youâ€™re dead anyway... but by then youâ€™ll just be non existent. The people I live with call me ugly and weird and disgusting... yet they tell me they love me. I donâ€™t have any friends. I hate being alive... itâ€™s painful to exist.. everyday itâ€™s like dragging and dragging on... fighting. I feel like Sisyphus from Greek mythology... his punishment is to roll a boulder to the top of a mountain. Every time he nears the top the boulder falls back down... he never gets it to the top but he continues pushing it again and again forever. Thatâ€™s what being alive feels like. Constantly trying to reach your goals, constantly trying to be okay... not even trying to be happy.. just â€œokayâ€. TRYING. Life is pointless work and it wonâ€™t lead to anything. I feel worthless and disgusting and angry and just... barely living. I am existing but I donâ€™t feel alive. I breathe in and out... my heart beats and my brain functions but clearly not properly. I see a therapist... but still. It just all seems pointless. I donâ€™t know if I will kill myself but Iâ€™ve been telling myself that I would for years.
