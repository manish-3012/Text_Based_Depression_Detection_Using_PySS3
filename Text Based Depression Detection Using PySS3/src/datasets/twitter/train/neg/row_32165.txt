My (31f) best friend (29m) of 12 plus 2 years partner is leaving me, I don't want to be here anymoreI swore after my last abusive relationship that I'd never get into another. Him and I have been best friends and loved each other for years, but we were too shy to tell each other until two years ago. We have a six month old baby together. He no longer wants to be a family because he thinks that it isn't what he pictured. He's schizophrenic but medicated. He quit his job yesterday and started staying at his mother's. He said he doesn't love me anymore and doesn't know if he ever did. I'm at a loss, I trusted him more than any other human being. Now he's leaving, and I lost my sense of self worth. I swore I didn't want any more babies but I changed my mind for him since he didn't have any of his own. I changed my life, my future, my career, for him. I can't do this anymore. He has been constantly telling me I'm not good enough for him. I cook, clean, provide him with sex daily. I've lost a dangerous amount of weight (now 6'2" and 120 lbs) and he still calls me fat, says I never clean or cook (because he  cooked and cleaned for the first week after the birth of our child). I feel worthless ðŸ˜¢
