Those who seriously contemplated suicide but never followed up with it, what made you continue living?I have depression, but I'm not hysterically sad or anything like that right now. 

I've come to the realization (again), that I simply don't have anything I **want** to live for. The closest thing I **feel** I could live for right now, is to help my parents pay off their house and all their debt (out of gratitude because of how much they have helped me), but even that motivation greatly hinges on my emotional/mental well being (e.g. whenever they piss me off, it makes me not want to help them, or maybe if my job becomes too unbearable).

The biggest reason I'm still alive, is because I'm afraid how my family will react if I'm gone. Besides that, I have **absolutely no passion** in my life. Seriously, the highlight of my day is when I eat, and even that moment is becoming more bland every day. All the things that used to make me happy (primarily video games), don't excite me anymore. Not only have I lost nearly all interest in life, but I've lost nearly all motivation to speaking with people. 

This is going to sound like a weird contradiction, but my mind feels like there's a 'tornado' inside of it, filled with all the stress and confusion associated with life responsibilities, but my 'heart' feels so low and unmotivated. 

I don't want you guys to think I'm planning on killing myself soon or anything like that, but I seriously want to just give up all the stuff I own save for $100, sever all contact with my family and friends, and just take a bus to the beach, and just figure out what to do from there.
