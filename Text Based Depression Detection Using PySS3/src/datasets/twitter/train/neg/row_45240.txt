Im thinking of ending things.I want to end things. I have nothing to live for. I have no friends where I live, and no one here wants to be my friend. at my last school I got bullied and eveything got so bad for me that I had to go to online school. im not good at school, and can't stay focused on doing it. I have no talent and can't do anything right. my parents are emotionally manipulative, and I hate myself so much. my online friends dont actually like me, and I feel like they would be better off without me. I know how I would do it too. I would send my friends letters apologizing before I do it, so by the time they get them it will be done. I would probably od. that would probably be the least painful. I just want to be gone. nothing is getting better and nothing has for years. I at least used to be relevant online. I had a following and was gaining 2k a day. but now no one remembers me and I deleted my account. im unimportant to everyone. not to mention I will never be accepted by my parents. Im closeted (idk if im ftm or enby i just know im not cis) im going no where in life. idk what to do anymorw
