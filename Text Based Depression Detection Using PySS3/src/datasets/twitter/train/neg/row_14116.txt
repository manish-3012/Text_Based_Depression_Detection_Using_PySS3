Out of options?Hey. This is my first ever proper post on reddit. I lurk on some subs and comment sometimes, but I've never made a real post.

I'm basically at my wits end at the moment. I am 21 and have been struggling with anxiety since I was 15. I am currently doing my Honours year at University writing a thesis. I am a perfectionist and I place a lot of pressure on myself to succeed.

I am going through a particularly rough patch at the moment. I cry every day, I can't study, I am paralysed by fear. My thesis is due in 2 weeks and I applied for an extension. I see a psychologist.

I have no idea what to do. I can't live with myself any more. I've done all that I can to get help already, but it's not really helping. I don't want to do badly on my thesis (you only really get one shot at this). My whole life is my thesis at the moment, and I have to be studying 12 hours a day to keep up. The only thing that makes me comforts me is watching my favourite TV show (I re-watch episodes like a maniac lol).

I just can't see a way to be able to get myself out of my own head and complete the thesis to the standard that I want. It's leading me to desperation as I feel like I've turned everywhere there is to turn. I don't know what to do.

Can anyone help?
