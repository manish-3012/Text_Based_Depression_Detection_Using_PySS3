It's gonna be over soonI've been suicidal since 2018. From then till now, I've attempted twice, and when I wasnt attempting I was self harming either by cutting or by hitting my fist so hard on a solid door frame(which causes me physical pain for quite a long time) or by screaming really loud.

Let me be honest. I dont wanna die. Why? Because I wanna save people like me from dying in the future, I have a lot of dreams Im hoping to accomplish. However, everything I ever dreamed of doing is impossible when your parents controls your live. There is really no way out. I would know because I checked because I was such a coward and a scared chicken to die so I gave myself multiple excuses not to die.(My cause of suicide is MUCH GREATER than what Ive explained here)

I tried. I really tried my best to be ok. I tried my best but everyday its really hard. Im done hoping amd praying for things to get better. 
You know whats funny? Whenever I try to give myself an excuse not to die something happens. Something happens that dying would be the only option to save me.

Before anyone goes to comment and say go to a therapist(I cant) or "I dont know who you are but you're loved" or something along those lines, im not gonna listen you know why? Because in my life(which you dont know about) nobody gives a fuck about me. NOVODY CARES AND NOBODY WANTS TO. Its as if im unable to be loved. No its not just in my head. Whenever im done writing my suicide notes which will probably be by the beginning of June, then my job is done.

Im a 16 year old female and im dying in June 2020 by poisining.
