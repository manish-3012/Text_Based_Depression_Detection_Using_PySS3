Feel like I'm forcing myself to feel bad so I'll end my lifeTrying to make this story short, not sure how long I'll keep on typing

I'm a guy, diagnosed with depression

Not really living in a clinic, but I can't find the right word to describe it... anyways, I got 24/7 care in here with some other people trying to get their lifes back on track, like me

I don't really want to commit suicide... but my life feels "unlivable"

I can have a laugh for sure, but I'm not happy

Quit school, quit work, I get money from the gouverment for my autism, autism limits me to a few things in social life and everything else like work, school ect.

I can't really accept my autism... If you know me IRL you wouldn't see I have autism, and that's the reason for other people to think I'm "normal" and if something goes wrong cause of my autism I get called "weak" or "dumb"

Sometimes I cry, and I want to keep on crying for hours... cause it feels right in some way... but like I said in the title, I feel like I'm forcing myself into feeling horrible so I'll eventually end my life

also, it feels like I feel happy cause other people tell me to be happy

I care more about others than myself, wich causes me to take almost no care of myself, or listen to my own feelings

I don't feel like suicide is a solution, but I'm thinking about killing myself all the time

I'm not really good at stories... but yea, I'll check this page much cause yea, I'm always behind my PC

Bye guys, I'll see what you guys think about this story... feel free to ask questions if something is not clear
