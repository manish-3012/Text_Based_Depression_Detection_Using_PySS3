i feel like i'm drowningi feel as if something is consuming from the inside out, something that's just making me feel so numb.

my parents always say to work harder because if i don't work hard, i'll never become happy and i'll be useless without a job.

i hate this, and i hate hiding my problems, but i don't trust anybody with them.

i feel like suicide would bring me somewhere that i belong. somewhere that free me of the mental water.

i just want to fucking grab a shotgun and shoot myself

i don't belong anywhere, but laying on the ground as a corpse, and i hate thinking like that, but it seems like its my only choice, and that it isn't going to matter in the end because we'll all be dead, so nobody would care anyways.

help me, please.
