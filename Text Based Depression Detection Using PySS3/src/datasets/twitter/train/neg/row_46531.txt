I just tried to suffocate myselfI failed obviously I wussed out but life isnâ€™t worth living. I canâ€™t stop thinking about the girl I fell in love with and she faked being my friend for six years. Iâ€™ve tried to get over her for the last two years but nothing works. I cry before I go to sleep and when I wake up. Iâ€™ve lost almost all my friends because of this and nobody likes me. Iâ€™m a waste of breath and a disease to anyone I know. I constantly disappoint my family and I just want to die
