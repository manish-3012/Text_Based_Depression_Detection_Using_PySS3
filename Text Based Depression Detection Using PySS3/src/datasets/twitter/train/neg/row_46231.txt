Suicide attemptI still have the note I wrote. I am still not convinced I can go on living, and everywhere I look is a reminder of how shit life has been. I'm angry, and alone and tired of being alive. I never wanted to live and if I'm being honest I've been hoping to die since I could envision the possibility of not existing. I've lost a lot of important connections and now more than ever I am relieved so few people will miss me. I fewl bad for those who will, but is it terrible to say not enough? I have the means of overdosing i I want to now, and all I can do is imagine dying. I do not want to be here. I was hoping after this last attempt I would find a reason to stay alive, something just mine... But more and more I see I am nothing and have less and less to lose. I hope my brothers never find my body. I hope people think I ran away. 


I hope everyone forgets who I am in due time.
