Genital herpes destroyed my lifeI have had a blessed life with perfect health, job, family friends, wife and everything else.

2 months ago I became infected with hsv2 (Iâ€™ll spare you the traumatic story) and the primary outbreak has been beyond what Iâ€™ve read other people go through and still ongoing.

I think this is it for me and trying to think of how to end it peacefully as I can.
