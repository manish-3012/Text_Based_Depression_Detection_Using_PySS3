I wish suicide was much easier.Mostly everything in my life is getting extremely fucked up, studying, relationship with everyone I know. I got into very irritating situation. I don't left anything worthy what would make me cling to life, but suicide extremely scary and in my position unreliable, I don't own gun, nor I have any poison/drug. Just wish one night I wouldn't wake up anymore and it all will end without any pain.   


  
Everything what is left from my life is shitposting, consuming food and daydreaming about suicide.
