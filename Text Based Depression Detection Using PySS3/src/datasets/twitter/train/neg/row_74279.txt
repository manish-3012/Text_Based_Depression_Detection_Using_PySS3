:/i am so tired. ive been battling depression for so long now. i don't know if i want to keep going. despite how many times i repeat the phrase "it will get better" i no longer believe it. i don't have enough energy to keep going. im completely drained. no matter how hard i try to sleep, i just can't. i end up staring at my ceiling and counting down to the time sun rises again. im a failure. i no longer make my parents proud. my once excellent grades turned into me barely passing or even failing classes. i dont know how to fix them. no matter what i do i cant get myself to study. my brain is so preoccupied with these useless self destructive intrusive thoughts i cant do it anymore. ive built an entire persona just as a shield, so that no one would know what im going through, so that no one would know i want to die. but this happy go lucky persona is hellish to actually keep up. im tired. im tired of always laughing and making jokes. but if i stop i just might really kill myself as ive literally based everything on it. my self worth depends on other people and how they accept me. and since my parents arent proud of me anymore i just adapted to this new role of just being the funny girl or whatever you want to call it. but i dont have enough energy for it anymore. i dont want to go out. i dont want to stay here. i dont want to talk to anyone. i just want to lay down for a very long time.
