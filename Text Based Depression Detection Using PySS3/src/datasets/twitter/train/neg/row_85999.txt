Tips to stop myself?Iâ€™m due for some night time medication in a bit but Iâ€™m stuck in the bathroom bawling my eyes out in the shower because all I can think about it now I really want to dump my entire collection of meds into my body along with the night-time meds, and never wake up again.

I know I stop myself from doing it every time, but Iâ€™m just so tired these days and canâ€™t stop thinking about it. My therapist told me this afternoon to give my sister my medications so I donâ€™t allow myself to do *this*, and I know that I should do as advised but I donâ€™t want to. I really just want to get it over and done with and never wake up again. 

My plans are all thought out and have kind of progressed from â€œyikes suicidal urgesâ€ to â€œiâ€™m going to do it one day and itâ€™s just a matter of time, iâ€™m just seeing when i wonâ€™t be able to hold them off any longerâ€. How do i stop myself now, and in the future over and over again, because i know Iâ€™ll always have to deal with these urges until I actually start getting better?
