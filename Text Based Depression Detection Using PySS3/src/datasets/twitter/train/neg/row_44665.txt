the end is neari feel so unbelievably alone. i dont have anyone or anything anymore. my once grand dreams of becoming something more than myself have withered and died. i feel so lost and im trying desperately to find something, anything. but i dont even know what it is that im looking for. i dont have anything left to live for. ive lost what little motivation i had to get out of here. im sorry. i dont know if ill actually kill myself. but i feel like its inevitable. i feel like im going to die soon, and ill be the one to end it. its not like im leaving anything behind.

it almost feels nice, being able to put all this out there. like im telling an actual person or something.
