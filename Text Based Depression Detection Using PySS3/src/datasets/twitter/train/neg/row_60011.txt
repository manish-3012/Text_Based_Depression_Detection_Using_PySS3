I wish my husband and mom diedThey're the only ones keeping me from ending it. I can't do that to them and I feel like a hostage. I love them. And I hate the fact that they exist.I have to keep breathing to not break them. I keep playing scenarios of car accidents or serious illnesses in my head, I actually wish something quick and painless happened to them. They'd never know, they'd never have to mourn and I could finally, happily and freely do what I wish the most and end this pile of miserable crap that's called life.
