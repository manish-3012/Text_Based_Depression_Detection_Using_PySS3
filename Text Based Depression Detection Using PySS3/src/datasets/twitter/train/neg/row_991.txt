Iâ€™m losing reasons to live, day after dayI donâ€™t even know where to start. I donâ€™t want to live anymore, and the only thing stopping me from committing suicide is the pain and chance Iâ€™ll end up crippled. I donâ€™t even care about my family anymore. Itâ€™s been this way for a while. Every time I interact with them they put me down in ways they donâ€™t even understand. My father is disappointed in me for not constantly working with him, and my mother is constantly on my ass about work. My girlfriend left me for her best friend a few months back, and she spread lies about me saying I beat her, and now I canâ€™t trust anyone. I donâ€™t feel like I can love anyone, as a matter of fact. I feel only lust for others and thatâ€™s it. I see myself as a terrible person. I think things no one should. I think terrible things. I say rude things that no one should say. And yet here I am, pitying myself. I truly donâ€™t deserve to live.
