If I killed myself it would be a shocker.I am so done with everything. I don't even have words for it. I just hate my life but everyone thinks I'm happy. I talked to a therapist but I didnt open up to her or tell her my real issues. She even thought I was normal. There is tons of things wrong with me and not even a therapist could pick up on it. I need a good therapist to try to talk to one more time. I don't know what to do anymore.
