The only thing that makes sense is ending it all.I have always been ugly, any girl that got interested in me was a huge struggle (and none last), Iâ€™m very socially awkward, I have sabotaged my career (a shitty career to begin with that I had not chosen), now Iâ€™m balding fast. I always knew it would come to this. I have a low paying job going nowhere, few good friends. Iâ€™m not good at anything, why be another miserable soul roaming around? just to keep other people happy? to lower statistics on suicide? Anything that Iâ€™m â€œgoodâ€ at I am actually just average tops. I never achieved nor conquered anything (and I have tried). I just want to sleep forever, even if it takes a noose around my neck to do it. I just feel bad and getting worse. Keep trying just makes me sink more. Itâ€™s 6 am I am awake and thatâ€™s all I can think about... this and reminisce about the very few good moments I had and that wonâ€™t come back because Iâ€™m a worse failure than I was.
