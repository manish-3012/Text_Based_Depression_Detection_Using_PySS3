I wish I would die almost everydayI wish someone would kill me so I don't have to struggle through everyday. I don't want to be seen differently by my family or loved ones or them to blame themselves. But if someone else did it for me or it was an accident then it's sad but not that bad. It would be a tragic but it would just have been what the universe willed. No one could've changed it. Instead of everyone thinking they should've done something or whatever.
