I don't have a futureI'm a sophomore in highschool and am 16. I am failing all my classes and can't do anything in life. My mom is always telling me how when I turn 18, she is going to kick me out of the house so I'll be homeless when I'm a senior in high school. I have no family to turn to as they all live in a different state and most of them I have a rocky relationship with. I can't move to anywhere since any money I made working part time went into a shared bank account since I am a minor, then said money was taken by my mom to pay "rent". I can't get into a good college, will be homeless, and a failure. I want to live but it all seems pointless to try when I know my fate. I'm sorry to all my friends I know and all my teammates on the basketball team that I've had a lot of fun with but this is the end for me.
