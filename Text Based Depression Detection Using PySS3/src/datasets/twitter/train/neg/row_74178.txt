My thoughts have got darkerI had a wobbly day today. My niece and nephew are my main reasons for staying alive. They are so worth all the emotional pain I withstand. 

But I had one of those "would anyone miss me?" moments. I think most people would be better off without me, and I hate feeling like I'm currently a burden to others. 

I'm the kind of person who is constantly cancelling parties because my friends cancel on me last minute. I did get a small number of friends out for my last birthday, but it's sad that my friends rarely make plans with me - it's always me reaching out to them.

I've been suffering from loneliness and my partner doesn't understand why I feel lonely. 

It's hard to explain and I don't like him feeling bad about it. 

I'm in a safe space now - in bed, with a full house. No risk of loneliness for now. But at times I can be surrounded by people and still feel invisible.
