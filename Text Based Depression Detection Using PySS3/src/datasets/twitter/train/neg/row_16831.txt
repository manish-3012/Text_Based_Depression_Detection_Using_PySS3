I am ready to commit suicide i just dont know how?So after a lot of thinkin, i am ready to commit suicide. I tried to be a better person (after i did something bad and i realized i was in the wrong) its still not enough. Ive lost everything ive had and i am mentally drained. The friends who had my back were just with me to make me feel better.

Every second of the day I keep hearing voices in my head telling me i dont deserve anything. And guess what? Theyâ€™re right.  For 7 months i have been struggling with these voices and they finally done their job.

So i am ready to kill myself, i just dont know how. Ofcourse i could point a gun at my head and just pull the trigger but i dont want my mom to find my brains on the wall. Is there a way to make it look like a natural death?
