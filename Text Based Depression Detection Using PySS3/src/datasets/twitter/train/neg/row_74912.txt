Why I want to dieI believe sometimes some people are meant to die alone, not because of the way they feel but because of the way they are. I think a big contribution to my depression are the demons in my mind. my mind is full demons and Iâ€™m so sick of dealing with them and I feel the only way to get rid of them is to end my life because everything else Iâ€™ve tried, doesnâ€™t work. I can say I understand a lot of things about life and how it works, and at the end of the day I want to make it better, and I feel it would be so much better without me. My demons and depression make me never want to have children because Iâ€™m terrified they will be just like me.

my dad doesnâ€™t believe in depression but my stepmom does and weâ€™ve talked about it but I think she just thinks Iâ€™m sad and I have never told anyone about my demons, and I donâ€™t plan to, if I did, they would just try to help and help doesnâ€™t work for me, I believe sometimes things are incurable, just like a scar, they never go away, just like a disease, like a person with Down syndrome, you canâ€™t cure it. at the same time I donâ€™t want my stepmom to believe Iâ€™m serious because I, myself donâ€™t want to believe that I have it, I have people to talk to but itâ€™s always the same response and every time I talk to my friends about it, they say similar responses and also try to convince me that they have it and talk about things that relate to it. I donâ€™t know if they do it to relieve me from my emotions and Iâ€™m not complaining about their help because I truly do appreciate it but I donâ€™t think they understand.

Overtime when I think of my process to end my life. Iâ€™ll be happy I did it because I wonâ€™t have to stress on who I am, and that there will be one less person like me on earth. And with doing that it will make it a better place
