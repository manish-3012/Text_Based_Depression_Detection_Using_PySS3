Feeling empty and itâ€™s alarming.In the past this emptiness and lack of emotion is what drove me so close to killing myself. I thought I had gotten past this but Iâ€™m right back there again. I canâ€™t kill myself right now though. My aunt just died and I donâ€™t want to seem like Iâ€™m attention seeking or something if Iâ€™m not successful. I donâ€™t really want to live anymore. Iâ€™m not interested in anything. I feel so empty. I donâ€™t want to be a burden. I donâ€™t want to feel pressured to see people. I want to be alone. I want to this emptiness to be everything. I want the void. I want nothing.
