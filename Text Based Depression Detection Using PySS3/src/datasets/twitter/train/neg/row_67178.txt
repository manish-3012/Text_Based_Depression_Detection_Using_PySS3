Backup PlanHow do I stop going through life thinking of suicide as an option, as a backup plan if things don't work out? I constantly have these thoughts and I feel so pathetic. I am where I am because I put myself here, it's no one's fault but my own. If I just tried hard enough to better myself and make an effort, I could probably end up in the good place I want to be. But for some reason I just can't.. And always think "that's okay, I'll probably end up killing myself anyway".
