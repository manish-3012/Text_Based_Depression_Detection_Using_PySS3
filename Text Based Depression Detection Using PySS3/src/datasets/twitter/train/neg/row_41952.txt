Constant Nightmares Since Getting Dumped; Thoughts of Suicide Getting More Frequent/SeriousI've always had depression but never like this.  I spent hours the other night researching the least painful way to die.  My gf of 12 years dumped me in a very cold, uncaring manner last month simply for having depression.  I now live with my parents, who are incredibly toxic and hard to be around.  I love and appreciate them but this is not a healthy living situation.  I hate this town and this state.  Never imagined having to come back here to live.  

Ever since being dumped, I've had vivid nightmares every single night...many having to do with my ex having sex with someone else or moving on and leaving me behind.  It doesn't sound so bad but the dreams are fraught with emotion and put me in a horrid mood the whole day.  Yet all I want to do is sleep.  I have no energy whatsoever and feel horrid, just like I do every Spring.  (Reverse Seasonal Depression?)  The difference is, now I actually have something to be depressed ABOUT.  

I'm about to be 33 and am living with my parents, trying to get disability for income.  I'm the literal definition of a loser.  I finished high school and college and had a great life in a city I loved, now I have nothing.  All of that was thanks to my girlfriend apparently.  She is outgoing and ambitious--the opposite of me.  I haven't worked since 2007 due to my mental conditions.  I can't drive or do other "independent adult" things due to crippling anxiety, and it's nearly impossible to make friends because I have Asperger's and social anxiety.  I have no control over my life and feel completely hopeless.  

The thought of shooting myself or overdosing actually brings me peace.  It's often the last thing I think about at night as I fall asleep.  I don't know what the hell to do anymore because I don't want to hurt my family but can't go on like this.

Thanks for listening.
