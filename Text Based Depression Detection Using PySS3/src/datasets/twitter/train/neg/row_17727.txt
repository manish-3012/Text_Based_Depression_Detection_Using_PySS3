I'll be dead in less than two weeksI tried to kill myself a month and a half ago and failed. Since then the things I was already not okay with in my life haven't changed. And the couple things I was okay with? So much worse. I'm a complete failure at my job. My best friend, my only real support, is leaving me. I'm finally too much for even them to deal with.

I guess I thought that maybe my survival could've meant something. But it hasn't. No one actually cares that I tried to die. No one cares that I'm working on trying again.

I don't know why I'm posting this. I guess I just want someone to really see what's happening to me. I'm invisible in my life. I know I'll be invisible in my death.

Sorry. I whine too much when I should just shut up and do something.
