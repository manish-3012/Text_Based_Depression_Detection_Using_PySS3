I have made tons of mistakes, feel extremely tired, and don't know how to heal...I was misdiagnosed with Asperger's **(I don't have it, I'm neurotypical)**, and I foolishly told everyone I used to know about it, including people in my first college career (medicine), the second one (psychology) and people I knew from high school as well.

**That's when the nightmare began.**

Most people started to treat me more like a child, innocent or special needs person. They didn't take me seriously, they mostly talked to me either for college stuff (asking for help in class), or just as acquaintances/classmates, but I feel that they wouldn't befriend me because of what I said.

I became suicidal again after realizing the mistake I ended up making. When I graduated from high school, I thought things could be better... No more bullying, no more teasing, no more rejection.

But I destroyed that chance of happiness.

**And it went downhill after that.**

I started to isolate as a way to cope, and I stopped talking to almost everyone I used to know. I became extremely paranoid, started to have panic attacks and the suicidal thoughts kept growing and growing.

I asked for help. I tried taking some pills, going to psychologists and psychatrists and so on... But those treatments barely worked.

Because the main reason of my suffering is external, not internal, that's why I couldn't get better no matter how much I tried.

I feel like I disappointed and betrayed many people, and I became a hypocrite as well.

Even before the misdiagnosis, I started to drift away from many friends as well. Either because of natural distancing, or my inmaturity and foolishness. The misdiagnosis just made everything worse.

Right now... I have social anxiety, I'm depressed, and I also have paranoid personality disorder, and possibly schizoaffective depression and schizotypal traits **(the last two were told by the psychiatrist I visited a few months ago, but I'm not 100% sure).**

And when I try to think about a possible future... I don't even know if I will have one, because I feel that I will eventually kill myself, because I can't cope with reality.

I haven't learned anything, I haven't changed at all. **I'm still a bitter, hypocritical, selfish, toxic and inmature person who destroyed his entire life, and is such a coward that he can't even face the consequences of his actions...**

I think I have a few possible futures... But honestly, I don't see anything good in them.

a) **Keep living the only way I know how** (being condescending, helping people begrudgingly at college, not complaining about anything and trying to hold on as much as I can). (I'm afraid I would eventually have a mental breakdown in this one).

b) **Abandoning my old ideal** (no longer helping people at college at all, only helping my remaining friends and family, becoming a cold hearted person to everyone except the former people and saying that I don't like to be treated like a child or disabled person). (People will probably hate me if I suddenly stop helping them after years of doing so).

c) **Only helping a few people at college and my remaining friends and family, and no longer helping anyone else at all.** (They would think I'm arrogant for only helping a few people, and they would hate me as well).

Honestly, I'm tired. **I'm very, very tired.**

Because of my mental issues, if I don't get better in two and a half years, I won't be able to work as a psychologist, since their ethic code says that someone with depression or another issue can't give therapy to others. And all those years of studying will go to waste.

**I'm tired of the panic attacks, I'm tired of remembering the mistakes I've made, I'm tired of feeling like I'm a horrible person, I'm tired of getting treated like a child again and again, I'm tired of not being able to get better, I'm tired of feeling like I'm dying all the time...**

What could I do to fix this never ending mess?

I feel that... I won't be able to last more than four or five years, maybe even less, if things keep going like they are now.
