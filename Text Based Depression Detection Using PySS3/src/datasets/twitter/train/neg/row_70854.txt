Love life and accomlishmentOne thing about constantly struggling with suicide ideation made realize how fragile life is. Like human beings are such a pathetic specie that one minute your alive the next your dead from self inflicted injuries. Well here is the thing just because I feel it doesn't mean I have to be it. I sometimes feel like crap, but I am not crap. I feel lonely most of the time and alone in the world but I realize the world doesn't owe me anything, it doesn't owe me happiness or companionship or love. I choose to love myself on this lonely Friday night and embrace it might not last forever but it might. Guess the future is not ours to see
