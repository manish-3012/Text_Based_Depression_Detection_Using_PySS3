Keep trying to hang myself but I can never go through with itOver and over and over again Ive stood on a step ladder with a noose around my neck in my shed. Spent a ridiculous amount of time just standing there trying to get myself to jump or just let go and fall backwards I can never do it. Tried to psych my self up for it by step down and restricting my breathing for a few seconds then stepping up but it hasnâ€™t worked. I tried this morning and again just a few minutes ago. I keep on doing things that make me wanna die even more like binging thinking hey ill be dead why not but then I cant do it and I just wanna die even more afterwards but I cant do it im such a mess I cant even kill myself
