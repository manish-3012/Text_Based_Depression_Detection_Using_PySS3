I am not good enoughI am not good enough. I don't deserve to be loved. I don't deserve human companionship. I am too much hassle. I am a burden and I can't do anything right. I am an empty shell. I wish they knew how I felt, I wish my boyfriend knew but I can't tell him because it's not his fault, but it is all at the same time. I can't be a good lover, partner and my entire existence is not right and not good, despite my instincts telling me the opposite, he is always telling me otherwise. I'm trapped and I can't help but want to escape from everything. please help me
