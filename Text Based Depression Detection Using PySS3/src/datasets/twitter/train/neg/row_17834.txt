I have no mouth, but I must screamThe title is a great short story, but it also hits me in another way. I need someone to talk to, but I have no one. I cannot afford therapy anymore. I cannot talk to anyone I know in real life. I tried to join forums or chat groups, and if I ever post, people ignore me or give me generic platitudes like "it gets better." No, I want to fucking talk to someone, not just hear vague, vapid expressions. But there's no one, and this post won't be any different. It will be ignored like every other post I made months back (an another account). It will be ignored like every time I go to chat rooms to discuss my problems. I really feel like I have no mouth because my voice cannot reach anyone.
