it feels so closeI'm 16. Since I was 11, I knew I'd end up here. I wanted to kill myself then, I want to now. The only reason I haven't is because I don't want to make my mom suffer. My dad can fuck off. Bisexual in a homophobic, baptist household. Bipolar in a religious, denying household. Ya know what's fucking sick? That we're all so fucking sedated. We sit here and let fucking PIXELS entertain us. Because if everyone didn't, they'd come to the same conclusion as me. It's so horrible, this world is so fucking horrible. My fucking mind is so fucked, I've been non stop high on whatever I can get my hands on for 9 days straight. Everyone's so fake. My parents can act like they care but I hear my dad laughing and calling me names behind my back. He's called me crazy since I was 5. Always called me a psycho behind my back. My sisters always used to tell me, after I'd say "no, he doesn't hate me." I really just don't see an end to my pain other than suicide. Therapy is bullshit, medication is bullshit.
