I kept believing some Now all I do is cry I have no support system in place and the day after th the police. That did not help matters I know this takes time to wear off and Ive been going f I don't have many friends and the ones I do have are Anyway, the good news is I am losing weight :) And th Sometimes when I think about it, it all seems silly to c are people much worse off. But I am literally not able able to move forward in life.
