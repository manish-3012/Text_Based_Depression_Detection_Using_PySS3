Feeling DefeatedIâ€™m tired. Iâ€™m so so tired of fighting for myself. It hurts and I donâ€™t think I can keep it up much longer. 

I broke down about a month ago and was sent to the Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP) through Kaiser. This was helpful, but only placed a bandaid on my pain for two weeks. 

I met with my new therapist for the first time today. Kaiser has such a shortage of providers that I cannot receive the appropriate and timely care afforded to me by law. My next appointment with her is in a month. I will have individual therapy 12 hours a year. 12 hours. In. An. Entire. Year. My practitioner believes I need weekly therapy, but Iâ€™m unlikely to receive it. 

I filed a grievance today, I should hear back from member services within 30 days. Thirty days is such a long time to deny care for a â€œhigh-risk patient.â€ Iâ€™m tired and donâ€™t know how much longer I can fight for my access to care. I want to fight for others, but I feel so beaten down. I did the right thing by reaching out for help, this feels like a major rejection. Whatâ€™s the point? The pain feels so much greater than the idea of nothingness. Nothingness sounds comforting.
