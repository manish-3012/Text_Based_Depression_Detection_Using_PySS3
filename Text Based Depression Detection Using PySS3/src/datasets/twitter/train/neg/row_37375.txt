Iâ€™m fed up... and Iâ€™m breaking downI dropped out of college back in 2012. The guy I dated, thomas, at that point was my world so I stopped going to classes to be with him and spend more time. I also worked part time at an engineering firm. Since then Iâ€™ve been working. Thomas has depression and wasnâ€™t working. I supported us for our entire relationship. I was proposed to by Thomas in April 2013 and we got married September. I didnâ€™t have my papers and got them through marriage. I didnâ€™t purposefully marriage Thomas for my papers. In fact, I had to tell him I didnâ€™t have papers after he proposed. 
My parents are undocumented and I am currently waiting to put through their paperwork. They are under the impression I am still in school. I have just been working. Their dream for me was to be a pediatrician. They uprooted from Trinidad to the US to give us a better life. My brother and I were 10 and 8 when we moved. My parents sacrificed so much for us to have a better life.
In 2015, things with Thomas and I went sour. He cheated on me and we separated. He sent lewd photos and videos of me to my job. I resigned immediately. I now work part time at a tax firm. 2017, Thomas found someone else and is dating them. I was angry, I messaged the new girl that she was messing with my man repeatedly telling her stay away. She went to the police and said I was harassing her. I was arrested. I go to court and charges are dropped. My citizenship is still in processing. Parents are questioning if Iâ€™m in school and telling me that I donâ€™t care enough because Iâ€™m not a citizen yet. Iâ€™m not angry at them. Itâ€™s my fault. I am 27, broke with a dead end job, no love life and lying to everyone in my life - except for this post. Iâ€™m fed up of lying. Iâ€™m fed up of existing. I failed myself and my parents.
