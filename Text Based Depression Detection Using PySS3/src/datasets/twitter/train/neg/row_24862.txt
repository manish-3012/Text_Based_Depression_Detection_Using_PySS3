[HELP] I would ask DAE feel this way, but I know I'm never truly alone in these sorts of thoughts (X-Post from /r/Depression)Whenever I get locked in an existential crisis (like now), I feel like I need to do something extreme to affirm that I'm even alive. Not violent or anything, but certainly weird, quite possibly illegal. I want to get drunk or stoned and go out into my university's arboretum at night and stargaze. And even that won't satisfy me. Nothing ever does, in times like these. I don't even know what I need to do, but the need is of such an immense gravity that it (and my failure to fulfill it) is all-consuming.

I feel (read: I know) I'm wasting my life away just going to class and playing minecraft with friends. I know that I need to do something. I need to make something of myself. BUT WHAT? I feel so impossibly weak. All I do is follow rules and jump through hoops.

I'm almost 20 years old. A fourth of my life is just about over, and how much of it was spent doing something I could point to say was worthwhile? What do I have to show for my existence, what have I done that would make repeating this life worth it? Not much. Certainly not nothing, but not 20 years' worth. Not even close.

THIS IS MY LIFE, and I choose mediocrity everyday.

How do you guys handle this? (If you do at all)

**EDIT:** Downvote, really? Love you guys, too &lt;3
