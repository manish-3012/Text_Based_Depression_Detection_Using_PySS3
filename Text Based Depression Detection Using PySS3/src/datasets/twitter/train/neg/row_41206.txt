A change in my life.I am a young adult who is no where close to adulthood. All my plans Iâ€™ve worked so hard for to change my life around have all crashed above me. Iâ€™m not going to college anymore. Why does that seem like such a dead end for me? My living environment is what I need to escape from. Every day it forces me closer to taking my life. I love my care takers but there is so much they donâ€™t understand about me. And there is so much I donâ€™t understand about them. I think itâ€™s time for me to go. One way or another I need to leave.
