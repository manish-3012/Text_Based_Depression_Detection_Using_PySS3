Do we owe it to our parents not to kill ourselves before they die?Assuming they weren't abusive or anything like that of course. 

On one hand they do everything they reasonably can to help and would be devastated if i died. On the other hand, I had no say in whether I wanted to be here or not and I hate life, I wish they never had me. 20-30 years is a long time left.

Thoughts?
