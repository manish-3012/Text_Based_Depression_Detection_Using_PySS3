I canâ€™t do it anymoreIâ€™m in Highschool, halfway through sophomore year and I canâ€™t take it anymore. I have no friends and never have, not even in kindergarten. I donâ€™t know what itâ€™s like to truly laugh with someone who cares about me. I was bullied in elementary school and no one gives a shit in Highschool. I barely know what happiness feels like and Iâ€™m sad so much that itâ€™s just numb. I feel empty. My family somewhat cares about me but no one can live off just their family. Besides theyâ€™re rude to me and donâ€™t seem to have any actual interest in my life. 

I want to die. I donâ€™t know how or when, but it will be soon. I just need death. Might try and get a gun but itâ€™s illegal in my country. I might cut my wrists of drain but knowing how much of a coward I am Iâ€™ll probably chicken out because of the pain. In the next few days Iâ€™ll just lose it and jump in front of a car or try and hit my head on something hard. Iâ€™m sorry, I know people here donâ€™t want this but itâ€™s not the same as real people. 

Donâ€™t worry, I donâ€™t even know what Iâ€™m going to do with my life if I was going to grow up so itâ€™s not like Iâ€™m anyone important. No one will miss me other than maybe my family, but thatâ€™s just because Iâ€™m related to them, not because of who I actually am. If anything people will be glad Iâ€™m gone, after all Iâ€™m a waste of food, space and air. As long as death is painless, Iâ€™ll have done something right for once. Goodbye
