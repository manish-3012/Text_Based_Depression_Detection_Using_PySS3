I no longer see a way out.I have been struggling with deep depression every since I got out of the Army 11 years ago.  I have come close to suicide many times but every time I was able to stop myself because I could see at least the slightest ray of light at the end of the tunnel no matter how dark it seemed.  This time is different, I'm grossly overweight at 450lbs, I'm probably going to get fired from my job in the next couple of weeks and I have no idea how I'll be able to support my family after that.  The only solution I can find is suicide, it really does seem like to solution.  I know at this point I will never be able to lose the weight so it would save them from watching me waste away.  I have a really large life insurance policy which I have had long enough that it would cover suicide so my family would be set financially.  I wish there was another way.  I wish I could pull myself out of this pit of despair, I would love nothing more than to watch my kids grow up but I just can't see any other way out at this point.
