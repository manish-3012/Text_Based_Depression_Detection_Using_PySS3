Just like any other hereJust like so many other i feel like giving up, i have been heavily suicidal for the past 1/2 years now. it's a bit longer than a year ago since my first attempt but even after getting all that help that was offered to me, i still dont feel better. 

Everytime i think that ive finally hit rock bottom and that theres only a way up, it gets worse. There's no hope left for me that "it's all gonna be okay", that "it's all gonna get better"...

I'm still in school and i still live with my mum and i seem to also be failing at everything like that; my grades, social interaction, tryna keep my mum happy or just getting out of bed. My mums always dissapointed and mad and i've got no dad to flee to because hes abusive, i've got no family to go to because i barely have any contact with them and they wouldnt understand at all.

I think i'm gonna leave next weekend...
