Feeling helpless with psychiatristsIâ€™m stuck in a shitty position being 17 because I canâ€™t just go off and find myself a psychiatrist. My parents finally agreed that I should schedule a psychiatrist appointment for depression and anxiety but the agreement is using a psychiatrist listed by the insurance. 

Now I have a list of eight different psychiatrists to choose from but Iâ€™m feeling more helpless now than before. None of them have any information online or any information listed by the insurance company besides names and location. Every time I begin to look at the list I get a panic attack and Iâ€™m at the point where I feel like rolling dice leaves me in a better position than trying to pick a random name out to go to. I donâ€™t really know what to do and I feel more helpless than when they didnâ€™t want to acknowledge anything was wrong.
