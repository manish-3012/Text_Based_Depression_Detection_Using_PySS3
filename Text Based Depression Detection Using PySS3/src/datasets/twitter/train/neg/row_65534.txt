I (21m) dont know how I can further improve from what ive already done
I am too ugly to date and it has been such a frustrating and demoralizing experience. Iâ€™ve done everything in my power to fix it, Iâ€™ve lost 80 pounds, I bought all new clothes, I bought a car, Iâ€™ve held a job down for over a year, I go to college, none of this even matters. Iâ€™m still so ugly that it just doesnâ€™t make sense for any woman to settle for me when they can find anyone with the same traits as myself but arenâ€™t repulsive.

Iâ€™ve been on tinder (paying for gold since March), bumble, okcupid, and hinge since October and between all of those apps I have around 10 matches combined between them and 0 dates. Iâ€™ve had my friends take pictures of me, help me write a bio, and I had my friends who are girls who are pretty experienced with dating apps look over my profiles, but none of that matters if youâ€™re as ugly as me. Iâ€™ve asked out girls in person as well, the last three were people I would consider good friends of mine and they all three said yes. Not a single one of them showed up and not a single one of them told me beforehand that they werenâ€™t coming, Iâ€™m not worth the effort I guess.

Iâ€™m very good with people, I have two different friend groups who invite me out to be the â€œfunny guyâ€. I have lots of girls who are great friends with me but when I ask them out they want nothing to do with me. For example, Iâ€™ve asked three girls who were good friends with me in the last 6 or 7 months and theyâ€™ve all said yes, each time theyâ€™ve seemed very excited to go out with me but out of all of those times none of them even told me they werenâ€™t coming, Iâ€™m not even worth knowing that you donâ€™t want to see me, Iâ€™m worthless.

I donâ€™t even have anyone I can turn to, even my mom and sister told me that despite losing 80 pounds that Iâ€™m still a 2/10. What else am I supposed to do at this point? Iâ€™d get plastic surgery but Iâ€™ll never be able to afford it. I just feel like my only purpose is to be an inconvenience to women who are looking for men who arenâ€™t subhuman vermin. I donâ€™t even have a career to look forward to because I decided that it would be a good idea to take on lifelong debt for a fucking history degree. It feels like I have nothing to look forward to, poverty? Being alone forever?

What do I do?

Iâ€™ve been in therapy since March
