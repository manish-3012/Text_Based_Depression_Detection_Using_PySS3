I feel hopelessI feel like dying. The national suicide hotline, the boys town national helpline, my universityâ€™s after-hours counseling hotline, Crisis Text Line, and the Samaritans crisis line have not been able to help me. The person at the suicide hotline hung up on me and the next time I called, it was routed to the same center as the person before but to a different agent, and the agent this time sounded extremely bored, lacked empathy, was impatient when I couldnâ€™t give him satisfactory answers, and told me that the suicide hotline is for suicide and not for family abuse. Even though I told him I feel very distressed and want my life to end.
