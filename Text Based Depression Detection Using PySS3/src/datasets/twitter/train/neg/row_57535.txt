DoneI have been depressed for like 5 years now and i keep telling myself it will become better.. i will be happy one day.. but everything is so messed up..

I just lost one of the most important person in my life because i messed up. In school no one talks to me anymore, so i sit alone all day. the people i used to call my friends ignore me..
i almost killed myself last night, but i didn't have enough pills to overdose with... i still regret not doing it..

i don't know what to do anymore... everyone leaves or ignores me. No one cares. I only make people feel bad and worry... i fail at school, everyone there hates me.. everyone that knows left or tells me i am overreacting. while i am hurting myself and crying myself to sleep every night hoping to find the guts to kill myself.

I want to die so much... i am so done.. i keep on crying like all the time and life is such a mess... i am nothing, no one will even care or notice it.. i'm done.i don't know what i am still doing here.
sorry for wasting your time..
