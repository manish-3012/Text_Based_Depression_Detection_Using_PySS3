I donâ€™t have an interesting titleIâ€™ve been depressed my whole live, to varying degrees. Iâ€™m actually not feeling as bad as I have before, but for some reason, itâ€™s different. I have passions. I love writing, I do a weekly podcast that has an okay following, I have a dog who is the sweetest, most amazing creature ever.

But I just donâ€™t care. Life is boring. I donâ€™t have any motivation to work on my passions. I know what I should do (exercise, write, eat better, blah blah, blah), but I donâ€™t do them. Itâ€™s my fault Iâ€™m in this state, and I donâ€™t care enough to fix it. My therapist essentially told me I need to cut down on my drinking or she canâ€™t see me anymore. She may be right, but thereâ€™s so much more going on than that.

I know that I donâ€™t need to do this. I get very existential about life. If I werenâ€™t here, it wouldnâ€™t matter. I wouldnâ€™t have to struggle. Why force it? Why do anything.

I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m posting, but I also donâ€™t know what else to do.
