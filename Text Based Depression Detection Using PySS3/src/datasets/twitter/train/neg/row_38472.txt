IwanttodieI have so many fucking expectations. My dad went to Harvard and expects me to do big things or whatever in school, but I hate every fucking second of it. I thought writing was my passion, but now I hate it just like everything else. I had a therapist for 2 years just for me to not tell them about how I really felt. I can't open up about anything. I'm not going to kill myself as of right now, but I don't want to be here. Iâ€” fuck I'm too distraught to type much else. I feel shitty because posting on this sub makes me feel like I'm just subconsciously in need of attention, but I don't know what else to do. I have no passion or drive or care. I just want to be done.
