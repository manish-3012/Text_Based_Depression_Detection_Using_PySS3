Young cousin is struggling with severe depression and making not-so-subtle hints about suicide. What do I do?I have a young cousin who is constantly posting things on facebook about suicide.  Two examples from today are "If I kill myself, don't act surprised" and "If I killed myself, would you even care?"  They are increasing in frequency.

Some background: Her father has been suicidal for her entire life, has attempted and been hospitalized numerous times.  She is diagnosed bipolar (as well as her father).  I'm older and somewhat distant, but she gravitates to me when I'm around (I live pretty far away and see her a few times a year).  

She's 15 and struggling with her sexuality.  She's in a mostly healthy relationship with another girl that her family is very supportive of.  She's engaged in a variety self harm for a few years and is always very vocal about it.

What do I do to help?  Should I say or do anything?  I'm older, but we have a pretty communicative relationship when I'm around.  I addressed this with her grandmother as I was very concerned and was told to "ignore it" as it was just attention seeking behavior.  Previously, I assumed that's all it was also, but even if it is:  She had access to try, there's a family history of it, and her posts are increasing in frequency.  I don't want to assume she's "being dramatic" and be wrong.  I considered sending her a message about it, but I don't know what to say.  Please help me.
