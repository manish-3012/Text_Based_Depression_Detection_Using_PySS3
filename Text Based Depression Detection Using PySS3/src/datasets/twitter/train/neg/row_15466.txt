I can't stop crying. I don't know what to do.So, everything in life seems to be piling up on me. I have a full course load of senior year classes, an entire stack of companies that I need to submit job applications to very soon, exams and projects coming up, two clubs that I'm already committed to doing things for, and I missed a lot of school last week for a family funeral. I've also been sick for over a week now, and I can't sleep more than 3 hours a night even with medicine. The thought of food makes me feel sick so I am barely eating._x000D_

The thing that really is hurting me now though, is that yesterday I went over to see the guy I was dating, already upset and crying and hoping for any kind of comfort, only to have him tell me that he didn't want me. We were both going to the same party last night and he told me that I shouldn't be around because he thought he had maybe 4 other women he could get with. After he spent the night grinding on some girl he met two weeks ago, he told me that he wanted to date her and proceeded to tell me everything that is wrong with me, both physically and personality wise. Looking back now, I should have seen something coming over the last week, even though we haven't had any fights or anything._x000D_

I'm posting this here because when I came back to my apartment last night, I spent a long time thinking about how easy it would be to OD with all the alcohol and drugs I have here. I do think I probably have some form of depression based on my past history, although it's never been diagnosed or treated. Fortunately I've never been tempted to think about this before, but this is the closest I've ever been and the whole idea scares me. I just can't see a way to take care of my pile of work and I can't even begin to describe how lonely I am. There's no other way to make it all go away, and waiting it out hurts too much._x000D_

I don't have a car, so it's hard for me to get out of the area and take my mind off things, even if I did have time to do so. I also don't have a whole lot of friends here, most of the people I did know graduated and are already drifting away. I called two friends last night, but neither of them live remotely close and it didn't seem to help, although they did everything they could for me. The thing I need most in the world right now is someone to hold me while I cry on them, or even just a big hug would probably do wonders. I just feel so alone. What do I do?
