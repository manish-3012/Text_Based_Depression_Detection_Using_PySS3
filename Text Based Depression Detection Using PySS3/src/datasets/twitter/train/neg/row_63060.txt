It's getting worseI'm still here so that's alright I guess.

I'm still dropping in regards to my esteem and now all determination and hope has all but left me.

I've made a cheesy post here before, but I'll spare all tge detail this time and just vent about what I want to vent about.

I've gotten to the point where it's becoming hard for me to get out of bed. I'm not eating as much if at all, and my Nan, who has been there for my entire life is in her final stages. She can't breathe without having to moan so her airways expand and to make things worse she has to take prescription drugs every few hours so she is hardly here mentally. I already miss her so much because she isn't the same woman she was.

I don't have an outlet because nobody cares. To make things worse I got my midterm and I'm averaging a 60 so all my dreams of going to university have been shattered as well. For whatever reason I keep pushing on though. 

Now my landwhale of an aunt has joined my pos uncle. Honestly they are toxic to the entire family but my uncle is related to my Nan by blood so she lets them stay around. 

They have been kicked out once, and my aunt told my Nan what a terrible mother she is abandoning her child. Nothing was done about it though, if I don't kill myself I'm afraid I will snap.

It's too late now. Everything has been bottled up too long, and I'm at my breaking point.
