I'll probably kill myself if my future SO cheats on me.Too many cheating stories I've read and recently I've discovered some of the worst ones. I can feel the victim's pain and if I got cheated on I definitely won't be able to handle the pain. The thought of the woman I wanted to spend my life with decides to have an affair with another man and feel no remorse about it. Nope. I can't do it. What's worse is that if we already had kids when she cheated. She not only hurt me but ruined our kid's lives. I can't live with the fact that the love of my life and the mother of my children was actually a heartless monster. It breaks my heart and makes me furious that this possibility is likely gonna happen! Well, that's just what I think. It feels like everyone's a cheater, I know I'm being irrational but it's seriously hard for me to think rationally. I'm considering two options now: Either never enter or relationship or commit suicide if my wife/girlfriend does cheat on me.
