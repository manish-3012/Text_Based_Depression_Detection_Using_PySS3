For every problem( even the simplest one), my mind wanders searching for a SUICIDE method. Does anybody here have same thoughts like me?If something doesn't go according to my mind, first solution comes to my mind is "me killing MYSELF".
My thought process is like this==

If I fail my exams, I will kill MYSELF.

If I lose money, I will kill MYSELF.

If I get rejected, I will kill MYSELF.

If I am about to get arrested, I will kill myself.

Simplest of problems, my mind wanders searching for suicide methods.
