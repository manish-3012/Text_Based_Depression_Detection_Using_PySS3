Planning my suicideI have the details planned. My social anxiety have backed me into a corner- almost everyone I know is annoyed with me. I have never known what to do with my life, as I'm not happy or skilled. This may be the best option for me.

I'll make a video for my best friend. I hate to do this to her considering she had a differe t friend commit suicide, but uts for the best. She has a thearapist now, and I know she's step g enough.

I'll stay around a bit longer- clean my room perhaps. I want to get high/drunk at least once in my lifetime too.

All that's left to plan is the method. I've been wondering if taking allergy medication that causes drowsiness would make me less conscious for the ordeal. Dying in my sleep is the dream (no pun intended) so I'd like it to be painless.

I know I shouldn't be thinking this way. Like I'm running out of time, and perhaps I am. 1 year left to fix the mess a bit, then go to sleep.

I would like to seek help. Thinking of calling the national suicide hotline tonight
