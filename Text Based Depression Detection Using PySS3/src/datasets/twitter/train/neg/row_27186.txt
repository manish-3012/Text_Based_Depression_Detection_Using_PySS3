i'm so pathetic i'm seriously considering suicide over a concertthis is probably just the catalyst to how i should feel. i've spent months figuring out fucking everything and trying to get together money to see a concert that might be a once in a lifetime thing for me, and i can't go. i've been a massive fan of a member of the group i want to see for 10 years, over half of my life, and this is the first time he's coming to my state in his career. he's from a different country and this could never happen again. and i'm not seeing it.

i don't have a job because of ocd and body dysmorphia and i had sort of a traumatic experience donating plasma so i couldn't even do that. i accidentally sold ALL my valuable pokemon cards for $10.25, and the clerk didn't even give me the quarter. i cleaned my best friend's house on saturday for money, and it turns out he won't have the money until friday. the concert is literally today late at night. everything has gone wrong. i said to myself this is one thing i am NOT going to miss and i'm going to fucking miss it. i was crying tears of joy and was the happiest i felt in a long time when i thought i was getting the money to go from my best friend.

this was the only thing i was staying alive for. everything is all snowballing and it's one thing after another and i am so tired of being in limbo, not able to live and not able to die. i am so fucking pathetic and right now i'm home alone and feeling so unstable and dangerous and i can't stop crying and i JUST woke up. this is the start of a terrible spiral and i don't even care.
