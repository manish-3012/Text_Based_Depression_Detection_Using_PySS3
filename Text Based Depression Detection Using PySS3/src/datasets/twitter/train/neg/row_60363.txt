Self HarmingDon't know where to start really, this is the first time I've really told**anyone** my problems. 
Anyway, a little backstory, i'm 18 in May this year and currently in college in the UK. Recently i've been getting extremely depressed and really don't see the point of a future as i'm going nowhere.

My grades at college aren't great, i have no career prospects, i'm not really good at anything, as soon as i leave college my current part-time job won't provide me with a suitable amount of income and the thought of even looking for another job just stresses me out so much. I'm a depressed closet-gay with no intention of telling family or friends as i expect a negative outcome.

And now as i type this with 9 burning cuts on my left arms, i'm wondering how easy it would be just to end it all.

I honestly see no point in continuing on with a life that's going nowhere
