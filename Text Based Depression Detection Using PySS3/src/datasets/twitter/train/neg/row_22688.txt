I had my first suicidal thoughtDisclaimer: I'm not actually suicidal, and I'm neither planning nor wanting to suicide.

I have some kind of anxiety issues (not clinical anxiety, not something important), which comes from a bigger source. I'm weak. I'm so damn weak. I have everything someone could want (a lovable family, lots of friends, no medical or economical problems, good grades at school)... but I still have anxiety problems. There's plenty of light all around me, still I only see darkness. Many fires burn trying to make me feel warm, still I feel chill. Everytime something gives me hope for this to change, it turns out to be only an illusion. I have no problems, still I struggle. At this point I've come to the conclusion that all this is my fault, for I am weak. Too weak to not struggle even though I haven't any kind of real problem. And because of my weakness, life seems so hard that yesterday I seriously thought about killing myself by slicing my throat. I now don't think about anything like this, but I'm afraid that this kind of thoughts may return again, and again, and again, until they become my reality. I'm too weak to live, but too afraid of hurting and disappointing others and myself to die. I'm right on the edge of this dark pit and I really don't want to fall... but I don't know if this is enough...
