Parents never realize how much words hurtAccording to my mom my problems aren't real problems. No one, except her, knows real problems. So my constant depression isn't real to her. Acting as the only source of support for my estranged, depressed sister isn't a problem. My brother drunkenly telling me he was or is suicidal isn't a  problem. If only she knew my nephew tried to commit suicide. If only she knew how much she traumatized my niece. 



I wish I could open up to friends more. It's difficult though because you don't want to burden them. It feels like my life is one sick joke. Or maybe I'm being punished for something. Maybe it's both. I know I'm a piece of shit anyway. Further I fall into this cave of generational trauma and curses. The only good is that I know I won't be responsible for passing down more trauma.
