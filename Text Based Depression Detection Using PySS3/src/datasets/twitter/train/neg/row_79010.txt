Depressed and I Have To Interview For My Own Job In Two Weeks.I was diagnosed last May and currently on fluoxetine, and underwent some CBT therapy but have been referred for more intense treatment.

I have to interview for my own job in two weeks time as the company is restructuring, and although I should easily be the best fit, I have severe self doubt and I'm struggling to hold it together.

I've gained weight and honestly feel and look like shit. I'm married with two young children but it doesn't stop me wanting to commit suicide sometimes. I can't seem to get myself out of this rut.
