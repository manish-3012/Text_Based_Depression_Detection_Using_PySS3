I am tired.For the longest time I was the person who everyone went to if they wanted to vent or ask for help or just simply talk. The past few weeks have been very emotionally exhausting. I love hearing people out and helping them feel better, but I'm tired. I'm tired that everyone keeps telling me their problems and never bother asking me about mine. I'm like some kind of disposable toy that you get when you feel bad and get rid of it when you feel better.  I've been well for some time. But something's happening and I don't know how to control my emotions anymore. Every single thing triggers a bunch of negative emotions, including anger. Very bad anger. I get mad at others for messaging me with their problems and I don't want to feel this way. I don't *want* to kill myself but I do. It's weird to explain. Maybe I just want to be gone for a while. Run away somewhere and heal my soul. Sorry this is all over the place. I'm bad with my thoughts but I wanted to write this somewhere. I know how bad my thoughts and emotions can get and I was thinking of seeing a doctor about it. But I can't go there alone without parents and my mother didn't really care about this when I told her that I have some emotional issues. I'm very tired of feeling this way. I want to run away from these emotions but I can't.
