I hate myselfHi I'm a guy who likes to dress in drag, I have autism, ied and add though the add doesn't affect me anymore

I'm writing a long book and once I'm done with it and it's published I'm thinking about ending it, I have no other reason to live

I tried to isolate myself from my friends to make it easier on them

What do I do reddit
