My car feels like a trap.I've been struggling with thoughts of suicide for going on 5-6 months now. The thoughts and planning are becoming so frequent, several times almost every day.

 It seems like where it happens the most is in my car. When i get in to go some where, I start to zone out. I fantasize about speeding up to as fast as my car will go and wrapping myself around a tree or street light. No pain, just over.
