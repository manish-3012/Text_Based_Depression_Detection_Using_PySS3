Why am I so selfish?I want to enjoy life like you do.. but I don't. As much as I try I just can't. My brain is just not functioning right. 

What do you say to someone like me?
I don't want to be in meds again because it kept me weak and lazy. 
I've tried for my son's and husband sake. I can't. I had to fake so many things in my life. I had to be happy for others while I was dying inside. My son now lives in a different state living his best life and I'm so proud of him. He's 22 and a culinary graduate. His dreams are now in motion and here I am thinking about ending everything because my head my brain is unbalanced. I'm trying to hold on but those voices in my head are winning. I'm desperate but I have to keep quite around here because I'm not understood by anyone. How can I be depressed while living how I live? That's what i get from people that i reach out to that are the closest to me. Well I know I'm supposed to be happy. I know I have many blessings. I don't know why my brain isn't responding to what is supposed to be my happiness. I know how I sound but this is the best I can do to explain it. I just want it to end! I struggle everyday to get me through one more day. ðŸ¤ 

I wanted to let things out my chest to anyone listening out there. Trust me..here I can't get a word in without been criticized by my mental issues. I'm clinically diagnosed with Persistent Depressive Disorder among others. My family called this idiotic and when am I ever going to get over it. Regardless that they know exactly what happened to me. I cannot fake it any longer. I'm afraid that some how I will find the strength to do it. I don't want to disappoint anyone but I feel like I'm losing this battle. I can't hold strong any longer.
