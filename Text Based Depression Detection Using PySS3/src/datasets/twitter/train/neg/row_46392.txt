Troubled mindI am a 25 year old male with depression and suicidal thoughts that wax and wane for the past 3 years. I feel I am unable to deal with the stresses life brings me. I feel so inadequate and useless despite being relatively smart in school and having a degree in chemistry . I feel I'll never be able to achieve the only dream I have of becoming a doctor. This brings me down so much that I have contemplated killing myself many times . I know that many people will think I am much better off than they are and I probably am. But even where I am I constantly do battle with toxic thoughts that keep coming back. I sometimes wish I wasn't alive anymore so I won't be able to let anyone down in the future. I have the means to get it done. My family really loves me and I shouldn't be crying like a little bitch and appreciate their love. SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH MY BRAIN! I'm not the same person I used to be.
