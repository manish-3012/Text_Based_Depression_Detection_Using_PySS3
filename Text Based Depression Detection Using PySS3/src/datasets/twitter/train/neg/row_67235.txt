Would you be interested in an alternative kind of support group, run by ourselves?Iâ€™m writing up formal info but I want to see if thereâ€™s any interest here rn in the concept at all?
Feel free to reply or message or ignore 

The basic concept is travel, try to support each other,  try to have fun and try to get away from suicide. All we can do is try. 

If I could form a group Iâ€™d also interested in creating websites, social media pages, forums (non-compulsory) and such for those who wonâ€™t travel.
