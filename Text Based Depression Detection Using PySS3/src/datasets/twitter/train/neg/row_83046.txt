I HAVE TO APPEAR FOR AN EXAM TO GET HIRED AND I HAVE JUST 4 DAYS TO PREPARE FOR ITI'M SORRY FOR CAPS BUT I'M FEELING REALLY ANXIOUS.

FEELING LOW FROM PAST FEW DAYS, DEPRESSED SINCE YEARS. I HAVEN'T REALLY ACHIEVED ANYTHING IN MY LIFE SO FAR. GOT NO ONE WHO COULD LISTEN ME, IT'S NOT LIKE I NEED SOMEONE BUT WOULD BE BETTER IF I HAD SOMEONE. I DON'T HAVE EVEN A BIT OF ENERGY TO EXPLAIN WHAT'S IN MY MIND. I JUST KNOW I'VE TO PASS THIS EXAM AND I'M GOING TO DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO MAKE IT THROUGH THIS JOB. I JUST GOT 4 DAYS, I DON'T KNOW IF I'LL BE ABLE TO MAKE IT OR NOT. I DON'T KNOW IF I EVEN HAVE THAT MUCH KNOWLEDGE TO PASS THIS EXAM BUT I'M GONNA TRY MY LEVEL BEST BUT AT THE SAME TIME I FEEL LITTLE FUCKED IDK WHY
