I've decided to never commit suicide because I prefer my surroundings to be happy, keeping my life is my gift to themI'm realising that I would have been long dead if I wouldn't have had any family. Not because they're any support, just because I don't want to fuck their lifes up. To be honest, this takes some great weight of my shoulders, as I'm doing a good deed every day just by waking up.
