I want to end it, but Iâ€™m so scaredEverything is going wrong and itâ€™s all my fault. Iâ€™m failing all my classes in college, I donâ€™t have any motivation to work or even do the things that used to bring me joy like reading or writing. Iâ€™ve racked up so much credit card debt by trying to eat my problems away, making myself even more obese than I once was. Most of my friends stopped talking to me after high school. It seems like Iâ€™m the only one who attempts to make plans to hangout or reach out to talk. 
I want to get help, but I canâ€™t afford it. A mental hospital would put me back thousands, therapists and psychologists all have waiting lists, and even without them I still couldnâ€™t afford it. The campus psychologist wonâ€™t email me back, I think theyâ€™re all booked, but I havenâ€™t gotten a response so I could be wrong. I hate talking to people about all this shit, and the suicide hotline has done me more harm than good. 
Itâ€™s not the pain of dying that scares me, itâ€™s what comes after. I have a sort of romanticized thought of being a ghost or spirit. Watching all my friends and family live their lives and seeing what comes next for them while I can just sort of exist without all the pain Iâ€™m feeling now. Iâ€™m scared if there being nothing. Iâ€™m not religious, but I do believe in ghosts, but what if Iâ€™m wrong? I canâ€™t comprehend the thought of my consciousness just being gone, and it absolutely terrifies me. I wish there was some sort of concrete evidence so I know what will happen.
