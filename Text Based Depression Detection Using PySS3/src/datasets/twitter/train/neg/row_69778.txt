It never ends.I've dealt with clinical depression and anxiety  since I was 13, diagnosed at 14, now 19 and I thought leaving my incredibly toxic town would help drown out my depression, oh was I wrong. I've dealt with suicidal thoughts for the past 6 months since turning 19 and everyday they just seem to be getting worse, I have no friends, no family and no social life and I'm trapped in this new city with no escape. I live with my bestfriend but if I would talk to him about my issues or what's bothering me he'd push it away as, Oh I have it worse than you, and I get he's in a shitty situation but it's toxic that he doesn't attempt to better himself in anyway. I just want to end it or at least leave
