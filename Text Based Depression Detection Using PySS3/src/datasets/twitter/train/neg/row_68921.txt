My parents don't think i want to kill myselfMy parents are what I'd categorize as verbally abusive, but only when I try to outright disagree with them on something. My mom is mostly the one at fault, but whenever I try to go to my dad for help, he always takes her side. My only solace is my older sister, and she's leaving for college this year. I don't know what to do. I told my parents I wanted to die and they laughed and said I'd get over it. I guess I don't really want to die, I just want to be happy and that seems like the easiest way to go about it.
