ConfessionI just want to let people know. Especially those over 25. I never wanted to grow up and it never has and never will appeal to me. With that, I want y'all to know that some of us just want to be 18 forever. I don't want to be like you. I don't like you. Not everyone wants to suck their boss' cock for the rest of their life. Some of us just want to have fun and be young that is it. I'm saying this cause I'm sick of people wanting me to be mature. I'm a 22 year old freshmen and I just want the experience of an 18 year old. That's all I'm asking. I don't want my college experience to be different. Just respect my wishes. I like my 18 year old freshmen roommates and you know what, lying about my age has done wonders and if you have an issue with it, that's your problem. Lying about my age has allowed me to be a kid again; I don't want to be an adult. I want to be a normal college kid. There's a reason why I hate being around older college students even though I'm technically am one. I hate people and definately those who are "mature". So to sum it all off, I don't live to get a job. I live to be youthful and fun. So to those especially who have surrendered to adulthood to simply fuck off.
