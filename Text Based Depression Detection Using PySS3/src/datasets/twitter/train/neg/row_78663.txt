On a highI come back to this sub because I want to remember how low I had got. So I can rejoice in the high that I have now. I was in a pretty dark place. Those were close times and my mental totem got me through it. My pain is not so bad,  and I feel there has been a behavior change. It's a positive one and I'm happy for it. However vague or accurate my feelings are to you the reader I hope you're headspace is low I hope its met with an equally opposite high. And hopefully in not to late a time.
