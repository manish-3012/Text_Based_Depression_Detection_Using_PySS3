I'm doneI'm completely done. I might kill myself. I've been self harming alot lately and i can't do it anymore. I have no friends, I'm depressed, I don't see the point. My parents dont get it neither. They say "Why are you like this?" or "Stop crying!" and it's tiring me out. I'd rather be dead than continue living this life.
