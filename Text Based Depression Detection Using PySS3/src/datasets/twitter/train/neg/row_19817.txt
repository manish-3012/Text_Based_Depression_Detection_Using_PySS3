If i jump out from the 10th floor can i have a chance to die?Here in europe (atleast where i live- very small town) we dont have a 30floor building or higher 
My only chance is this.:/ atleast there is concrete below. 
No i dont really have other options if i dont want to suffer or if i dont want someone else to suffer because of me. (like jump front of a train or something) 
We cant get guns there, i have no access to medical drugs... i could slit my wrist but i have very bad panic attacks so maybe while i do it i change my mind and i get panicked or something. So i guess the jumpimg is the best alternative for me.
