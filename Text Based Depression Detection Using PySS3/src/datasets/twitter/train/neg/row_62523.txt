Depressed after I stopped taking my medsI became severely suicidal and depressed in February/March this year, though I struggled with it for a few years before, but not to the same degree. I was in a psychiatric hospital and started on 25 mg Sertraline and then moved up to 50 mg. My psych wanted to higher my dose but I convinced her that I was fine on 50 mg. I also had the implant/implanon (birth control) in but got that removed because the doctors thought that could have been the reason for my depression. I stopped taking my meds at once over a month ago and my therapist was fine with it. I was doing well up until now but I can feel my depression coming back. Do you think it's a delayed reaction from not taking my meds? Has this ever happened to you?
