i ruin everythingi got way too drunk and destroyed my relationship. i barely even remember it. i poured out the rest of my alcohol down the sink this morning. iâ€™m supposed to leave for work in 5 minutes but i just wanna curl up in a ball and die. i shouldnâ€™t have seen my batshit insane sister and i shouldnâ€™t have drank with her. i feel so worthless and stupid and used. i always manage to find away to ruin things and push him away. i deserve to die.
