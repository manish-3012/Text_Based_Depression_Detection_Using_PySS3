Feeling really low and have a planHey everyone, just posting here to try to get this off my chest, the last 2 days have been hell. Wife and me got in an argument and she got in my face like she normally does and shoves me around but this time a switch flipped and I shoved her back. She called the cops, I got arrested. 
    
One of the cops is her friend so as soon as I heard his name I knew I was fucked. I can't go with in 100 meters of her. We have 2 kids one is 4 and the other will be one in a few days. I never thought I'd miss my own sons birthday. And I know she is going to make it as hard as she can to see the kids.

I feel so horrible and shitty for our oldest to have to go through this. He loves me so much that the last time we got into a fight and I spent the night away he was having panic attacks that I wasn't there him, now I don't even know when I'll see him next.

I've noticed a really tall bridge by where I'm staying over a river and every time I walk past it I picture myself jumping off. I haven't went on the bridge yet because I know as soon as I do I'll jump. 

I'm so sorry to my kids. I love you guys so much. Daddy will love you so much no matter what happens to me, make me proud boys, be better man then me.
