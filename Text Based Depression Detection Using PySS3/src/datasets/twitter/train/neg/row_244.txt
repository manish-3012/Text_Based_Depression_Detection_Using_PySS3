A Hopeless LifeI.... im a 13 years old kid, i know you might think i was some sort of emo or troll or anything.. but i just really need to get this out of my chest, so i live in indonesia, i'm a student last week i have a finals that will indicate if i was going to stay in my grade or goes up from my grade(im so sorry for my bad english) but the problem is my school uses some kind of server to store the grade, i studied really hard i even stay up late just to study and memorize, the first day i was confident, i answered every question it was easy, i check every number from 1-50 until i was sure im gonna get an a, so i press "send" and i wait.... Until 1 or 2 minutes later i got an F and no im not making this up, and looks like i will not make it to the next grade, my family was very strict my parent put a lot of trust in me and looks like im gonna dissapoint them... again, look i know im a dissapointment so don't waste your time telling me that in the reply, i just dont know, i know that my family are gonna take all of my facilities including my PC which i use to Write novels,making a 3d models and edit video, Basically my hope for survival, i know this world is a harsh place, and i can't stop what i was doing with my PC or i will end up a beggar, and if i did not make it to the ninth grade i will lose all my friend, love from my parent, and maybe even my sanity, so looks like suicide was the only way i could escape, or maybe not, i don't know, I Just Wanna Die
