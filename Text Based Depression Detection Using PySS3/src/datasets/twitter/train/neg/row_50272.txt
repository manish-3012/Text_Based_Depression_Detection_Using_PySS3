I hate myself.I do not blame others for not liking me because I hate myself. I am not worth liking because I am good for nothing. I can not do anything except wasting my time and time of people who are forced to stay in my life. I wish I was a better person. I wish I could love myself. I wish I had a restart button to start everything again and not do the mistakes that I have done. I am constantly running away from myself but I end up finding me again. Sometimes I feel that I am born to be humiliated. I am born to bear the pain.
