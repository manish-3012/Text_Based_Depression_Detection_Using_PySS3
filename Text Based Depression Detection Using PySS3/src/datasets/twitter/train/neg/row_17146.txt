2020 is such a messI really lost myself this year . Lost my self control , sense of happiness and hope . It was like all of my bad years combined and made a big combo , Ä±am literally living on the autopilot mode right now . I cant silence my emotions anymore , they are keep controlling me and i hate this , i cant control myself anymore . I started to act really cringy on this year, i hate this , i hate this . 

I dont really know where Ä±am going to , i lost myself in the something  unknown . I sometimes asking myself that wtf Ä±am doing ?  or why act like this ? 
But I even dont know the answer . I feel like a disgrace and i ashamed by myself .  I had many plans to improve my health , my emotional life but i ended becoming more  cringy and confused person .  Ending like this wasnt on my plans . Long story short 
2020 is such a mess . I hope next year will be much better than this , i hope we will find a little serenity , healing and peace . I hope Ä±t will get better for all of us .
