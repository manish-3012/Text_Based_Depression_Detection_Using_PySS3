I dont know why I feel this wayI think about killing myself every single day. In fact, multiple times a day. I dont know why. Ive got Good friends, great grades, Ive got a loving family, and anything you might want. But I still feel like shit. I dont know why. I have gotten this feeling that life is pointless. I will study for another 6-7 years until I get a job, and from there I will just work until I die.

The same thing, day in, day out. For the rest of my life. 

If things come to the worst, I kill myself. What are the consequences? Sure, my family will greive. They are the main reason I havent done it. My friends? They will be fine after a year if not less. I will have no legacy, even if I kill myself now I will have the same legacy as if i were to die at 80. None. I will never be special, who is? 

Maybe i need to vent, i dont know

I want to seek help, but im scared about How my family would react, theyve already got enough going on in their lives.
