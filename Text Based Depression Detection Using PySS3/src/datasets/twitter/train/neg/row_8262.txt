Just want someone to listen and help me a littleLately I have no interest in doing anything, I dont meet my friends because I dont see a profit in it, I dont study because I dont see a long term profit of it too and the hobbies that I was using to help me to distract myself are starting to fail in their duty.

All my problems started really soon in my Life, my family is very catholic and I had the luck of borning bisexual, not a very good combination as you will guess. This Made me think that I should have borned as a girl, everybody will accept me easier, as Girls love boys, but thats not the center of this post.

Sometimes I have the notion that nobody likes me, and nobody will do, I dont talk about love, I talk about friendships and family. I started wondering "what would happen if I comit suicide right now, how everybody will react?" And this throughts became more serious in the time. At the point of spending long nights awake to Plan all the steps, writing letters, etc. I have boxes filled up with those letters. Explaining why for example.

The only Hobby that I already practice is OSDeveloping, I love it, but I'm scared if someday my apparent only distraction dissapears.

Any advices? Want to Talk? Thanks in advance.
