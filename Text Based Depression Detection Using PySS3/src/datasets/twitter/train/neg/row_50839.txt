what are the most quick, painless pills to die from?I have bottles of Tylenol, Asprin, Acetaminophen, Ibuprofen, Benadryl and some others. What would be the most painless or harmless? If I survive I donâ€™t want to be left with liver or heart problems. I donâ€™t want to be hooked up to machines, i just want to die quick. I donâ€™t want to be vomiting blood for hours before dying.

I tried taking Benadryl a few years ago when I was 12, all it did was make me hallucinate and I unable to move properly for a few hours. Maybe I didnâ€™t take enough? How much would be enough to die?
