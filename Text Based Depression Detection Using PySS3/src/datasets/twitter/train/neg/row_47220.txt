Money...I lost my job yesterday. Iâ€™m negative 800+ in m bank account with no money and bills weekly. I have no money for rent and itâ€™s halfway through the month. I am too depressed and way too anxious to get a job and keep it. I donâ€™t even really want to kill myself but I feel I need to to get out of this shithole of a life Iâ€™m in.
