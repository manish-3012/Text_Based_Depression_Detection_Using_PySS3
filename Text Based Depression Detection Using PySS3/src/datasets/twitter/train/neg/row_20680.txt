Everything is crumbling around me. I just feel..apathy? Why am I here?TW: mentions of abuse and incest 

My university went online because of the pandemic, and everything is starting to close down in my city. My supports are backing out, I have no routine. The city is a mess, people panicking or partying. My mother doesn't want to see me because she's afraid of getting sick. I can't see my dog, he lives with her. People tell me to make my own routine, to get out of the house, to get out of bed...but for what? 

I've come to realize all that was holding me together were my supports, school, my routine, the people around me. Now that they are all gone, what is the point?

I can't enjoy anything, it all seems pointless when the world is going to shit. Why am I still here?

There is nothing in this life to be happy for. Why am I still here?

My birthday is coming soon. I had so many plans, all stripped away. That's how life is, it just takes from you. I've had so much taken from me. Years of abuse, attempts at my life, nonconsensual incest. I kept living because somehow people convinced me there was something to live for, that I wasn't dead yet.

I don't even feel sad. I just feel apathetic. Nothing matters. Everything is meaningless. I feel empty. I feel dead already. Why not just end my life here? Just say it was because of the fucking virus. People are dying everywhere, I am nothing.
