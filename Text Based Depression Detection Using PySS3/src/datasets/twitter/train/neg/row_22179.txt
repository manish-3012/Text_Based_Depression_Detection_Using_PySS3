Looking for a reason to liveTeenage male here. Decent grades but nothing to be proud of, lackluster facial features, underweight, terrified of any and all social interaction, lost any and all hope for a bright or fulfilling future, all Joy has lost from my life, only apathy, jealousy, fear and sadness. I don't see why I shouldn't just end my painful existence other then im scared of death.
