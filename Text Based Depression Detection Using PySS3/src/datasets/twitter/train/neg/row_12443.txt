Is love even real?

I've been battling with severe depression and suicidal ideation since I was a young teen and when I met my husband I thought I finally had something to live for. 

But when the love of your life cheats on you it feels like everything is so worthless

I dont even care anymore that he doesn't love me, even if I loved him with every bit of my soul. 

I guess this is the perfect reason to leave this heartless uncaring universe. 

Just leave this earth being measly, weak, and broken hearted to join the comfy oblivion.
