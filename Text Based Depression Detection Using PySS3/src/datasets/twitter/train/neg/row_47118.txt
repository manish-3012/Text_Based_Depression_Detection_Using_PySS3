I donâ€™t even know when to take my suicidal thoughts seriously anymoreIâ€™ve been suicidal for such a large portion of my life that I donâ€™t believe myself when I consider it. I have a plan tomorrow, to go to the nearby hospital at 12 and jump off because I know I can access the roof, but I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s high enough for me to die. Someone did it a few years ago and got airlifted, and I donâ€™t want to be a vegetable if I fail. 

That seems pretty serious. I donâ€™t feel like itâ€™s worth calling the Suicide Hotline because I know I wonâ€™t do it. I guess I wonâ€™t. 

Iâ€™m just in so much pain. Thereâ€™s no way out. My girlfriend got pretty mad at me when I told her, and I guess I get it. I wish she wasnâ€™t angry but I know sheâ€™s only scared. Iâ€™m scared too.
