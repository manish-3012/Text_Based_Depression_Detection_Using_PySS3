Iâ€™m not meant to surviveWhen I talk about being suicidal, people dismiss me with â€œyouâ€™re so young! things will get better for you!â€ But then I hear stories about people who live to be 40, 50, 60 and are still miserable. Why should I spend decades just hoping things might get better when I know they wonâ€™t? 

Iâ€™ve also heard it said that people who die young werenâ€™t meant to survive. If Iâ€™m not meant to live, why fight to keep suffering? Everything in my life is awful and on a downward trend, so itâ€™s not unreasonable to want this pain to end. And donâ€™t give me that BS about â€œsuicide doesnâ€™t end the pain, it just gives it to others.â€ No one cares for me now, and although theyâ€™ll pretend when I die, within a month theyâ€™ll have forgotten me. 

Honestly, the only thing keeping me from walking into the woods and blowing my brains out right now is knowing that someone would have to cover my shift at work. But Iâ€™ve asked for a week off next month, which will be plenty of time for me to die and be replaced without incident.
