I wanna die. I feel like my life is too much of a burden.I can't do some of my classwork because of me being in physical, occupational, speech, or behavioral therapy. So, how do I kill myself without letting anyone know about it? 

Remember, I want to either kill myself or severely injure myself without being hospitalized.

There are: 
No guns in my household
No good knives to start cutting myself. (Is a machete good? Because I want to SUFFER OR DIE)

I'm thinking of buying sleeping pills for Suicide.
