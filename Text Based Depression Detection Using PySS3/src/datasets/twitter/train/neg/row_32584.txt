I'm neutralStreee free, neither happy and neither sad. Just lost middle of nowhere in life not knowing what to do. I'm agnostic and I seem to be accepting things without judging when I smoke weed. But when I'm sober I don't accept anything and think too deeply about everything. Suicide is an option for me at the moment.
