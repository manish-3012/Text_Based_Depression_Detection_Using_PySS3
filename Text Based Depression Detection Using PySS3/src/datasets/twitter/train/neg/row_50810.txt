I should have died the day you did. I've tried these last 4 years, but I can't anymore.It just gets worse. I just miss you more. I'm so alone. I am so fucking alone in this world, I'm basically still a kid, and nobody on this entire earth gives a fuck i exist. I am such an afterthought, so inconsequential. I have worked so hard, all for nothing. People naturally distrust and do not like me. Something about me is disgusting and malformed, and it has left me deserted on my own fucking wasteland. The day you died I became alone. I have never known love since you left me. I am so tired, Dad. I am so tired of trying to make things better. They're so bad without you. I wish you could see it, if you could see it now you would understand. I know you dont. You dont see me, you dont see the suffering. When we die, we die. You're not with me. I'm alone. I cant be alone any more. I have to do it now, I cant take the screaming any more. I'm sorry, i know you said not to , but i cant fucking take it another day. I'm sorry Dad. I'm so sorry
