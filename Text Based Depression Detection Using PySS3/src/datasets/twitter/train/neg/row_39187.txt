So tired of being tired and numbI donâ€™t really know why Iâ€™m writing this, I guess so I can get it off my chest without talking to someone I know personally. I feel so numb. Nothings really brought me great joy or great sadness in a while. Iâ€™ve been doing drugs more frequently lately just so I can remember what itâ€™s like to feel something and now Iâ€™ve become dependent on them. I never realized till now how good sadness can feel, I kinda miss it. I donâ€™t even hate myself, Iâ€™m a very attractive 20 year old girl who would have a lot of potential if I could get out of bed.... but I canâ€™t. Iâ€™m just existing right now., and I feel like life is getting less and less worth living every day. Which sucks to think to myself because I am aware of how insanely lucky I am to have been given the life and opportunities Iâ€™ve been given and I feel like a ungrateful cunt for not taking advantage of it. But I just canâ€™t. My anti depressants stopped working so I stopped taking them so now Iâ€™m kinda just deciding if I want to take the next step and rest for good. Thanks for reading
