Ibs-d and ocd ruined my life and I want to kill myself because of it.First of all it can be sound funny please don't make fun of me because everything is real.  


5 years ago when I was 15 this shit started. I  had diarrhae attacks they never stopped. I was in highschool and diarrhe was everyday. In school I was always in toilet than I go to the doctor they tested my everything and they told me I have ibs-d and there is no cure. I developed and anxiety about my situation, my anxiety was about shitting my pant in front of my classmates. Than I couldn't go to school I couldn't be around other people.  my family forced me but I couldn't go and I failed one year due to absence. I entered a distance eduacion program for high school. Now I am 20 years old I am much more better about my situation I can go to college. but I feel like my life has been destroyed. I don't have friends. Also none of my friends in highschool tried to reach me. I am always thinking about how I wasted my teenager years. And want to kill myself.
