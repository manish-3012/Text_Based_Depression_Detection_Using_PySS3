This is stupid but...I ran out of smokes today, no money for more. Last time I quit cold turkey I ended up in the hospital on suicide watch and they tried to put me in a psych hospital for two weeks but I didn't have transportation. I'm kinda scared. My wife keeps getting mad when I talk about how anxious I am because she's going through shit and she feels it's my fault for even starting... Which is true, but fuck. I'm scared.
