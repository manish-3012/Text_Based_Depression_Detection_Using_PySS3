CrosshatchingI start to draw at a very young age 

I, somehow, find the feeling of crosshatch pleasuring, by any pen on paper, by chalk on sidewalk, by pointing my finger in the air, and for the past two years, by pocket knife on my arm. I felt relieved after cutting it neatly, the pain isnâ€™t much, just enough to keep me alive, another day. 

the other day when my housemates and I played board game, the wound was accidentally showed up and one of them laughed, said â€œthis youngster is seeking for attentionâ€œ. I didnâ€™t realise my arms can make somebody uncomfortable until then, they think I try to get their attention, but I just simply do it for myself. Will they understand?
