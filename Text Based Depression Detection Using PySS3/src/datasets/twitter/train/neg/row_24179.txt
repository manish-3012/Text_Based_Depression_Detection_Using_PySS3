I'm waiting a week, the day after my 22 birthday.I turn 22 on Sunday and I've done nothing with my life. I failed college three times because of my depression, been unemployed for two years because I guess no one wants to hire a useless slob, and I have no friends. The last time I was "social" was two months ago (October 5, maybe?). All I do these days is sit around and feel self-piteous. It ends soon.
