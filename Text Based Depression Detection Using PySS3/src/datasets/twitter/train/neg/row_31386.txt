No reason to live anymoreNearing the end of college and don't have a job lined up. Even though I did alright I feel as though I am inadequate for the labor market. It feels like society just doesn't want me around anymore and unemployment is their way of telling me that I am not of sufficient (or any) value to them. I just want to fade away before having to live with the shame of having no prospects after school.
