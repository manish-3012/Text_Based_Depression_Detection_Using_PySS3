I just want to be dead.Simple as that. I spend every waking moment wishing I were dead. Iâ€™ve thought about suicide, I just havenâ€™t come up with the will to do it yet.
Iâ€™m beaten down, emotionally broken, mentally destroyed, and in constant physical pain. Whatâ€™s even the point anymore? Why do I still have to be here?
