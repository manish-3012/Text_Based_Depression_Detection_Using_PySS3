I'm writing my notes to my friends and family. This one is for you, the strangers who were so kind to me Thank you!This is goodbye internet! I will miss you! I'm heading into the great dark soon enough. I'll try to tell you what's on that mysterious other side. I'll miss you strangers. You were always here for me and you were my best friends I'm sorry for doing this to you as well. Please forgive me and stay strong. Find your happiness for me. I did not mean for this to happen
