I'm tired of life.It's been about 8 years. 8 years since I started dealing with this shit. I'm only 19, turning 20 in a few months. My childhood was fucking ruined. My "bright future" was destroyed. And now my life is worse than ever and I don't know how I'm going to make it much longer.

I have literally no friends (not figuratively literally, actual literally). Only one hobby that I'm starting to do less and less. Just dropped out of college after being put on academic probation for failing too many classes. I eat prepackaged garbage like cookies all day because I can rarely muster up the energy to make myself real food. My hair is matted. My teeth are probably rotting away because I brush them once a day, in the morning, during the best of times. My emotions are all fucked up. I've started hacking away at my arms with the blade from a cheap razor just to feel something and to get more "comfortable" with the idea of cutting for when I finally do it for the last time...

I just don't know what to do. The few therapists in my shitty town are awful and I can't drive to the ones further away because I never bothered to get a license.

I always was able to push away these thoughts because of how much it would destroy my parents and siblings if I died, but now I'm even caring less and less about that. I'm just so done.
