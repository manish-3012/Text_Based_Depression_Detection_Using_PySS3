Also its scary how messed up the world is. 24F. can't even hold a temp job right now. my bipolar meds have me all over the place but things are worse when I don't take them. I live with my grandma. no car. want to start college this summer for machine tool technology but makes me nervous because I may not be smart enough to grasp the info. Been single for 3 1/2 years. Bipolar, major anxiety, overweight, and ugly face. the world scares me because of all the crime and death and corruption I see on the news and on the internet. The only thing holding me back is I don't want to hurt my sisters. They are in 10th grade and are doing so well and planning on doing dual enrollment at the local community college. I just know they are going to be successful. They have so much promise and if I kill myself I could mess all of that up for them. I still think about killing myself everyday.
