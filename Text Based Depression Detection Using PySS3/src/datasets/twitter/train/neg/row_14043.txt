Life is pain, then you die.Logging in one of my throwaways for this:

This past Monday at my kids' school someone said about them "handle with care, dreams inside".

Holy fuck I had to get out. Can't stop crying since.

All of my dreams are so, so far beyond reach. I'm a colossal disappointment to life, despite my best efforts. All that remains ahead is slowly falling in the quick sand my life is. Looking the happy days fade in the horizon. Completely powerless to do anything.

And yet, I cannot leave. Oh I want it so bad. But can't. I just fucking can't.
