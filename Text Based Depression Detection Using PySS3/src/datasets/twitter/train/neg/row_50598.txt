i just want to go to sleep and never wake back upi was doing so well. i was finally with a good therapist and my meds were helping and i got into graduate school. it was going fucking perfect and then this goddamn fucking virus came and ruined everything. i got forced out of my apartment and have to live in my shitty hometown on the other side of the state from everyone that i love and actually cares about me. i've spiraled into a depressive episode and i'm self harming again even though i'm 24 fucking years old and i shouldn't be doing this shit. i get screamed at every day about how i'm lazy and disrespectful because i can barely force myself out of bed to do the bare essentials anymore.

i just want to fucking die. i want to go to sleep tonight and never see tomorrow. i don't even want to try to kill myself because i'll just fuck that up again and it'll be another thing that gets used to show what a piece of shit i am. i'm just tired.
