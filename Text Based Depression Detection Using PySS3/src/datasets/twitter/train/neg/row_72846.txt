the "black pill" has driven me into despair. Eagerly awaiting death now(the black pill is an "incel" set of ideas and proofs,showing objective human beauty exists)

so ,yes,i know this is an EVIL idea, but I think \*hiearchical\* beauty exists within humans. And I feel im not in the upper part of this hiearchy;this really prompts me to consider death. There are things I can improve; i can be hiearchically strong,rich and powerful.l I can make choices and deeds that influence several factors;but how do I change my face?

&amp;#x200B;

I dunno what to do. I cant cope with some wanker being hieararchically more attractive than me,who works so hard to be a good person.
