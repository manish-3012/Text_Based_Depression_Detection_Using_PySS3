People dont care about me till Im depressed?No one cares about me until I tell them I have depression and suicidal thoughts. Why do people want me alive anyway? Is it cause they need me, or that they want to see a failure so they can laugh at me. I think this could be it.

 I'll edit when I thought about it. Or ill make a new post...
