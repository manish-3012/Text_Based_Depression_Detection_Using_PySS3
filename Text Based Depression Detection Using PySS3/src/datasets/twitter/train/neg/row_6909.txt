Im DoneFucked up my world. Work is going alright, but i fucked up everything with my world, my girlfirend.

Barely got any family, shes been my family for the past 3 tears, ger family has been Mine literally. 

But now i fucked up. I was drunk and responsed to girls on Facebook messenger in an extremely innapropriate way. 

Now she Hates me, for all of the right reasons. 
I want to work things out, but she barely does.

I dont know what i should do if its over.

I lost all my close friends, all my friends are her friends. My family barely exists and i cant find the Will to live any more....

This is the third time During the past year where  theese thoughts attack me. Allthough this attack is stronger than ever...

I ruined my life.
I dont want to exist anymore without her
What the fuck should i do?
I just literally want to die right now....
