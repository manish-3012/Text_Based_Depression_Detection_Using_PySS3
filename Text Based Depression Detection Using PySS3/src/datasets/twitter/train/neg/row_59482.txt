A doomed lifeAnyone else tired of this struggle? I am. All i hoped for was a stable home, a caring family, a long term career, a boyfriend that loves me. None of these after all these years of caring for others and hard academic work and i feel super hopeless, what have i done in life to deserve all this? I've tried to help others out of my way and was always the one fixing everyone else's problems but they all eventually leave me and now i am left here alone. I tried to move on from my family and stayed with my bf for a bit now i have these disgusting scars and bite marks all over me. I'm a low life, not because I haven't tried to strive to be better all my life but because my mom really just wants me to fail in life and die off somewhere. To even get to my status in academics and career wise was tough with this type of mother and not only that, to see her sabatoge it all for me is just disgusting and so hard to bare. No where safe to stay and mom still treats me like shit after all these years of being a good daughter. Jobless and having to stay under a verbally and mentally degrading parent, &amp; also tired of being used as a temp after vigourous job searches, I'm really tired and feel alone in all this and I really hope I can die soon to end this misery. I don't deserve to live, not like this. Thanks for reading.
