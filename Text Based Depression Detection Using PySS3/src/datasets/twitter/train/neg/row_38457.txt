I just tried to kill myselfAs the title states I just tried to kill myself, I know I have people who care about me I'm just having a hard time believing that they do, I hear voices when I've had good days telling me that I did shit I didn't do and that I shouldn't even be able to walk because of what they think I am.  I get told by everyone new I meet that I'm a total sweetheart doesn't say the shit I do about people and myself, I degraded myself to the lowest person you can be on this earth just with words that came out of my mouth and I have to pretend that I don't remember what I said to people because it's that nd then there things that my head tell me I did but I didn't because everyone I thought I had harmed is alive and safe it just gets to much on my shoulders those as I can't grasp the reality and make believe in my head
