I wish I was never born...I'm turning 21 soon with 0 friends, a degree with a below average GPA and no job prospects. If I start a new degree they'll look at my GPA which is crap. I see nothing but darkness ahead. My heart feels sick and I want to throw up but can't since I haven't eaten in a while... haven't been able too. Oh and I failed a subject at university. I tried talking to my sister to take my mind of things but she wouldn't talk to me.

The only thing I'm worried about is my parents. They can never survive this. They are very nice and amazing people. One of my brothers already died in infancy. I should have been the child who died.
