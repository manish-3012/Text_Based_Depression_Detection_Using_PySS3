Is this really it?Iâ€™m feeling so lost. I thought I had finally made a friend but I couldnâ€™t have been more wrong. The person who almost single-handedly prevented my suicide just told me they hate me and Iâ€™m presuming he never wants to talk to me again. I considered this person my best friend but I failed them. Just like Iâ€™ve failed everybody else. I am really poison after all... I only hurt and disappoint people. I never wanted to hurt anyone but it seems I canâ€™t help it, Iâ€™m just a selfish, toxic person to the core. I think the best option is for me to take my own life. Everyone would be so much better off without me. 

I got my noose out and Iâ€™ve just been staring at it for the last 20 minuets. I need to die but Iâ€™m paralyzed by indecision.
