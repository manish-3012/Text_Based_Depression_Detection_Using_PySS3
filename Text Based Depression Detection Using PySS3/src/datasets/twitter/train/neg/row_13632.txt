My sister is having suicidal thoughts againThis quarantine, my sister has become distant to us, staying alone in her room almost the whole day and has stopped joining us for dinner, preferring to eat at a different time. Just this week my mom found out through my sister's friend that she's back to having suicidal thoughts. My mom tried to tell her that she meet her doctor again but she refuses. I have never talked to her about this but I really want to help her. Any advice on how to approach her or what to do? Thank you so much.
