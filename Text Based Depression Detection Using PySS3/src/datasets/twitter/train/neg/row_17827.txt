We all feel a way This is the worst Iâ€™ve been and it feels differentLife for me is a constant wave of failure.   Whenever I think things are looking up, disaster strikes.    Iâ€™m just so stupid I wonâ€™t ever be able to pull myself out, no matter the attitude I put on. 
The state is suing me for $60k, garnishing my pay, I pay child support to a one night stand from over 10 years ago.  I didnâ€™t graduate high school, I got my GED though.  I have a gf who seems to just like me around because I accept her anger in my life.  I smoke, I drink, Iâ€™m just another peon at a job.   Nothing Iâ€™ve ever done has worked out for me long term, even though Iâ€™ve investing 5+ years in some things.   Iâ€™ve given up on my dreams.   I live in an apartment with no visible future of improving my living situation.   I have a child due in August but can barely afford to survive.   I compare myself to no one.   I accidentally let my cat, my best friend out and heâ€™s been missing since October.  I face the world with such a positive outlook typically and work so hard but nothing has ever works for me.  here I am, broken, poor, and a monster. I just donâ€™t belong.

Iâ€™m ready.  Thereâ€™s nothing for me in this world.   Itâ€™s almost too late. I give myself one, two days tops.  Unless I see a miracle soon, Iâ€™m done.
