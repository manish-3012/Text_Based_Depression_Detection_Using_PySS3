I'm making sure everyone minimises their contact with me while staying happy so I can kill myself and cause the least amount of stress, and I think I've finally done it.Parents were never an issue, they've got another kid who means far more to them than I ever will, I have no significant other, extended family is either dead or preoccupied with their own issues. My friends all have plenty of other people, my best friend has found someone else, and I am extremely happy for him. There's nobody else I need to worry about, I can kill myself whenever I want now. I'm finally free.
