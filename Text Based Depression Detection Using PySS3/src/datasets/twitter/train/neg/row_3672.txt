Feel unwanted!I have a degree in Political Science , no criminal background or drug history, clean, sober, take care of myself, and yet, I keep on getting rejected from jobs (whether it's a NO or just not getting a response). 25 and no sense of direction. The world just doesn't make sense anymore.

It's very discouraging that I keep getting declined to get a job, but even more so when I keep on having to disappoint others with the bad news, especially when they expect a lot from me. This has affected my relationships with family, friends, girlfriend, etc.

All it takes is one YES to change my own world, but even then, I can't get that. Forget about paying debts or expenses; I'm just trying to make the rent and have food to bring home AT THE BARE MINIMUM and even that I cannot do!

This constant rejection is seriously dwindling my confidence like never before. They say that if you have a roof over your head, food on the table, and family who loves you that you are richer than most of the people on Earth, but I beg to differ. That just sounds a little cliche if you ask me.

I'm just going downward on this slippery slope: I have no car, no job, and apparently, no future. Even the place that was supposed to help me with employment and get proper attire for interviews had my case worker retired and no responses from my referral either. Murphy's law is a serious bitch!

I seriously would like to stay optimistic, but I would be bullshiting myself and those who I come in contact with. I have no use pretending that everything is fine just for someone elses benefit.

I know I'm not the most marketable or versatile person in the world, but I know what I'm worth and people just cannot recognize it. Also, I don't need comforting me by telling me that I'm not alone in this, because it really won't make me feel any better about myself, only worse.
