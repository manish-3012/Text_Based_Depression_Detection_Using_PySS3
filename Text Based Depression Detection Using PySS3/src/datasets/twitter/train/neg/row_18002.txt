Why is it so hard to kill myself?I look up ways to do it and I can't find any that will work without risks of just leaving me braindead.

I guess a gun would work, but I don't know where to find one. It's near impossible where I live to find one. All the attempts fail.

After my ex boyfriend left me I ended up trying to drown myself but it didn't work. I'm tired of just failed attempts to kill myself, I wish there was just some poison I could take but I dunno where to find it either. Can't believe I'm a failure at even killing myself.
