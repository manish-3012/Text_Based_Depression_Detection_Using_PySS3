True feelings about the world we have todayAll I wanted is something that cannot be express through words nor can be seen. True genuine actions and feelings is enough to keep me happy but as I grew older and wiser Iâ€™ve realized that the reality I wanted would never come true. At first I was able to carry the burden of this thing called life and kept moving forward, as I keep pressing on clinging to it the more I see just how rotten the world is and that I couldnâ€™t handle it anymore with fake love and fake loyalty. Suicide has always been in my head and it has never left because its always there for you no matter how lonely you get the thought of it keeps you company. Everyday I always would say to myself â€œI want to kill myselfâ€ or â€œCan I kill myself alreadyâ€ this goes through my thoughts atleast 1000x a day even when going through something that makes me happy. Iâ€™ve given up in this world with rotten people. All I really just want to ask are there still genuine people out there with no motives when they talk to you or use you at all if you have treasure that person with all you can and make sure that he/she is okay because they might just be feeling the same way Iâ€™m feeling as I write this letter not sadness, depression or coming from being hurt. Itâ€™s about knowing that you might be the only person who can be true to oneself and others. Iâ€™m sorry that I couldnâ€™t keep moving forward because underneath the mask all these years I have been in pain and suffering and Iâ€™ve chosen to give up.
