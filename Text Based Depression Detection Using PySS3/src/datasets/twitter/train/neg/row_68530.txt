I feel so lost and aloneI have like 3 friends, one of whom is mad at me now because we had a fight. I feel like no one really understands me. I'm so tired of everything. A few weeks ago I went to the hospital because I was suicidal (my parents brought me). We just sat in the waiting room for 3 hours, then went to a room with a doctor who did fuck all. He asked me if I was okay now, I said no, and he advised me to go to my gp. I asked for help, and I didn't get it.
I really don't think anyone can help me anymore. Not even the hospital. I'm just so tired of being hopelessly depressed.
