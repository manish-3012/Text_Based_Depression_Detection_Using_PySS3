I've created a fake world inside my head to help me cope with stuff, and I've only just fully accepted that and, I'd rather be dead then handle life like thatI've created this whole alternate world where everything is fine and I manipulate everything that is happening in my life, as it happens, to suit this world where everything is okay. I've created fake people based off of real people, I've changed myself and everything that I can to try and match this world in the hopes that it will become real, so that everything is okay.
I can't live like this. I can't do it, it is so fucked up and it is such a bad way of coping and I just can't
