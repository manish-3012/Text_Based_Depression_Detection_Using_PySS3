I have everything, why can't I be happyI hate the feeling of being spoiled or weak, and lately I have been feeling that hard, and I know full well how I have full control of it. I have a loving family that hears me out, a beautiful girlfriend that truly truly loves me and even a sort of direction in life. Hell, I go to a therapist too. But no matter what, sometimes, for no goddamn reason, I just sink into deep sadness and lethargy and I try and exhaust every mental strategy I have to make it better, and nothing works. And when I exhaust the last strategy is when the questions come up.

"Why can't I make do with the beautiful life that I have?"

"If there's no apparent problem, why can't I just think it better?"

"Hell's wrong with me?"

Christ's sake, I would never tell my mom or pops about how I want to end my life, I could never do that to them. But I truly feel like after all I've tried, all the mental strength training, all the purpose-hunting that I've done somewhat successfully, all the getting myself busy, I feel like the only thing left to do is to keep escaping and distracting myself. People tell you, don't escape into video games, movies, etc. but when I force myself not to, when I try to dig into it with my nails, I just find more and more dirt. I can barely get out of bed, until my little sisters come into the picture and give me a reason to smile and talk. 

My only hope seems to be my nearby army recruitment (in my country it is mandatory to some extent, and I am looking forward to it a lot), which will get my mind off it all. 

Anyone else feel like they got all they need and want but are utterly hollow inside?
