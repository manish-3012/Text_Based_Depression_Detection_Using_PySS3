existing is miserablei feel like i've failed every aspect of life. i'm so depressed i can never find the motivation to do school work, so i've failed almost every college class i've tried taking. even when i find the motivation and really try, i still end up failing. i lost my job and had to move back in with my father, who calls me fat and lazy almost every day. i have a boyfriend who doesn't even act like he likes me, in fact he routinely calls other girls hot while we hang out. i have a few friends who only see me as a drinking buddy... they never want to do anything else with me. i feel like i just have nothing going for me and i'm a waste of space at this point. i guess i just needed to get this off my chest here since no one in my life gives a shit about how i feel or what i have to say. sorry for making you read this.
