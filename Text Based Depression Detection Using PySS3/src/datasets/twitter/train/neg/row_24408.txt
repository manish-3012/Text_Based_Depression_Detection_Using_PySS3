I feel like i am a "glitch"The title says it all. I felt like i'm a little glitch that needs to be fixed since the day i started to school. My family, friends and every human being is just too strange for me. I couldn't think like them no matter how much i tried. I can't care about money, i can't care about my future. I can't understand "their struggle". Why they are trying to buy a Mercedes, why they are trying to be rich? Why no one gives a shit about how beautiful moon is? They dont care about music or books or nature, but if you get 1000 likes on a social platform every one of them go CRAZY. No matter how old are they. From 5 to 50, they all got their accounts and smartphones. Always busy with posting about "how happy they are".

Whenever i feel down and alone, i got in to this subreddit. Always writing something but never posting it. Writing thoughts is one of the best methods, it helps a lot. I just want to say thanks guys. Every one of you is a savior in my eyes. 

I hope one day we, glitches, will be free all of this thoughts.
