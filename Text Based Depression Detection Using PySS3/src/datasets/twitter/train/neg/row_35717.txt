When you wake up with thoughts of suicideWhen you wake up and the first thing on your mind after a restless sleep are thoughts of suicide, that's when you know that you're treading deep, foreboding waters. That's when you realise that you'll probably do something sooner rather than later, because the thoughts are incessantly banging at the forefront of your mind.

That's how it is for me, anyway.
