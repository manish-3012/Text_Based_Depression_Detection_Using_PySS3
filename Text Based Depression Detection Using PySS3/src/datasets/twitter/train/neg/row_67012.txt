I was molested at 8, its when my world started to crumbleI wrote this when I was 16, Im now 19


This was the start of my descent into this void that I would never crawl out of. After that I would then go on to endure physical and verbal abuse at home and school. I will never heal. 


â€œShe told me it was just a game
And like a fool i played the fiddle
She told me hush as if it was sane
And followed the steps again
Touch me here i touch you there
Kiss me on the lips
Warning signs would blare
Yet i swallow my pride in sips
Others approached my broken soul
To repeat the same tips
And like a fool I played the fiddle
And let my innocence start to whittle
Down the slope again.
I started to believe the horrid deeds
That it was all a game
I kissed and kissed till i found out that its
A darken lane
That i followed when i was told
That it was all a game

I was told it was a game when I was 8.
I was told it was secret and not to tell anyone.
I was kissed and touched down below and thought it was a game
Why was I such a stupid fool and listened. I was kissed by other people. I kissed other people who knew of the game. Finding out at 11 what really was happening was horrid. I was molested... touched by her. I kissed other people and welcomed it thinking i was cool and popular they would tell me where to touch them, then they would touch me I didnt like it.. yet i feel guilty . Even though i was the one molested. I feel responsible. I was stupid. Why didnt i fight back. Why didnt i say no. Why did i let it happen. Why cant i forget. Why cant i die.

I would never wish this pain on anyone.
I hate anyone who would do this to anyone.
Why did it have to be me?â€
