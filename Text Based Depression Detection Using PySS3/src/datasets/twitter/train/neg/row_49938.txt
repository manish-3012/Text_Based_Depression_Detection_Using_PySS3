Just a few hours left of my existence.I've made my decision, I'm overdosing on tons of different meds in just a few hours now. The end has finally come! All the pain and suffering I face on a daily basis will finally come to an end! I've truly loved all the support I've gotten in this subreddit, but I just can't continue on any longer. Goodbye everyone!
