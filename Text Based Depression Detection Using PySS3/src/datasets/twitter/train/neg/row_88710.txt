Text-based crisis counselingJust curious if there is something like that.  I am fairly nervous about phone calls and would much prefer to be communicating via text.  I'm in Canada, if that matters.

I'm sure my friends are getting a little sick of me coming over every evening because I don't feel safe by myself alone.

So far I have left the sharp objects alone--I don't want to do anything to mess up my roomy's house as he's got a 9 year old.  But hitting myself, breaking my hands, my nose, I am having a hard time controlling my self destructive impulses and I am concerned that I will go further than I intend at any time.  I'm getting pretty friendly with pain again.

I don't want to go back to my local crisis center because I am supposed to return back to work on Monday [I know what a fucking joke].

Anyway yeah somebody to text as a way to distract myself from these impulses and maybe work some shit out would be nice.
