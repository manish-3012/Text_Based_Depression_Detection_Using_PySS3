I don't know what to do anymoreI'm pretty much incapable of doing anything anymore. My depression has gotten the best of me. At this time I haven't showered or brushed my teeth in a good 5 days. I can't complete homework and I can't go to work. I keep on calling in because I just can't get out of bed. I'm running out of excuses. No matter how much progress I seem to make, my depression and PTSD manage to fuck everything up. I was sexually abused as a child and I haven't told anyone in my family. Nobody knows except for my sister, who completely blew it off and thinks I should "just get over it." The holidays just make this worse because now I have to go home to a place where everybody is taking his side and I'm just the person who won't talk to him. I guess I'm just a spoiled brat. I can't do this anymore. I feel so fucking trapped and I'm tired of living like this. I know suicide isn't the way to go but it feels like there's no other choice. This is the only way I can get out of my misery
