I've got some shit to do before i dieI'm feeling pretty bad again lately and thought about suicide again.
What helps me at the moment is a line of a song: "I've got some shit i'm trynna do before I hit the grave." artist is scrim, song's called scars from the album "a man rose from the dead". Good album for me. And damn.. 
I want to die but i have so much things i want to do before. 

I want to surf more powder

I want to stand a backflip

I've got some hills to bomb

I want to fly a wingsuit

I want to watch sunsets

I have people to love

I have people to hate

I want to get hurt

I want to be loved

I want to learn

I want to teach. 

There are thousands of things i wanna do. I don't have the energy now.
But I Fucking Want To Do Those Things. It keeps me going.
Be strong
