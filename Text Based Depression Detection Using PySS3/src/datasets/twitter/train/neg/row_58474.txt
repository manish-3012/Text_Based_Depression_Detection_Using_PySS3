I wish I could get rid of my fear of deathI know most things are quite blunt here but I still feel bad for being blunt.

I'd like to die, obviously it sounds a lot better than what I'm doing rn, it's just easier than it would be to become an adult and have to deal with everything in the world. One problem, I'm so scared of death.

I know no one here would actually tell me a way to become unafraid of it, but still. It just bothers me. I'm done with being depressed in my bed constantly and being pressured about growing up and such. It's just scary for me. On top of it it would be fine cause besides family I have one good friend and a girlfriend. This sounds super narcissistic probably, but whatever. Just getting it out here.
