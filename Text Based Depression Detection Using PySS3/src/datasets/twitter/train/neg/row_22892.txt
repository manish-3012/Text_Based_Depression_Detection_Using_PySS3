Just over a week to goSo for almost a year I've told myself if things weren't better by now I'd kill myself, ending the bad feelings I've lived with every day. I don't know how to feel though. On one hand I've felt relaxed, that I can end things. On the other, I feel worried about hurting my family.

I don't know if I can end it. I feel trapped by life. I wish there was another way, but I know there's not. Therapy and meds had little effect before. I feel completely hopeless.
