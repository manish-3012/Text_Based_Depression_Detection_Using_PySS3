I just don't care anymoreI'm covering myself in scars, I don't care. I just started at a new school last week, I've already lost two textbooks which I'll have to pay for and I don't do any homework or work in class, I don't care. I don't care that I'm getting worse, I don't care about death, I cross the road without looking, I jump off high places just to see how much it'll hurt, I cut and burn myself constantly every day, I'm so fucked up and I don't care. My parents think I'm getting better and they're proud, and I don't care about telling them just how bad I am. Occasionally my anxiety kicks up and makes me freak out because I'm ruining my life, but that just makes me even worse. I'm so broken and lost and empty and insane and useless and a disappointment and I don't know what to do anymore. There's no way out, every time I try to recover I hit a dead end and I don't even have the strength to try and get better anymore. I'm just so lost and I simply don't care about anything anymore.
