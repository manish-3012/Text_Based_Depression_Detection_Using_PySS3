Living after an attemptDoes anyone have advice on trying to feel more human after a suicide attempt? I realized that I do have something to live for, but everything still feels so dull and gray. I feel like physically Iâ€™m living, but thereâ€™s nothing alive inside of me. No passion, no motivation.
