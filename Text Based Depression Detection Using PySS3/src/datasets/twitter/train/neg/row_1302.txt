I thought this was kind of a support group for one another?I know it sounds dumb, I subscribed to this group to connect with others who also are going through dark times and talk in hopes of bringing each otherâ€™s spirits up. Iâ€™m not expecting anyone to save anybody but just talking helps. 

I donâ€™t want to get into details but Iâ€™ve been really scared, sad, and lonely because Iâ€™m considering leaving this world, I even tied my scarf to my door handle to see if it was secure enough to work. I just started seeing a therapist and I plan to go on some meds to help me get out of this rut. I hope it works, I feel like my days are numbered...

I turned to this in hopes to somewhat connect with others but I feel like I get shut down in some posts. Is that just the way it is as Iâ€™m learning here? Iâ€™m kind of a newb to Reddit, too.
