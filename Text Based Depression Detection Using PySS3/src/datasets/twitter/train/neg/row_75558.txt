I'm so fucking tired of everything being a joke.No matter the number of people who believe in my problem or/and take you seriously, just my dad is enough to make everything seem like a joke.
I feel like I'm the most selfish human being necause of him. I want to die so badly, I have low self-esteem, a one friend I completely crushed by rejecting when they told me they love me and the absolute worst dysphoria experience possible.
And yet. And fucking yet. My dad. Everything he says. He... At the same time makes me feel worse, and yet makes it seems like none of this is real or serious. Telling me I'm just selfish. That there's always worst. That I just have to choose not to be sad. Calling my therapy sessions just an hour where I complain.
I hate him. He forced me to undress at the beach. I couldn't take it. Worse thing is I can't complain about him. He doesn't hit me. He loves me, he's proud of me, he takes care of me. But Jesus Christ I've never been this pained by a human being in my entier life.
