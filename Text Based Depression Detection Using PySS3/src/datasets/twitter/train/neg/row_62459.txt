This is just a letter to my familyMom and Stephen, you didn't do anything wrong. I swear you didn't. You guys did so much for me, and I'll never know how to thank you for it. I love you guys so much. And Stephen, you've always been my dad, even if I don't call you that.

Grandma, I love you. You are the world to me, and you always spoiled me rotten. You were there for me whenever I needed you and I love you so much.

Uncle J, you were my role model growing up. I've always wanted to be like you, you always seemed so cool. I love you.

Auntie H, I love you. These past few weeks have been so hard on the both of us, and you were there for me every step of the way. 

Dyl, I don't know what to say here.. You've always been a brother to me. 

Brian, you've always been there for me. You've been a great friend to me all these years.

Joey, I remember hanging out in the junkyard in the little fort we made when we were kids. It was some of the best times of my life.

To everyone I didn't mention.. I love you, but it's time for me to go... I'm so sorry for any pain this causes any of you, but these feelings wont go away no matter what I do. This is getting hard for me to type through the tears, so I'm going to finish rereading to kill a mockingbird and then I'm going to end my suffering. 

I love you all so much, and I'm so sorry for being so selfish..

I've finished my book. Good bye...
