Canâ€™t find a reason to go onI just feel like Iâ€™ve seen enough. I used to look forward to things, and I used that to keep me alive, but I just donâ€™t anymore. I donâ€™t believe that staying alive a few more months to see the next super hero movie is worth it. I canâ€™t convince myself that if I stick around until the next holiday to see my family Iâ€™ll be glad that I did. I donâ€™t see any reason to think that tomorrow will be any better than today. That maybe someday Iâ€™ll have friends to see movies with. That someday I wonâ€™t be an embarrassment to my family. This is as good as it gets, and Iâ€™m okay with that. I need to go away and Iâ€™m okay with that.
