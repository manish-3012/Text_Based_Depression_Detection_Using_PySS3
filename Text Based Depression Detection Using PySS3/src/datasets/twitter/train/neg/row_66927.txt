I don't know how to liveI feel like I can't live a life. Like I wasn't supposed to live a life. I'm sorry this won't make sense, I'm so tired. I just keep thinking about doing something and I need to distract myself. I'm such a piece of shit. I just avoiding things and put things of and sabotage the opportunities I'm given. And I know I'm young and that these things now probably seem like nothing to most people, but I know in my heart that even though they're a small they just give a true look into who I am and the shitty fucking useless person I am truly. I'm so tired, but I don't want to sleep because when I go to sleep I wake up and it's tomorrow. I'm so tired. I don't know how I'm supposed to live a full life where I get an education and a job and a husband and kids I don't know how that's supposed to happen for someone like me. Someone who can't even fucking get up and do laundry or falls asleep on the cold bathroom tile every morning. I don't know how to be a full fledged fucking person in this world that doesn't seem to have space for me. I am surrounded by people, but I feel so alone. Like they're all in love with this version of me, this perception of me they have when really they don't the half of it. I have nowhere to go. My life is not a path I walk it is scaling down a mountain side, the only clear path the rope that dangles me from the place I started. I'm so sorry this doesn't make any sense. I'm so tired.
