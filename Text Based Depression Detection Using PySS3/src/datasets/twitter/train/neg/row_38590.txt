Failing at trying to find meaning in a lonely life.I had today off and the only words I spoke were to the cashier at the grocery store whose name I don't know and who does not know me. Self-checkout at the other store. The future is silent.   

I have several weeks off now. There are books I'd like to read, I've got netflix and was tentatively looking forward to it. But today everything seemed so empty.   

It is like I am in a spaceship that malfunctioned and goes nowhere with no way to communicate with everyone. What do you do in such a situation? Nothing I write or think will ever matter to anyone.   

I don't want to burden people so I don't text the two friends I have. But they don't know much about me. It would be too much. The images and concepts in my mind are brutal. To me that is alright, I've been taught to see things without emotion, but it means I can't ever be honest about what is going on.   

If I spoke honestly I would traumatize people.    

Understanding that, understanding just how different I am, a little bit more every day. It is like all humans drifted far away. I am a stranger to them, they feel that I am dangerous and shy away.   

I will be a doctor in two years, have been accepted into a surgery residency. I can play that persona well, good empathic happy doctor. Good reviews so far. But I can never be honest. Never say the truth.   

And at the end of the day I come home and am alone. And on some days like today I can't think of anything other than suicide.   

I do have a girlfriend on the other side of the planet, the one I can actually talk to. But I don't know when we'll manage to meet, live together. And I don't know if I am good for her, I've said some cruel things to her. She deserves better.
