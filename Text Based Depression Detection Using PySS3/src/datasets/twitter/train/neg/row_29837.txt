I dunnoI don't know how to describe my state of mind. I feel like I've lost control of myself and there's nothing I can do about it. I've given up trying to understand what's wrong with me. I don't know how to handle it. I don't want to handle it. I don't want to be in charge of my life. I don't care. I just don't fucking care. I have vivid daydreams of letting someone else take over my body and just watching from the outside. I want to dissociate back to that point. I just literally don't want to be here.
