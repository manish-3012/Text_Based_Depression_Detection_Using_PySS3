One thing after anotherThings just get worse and worse every day. Things pile on and I keep thinking that Iâ€™m capable of taking them on but Iâ€™m so not. Stress, debt, school, work. I hate the way that I would make other people feel but I canâ€™t take it anymore. I just want to go to sleep, it would be so much easier.
