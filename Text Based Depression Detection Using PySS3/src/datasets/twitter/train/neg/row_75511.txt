Having some girl problems and am extremely depressed.I met this single female co-worker a few weeks ago and instantly fell hard for her. I've never felt this way about anyone in my life (I'm almost 30 and have had a few girlfriends over the years, but would never consider myself being in love with any of them). 

Cutting to the chase, this woman isn't really into me. I speak to her on a daily basis and try to strike up conversation, and she's pleasant and nice to a degree, but I can tell she's just not really that into me and there's really not a lot of chemistry between us.

The bleak outlook of my chances with her have sunk me into a deep depression. I imagine it's along the same emotional lines as deep heartbreak..but it's weird because there was no actual "love" in the first place. Call it limerence I guess.

I've dealt with anxiety and depression throughout my life, but never to this degree. It almost seems silly. I barely know this person. I have started to reconsider my career path. Reconsider my life. I think of suicide on an hourly basis. I haven't had an appetite for the past few weeks and have been having digestion problems.

Anyone have any thoughts/advice?
