I want to kill bullies, not even my bullies, any bully.I want to kill everyone who harassed me throughout life. Realistically, I can't kill them all at once without getting caught in the process. I could settle on killing 20 bullies and then myself.

Also, when I attended elementary school, sometimes they'd place me in an in school detention room and each kid was always black except for me (white), I was usually sent there by the teacher who on several occasions purposely bent over to "help me" with my school work and her shirt would be loose and expose her breasts.

I am foreign to US and didn't know the English language very well and my family were far from helpful. I felt very helpless and I was unable to tell any adults. I still feel very fucking helpless, and I'm 21.
