Iâ€™m feeling badHello friends, Iâ€™m struggling today. I think itâ€™s been a week since itâ€™s been this bad. All I can think of is hanging myself, it feels like itâ€™s be a relief. I hate being here, I hate being alive. I deserve to die and leave myself desecrated. Iâ€™ll never bring joy because Iâ€™m not wired right. I have BPD and I think thatâ€™s causing this but at the same time, this cycle continues again and a-fucking-gain. Iâ€™m miserable and sad. I feel angry for still being here, I want to feel my neck break I want to feel myself suffer and gasp for life and to not have that option anymore.

I want to be found branded as the ugly person I wan naked and violated. But I donâ€™t even fucking know why Iâ€™m writing on here, what a fucking pussy
