Time's upYears ago I would always overexaggerate my mental breakdowns telling myself that I had went insane from depression; I now suffer from actual psychosis and I can't seem to escape the endless delusions and thoughts that are swirling around inside my head, I'm literally insane.

I can't focus on a traditional lifestyle because everything outside the bigger picture is trivial to me, I could not care less for anything that life throws at me. I may be insane but I'm smart enough to acknowledge the fact that I lack the necessary prospects that would lead to a life of contentment. My delusions does not stem from an inconsistent perspective on life as I can see reality for what it is, I'm just fundamentally incapable of finding contentment in it.

I care only for knowing the cosmic truth, but I may never fully know and comprehend it in life, which is why I can never be content. I cannot fathom living an ignorant and vain existence never knowing why I even did it in the first place and still somehow be content. This is where my delusions start to wander, in moments where I fall into a meditative state of deep introspection and contemplation I have spurts of clarity and enlightenment where I can feel an incomprehensive truth, I know it through intuition, but I can never see or fathom it. The theme seems to be unity, a collective and unending force, fiction and reality becomes undistinguishable as everything is derivative of infinity which allows for everything and all to be part of reality. I don't fear death as I know it will only mark the end of a inconsequential consciousness, I'm just a part of the universe after all.
