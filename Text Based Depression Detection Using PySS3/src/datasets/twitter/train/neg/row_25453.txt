I don't know what to choose.I am often thinking if I should kill myself or if I should continue to live and hope for something great to happen. I could just jump from a building and all my worries would go away and cease to exist. I donlt find it sad, it is just a way to end my problems. But if I continue to live and hope for something great to happen, it will be SO HARD to endure each day the worries and problems. So difficult... Sometimes, I ask myself how people are surviving, what they are thinking to be happy. I feel I am nothing to society: not accepted socially by a lot of people, though I have friends who accept me and who are considered kind. But by being friends with kind people, I think I am just too fragile. I feel guilty for being fragile and I know I have to toughen up, but I don't know how I can toughen up. I have tried to tell myself things to make myself stronger emotionally, but just recently, I cried because I will get detached from a friend. Please help me. I really want to leave this world.
