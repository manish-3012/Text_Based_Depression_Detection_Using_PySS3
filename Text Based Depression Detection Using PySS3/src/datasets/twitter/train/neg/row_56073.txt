It looks like it is all overI have nothing to live for. I have lost my will and desire to live. I am beyond any help as hospitals and medicines will not work. They will just make it worse. And pretty much delay the inevitable. I haven't decided on the method I will use yet. I've been thinking about how all day.

Life itself is precious. Just my life doesn't need to go on. It's been okay, I guess, but my time on this planet ends now.
