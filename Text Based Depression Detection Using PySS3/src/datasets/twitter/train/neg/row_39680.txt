ByeGonna by my mother a really expensive necklace then my list will complete and I can leave. Just need the necklace to arrive.
Just wanted to say thanks to those who tried to help or talk to me, but it is no use. 
I truly believe some of us just were never meant to be alive, and I'm one if those people for sure. 
This will probably be my last post on here until my planned date arrives. So with that. 
Goodbye world, I won't miss you
