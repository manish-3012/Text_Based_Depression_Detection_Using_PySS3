a friend cut me off and iâ€™m suicidal because of iti was manipulative. it was never intentional, and i never realised thatâ€™s what i was doing. i was so scared of losing her friendship, and now i have, and i want to kill myself because of it. i feel like i have nothing to live for. iâ€™m not a good person anyway, because i hurt her so badly, and i donâ€™t know how to improve. it feels like the only way out of this hole is to kill myself.

does anyone have any advice? to fix this, get her back in my life and earn her trust again, or to feel less disgusting about the whole situation?
