Have had suicidal thoughts for a while, but now I may have a strong reason to do it.Today I received a letter notifying me that I've been caught pirating Skyrim. I really don't know what to do and the legal terms are very confusing. The only thing they made clear is that I could have to pay up to 250,000 dollars. I don't have that kind of money, my family doesn't either. I've had suicidal thoughts for a while but never a real reason to actually do it. Now all I can think about is taking my own life. I really don't know what to do. I can't win a lawsuit. I can't afford lawyers. I just can't see any other options.
