What would you do?I got a problem out of nowhere, called Pectus Carinatum (google it). It's probably genetic, it appears unexpectedly during puberty when the body is rapidly growing. 

It damaged me mentally because I did nothing wrong to have that. Let alone the physical anomaly and the pain.

It made me suicidal. What are your thoughts?
