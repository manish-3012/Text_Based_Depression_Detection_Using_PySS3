Im not depressed, just fuckin' bored but...Well I'm 17, i'm tired of being a shit in everything, my fucking girlfriend cheated on me, i forgave her, then she cheated on me again, this time with 2 boys at the same time, i know i'm a fucking idiot but i loved her, that really fucking hurted, im a shit at school, im going to suspend because i failed too many subjects this semester, so, i have to start working and return to school in one year (Mexican preparatory school) , i think it's okay, the hardest thing will be telling my parents, but, well, i have to get a job, that's ok, i will get money, buy stuff i wanted to buy, make music with my friends (i sing), and i'm dating another girl, this one looks nice, shes pretty, smart, not like the girls on my classroom that are really fucking boring, they're all just the same girl in different bodies, and that's the point, today i saw something in the bus, i saw a colombian guy in the street, begging money to a guy in an expensive car, the guy in the car looked kinda rich or something, but he didn't help that colombian guy, he just closed the car window and left, the girls, the boys, the people, the commercial music, the goverment, me, this fucking world is just shit.

 i'm just, thinking all the time:

I dont give a fuck(Me vale verga)
That's not my fucking problem(No es mi pedo)
Fuck off(A la chingada)

3 life rules to be a fucking "happy" asshole

If you're depressed or something, don't worry dude, all will get better, everything happens for a reason do whatever you want to do, listen or make music, get a job, go out, smoke some cigarretes (Just don't do drugs dude, i tried that, that not cool) , this world is ugly , but there are small things that make it a lil better.
