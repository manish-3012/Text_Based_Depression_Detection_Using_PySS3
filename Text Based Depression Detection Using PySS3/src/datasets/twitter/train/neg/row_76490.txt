I feel so worthlessMy best friend is bipolar like me and I try to help him the best I can, but how can I help someone else when I'm so broken? Every single thing he tells me about himself just reminds me of how I'm messed up and how worthless I am. I care so much about him and I don't want to lose him as a friend, but I feel like absolute crap every time he brings anything about his own problems up. I can't ever tell him that because he might stop trying to talk to me which isn't what I want either.

I wish I didn't hate myself so much so that I could help him better.
