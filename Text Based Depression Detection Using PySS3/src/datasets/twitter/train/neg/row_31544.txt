I'm considering crawling out onto my roof.I am...struggling. 

I'm autistic and I'm in chronic physical pain. I fractured my ankle in December, doing something I love (ice-skating) and since the surgery to put the plates and pins in, I just haven't known peace. The doctors officially diagnosed it as "Chronic Regional Pain Syndrome," which \*was\* accurate in that I was suffering intense nerve-pain (like tiny shards of glass going backwards through my veins) in addition to the deep bone ache. 

The problem is though, while the nerve pain has pretty much cleared up, the bone ache is just...not going anywhere. I'm keeping up with physical therapy, even walking better because, for some weird reason, I -can- do the exercises. My physical therapist was so impressed and proud, actually, when I saw her for the first time since the lockdown a little while ago...but the pain doesn't ease. I can't walk for long distances without crutches. I get little relief and am dependant on tramadol...it lets me sleep a little while, but not much and not always at night when I need it. 

On top of that, a special interest of mine is coming to an end. A comic book with a character I adore. Being autistic, I experience the world \*through\* my interests; it's sort of how I make sense of life? I'm able to project onto something and make sense of things. I struggle without them...and, suffice to say...now is not the best time for it to end. 

It's gonna happen...but I don't want to be around for it. I don't want to deal with having to limp around, waiting for my meds to wear off before I can take my next dose, holding out this vague notion that it 'might' get better this time. I wanna just...be *free*.

I want out. But I specifically want to get onto my roof. I just can't actually physically climb--so while I puzzle it out how to get on out there, I thought I'd write this.

I feel as if I'm being drawn to my roof for some reason? I can't explain why. I've been having a lot of dreams about it; where I'm leaning out my window and \*right there\* is the moon and Saturn...and I'm \*so\* tempted to just jump on out and go see space...only I'm awake this time when I get that feeling. I can't explain it. 

I just want *out.* I don't want to worry, I don't want to limp, I don't want to deal with masking, about being so confused all the time in *any* 'adult' conversation (always get brushed off in a 'not now kiddo, you don't know the real world') and...y'know. Yeah. I don't *wanna* know the real world anymore. 

I want out...
