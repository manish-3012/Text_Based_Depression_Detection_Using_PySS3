HelpI have been giving "ending it" a lot of thought recently and had come to a decision that I would try to talk about it. About a month ago I told my two best friends about how I felt and their reaction was as follows: friend 1 told me that he actually feels the same way and had thought that I might have been feeling the same way in recent months but didn't offer any advice but this made me feel comforted. Friend 2 was completely taken off guard and surprised and only had to say "No.... Why RighteousEffort, why..?".  Telling my friends about my feelings and discussing them did help a little.

I also tried to talk to my parents about seeing someone to maybe get some medication or therapy to whic their response was "What do you have to be sad about? You have life too easy." and things of that nature which just made me feel terribly.

I feel like I am depressed and maybe even a little bipolar, my parents have even noticed this and said something. What I have to ask is for advice and what steps I should take to help improve my sadness. 

Thanks and if anyone has any questions I will try to answer.
