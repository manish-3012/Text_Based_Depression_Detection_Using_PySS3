[Update] Girlfriend of 2 years is about to break up with me. I don't think I'll make it through the night.Original: http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/13po5r/girlfriend_of_2_years_is_about_to_break_up_with/

She came over and she broke up with me without hesitation. No matter how much I begged her for an explanation, she said we need to spend at least one month apart, and she left. I've taken 400mg of DXM and about 2mg of 25-I, and many bowls since she's left. I haven't slept in 2 days. I'm going to try to starve myself. I don't deserve anything. Psychedelics make me see everything so clearly.
