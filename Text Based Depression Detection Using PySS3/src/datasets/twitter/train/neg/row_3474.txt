Is their a difference between being suicidal...and having suicidal thoughtsI find myself thinking about death and methods of dying almost like an obsession, like thinking about escape and how peaceful it would be to not have to feel anymore coping with the past and present, I was raped over 2 years ago now but have just spoken out I'm going through a lot I'm on effexor I was on citalopram for 2 years but it didn't work...anyway ... I'm scared of dying my head feels scrambled..I do think know my own head right now I just need a break from everyone around me I need to think I never have time to think
