My father told me he dreamt that I died and my mother born me againI've been through *so much shit* and *this* is the thing that made me genuinely wanna die for the first time in my life. I do wish I was born again. My neck is all cracking and always hurting, I'm always depressed and dissociated, I've been kicked from college for the second time, I don't eat and I don't do anything. I'm a total failure. I wish it was a bad dream and I would wake up having a healthy mind, body and not have lost my opportunities. I wish I lived again but didn't make all those stupid things that ruined me. But that trash is me. My reality. That thing that died in his dream.
