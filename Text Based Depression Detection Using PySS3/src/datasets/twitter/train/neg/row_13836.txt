Every time I say to myself "I can do this" there's a little voice saying "Why? You don't matter" and I can't do this anymoreI'm sorry, but I just needed to say it. It's torture. I don't know what's worse - giving up or fighting.




It's just that whenever I come up with a reason to live, whenever I assure myself that I am going to pull through and have a nice life, this other freaking voices simply chimes in with "Why would you do that though? Do you really think you matter? Do you really think that you would be able to help anyone? Do you think that you'll get accepted to a good college? We both know that isn't true."

&amp;nbsp;

No matter what I do, the voice (I call it Sylvia because it is a female voice but audibly not "mine") wins. When I try to fight it just drives me over the edge, it continues until I give up, until I break and need to punish myself for ever thinking that I could help someone, that I could achieve something.




But when I don't fight, when I go "Right, sorry, I forgot that I'm a waste of space for a second, haha." I don't have to argue with Sylvia and at least I don't feel even worse than before. Yes, I feel empty and numb, and, in a way, it's the worst feeling I've ever experienced, but I don't need to punish myself, I don't cry tears of rage.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm not sure what to do anymore. All I see around me are people whom I've failed to help, all I see is my selfishness calling me out: "Think about the people, you're selfish. You think you could change something, huh? How selfish!" Everything I do is selfish. Literally. I talk to someone - "Wow, you're so selfish, think about all the better people they could be talking to right now." I don't talk to someone - "How can you? Do you think you're better? You're just a selfish brat! What if they're sad now, what if they wanted to talk to you, huh?"



I can't do anything right, literally everything is wrong, even writing this is wrong. I can hear Sylvia screaming at me that it's selfish to bother you guys with my petty problems.

&amp;nbsp;

I've tried to kill myself four times so far. I have some memory problems though so I literally forgot to finish it the first three times. It's rather funny in hindsight. The fourth time failed due to my pocket knife being too dull. I am thinking about trying again. I could drown myself, or jump from our roof, I could drink something poisonous, I could grab a kitchen knife and stab myself in the chest or I could steal my father's gun and shoot myself.

&amp;nbsp;

And no, I cannot tell my family about this, the last time I said anything, I got "I am tired of this, if you like me, don't tell me those things anymore, I don't want to hear them" in response. Even my own family is tired of my bullshit, wow.

&amp;nbsp;

I just...I don't know anymore...I apologise for bothering you all.
