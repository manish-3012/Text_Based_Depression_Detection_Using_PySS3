I'm doneI just can't keep on going like I've been the past year. Sure I got clean from drugs but since then my life is absolute shit. Each day I wake up I pray for a brain aneursym or something to take me out of this hell hole. I used to have fun in life, had friends, dated, etc. Now all I do is look for ways to distract myself in the moment and recently that has stopped working. Every aspiration I had as a kid/teenager has dissipated right in front of my face and that hurts the most. Also knowing that because of the choices I made I will never be able to get married, have friends or just enjoy life. Each day is worse than the last and I'm sick of this. I bet a lot of other people here feel the same way but today was the day I lost all my remaining hope for obtaining a happy life. I'm starting to realize that no one will ever want to be around/with me. I refuse to go through life like this and I used to think that I was a strong person but every human has a breaking point. Today I finally gave up completely and I feel incredibly sick to my stomach. It felt like my soul left my body and I'm just watching my life go by right in front of me. I ordered some butyr fentanyl and prepared a half gram shot so when the time comes where I just can't stand to live even one more second I can just grab it and finally get some peace. One last high as a celebration of my attempt at life.
