Been suicidal for as long as I can remember. But I am staying up and cant go sleep because I am worried for my close friend that hasnt been on in 15 hrs and I know she had tried an attempt before. Would never wish anyone to go through this pain of wondering if someone you value kills themselves.Title. I an still suicidal, but I know the pain of worrying about someone you value suicide
