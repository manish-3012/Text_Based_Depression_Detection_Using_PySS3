I don't understand why, but I want everything to end. My life should be amazing, but I just want out. I can't take waking up everyday. I feel like I achieve nothing. It isn't that I don't have friends, that I'm lonely, but I think about suicide everyday and the more I think about it the more appealing and less scary it sounds. 

My future feels bleak and depressing. I don't feel like putting effort into anything. I just feel like ultimately, I will be unhappy for the rest of my life. I have nothing to live for. I don't know what to do. This has only lasted for about two weeks, although I've always been depressed but only recently did I see suicide as an option. Should I call my therapist and tell her I need to see her very soon? Can she even help me?
