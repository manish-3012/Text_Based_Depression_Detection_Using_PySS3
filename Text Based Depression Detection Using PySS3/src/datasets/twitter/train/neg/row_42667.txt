I just don't care anymore.  I just don't care.I'm 32 going on 33 and I have a good life, but I just don't care.  I used to have dreams, but I don't give a shit about them anymore.  Everything is boring.  I will never excel at anything, and I just don't care.  My family will benefit from my death and I feel that would be better than I can offer them right now.  I'm just so depressed and I don't know where else to go.  I don't even know why I'm posting.  One last attempt at reaching out?  Probably doesn't matter, but I guess I can at least have an archive of my last attempts at continuing.  What do you think?
