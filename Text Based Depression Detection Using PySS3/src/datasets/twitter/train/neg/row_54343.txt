I donâ€™t know what to doIâ€™m so scared. My wife and best friend of 6 years seems to be taking things to a place where we are going to get a divorce. We have been married a bit over a year, living together for 5+. I know sheâ€™s depressed, I am the only one taking meds. I had a bout with depression, anxiety, suicide in college. But the last few weeks have been hell. She says I donâ€™t understand what makes her tick, that I never listen to her needs or treat her more than a good friend. That she had hoped I would be the one to value her. Even if I try my hardest, I feel like I only do things wrong. We rarely have sex. Now sheâ€™s in the other room pretending to sleep, Iâ€™m thinking Iâ€™ll just kill myself if this ends. I donâ€™t know how our lives would separate, I donâ€™t want to lose the most wonderful person in my life. I donâ€™t see a path forward and I donâ€™t know what to do. Iâ€™m terrified and wishing someone, anyone would hold me and tell me things will be ok. But I donâ€™t think they will. Even if she hurts me, she is still my most favorite person. Iâ€™ve told her countless times that I will work at understanding her, that I will get better, but nothing holds. Maybe Iâ€™m just not worth it. I hadnâ€™t dated anyone for 10+ years before meeting her. She made me want to love again. If anyone is out there and has hope or ideas or anything.m, Iâ€™d appreciate it. I feel so helpless and stupid. I just want this all to stop. Iâ€™m so sorry.
