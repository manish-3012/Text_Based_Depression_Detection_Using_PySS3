no hope leftim 16, F, if that helps anything. im not depressed but I really want to commit suicide. it seems like the only answer right now, because I realized that with a body like mine, and an ugly, undesired face like mine, I'm not going to find anyone who wants to keep me. 
"you're 16, stop worrying about love!"

but I can't. I've been so neglected of love my whole life. me and my sister fight, not verbally, but physically to see who can get love from our parents and who can't. I've lost my whole life, and the love I receive is minimal. 

I'm touch starved, hopeless, and now I'm starting to think that if I'm so useless, I have no purpose. my life has no meaning. I'll never be loved. I was meant to be alone, and whatever purpose I have isn't showing itself. I'll never be something someone wants. I'll never be anything. all that's left to do is to kill myself.

so here's my question: how do I kill myself without anyone knowing? no one is going to care about me when I'm gone, so how do I do it without them knowing either? how could they ignore my body? 

I just want this life to be over. I have no soulmate, and my friends never keep in touch. I can't think of another reason to stay alive any longer.
