BrokenHave you ever fallen in love? Most of us have. It can be a wonderful thing and other times, the worst pain imaginable. 

I've been suffering with clinical depression and anxiety for some time now, failing University hit me hard and put me on a dark road. But thanks to my family and girlfriend at the time, I started getting help, getting the medication I needed, talking to my councilor each week, even getting in touch with the well-being service. And eventually, I started to feel like I was picking up all the pieces again, rebuilding, slowly, but surely. 

All until I fell in love with someone else, I threw away everything and risked it all because I was determined she was the one. I'l save the details but she needed up leaving me for someone else. She told me she loved me as she kissed me goodbye on Thursday, by Saturday of that week I got a phone call saying she had feelings for someone else. And just like that, those pieces I was putting together all shattered into a billion pieces. I risked everything for her, and it all blew up in my face. I lost what feels like everyone who mattered to me in a matter of months. 

Now I'm left here, alone. Wrists in tatters, enough drugs to numb a horse and feeling completely empty. I don't have the energy to rebuild myself again, especially now I have no one to try better myself for. I just don't care about myself enough. 

Every day feels like an uphill battle I just can't win. I'm exhausted all the time, yet my anxiety keeps me up. I'm trying to stay strong, but I don't know how much longer I can take.
