I think I've had OCD since I was young and it's gotten worseFirst of all, I'm not 100% sure if I have OCD or not since I have never talked to anyone about it. But I do have some thoughts in my head + feeling the need to do some things a certain number of times. Anyways, I've always been attracted to girls and had several girl crushes. I did some research and I think I have HOCD, which is pretty much my the OCD telling me that I am gay. I got really paranoid and I keep on thinking about it. This resulted in the HOCD getting even worse, I can't stop thinking about it. I feel like it's trying to turn me gay or something. I know I am straight and talked to many girls, but why is this happening if I know I'm not gay? As a result of this, whenever I am walking outside or see a good looking guy, I start to check them out and notice how good looking they are. I never have any like sexual desires for them. But I'm so lost and on top of that I'm very stressed out + depressed so it's just not a good mix of things to have.

I used to look at girls and admire their beauty and imagine them as my girlfriend, but like I feel like I lost that. Like when I look at a hot girl now, I don't feel that feeling I used to get. 

How do I tell myself that I'm not gay and it's just my brain playing tricks on me? This literally never happened until like two days ago.
