Told my family about my three suicide attemptsTbh I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m writing this but here I go.

 Iâ€™m from Kosovo and these things just donâ€™t â€œexistâ€ there, and if you actually express your feelings of sadness and depression you wonâ€™t be taken serious and be called lazy or an attention seeker. Recently about 8 months ago Iâ€™ve come clean to my family and told them about my depression and my three suicide attempts. Iâ€™m always 100% hones with people and hate lying or being around the bush, my parents are not the best, we moved to another country and opened a bakery. Ever since theyâ€™ve neglected me and never paid any kind of attention to anything I was saying or doing. My depression started that year when we moved here to Croatia and I had to leave everything behind and start over with new people, a new school, whiteout knowing the language or anything about the culture. I started to sleep all day, not talk to anyone, draw dark stuff, listen to depressed songs. I used to stay in my room all the time, the longest being 2 weeks without going out when I was on my school spring break. My dad yells all the time, my mom does everything sheâ€™s told to do, typical Albanian married couple, my older sister was always busy  taking care of the â€œbusinessâ€ and my younger brother was always and still is a dickhead. Itâ€™s been 9years since I became depressed and throughout those years Iâ€™ve attempted to end it all 3 times, now that Iâ€™ve been asked why Iâ€™m always so negative, angry, why Iâ€™m always so rude towards my parents I told them theyâ€™re shit at their job of parenting and I got shut down real quick by them telling me Iâ€™m just and attention seekers, lazy and always selfish, even after I told  them about the 3 attempts. They didnâ€™t do anything. But today i told my mom as a joke that I cut my hair yesterday when I took a shower and my brother joked and said â€œshould have cut your wrists insteadâ€, I got really pissed and started yelling at him and my mom and sister started yelling back at me saying something along the line of â€œyour taking this way to far, you need to collect yourselfâ€ ... Sooo I just wanted to ask if Iâ€™m the only one in this kind of situation or is there anybody else. Because I just cursed out God and really donâ€™t see anything worth living this life for but Iâ€™m also not going to kill myself because basically Iâ€™m a wuss so Iâ€™ll just continue to cry, isolate and slowly kill myself with stress until all the left hair falls out and I become obese.
