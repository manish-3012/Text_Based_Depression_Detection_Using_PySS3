Can i donate my organs if i kill myself?I dont know where to post this and ask this question but its related to suicide and i want to die, so i guess it can belong here, right?

If i am an organ donor and i kill myself, will they be able to donate my organs? I searched on google and in my country, your organs can be taken if you die from cardiovascular problemes or neurological things like a brain tumor. 

If i call an ambulance and after that i kill myself with a gun in my head or i slit my throat and the other parts of my body arent hurt by that and the ambulance arrive quick enough, will it be okay? Can they take the organs?
