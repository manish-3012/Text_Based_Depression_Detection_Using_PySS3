Utterly defeatedI donâ€™t really want to die. Death scares me a little, even with its inevitability. 

However Iâ€™m just completely exhausted. Mentally and physically. Every time I take one step forward , Iâ€™m pushed 5 steps back. 

Every time I think something is going great, it gets shattered by something awful that pops out of nowhere. 

Iâ€™m having the worst luck on a day to day basis, the world is against me without a doubt. 

Iâ€™m sick of trying to make my life something positive. Over 5 years of trying to get out of the worst rut has gotten me nowhere. Feel like Iâ€™m being repeatedly punched in the face and this time I donâ€™t have the energy to stand up again. 

I give up.
