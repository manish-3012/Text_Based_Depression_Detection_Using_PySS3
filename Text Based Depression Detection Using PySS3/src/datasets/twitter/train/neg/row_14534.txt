WellFirst of all I'm not a native speaker and really bad with words so sry in advance 

Recently I started thinking about committing suicide. I mean I knew I will never really do it because I'm really scared and objectively my life is pretty good. i just don't know why i can't enjoy it and why i always think I'm such a failure. It's just seems so logical to end the life because why not.

 Living just means being stressed and have to work 90% of your time. All my, I would say friends but that's not really the way I see them, say if my job fucks me up so much I should do something that I like but that's the problem. There is nothing I'm really good at and nothing I really enjoy. 

It's like the only thing that keeps me alive is my fear and the guilt of leaving people behind.


Well I don't really know why I'm posting this and what I hope for because out of experience it seems like I can't accept.
