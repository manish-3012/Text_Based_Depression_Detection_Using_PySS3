Today I will finally be freeSince my last post I had two amazing people message me and actually somehow make me reconsider going through with killing myself. Combined with my psychologist appointment yesterday I thought I had a chance. Then today everything hit me at once, I know that no matter how much I keep trying this shit will always come back, I can't keep dealing with it. 

I've already gotten pretty drunk and thought maybe I could distract myself on the computer. Now my computer has stopped working, it's a sign the universe just wants me gone. I have literally nothing now, the one distractions I had is fucked and there is no point. All I can do for now is keep drinking until I go through with it, have a drink on me everyone, I sure as hell am.
