I can't take this anymoreI wasn't meant to be happy in this world. I've never been able to truthfully say I've had a good day or I love my life.

I'm convinced all my "friends" are out to get me, are talking about me behind my back, and they all want me to kill myself already. I just know it. I don't know the last time someone's talked to me without me starting the conversation first. I don't know the last time I was invited somewhere for any reason besides pity and or mockery. I don't know the last time I felt I had a friend I could trust and confide in. 

My family purposefully makes my life a living he'll. Constant berating and yelling. My mom makes sure I'm ugly so I don't make friends. My dad always raises his voice for no reason, he just knows it makes me want to die even more. My brother exists to spite me. Right now I'm fighting the urge to go and cut all his guitar strings just so I have one less annoyance from him until my parents yell at me again and make me feel like the shit i am.

I'm a bad person and i don't deserve help. I don't deserve to live. What's my point in this world besides being everyone's toy to play with? I just want to be ok and I just want to feel genuinely loved and cared for by friends and family but I don't have that. I'm tired of it all. I want to go to sleep and never wake up. I wish I wasn't such a fucking coward and would just end it already. I don't want to do this anymore.
