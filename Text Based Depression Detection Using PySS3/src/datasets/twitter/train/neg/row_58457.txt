The rope stopped being scaryIâ€™ve never really been afraid of dying. But in the attempts the potential pain or the feeling of the thing made me stop. Iâ€™ve spat out pills, tied so many nooses just to sit and stare at them, sat out on a nature preserve and hoped some crazy would come kill me. Just. Anything. 

Today I put a length of my rope against my neck and it just felt nice. Like a caress. Like it wasnâ€™t an instrument anymore and more like it just wanted to take my pain away. Of course, Iâ€™m projecting. The rope was the same length of rope Iâ€™ve had for years. I meant it for a cat scratching post. Then I used it for bondage. And it just kinda has been around. 

I have a lot of trauma. My dad will tell you itâ€™s because I donâ€™t get out much. Not because he drank through most of my childhood. Or because his only interaction was yelling at me, ignoring me, or telling me heâ€™s disappointed because of my schoolwork. Iâ€™m out of college now, I did stay home because I was poor, then I stayed for my mom, and now Iâ€™ve stayed because Iâ€™m poor again. I could go to a womenâ€™s shelter for a while, or steal my car and live in it. But I have pets. I canâ€™t leave them with my parents. But the thought of rehoming them makes me feel so selfish. Why did I take them in knowing I might have to leave without them? Was I just impulsively trying to not be so alone? 

Today he started an argument because he could. I want a relationship with both of my parents for my moms sake. She doesnâ€™t help much honestly. Shuts down and blames it on minor things. I genuinely donâ€™t think sheâ€™s capable of grasping something so complex and painful. I donâ€™t think I want her to understand it the way I do. I donâ€™t want to either. But sheâ€™s also mostly innocent. Iâ€™ll leave her business off of reddit, but she was in a situation where I donâ€™t blame her for marrying him. 

The conclusion of the discussion between me and my father is that when my mental health was vastly in the negatives (surprisingly less ok than I am now), that he was justified in being angry that I didnâ€™t want to be social or go anywhere with them. That secluding myself when my relationship was failing, my job was degrading me to the point I stopped showering or eating properly, and I was drinking just to sedate myself and stay numb that I was in the wrong for not telling them. 

Why should I tell someone who is just angry at me because Iâ€™m hurting why Iâ€™m hurting? He had no right. And he still doesnâ€™t. He says he supports my art in the same conversation. Heâ€™s not supportive. He uses it as a point to say something positive and pretend he cares about me. 

Where I find a place for my pets determines what I do with myself. If they go to a good home Iâ€™ll send myself away into some other state of being. I kind of hope thereâ€™s nothing after death. Iâ€™m so tired of experiencing anything. If by some miracle I find a place that allows cats that I can afford I will go start a new life there.
