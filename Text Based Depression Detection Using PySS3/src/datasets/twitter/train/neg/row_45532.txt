Told my fiancÃ© my reddit password and told him to look here...He freaked out and such.

First it was a few weeks ago, when I was in a bad place, and texted him from a different number. Trying to pressure him into cheating. He didnâ€™t. I feel like that was the tipping point and he lost all respect for me.

Then he saw the post where I forgot about every birthday i ever had and every awesome memory Iâ€™ve had with him. He didnâ€™t take that well.

weâ€™re still together, but he told me that weâ€™re saying that weâ€™re exes.

Iâ€™ve wanted to hide under a rock and maybe never come out. I feel like maybe life isnâ€™t worth living anymore.

Nobody likes me, nobody had a great experience with me. Iâ€™m not someone you love. Iâ€™m someone to hate. I donâ€™t have any friends because I flaked on them. I chose to do this to myself.

Iâ€™m a vile person and I donâ€™t deserve love. I donâ€™t deserve to be here. I just donâ€™t have a purpose here. Nobody loves me. When I was engaged, my family started talking to me. They started to show interest in getting to know me. I shouldnâ€™t be here, today. I tried to do good. I really did, but Iâ€™m way past the age I should be. Iâ€™m just a selfish ball of hate. Like a Dalek, but a fleshy Dalek?? I donâ€™t know anymore. I tried to be something Iâ€™m not.

Iâ€™m stressed at home. Iâ€™m stressed at work. Iâ€™m stressed everywhere I go, and Iâ€™ll never sleep well. I guess the song is true; â€œThere ainâ€™t no rest for the wicked...â€

Iâ€™m dizzy every day. I guess Iâ€™ll never have kids either. 27 is too old for everything. Iâ€™m just as good as dead.
