Even on a great day -Even on a great day all it takes is a friend telling me that he thinks my hair is ugly, or that I smell bad (fragrance) or that my shirt is horrible. And who says that? Like I know friends are supposed to be honest. But when I really care about my hygeigne, looks and fragrance, it's really tough for me. Especially when I'm having a great day because then I can actually feel the fall. And I fall way down to where I get nauseous and almost throw up.

Today I showered for an hour, brushed my teeth 10 minutes, put on my brand new favorite clothes, wore my favourite fragrance, because today I'm supposed to start at a European kind of University. I met my friend on the train and we talked with another friend. Then he said *"One of you smells like barf"* (and he doesn't mean bad, he means barf when he says it) He continues, *"It's probably you **ShatteredByDecease*"

Now I have never been this nauseous. He ruined all I had - my confidence.

I'm gonna fight as everyday, but it is gonna be hard. I won't kill myself today, but I've been wanting to since I was 13.

Thanks for reading. I feel so alone.
