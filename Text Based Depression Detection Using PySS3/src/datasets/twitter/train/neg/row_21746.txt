I feel like a piece of shit.I thought I had control of this. It's been a pretty long time since I cut myself, and now I did it again. I felt so overwhelmed by everything. I love him, I don't want to hurt him. I don't want to hurt anyone. I don't want to feel pain.

Suicide thoughts came across my mind, and I'm afraid of them. I just want someone to tell me it's going to be okay.
