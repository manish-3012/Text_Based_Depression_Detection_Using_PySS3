I just feel so alone and want to dieMy family and close friends know about my suicidal thoughts and are extremely supportive but even with their support and company I feel alone. I still want to die everyday. I don't want to wake up anymore. I'm desperate. What do I do? I'm just sad, unmotivated, and empty. Everything is falling apart. I just want to die.
