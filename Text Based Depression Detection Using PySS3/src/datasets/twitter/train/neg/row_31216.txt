Should I run away before Killing myself?So I've been living with my parents my whole life. I'm still 20 and I have little money, a car, and constantly live with suicidal thoughts. I want to die so bad, but my poor parents know this, and they cry and tell me that I shouldn't go through with it, that they love me, that they'll kill themselves if I do it, ect. It's making my brain feel like it's splitting apart with guilt.

I'm pretty sure I just thought of a solution though and i want to see if anyone here thinks it will work

If i run away, let's say I just get in my car, use the rest of the money I have, I can probably drive to Arizona or Nevada or Portland to kill myself there. Sure, they won't know where I am, but they also won't know that I'm dead. By allowing that possiblity that Im still alive might make things easier to swallow?

Idk i just know I can't take this shit anymore and I need to do something soon. I'm beyond help and I just need to be put out of my misery. I just don't want to spread my sickness to others too.
