Iâ€™m a whiny little beta bitch who needs to off himselfLook, mathematically speaking, if I really want to make my family happier, I should die. They wonâ€™t be as stressed because of my personality. They wonâ€™t have to spend money to feed me. My little brother wonâ€™t have any issues with his internet connection. My mom and dad will finally be able to be happy again. Few people will care that Iâ€™m gone. The ones that do will certainly forget about me in a week or so as long as I die in a secret location. If I make sure to leave a note not to have a funeral, this will result in my family having more spending money and time to achieve all that theyâ€™ve wanted. My mother could finally work towards being an architect. Sheâ€™d be less stressed because she wouldnâ€™t have to deal with me AND sheâ€™d have her dream job. My dad could finally study for a better degree and do what he wants to do. They both had to stop when they made a mistake one day and conceived me. On another note, whatâ€™s the quickest and least painless way to commit suicide?
