Can someone just end my life?I'm so tired of this world. Here is nothing to fight for, nothing worth waking up for, nothing worth staying alive for. There's nothing in life to keep me going. I'm q piece of shit doomed to stay miserable my whole life so I may as well just quit now. Except I'm so much of a failure that I don't have the guts to kill myself even though I'd rather be dead than tolerate this fucking world. It's made it quite clear that I'm hated, that I shouldn't exist. It's made it clear that no one wants immigrants, gay people or trans people around, much less a combination of the three. Each day I simultaneously fear for my life but also wish to take my life. The more the current administration does the more obvious it is they want me gone. Besides, what's another meaningless drop in an ocean of suicides. 

Morning Edit: still here
