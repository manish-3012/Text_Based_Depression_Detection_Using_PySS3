HelpI'm willing to talk through it. I've had some great people talk me through all this pain. I have no idea why I feel so worthless, why I can't just get up and do things that will make my brain want to keep going....PM me if you are free and willing to help. I feel like I am falling apart. Oddly enough, the only thing getting me through the day-to-day is that it can all end whenever I want it to.
