Iâ€™m here ðŸ’•There is so much I want to say in this post.. 
I just want every single one of you to know if you have been, are, or ever do get to depressed that I am HERE. 

I have been there. Iâ€™m still there, but I no longer act on it. There were many times that I tried to commit suicide in various ways. 
I use to dream about &amp; long for my death. Every moment my heart was beating I was saying â€œcan it please just be the last beat??â€ 

My body ACHED. When I tell you that my body achedâ€” I mean it hurt so bad on the inside &amp; outside... that I basically felt numb. I hated myself, my home life, school life, past life, present, and even the unknown. 

The only thing that ever stopped me from full on dying was the fact that I had a small ass glimpse of hope &amp; I always thought about the â€œwhat ifs.â€

What if 10 min from now I felt better? What if an hr from now I feel better? Or tomorrow a blessing happens? 

I longed for feeling back in my body, I longed for unconditional love, I longed to be me, to find me. 

There is no doubt that I am still suicidal. It has taken so many different journeys in my life to be where I am &amp; who I am today. It takes time. At any given moment something can change you. Itâ€™s how you react to it. 

I want every one of you to be able to say with me that you are a #SuicideSurvivor.
