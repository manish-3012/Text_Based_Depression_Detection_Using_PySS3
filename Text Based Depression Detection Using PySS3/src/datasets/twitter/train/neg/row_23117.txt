Becoming increasingly frustrated, lonely and vengeful towards others and my life everydaySorry for the long rant.
With each day that passes, iâ€™m becoming more and more frustrated, full of rage, lonely, upset and vengeful. The thoughts that crowd my head 24/7 are literally fucking breaking me down. Iâ€™ve got bald patches in my hair, COMPLETEY torn apart my palms with needles. 

Each day that goes by Iâ€™m alone, with literally no friends or ANYONE to talk to at all. Iâ€™m stuck inside my bedroom with my own thoughts. Iâ€™ve been doing a LOT of drugs of all kinds lately and tearing apart my skin and hair because iâ€™ve got nothing else to do except sit in my room. Iâ€™m a fucking miserable waste of space. Iâ€™m truant and got expelled from this school year so I have to repeat it. My parents keep pushing me to get a job and grow up. I canâ€™t take it anymore. I genuinely cannot. Iâ€™m breaking down every fucking second and i JUST WANT TO FUCKING DIE. I think about killing others and myself everyday but I will never go to the hospital again. Iâ€™m just going to do it. I donâ€™t give a fuck anymore about all these failed friendships and relationships and every fucking body abandoning me. Good fucking riddance. I donâ€™t give a shit how I die or if itâ€™s the most painful way to die. I just need it over with. Iâ€™ve nothing to live for anymore.
