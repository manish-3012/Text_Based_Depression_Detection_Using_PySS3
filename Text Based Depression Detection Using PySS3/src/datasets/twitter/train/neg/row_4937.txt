Swallowing some pills tonightEvery time I want to i manage to somehow avoid it. But tonight I don't see why not. I have a small amount of risperidone and lots of sertraline. I know it's a tiny chance but maybe the first 2 fails made that chance slightly bigger.

Edit: I played a game of league and someone weirdly made me happy. I swallowed a bunch of pills after that but I actually rethought it after I did. I think partially because of that person. I vomited till nothing came out. I think there are still some in me but I got most of them out. I'm also going to flush the ones I've been saving after my dad leaves for work.
