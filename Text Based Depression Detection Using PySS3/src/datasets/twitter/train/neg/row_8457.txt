The world is a dark and scary place and frankly, Iâ€™m too sensitive. I just want to disappear.All I see these days is hate, ignorance, and warring between people. I want a safe space to feel loved and a community that cares about me. Iâ€™m a gentle soul and I just want a quiet, happy life... I donâ€™t think thatâ€™s possible. Iâ€™m feeling more inclined to self-harm in order to cope. More than anything though, I want to disappear. I donâ€™t want to fight, I donâ€™t want to be on the defensive. Iâ€™ve already had an extremely rough life in my short 22 years and Iâ€™m tired of this. I want to live in a bubble but I canâ€™t. Maybe Iâ€™ll end it instead.
