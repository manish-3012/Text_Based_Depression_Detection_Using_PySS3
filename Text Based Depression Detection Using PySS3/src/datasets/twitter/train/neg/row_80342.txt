Sick to death how I'm treated due to my ugliness.The Horn effect is real, I experience it every day. 

Not sure if anyone else can relate but people give me strange glances, smirk, laugh at me, bully me, make me out to be awkward and weird. 

I'm weird because I sit alone because of the way I get treated? what do people expect?

I really wish I was in a country that had firearms to blow my brains out.
