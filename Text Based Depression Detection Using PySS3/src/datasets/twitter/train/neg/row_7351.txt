I'm going to be homeless again and I am freaking the fuck outI've made a couple posts before about how I'm living with a guy who's abusing me. That's shitty but now I'm just freaking the fuck out. Beyond Presto stealing my fucking funds off of my card for no reason and delaying me from seeing places for a couple days, I can't fucking find anywhere. Every place I've gone to seen or emailed about so far ask me where I work. I don't and I'm on disability and I say it as such. They then say they don't want someone who's on disability. 

WHY? IT'S FUCKING MONEY. JESUS CHRIST IM GOING TO BE FUCKING HOMELESS BECAUSE YOU'RE FUCKING PICKY?! I'm having a panic attack and crying and fuck. Then to top it all off this piece of fuck I live with keeps asking me every fucking day "Find a place to live yet?" or "Hows the hunt going" in a smug way. Has asked multiple times "You know you have to be out by the end of the month right?" YES. I FUCKING KNOW. 

im going to fucking lose it. I dont know what to do .
