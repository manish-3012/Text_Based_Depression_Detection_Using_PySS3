Fuck man...Whenever Iâ€™m awake I just feel miserable. I appreciate greatly the help. Iâ€™m just so stressed out. I need to move out of my parents and now I have to deal with a SECOND disorderly persons offense and the first one didnâ€™t even go to court yet. Iâ€™m about to finish my internship and I need a job. I havenâ€™t kissed a girl in over a year and last night I completely fucking embarrassed myself (check last post for details)

I donâ€™t know what else to do.
