Fuck it, its not worth itLike, nobody truly cares in this world it seems like, people only need themselves. Nobody ever wants to be around me for being gay or being too much to deal with or just cause they hate me, relationships suck, love is a tease we see on movies, and the light is fading. Does anyone even know if all of this shit we're diagnosed with ever goes away or are we just doomed? Ive been dealing with the thought of ending since junior year of highschool, about to be a sophomore in college now, and it just doesnt seem to get any better, people said college would be better, yet here i am, even worse shape. No friends, nothing to do, nowhere to go, nobody to care about. Is there a better life after this?
