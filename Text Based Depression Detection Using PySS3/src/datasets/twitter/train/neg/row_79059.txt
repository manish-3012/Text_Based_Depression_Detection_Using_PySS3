seriously feel like killing myself because of a breakup cant handle the pain anymoreitâ€™s literally been 6 months since it happened and iâ€™m still doing So terribly. every single moment has been trying to avoid suicide but lately ive completely given up. ik itâ€™s stupid to feel this way over a person but i have a lot of abandonment and trauma issues that i cant handle any of this. + I am on medication/getting therapy and still no improvement so i really am at a breaking point
