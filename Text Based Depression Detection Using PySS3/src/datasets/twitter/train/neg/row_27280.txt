PainI want to kill myself right now but Iâ€™m not sure what I have in my house that can do it, I have all these pills that might but idk if it would work because if I try to it might just knock me out and Iâ€™ll end up in some emergency room and be admitted to a mental institution. I only want to die mainly because Iâ€™m sick of the situation Iâ€™m in right now and shit doesnâ€™t even seem to get better and Iâ€™m over it. I feel like Iâ€™ve been on this planet for a long ass time. I donâ€™t deserve to be where Iâ€™m at right now and Iâ€™m only 17. Iâ€™m tired of it. I also want to kill myself to hurt my mom because I donâ€™t like her and me and my brother is all she has. Sheâ€™s a lazy ass hoarder and Iâ€™m tired of it. My dad left me when I was younger but I donâ€™t let that define me anymore. I donâ€™t know
