Been on the verge of wanting to kill myself all dayMy wife left me finally. I'm self destructive and I don't know and don't know how to stop it. In 30 days, me and my 12 year old daughter will be homeless with nowhere to go. I wish I wasn't like this. I wrote my wife a note hoping she finds it when I finally do kill myself. Someone please help me
