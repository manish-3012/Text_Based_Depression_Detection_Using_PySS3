Can I please talk to someone? I am running out of options. I promise to be kind, just message me.I am struggling harder and harder in recent times and no matter how many people surround me, I havenâ€™t got anyone to talk to. They are all my friends and family but I canâ€™t do it. I would love to talk to someone, anyone, just to listen. It would save my life, I am really reaching the end.
