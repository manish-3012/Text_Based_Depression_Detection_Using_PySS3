Nothing's going right and this is why I wish I was deadI'm still in school so I do normal things people like me do. I have to ride a bus because I just don't really have another choice right now and it's awful. Ive been bullied on the bus since preschool and it never stops, it only gets worse. Now that my little cousins, who are in fifth and second grade, are riding the bus, I have to stick up for them and myself. I was sticking up for them and got myself in a bunch of trouble and now I'm being threatened of getting kicked off and I honestly didn't harm or threaten or do anything to get kicked off. Everyone is bullying me right now and that's just the bus. I have to babysit my cousins and one of them will not sit still and that really makes me mad and bothers me. I leave the room and they follow and I never get a break. At school I take depression fits and just go to the bathroom and cry. No one likes me and they all call me a "fat hippopotamus" when they have nothing to talk about. I can't help my weight, I've went on starvation fits and I exercise every day I'm just made bigger and I can't help it. I make fat jokes about myself all the time so it doesn't bother me but it does. Then I like people like as a friend and my friends tell them that I love them and act all immature about the situation. My one friend who I thought was my best friend broke her ankle and had to miss school today, she constantly lies to me when i do belive her she turns around and it's a lie. I've cut myself for a year and everyone around me just tells me to stop that everythings fine when its not. They don't know what I deal with and every single day they add things that make me more stressed and make me want to die even more. I don't care about anything or anyone anymore. I'm ready for life to end. I touched on very few topics in this, but I still hate everything.
