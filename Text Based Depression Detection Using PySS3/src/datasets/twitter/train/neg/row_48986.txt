Everyone suddenly cares?! Ha.Tried to commit self murder two nights ago and now my phone is flooded with people asking me if Iâ€™m okay. Itâ€™s funny because Iâ€™ve been telling people I wasnâ€™t okay and everyone would just say â€œthings always get betterâ€ 

Well they donâ€™t get better, they donâ€™t get better when you canâ€™t stand yourself. I wish I could turn my thoughts off
