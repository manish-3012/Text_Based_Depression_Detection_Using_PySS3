Life is a jokeI FORCED MYSELF TO CRY, to feel sad. My mind is a crazy storm. I canâ€™t fucking do anything without being negative. Everything in my life feels like shit. Social anxiety has always brought me to endless suffering. I always pretend and act like everything is okay. When I let it all out, I just hurt those who I love the most. Why is it so hard to live. Why do I have to go through so much shit. Does it really matter if my problems arenâ€™t as insanely bad as others? Itâ€™s just selfish to try and show ur real emotions to the world. I had always had to be the person who encourages others to do better when I know myself ainâ€™t capable of doing that myself. I ALWAYS HELP OTHERS, but OTHERS DONT HELP ME. FUCK LIFE. EVERYTHING IS SHIT. I WISH THE WORLD WOULD JUST END RIGHT FUCKING NOW. I donâ€™t fucking care about life, itâ€™s all shit anyways. LIFE IS A JOKE.
