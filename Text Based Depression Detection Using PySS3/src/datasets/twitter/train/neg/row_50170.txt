I'm so tired of holding onIt's been 8 months since she left and everything still feels so fucked. I'm back with my parents and I'm about to fail out of my classes this semester and at this point I dont care anymore.

I have therapy regularly and I take medicine but it's not getting better and I cant keep doing this. I've been in the hospital before after having tried killing myself but I wont make that same mistake again.

I'm so tired of trying. I dont know if it's a matter of if I kill myself at this point as opposed to a matter of when. I just have to find a way to do it.

Anyway, thanks for reading if you made it this far. Glad someone cared enough to listen just a little bit.
