Every fucking day of my lifeIt's almost been a month since I tried and was hospitalized. I'm so sick of feeling. I'm so sick of feeling. I hate fucking up and that's all I keep doing. I just don't want to exist anymore. Everyone keeps saying that it will get better. When? It's been over 10 years. I don't know what to do anymore.
