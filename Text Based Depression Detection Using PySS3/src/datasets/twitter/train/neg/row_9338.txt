The call for death is getting stronger and stronger.Iâ€™ve recently been very stressed out about school and Iâ€™m worried about where my life is headed. I feel really alone, I feel distant from my friends and even my boyfriend, I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s wrong with me but some days I feel like I just canâ€™t connect to anyone. I have a horrible past that doesnâ€™t seem to go away and I feel like Iâ€™ve already made so many wrong choices and fucked up myself permanently. Iâ€™m worried about my mental health and overall sanity but I canâ€™t seem to get the proper help for it due to multiple reasons, I do have a therapist but if I told them how bad things really were Iâ€™d been sent to some kind of psych ward. Iâ€™d also extremely worry my mom and family who are already stressed out enough and stressful enough, I love them but they fight all the time about everything and itâ€™s so negative and hard to listen to. Because of all the stress and mental health I never have the energy I need to get anything done or feel productive, I feel like Iâ€™m wasting away life. Everything is stacking up to make a series of awful problems. I donâ€™t know how much longer I can hold everything together, Iâ€™ve been trying not to let anyone know because I donâ€™t want to worry anyone but I seriously need help. What should I do? I feel like Iâ€™m just spiraling, I canâ€™t live like this, soon I wonâ€™t be alive at all if this continues.
