Why should I keep living when Iâ€™m garbage? Honestly. Iâ€™m not worth the air I breath. At best I am a fucking joke and at worst I am a burden. Itâ€™s all by my own fault of course. The only thing more disgusting than my personality is my appearance.  
 

I never get the bad karma I truly deserve and It drives me crazy seeing good people struggle, while a POS like me gets off lightly. I am sorry for not killing myself ages ago... even if I know my apologies donâ€™t deserve to be accepted.
