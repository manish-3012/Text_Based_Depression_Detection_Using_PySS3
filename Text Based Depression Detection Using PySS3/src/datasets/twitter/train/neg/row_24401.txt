I love my kittyI've been suicidal for years, but I got a cat a couple months ago in the middle of the worst time in my life and now I can't keep her anymore
While I was sewing yesterday my cat swallowed a sewing pin and now has to get surgery and my mom won't let me keep her anymore.
We can't afford her surgery so we had to call my father who is rich but also a drug addict and tried to rape me less than five months ago.
Ive been holding on just so I can take care of her and now I failed at that and will probably never see her again after today. I'll have no reason to live anymore.
