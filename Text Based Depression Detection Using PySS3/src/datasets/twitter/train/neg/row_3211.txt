Am I selfish for wanting to end my life?Been feeling suicidal but just not got around to it purely because people would get upset and I understand that but I get called selfish and loads of other things for wanting to end my life. I can understand people thinking itâ€™s selfish but to me ending it seems like the only option sometimes and I have to go through the things I go through when nobody else understands. I donâ€™t even see a good future for myself so when people bring it up like itâ€™s gonna change things I just donâ€™t see it happening.

Sometimes I get right to the edge of attempting to end it all but then I realise what the fuck am I doing and I calm myself. Iâ€™ve never believed in myself and thought Iâ€™d never get this far but Iâ€™m still here and itâ€™s daily things that keep putting me down and Iâ€™m scared that Iâ€™ll get so far down Iâ€™ll end up killing myself without hesitation. Lacking support right now :â€™(
