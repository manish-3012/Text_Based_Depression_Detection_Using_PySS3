Thinking of ending it allI'm a long time stalker of this subreddit, which I know is a strange thing to say. But I have been thinking of ending it all on many occasions. It's just now it feels like an ever increasing feeling like this is the right thing to do. 

Right now my fiance is out with his friends from work so I guess it would lessen the impact of him finding me. I was also wondering if there are other things I could do, such as tidy up things which could make things easier for him to handle my passing?
