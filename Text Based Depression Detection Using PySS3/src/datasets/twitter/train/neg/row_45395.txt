Out but not okayI overdosed and ended up in the hospital. My blood pressure was too low and they were worried. I told them I wouldnâ€™t be okay... they sent me to a stabilization place which is 3 days. They donâ€™t check on you, they have things to hurt yourself with if you wanted to. The only thing they lock up is meds. Iâ€™m going down hill.... tomorrowâ€™s the 3rd. My trigger day. Iâ€™m not okay..
