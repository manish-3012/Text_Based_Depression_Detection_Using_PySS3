I survived the weekI thought I should update anyone who cares and read my last post about not thinking I was going to make it through the week. Well I did and it wasn't worth it, I guess. I'm going through another episode and I'm getting really fucking tired. I need a way out. I wish I could die and no one would care, I don't want to sound selfish but it's not fair to me. Anyways I'm getting off topic but I want to thank the person who personally messaged me and gave me words of encouragement.
