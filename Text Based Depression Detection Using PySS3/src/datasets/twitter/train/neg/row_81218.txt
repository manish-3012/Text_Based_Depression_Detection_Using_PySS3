I think Iâ€™m suicidalIâ€™m 21, hi. Iâ€™m a junior in college, but living with my parents rn bc of covid. 
Iâ€™m not really good at typing out my feelings but Iâ€™m gonna try. 
Recently Iâ€™ve been feeling really really unmotivated and uninterested in literally everything. Nothing makes me happy like it used to.
Iâ€™m tired. Like really really tired to a point where I can feel it ache in my bones, if that makes sense. 
And nothing seems worth it anymore. 
I think the reason Iâ€™m like this is because of stuff I thought I got over.
I went through some stuff when I was 16-18 with a boy I dated. He forced me into a lot of sexual things that I wasnâ€™t okay with and he would hit me or threaten my/his own life a lot if I said no. I thought I processed it and was over it, but recently itâ€™s all I can think about. Every day, no matter what Iâ€™m doing. If Iâ€™m with my boyfriend, itâ€™s on my mind. If Iâ€™m at work, itâ€™s on my mind. If Iâ€™m just trying to watch tv itâ€™s on my fucking mind. 
I feel so low. I donâ€™t cry usually but every day ive been in tears. 
Like literally I went to my boyfriends house and just laid in his bed and cried for 3 hours. I couldnâ€™t stop. And I couldnâ€™t explain because I havenâ€™t told anyone, so I blamed it on a muscle spasm that I didnâ€™t have. 
I donâ€™t constantly think about death, but I honestly feel like it would be easier if I wasnâ€™t here. Like really. I just donâ€™t want to be here anymore, and I donâ€™t want to think about my ex anymore, and I donâ€™t want to go through this anymore. I feel so so fucking tired. 
And I canâ€™t tell anyone. I donâ€™t want to wreck my relationship, I donâ€™t want to disappoint my parents. I donâ€™t want them to blame themselves. Nothings working anymore. I canâ€™t get happy. 
I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m suicidal but Iâ€™m so tired. And this is so hard. Idk what to do. 
Sorry if this is word vomit. Iâ€™m sorry if Iâ€™ve wasted anyoneâ€™s time. Iâ€™m sorry.
