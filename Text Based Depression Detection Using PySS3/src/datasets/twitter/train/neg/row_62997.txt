World seems kinda shitty, and I'm not sure it's something I can cope with.I'm a 15 y/o guy. My family is really wealthy. I have an awesome cat and an expensive gaming computer. But I really hate the world in general. When I read the latest news, I see not one good thing going on. The American government is broken, and we're in the list of the 20 *least* corrupt governments in the world. I'm harassed regularly because of my lack of faith in a god, and when I stick up for myself, *I'm* the bad guy. Russia is harassing Ukraine. ISIS is killing people. People are starving. People are raped daily. I don't understand joy, and how someone could feel it while we live in a world so fucked up that we can't even take care of our fellow humans. And there's nothing I can do to change it. I just want out. Away from people. Where I don't have to constantly hear about the horrendous things that people do. I'm ashamed to even be a human, and suicide seems like the only way out. I've tried everything else, cutting, drugs, ditching friends, you name it. Why won't it work?
