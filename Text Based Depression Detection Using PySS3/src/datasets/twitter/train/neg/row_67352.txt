I've had enoughI'm sorry if this is putting a burden on any of you but i just need to type this out. get it off my shoulders i guess. right now my laying in bed listening to my 2 roommates and their 2 girl friends playing cards. they are having so much fun and all i can think about is how A) how i never have fun anymore (especially when sober) and B) i am so bad at relationships that i'll never have a girl friend like they do. I'm really jealous. I haven't been on a date in almost 7 years (now a senior in college, do the math). I'm so afraid of being alone of the rest of my life, i'm not sure i want to keep going. I know i'm just feeling sorry for myself at this point but i've really had it. 

I feel like i'm on the 5th floor of a burning building. I can either jump or wait for the flames to get me. Either way the ending is the same, one is just much longer and painful than the other.
