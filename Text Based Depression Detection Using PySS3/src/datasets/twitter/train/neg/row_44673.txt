I don't know how to live without wanting to die.I made a pact to myself that I wouldn't try again after my last attempt. That I would keep going...

But I didn't realize I don't know how. I've been waiting to kill myself for 2, 3ish years. I've only had that on my mind. I haven't thought about graduation. Or getting into relationships. Or career choices. Or anything at all.
I never imagined a future for myself.

How do I live with the purpose of surviving?
