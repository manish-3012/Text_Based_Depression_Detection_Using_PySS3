Feeling like Iâ€™ve crossed a threshold.About a year ago I started having severe acid reflux and it has gradually turned my life into a living hell. It might sound like something manageable but Iâ€™ve racked up $60,000 worth of medical bills trying to find out whatâ€™s wrong with my stomach. At this point I am bed ridden most of the day. Iâ€™ve gone through my savings, sold everything of value and have been living without running water for months. The pain in my stomach while I am typing this is almost unbearable. If I had a gun I know with certainty I would kill myself right this moment. I have gone through twelve doctors, two gastroenterologists and a mental health psychiatrist. After having done every test known to medical science every single one of them cannot come to any type of conclusion because they canâ€™t see anything wrong with me. Iâ€™ve actually had doctors lean in and tell me I might have a mental health issue. I went to the ER today for the eighth time this month and they literally rolled their eyes at me and did nothing. I can barely move the pain is so severe and even breathing in hurts. I canâ€™t see myself getting out of this hole. I lay in bed and fantasize about jumping off the bridge by my apartment almost every night. The sad thing is if it wasnâ€™t for this hopeless pain I wouldnâ€™t want to die. I just canâ€™t live with this pain. I canâ€™t even have lettuce and water without my stomach bloating and hurting. I canâ€™t go on with this any longer.
