A day at the hospital.So I spent today at the hospital following a mental breakdown this morning. 

This is so, so hard but there is a sliver that I may just survive this. Today I started along a new road. I do not know where it will lead but anything is possible. I hope I can become the man I was 2 years ago. A man who had the love of a good woman... no, the love of the best woman Iâ€™ve ever known. A man who was confident, loving, content and at peace with life. 

I hope I can win you back, you mean the world to me and so much more than I could ever put into words.
