I've reached my limit , Should I end it all ?I never had a choice to begin with . Why was I the only one out of my siblings to get trauma and triggers from my dad's abusive behaviour towards my mom ? Why am I the only one who slits my wrists and cries myself to sleep every night ? Why am I the only one who's pressured into getting straight As ? Why did god choose me to suffer the most ? I didn't ask to be afraid of men , I literally get an anxiety attack if a man shouts at me . I can't deal with confrontation and I have to put up this shitty facade of the ' happy go lucky ' classmate so I can protect my family's pride . But why , why me ? Of all people why did god choose me to suffer the most ? To be bisexual in a homophobic country , to study my ass off day and night . To feel depressed and get anxiety attacks . Why me ? Why ? My dad has changed but I can't forget what he did . Why is it only me who can't forgive him ? Why is god so cruel and treats me like this ? I just want to live one day feeling happy , I beg you . I'm tired of being miserable and alone . Good grades for the sake of bad health . I hate this . I hate everything in this miserable life of mine . I want to die , someone please kill me . I'm too scared to do it myself . Is there even a reason for me to live ? Do I deserve to be happy ? Maybe I deserve all this for doing something in my past life but I don't know . Please I just want to cry on someone's shoulder , please hold my hand and tell me it's okay . I just want someone to tell me that i'm good enough and I should take a break . I just want someone to hold my hand . Will things really get better ? If it won't then I rather kill myself then continue suffering like this . I'm having an anxiety attack , I can't breathe . My chest hurts and my legs are shaking . Please somebody just hug me and tell me it's okay .
