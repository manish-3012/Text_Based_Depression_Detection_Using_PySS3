19 and fucked my lifeItâ€™s my own fault, when I was younger I never cared about my grades and I left college to work I had a few jobs but at the moment I just keep getting denied one. I wanted to join the military but my medical was declined for anxiety and a head injury even tho my ex girlfriend told me to go to the doctors I did to put her at ease and was trialed for anxiety I donâ€™t have it because it was her pressuring me and my head injury was a bump my friend said I was having a seizure to tease me but forgot to tell me it was a lie. My doctor told me he believes me but the army people might think Iâ€™m bullshiting because it sounds like a convenient lie but itâ€™s genuinely true. I feel I fucked my life from stupid decisions and thereâ€™s nothing I can do if this medical appeal fails Iâ€™m fucked guys.
