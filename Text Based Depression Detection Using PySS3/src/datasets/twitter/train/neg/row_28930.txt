My dog is the only thing thatâ€™s keeping me alive. He wonâ€™t know where Iâ€™ve gone if I left.Tired of living. Iâ€™m a 22 year old female living in an Asian country. 

Iâ€™m honestly not sure if Iâ€™m depressed or not because Iâ€™ve never been diagnosed. Especially in an Asian country, where having depression is basically taboo or your family doesnâ€™t want to have anything to do with you if you get diagnosed. 

I basically feel like my parents donâ€™t love me at all. They only love my elder brother. Because heâ€™s smarter than me. Theyâ€™ve always compared me to him and I always feel inadequate. 

I help around the house, I do the laundry, cook, clean but to them Iâ€™m just a lazy slob. 

I cry myself to sleep almost every night because Iâ€™m so tired of living. Sometimes I feel like I want to commit suicide because I feel my life isnâ€™t going anywhere. Iâ€™m 22 but my mother always says when she was at my age sheâ€™s already graduated from university and has a job. While Iâ€™ve just started University. She keeps saying Iâ€™m slow and stupid. 

Not to mention when I got tattoos and my parents found out (back in 2017) my dad slapped/ kicked/ punched/ strangled me. Because of tattoos. He says only prostitutes get tattoos. I wanted to kill myself that day. My mother saw everything happening but never stopped him. When my dad just beat my brother, she would put herself between the both of them physically. But for me? She just stood there and watched. 

I wanted to call the police but she said I would be â€œbreaking up the familyâ€

Right now Iâ€™m so tired. I also have been having issues with my boyfriend. Iâ€™ve posted in another thread that you can see if youâ€™d like. 

Iâ€™m just so tired of living. I donâ€™t feel like anything is ever going to get better. I feel Iâ€™ll forever be unloved, and Iâ€™ll die alone. I donâ€™t think anyone will ever miss me. 

The only thing thatâ€™s keeping me alive right now is my dog. Because he will be wondering where I went and that tears me up inside. But if my dog passes away, I wouldnâ€™t have anything to live for. Anymore..
