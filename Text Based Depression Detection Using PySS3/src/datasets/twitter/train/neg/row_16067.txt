Maybe reddit can help me.I get these really weird compulsions... I don't know if I'm even human anymore. I mean, if someone died would anyone even notice? I'm losing touch on what life is worth, and that is making it difficult for me to stay afloat. All it would take is about 3 seconds, and a life would be ended, and many others impacted forever... why does that seem so appealing to me?
