Still aloneWhen does it get better it's been 10 years.

When I graduated from high school the song that was spammed on the radio went like "does it always feel like nothing's changed at all." Five years later and it's still exactly the same, if not worse.

While I try to sleep all I can hear is my roommate and how socially successful he is.

Just fucking kill me already. Litterally nobody would miss me
