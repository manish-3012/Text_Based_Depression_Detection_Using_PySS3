I lied to you all, Iâ€™m sorry.I told you all life was worth living. Itâ€™s not. Iâ€™m done. I plan on selling all my most expensive items so that when I die the vultures, my mother and father, my abusers, my hateful and disgusting family canâ€™t take it all. I am sad I will miss Christmas but so be it. I will not be able to be sad if I miss Christmas because I wonâ€™t be able to think or feel anything. I already bought a grave plot. Everything is in order . Iâ€™m sorry I lied and said life was worth living.
