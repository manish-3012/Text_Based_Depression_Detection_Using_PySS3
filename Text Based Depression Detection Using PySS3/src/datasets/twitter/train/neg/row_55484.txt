I think this is it.I want to die tonight. I haven't done it yet because I didn't want my dad to find me and I don't want him to live with that. But I am that selfish right now because I'm tired of being everyone's doormat. My bf and I got into an argument and I tried to console him and fix the situation for the hundredth time and it still wasn't good enough. I hate my family so I don't care about them. I only care about my dad really. After the traumatizing things this week, I just can't take anymore. I'm so numb right now that I don't even care. So, I guess this would be my note.
