Hello EverybodySo, yea, hi all. The reason why I'm posting this is because I'm thinking about suicide again, and I really don't know what to do. I've thought about it before, a lot, but never gone through with it, and really don't think I will. It's just that after today the speed at which I mentally go to it is starting to alarm me.

So, the situation is basically that I just can't plain deal with my father. He bitches and complains about everything, almost nonstop, except for me, and I just can't handle it. The specific thing today that got me going was that my mom come home from work (he's unemployed) with a migraine. So, she says that she's just going to reheat leftovers from yesterday for dinner. My dad then proceeds to yell at her for a solid ten minutes and continues to do so until she acquiesces to make him something else. Afterwards he went off about how Obama is trying to ruin his life or something. 

I just can't deal with it everyday, seeing the crushed look in ky moms eyes, hearing the blind hatred in his voice. I've been trying, and I haven't thought about suicide in about a month, but after todays incident, my mind instantly jumped to suicide, which scared the hell out of me. I've tried talking to him, and he just won't change. I can't really get away from him for an extended period of time either.

I really don't know what to do. Even if I make it to when I go to college (assuming I get a scholarship that covers room and board. Otherwise I'm stuck here for another year at least. Yea.) I still know my mom has to deal with him, which crushes me. I just don't know.

I also don't know what I can accomplish by posting this here, but it just feels good to get it off my chest to someone other than my stuffed animals. Sorry if I formatted wrong, its my first time posting here and I'm on my phone.

Thank you for listening to me.
