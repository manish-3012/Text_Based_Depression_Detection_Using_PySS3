I'm SorryDear Parents,


It's hard to talk about it...   Ahhhhh..  I'm a disappointment to my family, to my college, to my work, and to myself. I appreciate the support, but I'm just fed up with put on a facade smile for people and not being able to get out of bed without taking something. For people who haven't dealt with depression, take this moment to think of yourself dying you will no longer exist. That void of emptiness. I want you to think of all the people you love and value...  and the memories that you have, and the experiences that you will never get,..  and if you are smart; you will be feeling a degree of fear, and to someone with depression having felt this fear and the absolute certainty to their end. This fear, was better, because whatâ€™s behind them is worse. Enough rambling, I guess this is the end. Iâ€™m Sorry.
