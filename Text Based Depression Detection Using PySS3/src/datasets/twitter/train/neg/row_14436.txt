drained.i donâ€™t really have the words right now for how i feel, except that itâ€™s miserable. i donâ€™t have anything or anyone to keep me going anymore, and iâ€™m still hung up over someone who couldnâ€™t care less if i was alive or dead. iâ€™m trying to keep my shit together because my best friend needs me, but iâ€™m just tired and things have only been getting worse. i donâ€™t think iâ€™ll be here come next year and i feel sick at the thought.
