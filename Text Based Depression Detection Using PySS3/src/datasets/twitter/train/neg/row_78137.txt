Yelling makes me want to self harm so badTomorrow I have class with a teacher that is kinda bullying me, he says it's a joke but it doesn't really seems like it. 

He yells every class and when I hear yelling I instinctively cry or get really upset, even if they're not yelling at me. 

I just cant help it I get so overwhelmed I just want to repeatedly cut and harm myself over and over again till I feel like I have gotten what I deserve for being such a disappointment. 

I just cant handle yelling and screaming or even just loud talking idk maybe its PTSD from my childhood but I dont want to feel like this I want this to be good I want my teacher to respect me and respect the fact that I'm really affected by these things bc I just want to bang my head on the wall till I pass out and I dont know what to do or why, I just dont want to feel like this again
