Can someone be too broken?I spent many years being severely abused and it still affects me. Can someone be too abused to run a normal life? I tend to mess things up due to being re-traumatized and turning into something I'm not.

The most recent incident is with my girlfriend. She is everything I've ever wanted but after getting a message from an abuser inquering why I haven't killed myself yet, I misplaced my anger. I turned into someone she didn't know. I wasn't who she fell in love with. I messed it all up in the space of a week and she doesn't know how much more she can take. She is everything to me. I can't lose her. I'm trying to fix it. I'm getting on meds, seeing a therapist multiple times a week, and proving that wasn't who I really, but I don't know if it will work. 

Every time I hug her I have trouble letting go because I feel like she will leave me. I kiss her so hard hoping she will feel my love and reciprocate. I know she loves me but I'm too much. I can't say it to her, but I don't want a future if she isn't in it. She is what made all the other pain worth it. I recognize that is too much for one person to deal with so I try not to let that across to her. 

If we break up, it will only prove I'm too broken. I can't go on without her and even if i could, I truly don't want to. I already know what to do when the day comes. It won't be her fault. It's my fault. It's all the other pain that I've dealt with finally reaching me.
