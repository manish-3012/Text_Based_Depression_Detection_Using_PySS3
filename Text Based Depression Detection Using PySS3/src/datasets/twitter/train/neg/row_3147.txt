Im about to do it. Depression has finally defeated me.This is it. I cant do it no more. Im tired of hearing everyone telling me how worthless i am ,im just a failure. I wish there was no such thing as grades , i wish i was born somewhere else with better people around me. I made mistakes in the past and idk till how long am i gonna have to pay for them. I have tried ny best but i just cant bring myself to concentrate on my studies.  Every night i only sleep  barelt 2 hours , my deadlines are not far from now and i havent done anyrhing to prepare for em. Everyone is so better and faar ahead of me. I have no chance of becoming what i want. I gave my everything for my family but they never helped me back. I look at every aspect of my life i see failure. Im just a fucking loser that deserves to die.
I finally made a perfect hangman's knot and its time to use it.
