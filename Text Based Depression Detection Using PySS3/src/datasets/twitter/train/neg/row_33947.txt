Finding it difficult to deal with the weight of depressionI'm 17 years old, and i've been through heavy bouts of depression in the past year or so and lately the given situation i find myself is proving to be too much.

I cant reach out to those close to me without being accused of weakness or begging for a pity party. I was bullied for my size for years until i retaliated and gained the reputation of instability. I've recently broken up with my long-term girlfriend too and im learning more and more about what she was like behind my back each day, and with each secret learned its like another nail in the coffin. I just thought i could come here to maybe discuss and ask for help if anyone's willing to hear me out at all.

I need to find a purpose in life until all my reasons dry up.
