I think i am addicted to psychiatric violenceI think i am kinda dumb because i have been inpatient a lot during the last two years and i have been clearly traumatized by it. I was under so much medication that i couldnâ€™t think straight and i was tied to my bed most of the time, being put in Â«Â solitary Â«Â  a lot, restrained for days at once. It was awful but now that i am feeling better i canâ€™t stop thinking about it and it is like... i miss all this violence? 
It doesnâ€™t make sense to me, does anyone else feels like that?
