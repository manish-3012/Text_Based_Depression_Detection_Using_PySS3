Iâ€™m just getting worse and worseI made a throwaway account because Iâ€™m too embarrassed to admit who I really am, but I need some help, or something. 
Iâ€™m 26 now, Iâ€™ll be 27 in a couple months, and I just feel like a big pile of worthlessness. I donâ€™t have the motivation to do the things I love anymore... I used to paint, and I even had a few that won a few contests when I was in highschool, but whenever I try and pick up a brush now, I draw a blank, or I just canâ€™t seem to find the motivation to do anything. I used to enjoy playing video games, but even that doesnâ€™t seem to interest me these days. I donâ€™t hang out with my friends as much as I used to, and whenever we make plans, when the day actually comes, I just canâ€™t find the motivation to actually leave my house, and it kills me, because I cherish my friendships. Iâ€™m afraid Iâ€™m gonna lose them. 
The biggest thing that bothers me though, is the fact that Iâ€™ll never be happy like I was when I was in highschool. I would give up everything in my life right now to go back to my highschool years, and re-live it. I was happy, I didnâ€™t worry so much about everything, I didnâ€™t have to worry about an income to afford living... Maybe itâ€™s selfish of me, idk, but I just wish I didnâ€™t feel like this every single day. 
Iâ€™ve resorted to drinking, almost everyday just to numb my mind. It works, but I canâ€™t help but feel like Iâ€™m just spiraling out of control. 
Everything just seems so pointless now, and I just want to die.
