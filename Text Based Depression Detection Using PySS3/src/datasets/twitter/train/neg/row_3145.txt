Making my 7th suicide attempt tomorrow morningMid 20s male

I'm not unattractive, but not a male model or anything. I take care of my hygiene and wear nice clothes. I keep my space clean and organized. These things are all so hard but I make sure every day things are taken care of.

People tend to like me but I isolate myself. Many people care about me but I never do anything social because I feel out of place doing anything with anyone. 

I have a very loving family who will do anything to help. It hurts me to know how much stress I've caused my family and others, and how much pain my death will cause to my family and so many others.

I have increasingly severe depression and anxiety I've lived with since probably birth or very early childhood. They've led to other mental health problems. I've learned very well how to hide them so I appear to the casual onlooker to be doing ok.

I've made 6 genuine suicide attempts in the past few months. I've tried so many therapists and so many psychiatric medications. Still working with a therapist and using several medications.

I'm so young and if I keep fighting I know I can pull through this and create a decent life for myself and do a lot of good in this world.

But I'll likely continue trying to kill myself until it works despite all the professionals and everyone else who have tried to help.

I'll probably fail my attempt tomorrow and end up in another mental hospital. I've been spending lots of time in those lately.

I feel so guilty. But I'm just exhausted.
