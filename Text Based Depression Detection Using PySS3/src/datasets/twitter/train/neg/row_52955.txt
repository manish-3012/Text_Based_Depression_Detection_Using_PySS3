Deciding to stay.Made a post the other day.

Some typical responses that werenâ€™t helpful, but one guy sent me a message and just listened to me and it really, really helped. I mean, he didnâ€™t give hardly any advice but it just mattered to me that somebody listened.

Iâ€™ve decided to stay. One of my friends helped pay my power bill so thatâ€™s just one less weight that was making me dip into suicidality. Now that I have another week before bills are due, maybe just maybe I can pull something together.

Unfortunately after I did that, I asked in a few other subreddits for advice. They looked in my history and saw the suicide post, and how I was now asking how to live, and all got VERY harsh and started accusing me of being a scammer. At first it made me belligerently angry and I cursed them but then I realized, this is Reddit. Itâ€™s strangers. They have to assume the worst because my kidsâ€™ welfare is at stake. So I apologized to everyone and Iâ€™m committing internally to never baring my soul on a public forum again. 

I suggest all of you do the same. People will take every last thing you say and twist it into the most scammy possible scenario and absolutely vilify you. Itâ€™s better to have hard and long conversations with a few close people you love. 

Today or tomorrow Iâ€™m going to meet with the pastor at my local church. Going to ask him to look at all of the factors in my life and counsel me about a plan for the future and hold me accountable.

Thereâ€™s a chance I can pull this together. Honestly, when I tried to make a video saying goodbye to my oldest daughter something clicked in me and I knew that it was only a matter of time before I wouldnâ€™t want to kill myself. Thereâ€™s no weight of pain, guilt, or poverty that is stronger than my desire for her good. Not that my other children matter less, but sheâ€™s older and has a more complete personality and I can just see in my mindâ€™s eye how it would absolutely devastate her for daddy to die.

Anyways.. this post doesnâ€™t serve to say â€œit gets betterâ€ in regards to life. Itâ€™s to say â€œit gets betterâ€ in regards to your resolve. Well, it may. Itâ€™s worth not making the decision to wait until a time that you would decide otherwise, if that makes any sense. 

Wait for the best version of yourself to make the most important decision in your life.
