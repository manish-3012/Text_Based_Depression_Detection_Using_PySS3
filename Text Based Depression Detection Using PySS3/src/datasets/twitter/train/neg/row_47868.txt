I need someone who can understandHello there people of this subreddit. I'm dealing with quite a few mental illnesses and i do believe i need treatment. However the best i can have in my country is a psychiatrist who wont do a treatment other than giving me antidepressant. But here's the thing. I told my family that i want to at least get an antidepressant so i can have one of my illnesses weakened at the very least and they said sure we will go there in the begginning of this month. And we are at the middle of the month now so i reminded them about this and i told them my depression is getting worse (nightmares, sleepless nights and suicidal thoughts and whatnot are getting more severe) which they responded with "you are just exaggerating stuff and there is nothing to trigger your depression" but there always is, they arent me, how are they supposed to know what i feel and experience? So i told my mom that i hope i will suicide in front of her so she can see it and i don't know anything at this point. I just need someone to talk to until i;
a)get treated in some way that i can get rid of those suicidal thoughts
b)kill myself
Even my friends dont care and now my family is added to the list of people who dont care at all. I hate my life with all my heart.
