How do you get rid of scars?No, I've still not stopped suffering, but I hate cutting myself, not because of the pain, but because I deal with a lot of people on a daily basis, and I cut my arms, so it's easy for someone to spot it, my classmate almost saw it today, and so did my mom, but I acted quickly and hid it. And I'm addicted to it right now, I love hurting myself because I made a lot of mistakes, I am one, after all.
How can I conceal them? I can't wear long sleeved shirts or stuff because it's really hot around here and my mother would never let me off the hook if I do something suspicious, and my cousin has these things (alcohol or something) that will help it recover, though I don't want to come out to her nor steal from her closet.
