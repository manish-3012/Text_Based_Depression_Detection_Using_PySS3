I donâ€™t care?Is it normal to feel this numb? I barely shower, I sleep
my days away, I donâ€™t care about school, I have diabetes and I find myself not caring if I donâ€™t take my medicine, I donâ€™t care if it takes 30 years off my life.

I just donâ€™t care about literally anything and I donâ€™t see the point in doing anything anymore. I donâ€™t want nor care about doing school work, I donâ€™t care about losing my job, I donâ€™t care that I donâ€™t have a significant other. The only thing stopping me from killing myself is my parents, brother, and my best friend. I just know they will be sad and I know they would never forgive themselves or get over it. But itâ€™s truly not them. There is nothing they can do.
