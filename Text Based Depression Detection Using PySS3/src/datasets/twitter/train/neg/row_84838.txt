I'm tiredthe only thing keeping me here is the fact that someone would have to break the news to my 6 year old nephew and it would cause him to end up where i am today. wanting to die. so what could be worse than wanting to kill yourself? wanting to kill yourself but being unable to and having to live out this shitty existence.
