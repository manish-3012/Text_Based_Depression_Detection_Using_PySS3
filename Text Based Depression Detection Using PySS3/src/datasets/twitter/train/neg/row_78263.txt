Does anyone else feel like their SO want them to die?My girlfriend is the only person I could possibly talk to about killing myself. When I'm at a low, I get unresponsive. She told me I've been making the house unstable. It's just me and her. If she's feeling like things are unstable, I guess that's on me.
