I feel alone and want to end it allI feel so alone and hopeless. My girlfriend tells my that I make her feel bad when I want to talk about how shitty I feel with her, I have literally 0 true friends, my only friends either make fun of me or donâ€™t understand at all. My father doesnâ€™t understand what Iâ€™m going through. Maybe Iâ€™m just way to fucked up and I should just kill myself and end it all? I have these thoughts every fucking day. Also my girlfriends parents are fucked up and she didnâ€™t even tell them about me because they would just not allow her to be with me. I donâ€™t think anyone will read this but I really Am close to fucking ending it all.
