If I canâ€™t love myself, how can i love anyone else?I just want to leave because I have fucked up relationships where people want to leave after minutes of interaction. I feel ashamed for things I have thought and said to people that I love and that love me. I wish I could take it all back. I wish I could love myself again but I have spent so many hours hating myself thinking of ways out..I donâ€™t know how to come back from this pity party. I just want to spare everyone from my dull self. I am so lucky and healthy physically but I feel empty and narcissistic and rigid mentally. I donâ€™t want to leave a legacy of suicide with my family but I donâ€™t want to burden them with worry about me as I live.
