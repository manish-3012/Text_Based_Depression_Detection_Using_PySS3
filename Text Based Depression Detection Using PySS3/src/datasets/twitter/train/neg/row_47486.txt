I accidentally counted up my pillsAnd I think I have enough to end it. Iâ€™ve been so so depressed and suicidal lately. I cry a lot during normal life activities because the level of constant pain is too high to sustain. Itâ€™s like this heavy, dark ghost living in my body.  It feels like I have no control over my life or body. It feels like my circumstances will be immobilizing forever. Or that I canâ€™t maintain surviving until they get better. I canâ€™t last until the pain is gone. Itâ€™s too painful to handle much longer. I have too few coping mechanisms and forms of support no matter how hard I try. Iâ€™m handed sack of shit after sack of shit and I feel like a pathetic victim idiot. I canâ€™t even take control of my life to improve it. I try and Iâ€™m met with setback after setback. It doesnâ€™t get better no matter how hard I try. Iâ€™m exhausted. I get yelled at for sleeping when Iâ€™m just fucking depressed. Itâ€™s too painful to be awake. Thereâ€™s nothing anyone could do to help. Iâ€™m too valuable of a source of negative energy for the people in my life for them to be nice to me. They have to hurt me because they need my pain as fuel to survive. Thatâ€™s my place in life. Just a fuel source for narcissists and abusers. Iâ€™m scared to make the move but today I realized. I have the tools I need to end my life. I could make it all go away just like that. How do you fight the temptation to just let go? It feels the little things I was holding on for just arenâ€™t worth it. I donâ€™t give a shit about how my death would affect other people. No one gave a fuck how their behavior affected me during my life. Their feelings are not my responsibility. I owe them nothing. Why stay? How is the pain worth it? Is it really?
