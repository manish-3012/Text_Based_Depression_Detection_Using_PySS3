I donâ€™t know if I wanna live or if I wanna dieI canâ€™t talk to my  family about my depression when I do they donâ€™t talk it seriously they just tell me I complain too or something like that I really wish I wasnâ€™t born then I wouldnâ€™t have to live with this depression I wanna kill myself but Iâ€™m afraid of whatâ€™s gonna happen after death I donâ€™t wanna be alive at the same time though and continue to suffer
