When You Finally Realized How Unloved You Are 

Only family I have is an adult daughter in another state and her 6 year old child, my Grandson. I was supposed to visit in April, for my birthday, only thing I asked for, to see them, and it was cancelled because of Covid.

Since restrictions have been lifted they have taken 3 family trips. Not a word to me about visiting. Not a thought about how it was my only birthday wish. I guess they just don't want to see me. I heard about the third trip today and decided I'd rather be dead than be put through anymore emotional pain.

I now realize I have no family. It's almost a relief. Expectations are a bitch.
