I'm tired of being incompetent and not having a stable career.I got into a "relationship" with a guy I met online and got into a car accident moving for him. I lost almost everything and my insurance refused to total my car. I stayed with him until I got my car back weeks later. Before I left him he sexually assaulted me and took my virginity. He used me for money and to make himself feel better. The police couldn't do anything and I was briefly homeless. 

He lied to me how he wasn't attracted to certain girls and "rejected" them or didn't try, when in reality he was mad they didn't like him. 

I got tested a month later and got negative test results for HIV, but I'm still afraid he gave me something because he lied about a lot of things. Fast forward later I took a job and later was encouraged to quit because I had difficulty concentrating on my job. 

I know people live successful lives, but I feel like he ruined my life. I end of up job hopping because I'm in pain.
