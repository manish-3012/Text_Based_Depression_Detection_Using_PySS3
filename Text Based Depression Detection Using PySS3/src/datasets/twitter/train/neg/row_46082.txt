im so fucking weirdim literally like a fucking serial killer or some shit dude, my grandma died like a week ago and i feel nothing about it. i also got caught running away from home a couple days ago so now everyone thinks im a freak and everyone is asking me to open up and shit but fuck that right, im a guy so i gotta be manly all fucking day. im running away from home again, packing a phone charger, a knife, sleeping pills, headphones, some soda and im walking from sweden down to spain, you might have seen my last post about that.
