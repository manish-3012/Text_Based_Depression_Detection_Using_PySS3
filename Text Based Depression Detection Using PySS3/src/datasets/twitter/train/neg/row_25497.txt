contemplating suicideI'm 14 (male), I have been thinking about Suicide for awhile now. There is so much hate in the world and it's so depressing. It's hard when you know your parents won't accept you when you don't even accept your self. I am questioning my sexuality and it has caused alot of self loathing. I started cutting 2 years ago and the scars added up but are hidden. I can't really find a reason to get out of bed besides school and i hate school. So many bullies and Homophobic assholes. I have grown so ashamed of my Sexuality i grew hate for the church i don't even feel welcome there. You know what's F**ked up? My Best friend (he is christian) i came out to him and he attacked me with Bible verses. i am not sure how long i can hang on.
