Please help. Brother is suicidal.He won't talk about it. He won't get help. He won't go to a therapist and he won't make an effort. I can't say I can understand what he's going through, but I get his lack of motivation and an absence of sense of importance or purpose. He says life is boring and is nothing but work.

He has a car and he sometimes make an effort to lose weight and he's deleted his Ruenscape account, which I'm very happy about. We think he's bipolar, mabye manic. He'll stay in his room sometimes and whenever he does we worry what he might do. 

He talks about killing himself when he's in an episode, but when he's not he's one of the sweetest people. 

He's talked about killing the family but I don't think he will go that far, so I don't worry. But I'm not calling his bluff whatsoever when he talks about hurting himself. 

When he's in a good state, which is about 30% of his time awake and can last about an hour and a half, we can talk about getting medication. But we don't want to end that good state and anger him, or tempt him to do anything. What should we do? 

My mom has dealt with suicide before, and it seems to run in his father's side (we have different dads). Butbwe still feel like we can't force help on him until it's too late
