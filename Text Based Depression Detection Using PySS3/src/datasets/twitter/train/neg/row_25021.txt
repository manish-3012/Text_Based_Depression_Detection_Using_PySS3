Ever hear a song and wonder what it would be like to die to it?Kinda geeky I suppose but the soundtrack to Naruto Shippuden have these eerie gospel kind of chants that leave me with this one image in my head. Me standing on the edge of my balcony of my 6th floor appartment, inevitably jumping with this in my ears. 
Fuck everything sucks. Even though I have parents that love me, I'm in college doing relatively well, and have a couple of friends I consider brothers, everything just isn't working out. My parents love me but won't understand my religious standpoint, which will one day undo that love. My social life in college is essentially non-existant. I was so into things in High School and had the whole school as friends. Now I feel like I don't have anybody. And one of these brothers is depressed and cuts himself and no matter how hard I try, he just doesnt get any better. What is the point of life really? Would dying really make a difference? What happened to my sociality? I guess thats my biggest problem. Where's the old Karim that I once knew? Where is everyone I once had? Why can't I make new friends to replace the ones Ive lost? Whats wrong with me?
