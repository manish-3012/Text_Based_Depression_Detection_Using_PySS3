I let my life go off trackHey,

I've been depressed for a while without giving it much thought, i tried to just ignore it. 3 months ago I had a shitty breakup and that made me very self-conscious, as in I feel like my last 3-4 years were wasted smoking weed and doing nothing constructive. I dropped out of school and i had already pretty much stopped seeing friends. Being alone all the time is starting to get to me, i've been having thoughts about dying or just fleeing somewhere to start over for some weeks now. It's scaring the fuck out of me. I never harmed myself but I came close many times, and I don't have a concrete plan, but I keep imagining ways that I could die by accident and it's weirdly relieving to think about it. I'm scared, I want to tell someone, but the only person i'd be comfortable telling is someone that i've pushed away a lot recently. And I don't want to just have her around so I can vent when I need to, that wouldn't be right. I need tips on how to approach the subject and i need to know if it's okay for me to tell that.

Thanks
