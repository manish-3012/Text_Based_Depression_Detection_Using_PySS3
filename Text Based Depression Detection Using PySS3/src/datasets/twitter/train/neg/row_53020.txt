Death and suffering turn me onYes. It's gotten so bad that the only time im happy is when I imagine getting hurt or dying. When I'm upset, I think about all the different ways I could die and for some reason it calms me down. Now I can't seem to get turned on by anything except imagining being tortured and then killed. I have developed masochist personality disorder, and I'm afraid that my therapist has found out about it. I don't think I want to die, but then again just the mere thought of being murdered makes me feel butterflies in my stomach. I want to be drowned, choked, and beaten to death. Is this some sort of fetish? Ive never experienced something like this before, but maybe it's because of the hormones?(I'm a 16F) Or do I just really wanna die that bad?
