I overdosedI overdosed and it is probably one of the WORST decision I have ever made in my life. Yes, things have changed ever since and I wonâ€™t get into it but it has changed my aspects in life and the options I can take. 

I am not motivated enough to start things yet but Iâ€™m getting there. I will probably never try to kill myself ever again. It was a stupid decision. I still am very suicidal of course but I have gained fear of harming myself again. 

I have stopped thinking about how and what I feel like. Itâ€™s too much for me, I believe. Iâ€™m trying to live in the moment and get to my goals. 

This is a new start for me. It feels like Iâ€™ve been born again. I hope everything goes well. I hope everything stays well.
