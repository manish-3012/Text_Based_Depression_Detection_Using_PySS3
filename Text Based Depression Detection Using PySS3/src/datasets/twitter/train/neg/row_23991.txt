Eating Disorder "Recovery" is killing me.So I reached 100 pounds yesterday (I'm 5'5). God, I am totally miserable. 

The rational part of my brain knows that at my height that is still pretty tiny but the ED part is telling me that I've really f*cked this up. I gained 20 pounds. I'm disgusting and I don't want to even be in my gross body anymore.

Rational part of my brain keeps telling me: Remember how six months ago you didn't even have the energy to climb stairs? Remember how you had SO LITTLE energy that you kept peeing the bed because your body was too exhausted to wake itself up to go to the bathroom? Remember how you had to buy clothes from the kids section because even the smallest size in juniors was far too big? Remember how your friends in the pro-Ana community are pretty much all dead? You don't have a menstrual cycle anymore and you're in your twenties!

But the ED part of my brain: Remember how you were always the fattest, ugliest girl in your class until you found pro-Ana? Remember how everyone told you how lovely you were when you first started losing weight? Don't you realize that if you get fat again they will go back to hating you and mocking you. You'll never find another boyfriend because fat girls don't deserve love. Won't you miss feeling light and free when you're bogged down with more weight? Don't you realize your facial features look best with no fat on them? You won't get a job. You won't have friends. You'll just be another worthless fatty that everyone hates and rightly so. Stop eating you stupid fat pig, you should be ashamed. I am ashamed. One hundred pounds. I swore to God I would never see triple digits on a scale again.

I can't even take a shower or change my clothes because I don't want to deal with the extra weight on my body or see it.

Hopefully, I feel better soon but counseling has not been doing much for me so far. Thanks guys, venting helps. :)
