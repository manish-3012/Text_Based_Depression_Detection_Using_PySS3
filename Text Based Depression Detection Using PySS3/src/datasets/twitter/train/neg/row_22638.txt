Banned from the suicide lifeline chatHow fucking awful do you have to be to get banned from a suicide prevention chat? The last time I used it the guy told me he was going to send police to my house because he didn't feel like I was going to be safe.

No police ever came and after that I wasn't able to use the chat anymore-- Still not able to. Just another validation that I'm probably insufferable to talk to, even the volunteers can't stand it.

So, now I'm in the process of buying a gun. What's the point?
