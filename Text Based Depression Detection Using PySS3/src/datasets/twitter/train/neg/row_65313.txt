Anyone want to talk to a chronically suicidal person?Just to chat with, whatsapp or whatever, throughout the day, just for light conversation. I'll be nice, kind, positive, not a downer. I'm not looking for someone to be my therapist or punching bag. I just want someone to talk to regularly. 

I don't have much in common with people outside of this forum, lately, and it's hard to pretend to be okay to people who don't understand suicidal feelings. It seems to create tension that perpetuates a pattern of me being suicidal and them thinking they are helping.

So I come on here a lot, but people just, stop reaching out, or talking back. That gets, depressing. I am just as much to blame, but I guess, I just, feel like a bother to people at some point. 

So I am just asking here, on the onset, for someone to talk to, who doesn't plan on leaving just yet. Who doesn't have preconceived notions of what feeling suicidal is like, or what it means, or implies. I won't kill myself. But I can't really stop the feeling inside of me, that tells me that death is the only way out.

I am not looking for someone to date. If that is what you are looking for, or hope to gain eventually from me, please don't message me. You are not helping.
