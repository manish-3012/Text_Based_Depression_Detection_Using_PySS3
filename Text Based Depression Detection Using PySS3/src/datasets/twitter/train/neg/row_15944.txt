It's an option.I've always had a fear of death, but I'm starting to consider suicide as an option. All my life I've been rejected, called weird, made fun of, etc. I'm far from an inept human being. I like to think I'm quite nice with reasonable exceptions (we all make mistakes). Not many people want to be friends with me, they just ignore me. I dislike my family due to a lifelong relationship issue. I'm seventeen, about to graduate and stuff. I used to envision this moment being a magnificent time in the story of my life, but it overall seems mundane and crooked. I understand it could get better, but I've made mistakes too, and I'm not so sure if it's worth continuing this story called life.
