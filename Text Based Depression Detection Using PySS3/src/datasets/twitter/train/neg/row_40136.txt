fuck this lifewalked around tonight for an hour or so. every time i saw a car or a bus or something, i wanted to step in front of it. just to see what would happen. 

i didnâ€™t do it. fuck knows why, probably guilt that iâ€™d scare the shit out of some random driver that hadnâ€™t done anything wrong. i donâ€™t wanna hurt anyone.

thereâ€™s nothing here anymore thatâ€™s helping, i donâ€™t feel like anybody cares. iâ€™m just so fucking sad, all the time. and i donâ€™t have a clue what helps anymore.

decided that when everyone eventually gets sick of me (a matter of time) iâ€™ll end it. until then, iâ€™ll just stick with whatever bullshit each day brings.
