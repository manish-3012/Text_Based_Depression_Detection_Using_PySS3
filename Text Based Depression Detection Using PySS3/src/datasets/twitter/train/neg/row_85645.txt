[update to] I know how Iâ€™m going to do itIâ€™d link my original post, but I donâ€™t know how to. 


Anyway, I thought my research was well thought through â€“ it wasnâ€™t.


Iâ€™m adding 2 things to the mix.


First â€“ anti-emetics (dopamine blockers), to make sure I donâ€™t puke all that fucking shit (Iâ€™ve also made an inventory of everything (potentially lethal) that Iâ€™ve got.


And second â€“ Iâ€™m not going to do it on that overhanging railing. There are just too many eyes, even at 3-4 am. Thatâ€™s what sucks about living in the city. 


Iâ€™ve written my suicide notes â€“ theyâ€™re not *just* password-protected, in case law enforcement wants to have a look at it â€“ Iâ€™ve got a trusted friend whoâ€™d be able to unlock it with and only with their fingerprint.


I might not do this tonight, but Iâ€™m probably going to do so very soon.



The only reason Iâ€™m doing this is so that maybe whoever lives on after I do knows that Iâ€™m serious about this, and that it wasnâ€™t an impulsive decision. 


My suicide note will explain more to the people who were in my life. 


Thank you, if youâ€™re reading this.
