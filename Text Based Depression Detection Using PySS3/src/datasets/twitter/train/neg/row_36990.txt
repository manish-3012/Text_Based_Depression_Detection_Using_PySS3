I just feel...bad...and I don't know why.I haven't felt like this in a really long time. I've worked so hard to overcome my suicidal feelings and find better ways to cope, but tonight? I just feel _bad_. Not even depressed, just...not right. Like an unhappy sinking feeling. Like the strongest discontent with my current situation that I am capable of feeling. And there's that nagging part of me saying "you have an easy out." It's a voice I've taught myself to ignore over the course of the last few years. Or maybe a voice that completely disappeared. Point is, the nagging suicidal feeling has come back. I know I can't and won't do it. I don't want to be that student that kills herself right before/during finals week because school was "too much". Because it's not too much for me, and I'm capable of doing the work I need to do to finish. I know my friends would be devastated. I know my mom would have to make that long drive across state lines when she found out. I'm not going to kill myself, but I can't help feeling like I want to.
