Suicide because of shitty marksI'm thinking of suicide again because of my marks for school. I understand how dumb that sounds but sometimes I feel actually pretty hopeless about it. All I really need is for someone to tell me that failing a course, or having to repeat a grade is completely ok. I'm probably not going to do it but sometimes I REALLY think about it, which is kinda stupid when you think about how small 12 or 13 years is.
