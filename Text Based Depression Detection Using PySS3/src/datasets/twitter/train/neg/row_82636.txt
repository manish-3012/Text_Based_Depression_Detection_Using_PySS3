A note in progress...Does anyone have a suicide note that's a work in progress? I got into a really dark place and started a note. I abandoned it but sometimes return to it and add thoughts and explanations to it. Is that normal? Why do I do that? The one thing that's keeping me back is my children. I write them notes and add to existing ones, constantly, like I'm gone. Is that an ok way to deal with my thoughts? I hate the idea of getting a pill from the Dr and I already know what a counselor is gonna say so I don't think they'd help. What are your thoughts? 

Wtf is the internet?
