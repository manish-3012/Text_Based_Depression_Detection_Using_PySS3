I took 5 sleep eze extra strength pills right now.I don't know how harmful it is. I couldn't take it anymore. I can only be at peace when I'm asleep. I feel like my body feels weird and my hands are shaking but I'm not sure if it's just a placebo type effect. I'm scared but at the same time I welcome the peace if anything does happen. I took them 5 minutes ago. I've always been too much of a coward to do anything but this past week has been very hard and I just can't handle life anymore. I have nobody.
