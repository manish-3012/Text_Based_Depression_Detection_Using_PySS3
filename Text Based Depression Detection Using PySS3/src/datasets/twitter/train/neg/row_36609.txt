GoodbyeGoodbye world. This is the end of the line. The end of my short life. My death will free a lot of people from pain and their past. I want to apologize to all the people I've insulted, all the people I've hated, all the people I've even spent time with. Meeting me will have caused you pain. I'm trying to free you. Goodbye.
