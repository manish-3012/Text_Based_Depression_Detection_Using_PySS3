Do Suicide Hotlines always call the police?Things are getting worse and I really need someone to talk to, but I don't really have anyone. My family has their own problems and I don't want to worry them. I really feel like I might do permanent damage to myself during one of these days and I go in and out of these feelings. I'll randomly get an urge to kill myself and I won't know what to do to get out of it other than just waiting it out. Do all suicide hotlines call the cops? Is there any way to talk to them without them sending someone? The last thing I want is to be trapped in some facility.
