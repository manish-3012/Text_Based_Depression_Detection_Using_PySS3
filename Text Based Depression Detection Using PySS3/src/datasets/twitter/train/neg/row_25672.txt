I feel suicidal, and asking for help feels burdensome.I donâ€™t know what to do. I made a throwaway just to vent, I suppose. I am in a constant struggle, trying to make sense of the world, but I donâ€™t think it makes sense. I want to be done with this feeling of hopeless confusion. 

I canâ€™t even reach out for help, it feels terrible even admitting to myself that I have a problem, let alone telling someone else about it.

Help me, please.
