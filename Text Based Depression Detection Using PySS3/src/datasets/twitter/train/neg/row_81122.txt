Hello. Me again...So just over a week ago I made a post on here about my situation and many of the reasons why I feel like I want to kill myself. I can't be bothered to go through them again so give that a look.

Since that post things have only gotten worse. Any attempt at trying to get help hasn't worked, and I am constantly feeling more and more hopeless.

I am honestly sick of my parents, especially my mum, as they keep trying to force me into situations that make me anxious and uncomfortable, despite any protests from me.

School is becoming much worse, as I am in a very competitive school environment, and despite doing well against most people, I still feel like I'm utterly failing in some subjects, and that I don't have the motivation to fix the issues.

I'm in constant fear of putting myself as transgender to people at school and my parents, due to my regularity of being a target for bullies and the uncertainty of my parents' reaction.

I easily get mad at every little mistake and end up breaking and throwing stuff, despite the mistakes not mattering, which makes me just feel like a selfish, perfectionist git.

Every day I have some thought of killing myself, that I can't get help, that there's no reason to carry on and that things will just get worse. I just don't know what to do anymore.
