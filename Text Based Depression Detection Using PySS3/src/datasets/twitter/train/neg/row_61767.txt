Every day. Every F-ing day.It's like I'm used to being suicidal. Every damn day I think about it. About ending it all. It's so damn torturous because I'm too goddamn pussy to do anything. I'm stuck in this trap and I don't have the guts to do anything. Every day I keep telling myself that it'll get better. But it doesn't. I'm sick of lying to myself. I can't just ignore my feelings. But if I go near them I just wanna die. No one can empathise with me. I just drag everybody down. I'm not good with girls. Never have been never will be. And it's so disgusting.  I'm fine with the idea of dying. Suicidal ideation is as normal to me as my name. It's becoming a sick fantasy of mine. Everywhere I go, I go with a smile, because it's the only way to get anyone to interact with me. But no one knows the help I need. Which is ironic-since most of the time I don't want it. I want death, but life clings to me like a disease. I wish I could take the place of some poor soul who wants to live but will die soon so that they could live. ðŸ˜”
