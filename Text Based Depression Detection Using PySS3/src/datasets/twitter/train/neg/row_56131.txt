Note to my mom, I love youThis is it, its the end of the road for me. The feeling of overwhelming sadness is unbearable, I think the world would be better off without me , nothing is worth breathing for, im just a waste of resources on this planet, the unmistakable feeling of being unwanted and hatred is fogging my existence, you may question my decision but please remember that human beings are complicated creatures,Â  you may think I'm selfish for leaving this world without saying goodbye , leaving the people who loved me if any ,Â  its not the easiest way to end the unlimited suffering I am facing , nor the smoothestÂ route to demolish the darkness of being lonely and rejected, please don't be sad that im gone , be happy that you meant the world to me.
