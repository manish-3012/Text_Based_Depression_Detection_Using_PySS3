i'm sorry for posting here againbut i don't know where else to say any of this without being accused of trying to guilt trip people or attention seeking. whenever i post about anything like this on my tumblr i get plenty of hate messages telling me how horrible i am.  
but yeah. i fucking suck. i'm a horrible person and i hate myself. everyone else fucking hates me too. i want to be fucking dead. it literally baffles me that there are people in the world who don't fantasize about killing themselves because that's all i think about.  
i don't deserve to take up space or be happy or loved. i'm so fucking disgusting and stupid and ugly and worthless. everyone i meet immediately hates me. no one is ever going to love me because everything about me is so fucking repulsive and embarrassing. everyone wants me to die. i'm fucking pathetic.  
literally every single day i think about ways to kill myself. i'm going to do it soon. i literally can't stand being alive anymore, every single day fucking hurts. i hate myself so goddamn much. i'm worthless.
