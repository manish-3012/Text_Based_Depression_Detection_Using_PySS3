Posting here bc everyone else will call the cops or tell my parentsIâ€™m terrified to even tell my therapist I want to kill my self because I donâ€™t want to be imprisoned in a hospital and have all future job prospects ruined with a 51/50. My long term live in boyfriendâ€™s (really more of a domestic partner) mom killed herself 3 years ago so I canâ€™t tell him either because he just yells at me and gets upset when I say I want to die and threatens to call my mom or the police. Iâ€™m In my mid twenties, have a job but I might lose it in spring bc I was hired specifically as pandemic help. I have no other prospects. Only reason I might not kill my self is it would make my mom cry and she doesnâ€™t deserve it sheâ€™s a really really good person. I have to stop now my eyes are blurring and I canâ€™t type anymore
