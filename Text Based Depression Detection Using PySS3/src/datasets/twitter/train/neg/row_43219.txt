Almost 30 and wondering why I'm still hereI've had mental health struggles since childhood and they've never fully gone away. I'm 27 now and feeling like I've wasted a lot of my life. My job has put me on reduced hours and I'm struggling to find something better. I've tried to meet people or start a relationship for a while now but no one is interested. I have no real friends, I talk to people online but it's worse cause I know I will likely never meet them. On my days off I don't bother to get out of bed most of the time, what's the point? I'm not eating properly anymore either.  


I was hoping to move to the US  this year but it didn't work out ( I know it's bad there currently but still ) I'm a couple years off 30 and what the fuck do I have to show for it? We don't have guns In this country so I'll have to come up with a better way.
