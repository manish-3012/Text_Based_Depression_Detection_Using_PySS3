why do i keep living?i'm a failure. i failed my first semester of college, but i did okay last semester, but i'm going to fail this semester too. nobody cares, and nobody ever has. i don't have a therapist and i've had nothing but bad experiences with them anyways. i never do what i'm supposed to. i don't work. i don't contribute a thing to the house. all i do is coop myself up in my room. i hate this. i hate myself. why do i try? why can't i just work up the courage to kill myself? i can't go on like this. i hate this. somebody please just end me
