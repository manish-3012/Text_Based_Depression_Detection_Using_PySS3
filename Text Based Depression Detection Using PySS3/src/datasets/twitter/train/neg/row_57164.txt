I Keep Taping Bread to the CeilingI have Bipolar type 1 and my manic episodes have been increasing. Usually when I have these episodes I start throwing stuff and screaming along with severe hallucinations. I keep seeing this old lady in the corner of my room. She has really outstretched smile to the point that it looks like her jaw is dislocated. Originally she just stayed in the corner, but now she is moving around. I tried to go into my garage last night to scream and I saw her walking up to the door. This is the first time Iâ€™ve ever seen her visually move. I have a voice in my head that keeps telling me that if I tape bread to the ceiling sheâ€™ll go away. I attempted to run back to my room and get the bread and she tried to grab me when I opened the door. She grabbed me on my ankle, which is where my other hallucination I have often grabs me. It was like a cold, familiar feeling. I have now been in my room for the past few hours taping bread to the ceiling. She hasnâ€™t come back since I started, so I think itâ€™s working. Iâ€™m just scared when my parents come in my room that theyâ€™ll think Iâ€™ve gone insane. Does anybody know what I should do and how to stop hallucinations?
