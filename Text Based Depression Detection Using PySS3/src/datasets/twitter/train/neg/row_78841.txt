Coping?Around a month ago, one of my friends committed suicide at his college. Iâ€™ve know him all of high school and he was one of my closest friends. He would always say he wanted to die and talked about being depressed the majority of the time but no one really took him seriously/knew how to help.  After hearing about his death, Iâ€™ve been having a really rough time. He asked not to be remembered in anyway and wants everyone to just move on but I donâ€™t know if I can or even want that.  I loved him a lot and there many regrets I have with him. Has anyone dealt with a suicide and knows how to move past this?
