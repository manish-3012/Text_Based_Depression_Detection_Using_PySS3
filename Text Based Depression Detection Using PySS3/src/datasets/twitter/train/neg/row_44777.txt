My dad killed himself last nightI feel numb and in shock. I'm finding it hard to process it, especially since I got out of inpatient for suicidal thoughts just 2 weeks ago. I'm with my family right now and we're trying to be as close as possible to each other in order to have our dialogue and deal with the grief. My mom is very shaken up and my little sister won't leave her room. I'm very confused and bewildered. The police tested my mom and my sister for gunpowder residue which I'm afraid will haunt them for the rest of their lives, and I'm especially heartbroken that my mom had to find him like that. Overall it's a very fucked up situation.
