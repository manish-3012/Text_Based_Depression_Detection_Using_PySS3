everything has fallen apart in the last year.my parents are separating, our home has gone into foreclosure, my only two friends have moved away, my brother moved across the country, my boyfriend who i love very much has barely spoken to me in the last two weeks (things were perfectly fine just two weeks ago...) on the day i was hospitalized last spring for a suicide attempt, my "best friend" told me i was selfish and manipulative and unkind and we haven't spoken since. all i do is work my life away to no end. i'm 24 and the thought of living like this for another 50-60 years sends me into a panic. 
i feel lonely and lost and i'm failing to see the point of all of this.
