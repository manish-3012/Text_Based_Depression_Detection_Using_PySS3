GuiltHi Reddit, a month ago I was watching a video on r/amateur... Two days ago I remebered it. I suddenly was in absolute Horror if the girl was underage or if it was rape. Today I searched it and IT IS NOT ORIGINAL CONTENT! It is not proven. I'm so disturbed. I think, I will tell my family and kill myself. Not today but very soon. I can't live with this uncertainty...
