I can't even do any of the crazy things I'd try as a last hail Mary before killing myselfTravel is too expensive. Yes it just is. Plane tickets usually cost more money than I've ever had at once. I don't have a car that can take me long distances and can't get one. Most of all I;m stuck at my bullshit job that makes me wanna kill myself even more than i already do so i can't get any free time to do any of those things anyway. Travelling somewhere on a whim was gonna be my last resort thing if I didn't wanna kill myself then I wouldn't but I still could wherever else I go and then it would be better anyway so nobody I knew would find me. As far as they'd be concerned I could've already died because I'd travel without telling anyone where I'm going.

Can't even do that though. Can't go anywhere, do anything, because even when Im on the brink of kiling myself all that I'm allowed to care about is work. I can't put it on pause, I just have to keep coming in and putting in my hours. Even though the cuts and burns are stinging me the whole day and I'm probably giving myself more of them on my breaks during my shift. Almost certainly in my car cutting or burning myself in fact during a break. But gotta work.
