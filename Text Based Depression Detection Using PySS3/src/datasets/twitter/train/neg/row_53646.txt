I just wanna be happy being myselfWhy the hell do I hate myself so fucking much, why can I be happy being myself. Im such a defect as a person, I have no reason to want to die but I still think my death every moment, I hurt myself to get rid of my self hatred but I have no reason to it.
I just wanna be happy being me is this too much for my fucked mind?
Sorry for the vent I just need some place to write my thoughts.
Im tired.
