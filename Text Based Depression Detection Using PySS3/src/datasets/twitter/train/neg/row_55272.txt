Why shouldnâ€™t I kill myself?Iâ€™m a 20M bipolar II survivor of sexual abuse. Why should I live anymore?
1. I hate my appearance. I try to improve how I think about myself, but I always come back to thinking Iâ€™m ugly when depressed.
2. I have no romantic relationship. I never felt love and that sucks because I was always rejected and my current interest is seeing someone else.
3. Iâ€™m a pushover. People have just walked all over me and my brother sexually abused me for that. I also always give in to my parents. Speaking of...
4. My parents neg me. They destroy my confidence in me. Commenting about my appearance (youâ€™ve gotten fat, you have acne... no shit) or casually insulting me for my failures like the fact I donâ€™t have a license. They also deny I have bipolar
5. Iâ€™m impatient and canâ€™t deal with my own family.
6. Iâ€™m stuck at home with people who frustrate me
7. I have no confidence in myself
8. Iâ€™m on the borderline of failing school and have let everyone down.
Itâ€™s gotten to a point where outside of my manic states, Iâ€™m numb or so sad I canâ€™t bring myself to do meaningful stuff. Why should I go on living if Iâ€™m this worthless?
