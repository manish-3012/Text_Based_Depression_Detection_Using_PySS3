3rd attempt in 1 monthTried to hang myself on my door knob. It takes so much determination and time. I respect people that do that. I feel bad for others that do it at a higher place. There's a moment where you freak out and you push through to let go while you also start regretting and then your body starts freaking out involuntarily and twitching. My belt loosened and gave me breathing room and I stopped passing out. I then sat back up. Broke out of my zone.
