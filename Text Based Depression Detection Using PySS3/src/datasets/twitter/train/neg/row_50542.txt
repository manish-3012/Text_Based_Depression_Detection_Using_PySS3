Having a rough go right now....I've been having a rough go, especially tonight.  I'm not to the point where I'm going to definitely commit suicide but I'm definitely  contemplating it.  I've just been over it for so long.  Financially, mentally, and emotionally I'm exhausted.  

I hate that my situation isn't as bad as others but I'm stretched so thin that I've reached and snapped my breaking point a while ago.  I'm at risk of losing everything I've fought so hard to get back.  I was so close to being homeless, I fought and fought, through the kindness of friends I got through that.  Through the kindness of an ex (who I fucked over and I agonize over that every day) I got through that.  

I just don't know what to do anymore, I've started cutting again.  Asking for help is almost out of the question.  I work in EMS as a paramedic and I'm terrified of my reputation being ruined by seeking help at a local ER or even worse having to have 911 called on me for it.  Working in EMS I also have access to so many drugs I can use to end it all with.  

I don't really want to die but I really don't want to keep fighting anymore....
