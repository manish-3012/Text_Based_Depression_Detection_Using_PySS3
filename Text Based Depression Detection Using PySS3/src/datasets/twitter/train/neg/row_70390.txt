Need help with a friend(sidenote, I made a throwaway so people won't think I'm fishing for upvotes)

&amp;nbsp;

I have a friend A that I met online a while ago. He was a bit, unconventional in behavior, but seemed alright until recently, another friend (B) of mine told me that friend A was considering suicide. Friend A doesn't know that I'm aware of this. Friend A has talked to friend B about self harm and others betraying him. I don't want to dismiss this as "angsty teenage stuff", I really want to help friend A. What can friend B and I do?
