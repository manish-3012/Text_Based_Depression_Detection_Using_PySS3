Options.I'm writting this from work right now and I'm thinking about killing myself. I recently got turned down for university and everything feels hopeless. At 28 I'm still alone, despise my job, dealing with chronic pain and dysphoria.  My whole life just feels it keels getting worst. My friends say it gets better but i dont see any evidence of that happening for me . I guess i just need something to keep me going. Some sort or achievable happiness because i dont think i can live much longer like this. What other options could i possibly have at this point other then to die
.
