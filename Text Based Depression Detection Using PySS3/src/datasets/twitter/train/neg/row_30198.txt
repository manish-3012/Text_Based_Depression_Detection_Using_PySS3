A friend of mine is suicidal and I don't know what to do.As the title says. I have a friend who's in a really bad mental state right now, he's depressed, talks about how he can't keep living like this.

I read the sidebar before posting, about how to talk to someone who is depressed and suicidal, what to say and not to say and I realized I already do those things, I try to help as much as I can, talking to him, I don't judge him and listen to him about how he feels. I'm empathetic. I can only imagine the pain he's in right now.

And it hurts. It hurts to see him like this because he is - was, brilliant before all of this. He was a person who could make you say "damn, he's going to change the world". That person doesn't exist anymore, he's just a husk of his former self.

I suggested that maybe he could try to start therapy again (he went to a therapist until 5 months ago then stopped), but he said he's tired. He's exhausted and is giving up on life. Told me he's started to write a draft for a suicidal note to send to his ex girlfriend.

He isolated himself. He went back home to his parents and is living with them now and eats just because they put food in front of him. He told me he's not speaking to anyone anymore, not his brother, not any other of his friends, he just said that it's too much effort to try and keep in contact with people so he doesn't anymore. Our conversations if you can call them that consist of me sending him cute dog pictures and videos because he loves dogs. Last night I had to go to sleep so cut the convo short and he said he was sorry to bother me. He's not a bother to me, I told him as such and that I'm here if he needs me. But it's complicated too seeing as we live in different states, it's not like I could go and visit him. He's my friend and I want to help him but I don't know what I can do. I don't think there's anything I can do.
