my sister basically saying she wants to commit suicideiâ€™m sorry if this is the wrong place to post this but i didint get responses anywhere else

My mom and my sister were arguing about my sister being disrespectful and my sister started saying how she wants to stop feeling EVERYTHING

like bro what the fuck man I didint even know she still felt these things. When she was in high school she cu her wrists and stuff but i thought that was all in the past

she started talking about how she wants to smash her head against the wall too.

I was never actually talking directly to her about this I was listening through the walls in my room 

She started screaming about something I canâ€™t even remember anymore but my mom told me to go downstairs so she doesnâ€™t freak me out

next thing i knew my sister was screaming and I hear a a loud bang and my mom was yelling at her to stop 
(I donâ€™t know what she was doing)

Now everythingâ€™s quiet and I think my mom is talking to my dad (They are divorced) 

This is the first time I cried in a long time but i hope my sisters okay i donâ€™t know what to do
