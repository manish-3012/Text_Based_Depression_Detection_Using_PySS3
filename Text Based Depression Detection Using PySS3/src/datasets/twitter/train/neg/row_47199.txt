feeling like i cant come back.never posted here. i dont know if im breaking any rules so im sorry.
i used to smoke to feel better but recently whenever i do i get extremely lightheaded and faint. last time i fainted i got a concussion. so ive decided to stop smoking marijuana untill i figure out whats happening.
anyways now that the depression is coming back ive never felt so low.
i found a hatred for myself i didnt know was there. i think i finally noticed how much of a piece a shit i am.
im not sure how to get out of this hole. im feelin pretty fuckin bad.
