Chronic illness, always in pain, lonely sad, going to die anywaysI have a chronic illness called NF1,  I am covered in tumors, 500 of them probably. I just had cancer removed, and I am probably going to have it come back. My fiance has an amazing job at an amazing company.I  have no friends with 3,000 miles. I can't work. I have to stay in my apartment everyday....ALL DAY, til I recover. Doctors ignore my symptoms. I never feel good. I gained 10 pounds recently, I feel very fat ugly and worthles. My fiance, my mom, my bubby, my sister everyone tells me they love me everyday. And I don't want to cause them pain. But I am just a leech on society, my health problems will kill me, and it will be a long and slow painful death. Everyone begs me to live and be happy, but I just can't. I really just can't. I see a therapist, I am on anti-depressents. I don't have job, I just sit in the house all day...I am so lonely. My fiance comes home every night, eats, we watch TV for 30 minutes, he use the computer at me, and then we go to bed. Every night. I have no human interaction and I am just miserable. 

Our friend gave me some work to do, and I DELETED IT, as I was about to send it and it wasn't saved. I can't do anything right. It's pathetic, and so sad. :(

Please help.
