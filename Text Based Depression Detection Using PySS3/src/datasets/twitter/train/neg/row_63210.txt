i dont want to die anymorei spent the last few days crying my eyes out and planning my suicide. I picked out where i wanted to buried and where my money would go after my death... I even started to plan my notes and to whom i wanted to write them to. this time i was really serious about it. 

then i went to sleep.

and suddenly woke up happy. like really happy. i ate pie for breakfast and my mind was going through all kinds of memories, from our family lake trips, to just talking with my mom and going to mcdonalds with her on a rainy day. i feel like i have all my energy and motivation for life back. i saw pictures of beautiful gardens here on reddit, and i immediately saw my future garden with a huge cattio for my rescued cats and my greenhouse filled with herbs and fresh tomatoes. i WANT to grow old, i want to go on hikes with my dogs, i want to hug my mom, i want to make homemade pizza so thick that the dough is pretty much still raw, i want to smell the forrest and hear the birds chirp while my dogs run all crazy.... i want to live. 

i just suddenly want to live. and it feels amazing.
