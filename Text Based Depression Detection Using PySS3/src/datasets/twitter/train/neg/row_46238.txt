Exactly 1 year from my suicide scare: it gets so much better.Exactly 1 year ago (I keep a counter app on my phone) I came the closest I have ever come to suicide. I call it a suicide scare rather than attempt since I did not take that final step and fail. I did however get very very close.
I had self harm scars all over my body, the deepest of which still haven't healed. It seemed certain to me that my pathetic, empty loveless life would end in suicide, and that once this was certain, why not bring up the date. I confided in the one person I could talk to that i'd decided to take my life (A move that I know realize was a cry for help). She called the police, who visited my university, therapist, house and parents.
Until then, i'd been keeping my illness and struggles to myself believing I was loved and cared for by no one. The police visit shocked me awake. 
It made everything real for the first time in years, I realized then if i didn't get better, I would die and pass my pain onto those around me.

The next year was a long, long road. I hadn't realized how much I had been numbing my emotions, and learning to live with them again was excrutiatingly painful at times.

Today, 365 days after the police came knocking on my door, I ran my first half marathon. In november, I will run my first marathon and in two years time my first half Iron Man.

So much can happen in 1 year. The man who lay on his bed gougeing marks in his skin to have some visible sign of the pain he felt inside, never would've believed he could stop self-harming or close his eyes without picturing his death.
And if he had taken his life, he never would've found a sport he loved, or experienced any of the joy it gives me now.

I'm not saying you have to take up endurance running (though I highly recommend it). I'm trying to show anyone who's where I was last year, that it can and does get some much better.

You are all loved, you all matter, despite what your brains might be telling you.
