I may just save everyone the disappointmentFor the second time, I find myself in the bathroom ready to just drown myself facedown. My brother hates me, my parents love me but I only disappoint and frustrate them. Ima be starting college soon(because of my own fuck ups, ive been doing nothing at home for months, almost a year.), but I feel like I may just be wasting their time and money. I feel like my girlfriend is losing interest and even if she isn't, I don't deserve her and she could find better. Its long distance anyway and I think ima fail at meeting our goals on my part because its become a trend that I do that. I could save everyone the disappointment. I have no friends as they all moved away or moved on without me. Most didn't even wanna come to my 18th birthday and most of the ones that did show up don't talk to me anymore. I use to have hope that going to school and getting friends would help me feel better but I've lost that too. I don't even think anyone would be interested in me.
