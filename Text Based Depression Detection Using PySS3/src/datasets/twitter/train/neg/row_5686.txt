Struggling with med abuse, self harm and lonelinessI'm not sure why I'm posting this. I think I just want someone to reach out.

 

This is the third or forth night in a row that I've taken quite a bit of medication. If I add it up, tonight I've taken 54mg of diazepam (valium I think in the US) and I don't know how much Co-codamol. Maybe about 6x 30/500mg doses in the past 2 or 3 hours.

 

I know it's not good for me but I'm having a rough time at the moment.

 

The first night I thought it was just to help me chill out, not to harm myself, but each night I keep taking it, knowing that it may harm me and I feel ambivalent about it.

 

I have been struggling with self harm thoughts more too and I gave in last night but they weren't that deep so it's fine.

 

My spouse is having a low patch too and I'm the one who has to hold it all together. I can't even tell them I'm having a bad time because they'll just spiral and it will make things worse. I want to help them and I'm trying, but I don't have anyone to help me.

 

I don't know what to do. That's all I guess. I just don't know what to do.
