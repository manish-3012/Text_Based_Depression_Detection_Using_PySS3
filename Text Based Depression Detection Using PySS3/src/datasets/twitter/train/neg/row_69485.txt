I don't want to die but I don't want to live. When does it get better?I just want to know. I hate this misery. I don't want another 25+ fucking years of it. I feel like I want to jump off a building, but I'm scared, and I don't want to make my parents sad. I hate this, I hate this, I hate this, I hate this.

I hate how everyone treats me like a weirdo, and I hate even more how I can't stop being weird. I can't stop being myself. How am I supposed to fix that? I can't afford any medical help, either. How do you get help when you have no money for any of the things you're supposed to use to help you, like drugs and therapists?

I don't know what to do.


EDIT: Thanks reddit. I feel much better having read the responses. I wish it were possible for others to just deal with my weirdness and me not have to change, but as it stands, this is the second job in a row where they're threatening to fire me for some of my odd quirks, and even though I'm trying not to be so weird, it's still not good enough. I'll never be good enough, it seems.
