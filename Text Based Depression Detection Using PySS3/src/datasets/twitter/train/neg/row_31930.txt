Where can I talk about my thoughts that isn't this subredditI'm gonna be frank, I kinda hate this subreddit. Honestly that's mostly just because I kinda hate Reddit in general. But I have no one to talk to, so this place tends to be the only place I know where to go. Generally speaking my posts are ignored or people just comment something like "relatable" on them. When people do respond they usually offer to PM me and then ghost me. I can't really say I've ever actually had anyone make me feel better.

So does anyone know where else I can go? I'm so god-damned desperate. 

Don't say 7 cups, I fucking hate that place, even moreso than Reddit.

Don't say "a therapist" either. Been there, done that, got too old to get covered so now I can't see her anymore.

FUCK suicide hotlines.

Sorry if this is against the rules but... I don't know where else to ask.
