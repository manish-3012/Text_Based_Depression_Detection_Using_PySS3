I was going to go to the hospitalTomorrow. My therapist wanted me to wait. So I could reassess my emotions and I could get things in order. 
But now this girl I hang out with is getting admitted, sheâ€™s currently at the ER and knows all the right things to say to get a room. She makes Everything about herself and she definitely has it worse off than you do. Plus I donâ€™t want her knowing the details of my shit. Thereâ€™s no other psych hospital that wouldnâ€™t be a 4 hour flight away. Idk what to do...everything feels so hopeless lately and this is just a sign that maybe Iâ€™m not supposed to be here.
