Anyone else feels like they deserve to suffer?I mean,all shitt in my life goes wrong and yesterday it got so overwelming I took a knife and slashed my face with it i need to suffer and eventually when it becomes too much to bare with self harming I will probably kill myself

I'm also abusing sleeping meds so I can feel fcked up...

Also the scar on my face is pretty big .. Any tips for hiding it? Don't feel like telling anyone what happened .

Thanks in Advance :)
