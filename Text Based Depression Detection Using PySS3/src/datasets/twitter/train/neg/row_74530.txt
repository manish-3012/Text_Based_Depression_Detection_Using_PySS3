If I don't kill myself I might hurt someone.Sometimes I think about how I could make a real positive change in this world. I think about killing the people I hate, because they exist to hurt other people. I am already a useless piece of shit, why can't I do good for once? 

That scares me. I don't like the thought of hurting people. I don't have much of a choice though. It's not like there's anything I can do that will mean anything. 

I will never actually hurt anyone. It's not in my nature. I'll kill myself before I get to that point. Maybe I should get help about that, but why? The world is so fucked up it will probably just make me worse. And even if someone came up to me and magically solved every problem with my messed up head, I'd still be alone, useless, and I should still die.
