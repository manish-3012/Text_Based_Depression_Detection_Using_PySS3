I still canâ€™t stop thinking of killing myself so I donâ€™t have to face the future and itâ€™s now destroying my lifeThis fear of graduation and the future has made even my classes with my favorite teacher a source of dread and anxiety for me. 

And the â€œdoomâ€ mentality that hangs around with media isnâ€™t really helping me either. With climate change, politics and the end of the world being so hotly talked about...It just makes the future scarier and scarier and makes killing myself in order not to face the future seems like a more and more reasonable choice. 

I canâ€™t even enjoy a walk outside or a browse on reddit without being bombarded with DOOM and the constant lingering dread and absolute paralyzing fear of the future. 

And I donâ€™t even know how to address it. My mom gets mad at me when I discuss my suicidal thoughts cause they â€œhurt herâ€. And my therapist is on hiatus. The only one willing to listen to me without strings attached is my dog and I know damn well that she doesnâ€™t understand most of the words I say. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with these doom thoughts and trying to tackle the anxiety so I can feel enjoyment again?
