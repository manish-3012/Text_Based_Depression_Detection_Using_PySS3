I can't come back from anythingI feel so irredeemable. People usually have others around them to get through certain things but I literally have no one (except my therapist, who I haven't been able to see for three weeks because of the snow here). I have no one around, no money, no friends, no family, no prospects, ruined education, relatives (Ns) who sabotage me over and over, absolutely nowhere to go and it took way too long for me to wake up and take the initiative to get help. How are you supposed to feel human again after so much of this. I just don't see the point. If you're trying to spend most of your life rebuilding your self esteem and trying to regain the things that most people take for granted from having a normal upbringing, then why? To refer to something someone else said here, why be tortured until death when you can just end it now.
