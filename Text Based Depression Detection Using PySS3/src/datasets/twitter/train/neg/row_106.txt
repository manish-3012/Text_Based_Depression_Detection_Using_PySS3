I take the train to work everyday, I usually always contemplate just jumping in front of it. Iâ€™ll probably never do it, but it calms me knowing I can.Depression is crushing my soul today. Holding back the tears is extra hard this morning. if there truly is a God, Iâ€™ll never understand why this God of ours created millions and millions with mental illness. pretty fucked up if you ask me. Man I wanna ball my eyes out.
