Iâ€™m not giving up on life.Man, listen. Shout out to the countless people who where here for me yesterday. You internet strangers are so fucking amazing. 

The last three years have been hell. I have been through the ringer from back to back deaths. My house burning down before Christmas. Being homeless with a child and pregnant. Being cheated on. Having a bastard baby. No car. Being lied to over and over. Leaving a great job to start my own business. And money issues for a while. Was abused and brutally raped and molested over and over as a child. Went into foster care. Tried to self medicate with sex. 

But life can kick fucking rocks! I refuse to give the fuck up. If the universe wants me out of here itâ€™s going to have to send someone to kill me themselves. Iâ€™m not a fucking quitter. 

Iâ€™ve been through the lowest of the low and dragged myself AND two kids up by the skin of my teeth. No body is capable of doing what Iâ€™ve done. This depression can ride on my shoulders for the next 20 years, idc. Iâ€™ll just be depressed. But Iâ€™m going to function. Because I might be a sad, anxious wreck. But I wonâ€™t be a loser. I canâ€™t control life. But I can control my choices. And death is FINAL, I donâ€™t have a reset button to come back if I want. But even if I only find 5 minutes of happiness in the next 5 years of my life. Thatâ€™s five more minutes that I wouldnâ€™t have had if I died. 

SO FUCK YOU WORLD! BE PREPARED! Iâ€™M COMING FOR YOU!!!
