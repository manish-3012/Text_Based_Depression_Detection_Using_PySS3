I'm so tired of everythingI'm meant to be moving out of my parents house in less than two weeks, into a nice rental with my fiance. I should be happy about this, surely.

Instead I'm just drowning in stress because I'm having to do all of the organisation myself. Power, internet, rubbish collection .. other utilities? I don't even know, and no one's helping because my parents have other things to care about and my fiance just doesn't seem to care.

The stress of work is sucky af too, I'm in a sales position and not making the revenue I need to be so I know I'm gonna end up with performance management if not being fired. I'm barely making enough to pay the bills after moving as it is.

None of this stuff is getting any better, and I'm sinking further and further into depression with every damn day. My job involves driving so I can't be on antidepressants and I've got no budget for therapy.

Every night I'm just lying awake thinking of overdosing and slitting my wrists .. just because even if it doesn't kill me it might get me away from this stress for a while.

Maybe tonight will be that night. I'm so so tired of hoping for things to improve and things only getting worse.
