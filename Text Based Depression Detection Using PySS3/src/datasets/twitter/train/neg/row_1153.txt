i hate iteveryday i wake up in this fucking body i hate it. i can't get through it. i know i have no future. ever since blake died i can't fucking do it. i'm angry and sad then i go through phases of nothingness. i know i'm worthless. i can't contribute. i'm just getting by and i think about him everyday. i went to a college in town because i could move away from his grave. i'm so fucking pathetic...everyone else just keeps living like nothing happened. one thing after another; jessica, grandpa, blake, shadow, josh, sheba. i couldn't mourn and now; now i can't o anything. i am so sorry to lay this on you but i just don't want to be here anymore.
