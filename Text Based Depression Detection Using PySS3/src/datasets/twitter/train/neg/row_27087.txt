Being sued and I can't let it destroy everything my family worked for.I'm being sued by a lady who claims I permanently disabled her from a fender bender we had years ago that resulted in a small scratch on her truck. I was recently served with papers and was told I would either settle for hundreds of thousands or go to court. I'm only 20 and I live with my parents and work a retail job for minimum wage. I've been coasting my way through community college for years now and I've learned no real skills through it. I've lost all my friends over petty arguments and my lack of time to hang out. 

I was told by the lawyer that if I can't pay this lady they will likely take my parents retirement assets to help pay since the car was under their name. My parents are 60+ and have worked their entire lives honestly, never going in debt or borrowing money to raise their family. I can't let this woman take away my dad's 30+ years of saving at his job. I can't do it.
