8 days lefti donâ€™t know how i feel to be honest. iâ€™ve had plenty of amazing people reaching out to me but i just canâ€™t seem to accept any of their help. deep down i know that i should accept the help, but something stops me from doing that. i still feel unworthy of love and help.. and it will probably not change until itâ€™s late.

iâ€™m starting to hold into a small piece of hope. but i donâ€™t think i should... i would just have to keep suffering longer.
