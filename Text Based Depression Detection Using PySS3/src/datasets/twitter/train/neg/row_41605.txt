Something's fundamentally wrong with me. There's something serious missing. I can't sleep right, I'm scared, my family's sick of me and I'm a burden to my friends. I just want to go already. I've planned for this time and again and never seen it through.It's always the question of what happens next. Some might say ti's fine as long as it stops you from killing yourself, but that question keeps me up at night. I've been in pain for years, ever present even when I'm managing okay. Yes, I'm more scared to die than I am to live, but living is horrible. So much pain and hate and so many horrible memories. I want to go, but I'm too scared of what lies beyond to do it.

It's like, yeah, on the one hand, you could make an argument that me not dying is a good thing or whatever, but on the other hand, what kind of life is it when you're trapped between two crushing walls of fear?
