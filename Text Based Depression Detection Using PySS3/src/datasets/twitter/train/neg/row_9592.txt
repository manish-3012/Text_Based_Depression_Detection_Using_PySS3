Existing vs. livingI'm in a downswing yet again and ruminating about my failures. While doing so I read an article about depression and suicide. In it the author spoke about little things in your life, things you do that are positive and beneficial to other people. How you make the world a brighter place with the smallest things. And that's true. I can count many things today and yesterday that other people have done to make me smile. Despite everything going on, I still see kindness and purity in the souls of a few people. I try to be that same light or ray of sunshine for others too.

I could continue to do that indefinitely. I could scrap the idea of suicide and continue to live out my unfulfilling life and be the person I became in the wake of my trauma and make people happy. I could bring light in that way.

But it would continue to kill me like it's been killing me for over half a year now, bits and pieces of my psyche coming apart a little at a time. I had my first ever breakdown a few weeks ago. I'm not doing so good. I've decided to stop talking about it to the people I care about. I can't escape it.

Back to my point. Could I continue to live and make other people happy, comfort them, help them? Yes.

But... for the first time I ask, what about me? What about MY happiness? The only thing I ever wanted I can never have. Doing other things is just existing, not living. I have a need to feel alive and no one understands this. Without this thing, life is pointless to me. I get no personal satisfaction, no joy. It's not worth living. I look on at those who have this thing and I am filled with self-hate and disgust and inferiority. I cannot take, cannot stomach the thought of just existing like this for years. I feel like screaming until I lose my voice, that is how painful it is.
