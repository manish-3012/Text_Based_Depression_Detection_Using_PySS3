Am I just looking for attention? Or is this real? What can I do? Is this normal?I guess I have always been sad, and.. I don't ever really think about my past a lot, but I have been verbally and physically abused ever since I was 7 years old, and I am 19 now. But I don't wanna be sad, I don't like it. Sometimes, I am not sad, sometimes I can be overwhelmingly happy. I just got out of a relationship with basically the girl of my dreams, she is having sex with very attractive, interesting, and funny guys. When she was with me, she always told me that she would never hurt me.. Well, she cheated on me, and left me to pursue a life of smoking weed, and having sex with extremely attractive men.. I guess she just deserved better than me, I'm short, not muscular, and don't really know what I am doing with myself. Not one attractive woman has taken interest in me after her, I never get any second looks, and I am usually refereed to as the man child.  I crave human contact, a hug, a kiss, cuddling.. Something to let me know that this isn't permanent, that this will change.. When looking back at everything in my life, there has been so many bad things that outnumber the good,she was my significant good, she showed me that there is happiness in the world. Now whenever I run into her, all she talks about is the amazing wild sex that she is having, and all the beautiful weed that she is smoking, and how she got rid of the cancer that is me... Damn..I don't need any advice,I have heard it all, can I just ask one thing of the nice redditor that read through my complaining? Can you please just tell me about your day, just talk to me in the comments, I will read and respond to everything, I just really want to know that someone is hurting like I am, and wants to talk to me too.
