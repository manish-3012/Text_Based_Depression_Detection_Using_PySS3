I Think I'm DoneHey guys,

I've been planning to kill myself for quite a while. I'm thinking of the suicide bag method. I've been on a 7 month drink and drug binge as a sort of prolonged suicide attempt. I have severe PTSD, anxiety, schizophrenia and depression. I'm engaged. My fiance has some quite serious mental health issues too. I fucking hate myself. Yesterday one of my best friends killed himself. I feel so alone. I think I'm going to do it tonight. I just got out of hospital 2 days ago, I was in because of severe liver damage, due to the drink and drugs. I'm 19, male. I wish my friend was alive.
