Asian parents that just rant at kids that gets **C** and ranting about your thoughts of suicide.Yep. i said exactly that. Most parents say "oh get over it" 

Some really get the help they need 

And mine?

Well they say: "WELL YOU SAID YOU WANT TO KILL YOURSELF? THEN THATS HOW PEOPLE GO TO SCHOOL AND SHOOT PEOPLE!"
"Teachers dont care, they just do their job, want to do their job to let the kids get held back in knowledge"

I need help... Please. This is starting to become unbearable.

&gt; PS: Welp sorry for the rant. i cant trust my parents either.
the internet is the last bastion of hope as there is still **good** people out there and i know it. **YET** in roblox they frame me as a greifer and I quit thank god because they blame me for greifing.

&gt; I draw Penguins CP style. I also may draw WW2 planes **MUCH later on as im also a fan of War Thunder.

&gt; what subreddit can i go to to share my drawings?
