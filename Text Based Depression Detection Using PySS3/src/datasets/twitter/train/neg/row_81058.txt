Boyfriend just told me to leave. I don't have anywhere to go.He told me I was the biggest waste of his time. I've been unstable for a long time and him telling me to leave is the last straw i guess. I don't have anywhere to go. He has my money, too. I think this is going to be it. He was the only thing i had. He got me up in the morning, hes the one that would force me to eat and get out of the house. hes been my only source of happiness for so long. 6 years almost. ive always had these thoughts. i knew one day it was going to happen. i have my favorite album playing right now. i guess this is it.
