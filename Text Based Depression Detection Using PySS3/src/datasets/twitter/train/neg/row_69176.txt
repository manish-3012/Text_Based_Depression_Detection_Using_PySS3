My brain hurts and soul is sickMy medications aren't helping, and my normal fleeting thoughts of suicide are becoming heavy. I grabbed a rifle earlier and made sure I could use it with the barrel against my head. 

Please say something to me. Anything. The anxiety is making my throat swell shut and my eyes keep welling up. I feel like my prayers aren't being heard and the thought of tomorrow disturbs me.
