I donâ€™t know why I just spit out the mouthful of Trazodone. I wish I was deadEverything in my life that could possibly go wrong has. I have no idea what Iâ€™m doing with college, the guy that I really liked that I was talking to, that I was convinced loved me back just said that he wanted to be friends. My brother has really serious legal issues that is draining our family dry financially, and my parents are both falling apart from the stress. This isnâ€™t  even 1/8 of all the things that are wrong, but I almost feel too tired to even explain. I just want to die and I donâ€™t know why I didnâ€™t just swallow that handful of pills. That wouldâ€™ve taken the pain away. Not to mention I have a fat and ugly piece of shit, I just posted something in the plastic surgery sub Reddit asking about my nose, and everybody told me about how fat and ugly I was and how I needed to lose weight.
