HelloSo recently I have been thinking about what Iâ€™m doing with my life, Iâ€™m not even in college, I have wasted my life. I donâ€™t want to die in the military, but I just found out I canâ€™t even join. I feel like being violent to others I hate everyone. I want them all dead. If I were to kill myself I would take as many as I could with me. They all make me extremely angry
