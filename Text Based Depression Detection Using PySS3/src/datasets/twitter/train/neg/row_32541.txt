I feel like I'm broken beyond repairI was abused by my parents my whole childhood. It fucked me up in the head. 

I suffer from loneliness a lot. Complete social isolation for the past 4 years. 

To cope with the abuse and the periodic years of loneliness I developped addiction**s**. 

I already tried to kill myself 3 times. Suffered major clinical depression a few years ago. 

I JUST NEED TO TELL THAT TO SOMEBODY
