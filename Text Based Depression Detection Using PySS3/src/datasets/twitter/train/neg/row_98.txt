I'm fucked. All of this is an illusion.Ive recently lost someone i felt like was a brother to me, and i realized that he was one of the only people who actually wanted to spend time with me and made an effort to. 
Im so tired of being the friend who asks. 
Why are people constantly so selfish? 
Last night i tried to end everything.
it didnt work and honestly the only person who knew and "cared" has left me completely alone the whole day, not talking to me at all and then promises to fix things when i ask for them to do something about it, but they never do.
its probably stupid but theyre in a band, and they have always said to me "you could be the singer, or the pianist (i play piano) or the bass player" and all three of those have been taken and i feel like a fucking failure. 

I used to be such a bad friend. but now km getting what i deserve in life.
It just keeps happening and im so tired of this cycle. 
I got kicked out of my therapy even after i begged to stay in. 
I havent been one day clean.
When will it end?
