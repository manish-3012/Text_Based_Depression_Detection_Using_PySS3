impossible situation20, living under my mom's roof though she doesn't live here personally. no job, no car, no license, no friends, no longer working on my old hobbies like i should be. the longer i'm like this, the more she guilts me for being such a useless sack of shit, and the worse i feel. the worse i feel, the less i'm able to do, repeat repeat repeat. 

i don't like doing things for enjoyment because i'm so stressed about getting my life together first, but in order to be in a good place so i can try to fix things, i need to do things for enjoyment. another endless cycle.

she likes to make jokes such as "i should quit my job and laze around the house like everyone else" to my face. i'm not like this because i want to be! i'm like this because i'm SO fucking mentally ill i'd walk into traffic if i was forced to work in my current state! 

dying solves everything though. no longer mooching, no longer taking up space, no longer feeling anything. a solution to an impossible situation.

i would literally kill myself if i had no choice but to work again, so isn't my path leading to death anyways?

i'm trying to get an appointment with a goddamn psychiatrist but it's taking one million years. even then, that solves nothing. that's only step 1. i'd love to die before then. please let me die.

note- i have avpd, dpd, c-ptsd and depression
