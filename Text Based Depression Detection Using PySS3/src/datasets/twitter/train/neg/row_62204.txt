no motivation to do anythingi'm honestly just really tired of everything. haven't showered in four days. i barely wanna eat or talk to people. in and out of hospitals, battling depression everyday etc. i really don't feel like doing anything anymore. no one seems to really care about me. things in my life are so stressful and tiring. i don't feel like things are getting better or ever will. this may be my last day alive. i don't know yet. every time i try, it either never works or something stops me. im just so tired and ready for it all to be over.
