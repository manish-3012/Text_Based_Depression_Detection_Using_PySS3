OCD girl againHello SWers,
I'm the girl who posted last week about my OCD that revolves around suicide. Just wanted to let you all know I've checked into a psychiatric hospital and I'm getting treatment for it :) I never got a chance to reply to any of your lovely messages, but I truly appreciate the support I got from this sub. 

Thank you friends.
