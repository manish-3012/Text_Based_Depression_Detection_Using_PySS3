I owe no explanation to anyoneMy birthday is in a couple of days. I'll turn 22 and I kinda feel so old already to be able to change anything. I don't know what to say, I'm feeling helpless. I wish it was a temporary break up problem, but it's not. I'm here sitting on my couch with absolutely nothing going on in my life. I hate the situation I'm in, I just see no point in living anymore. My whole life has been a struggle since forever, I've dealt with so much bullshit from social anxiety to depression, OCD, to frequent visits to the doctors, changing meds, to occasional meltdowns and rages every so often out of boredom for having nothing going on in my life. I'm currently unemployed, I dropped out of college 2 years ago, and I'm broke as fuck living off my struggling parents' money. I hate so many things about myself but nobody knows it. I'm sick of living with my parents and having my mom tries to make me feel better about myself and assures me that things are gonna get better, which never did, she's just lying because the thought of killing myself just terrifies her. The only thing I feel that prevents me from killing myself is her, my mother, but then again I feel like she's just happy that her 'little boy' is alive and there next to her,  but she doesn't care enough to accept that it's not enough for him to live if he's not happy. I owe nothing to no one, I just don't want to live this life, why don't I just kill myself.
