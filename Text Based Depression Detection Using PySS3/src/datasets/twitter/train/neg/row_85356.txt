I just messed up big timeI'm 16.

A lot of stuff has been building up for so long, and today I got given a Saturday detention. I will have to explain why to my parents, who will probably abuse me again. I would honestly rather die than face them. I feel like such a disappointment and a failure, and I guess I am. I am useless, pathetic and a waste of space. The only reason I haven't done it yet is because I am still writing the note.

I've had enough. I wish I was never born. I can't handle things anymore. I have been suicidal and depressed for so long, but this just pushed me over the edge.

Thanks for reading i guess.
