I dont know what to do     About a month ago my wallet disappeared and than anout a week after that i found it with all of the money in it gone, about $200. I asked my mom and all of my family members if they knew anything about what coupd have happened and they said no. A week ago i posted on spapchat about getting stoned as a joke. I have never done marijuana in my life and dont plan on it. Eventually my mom found out and is assuming that the money was missing for weed. At this point i dont know what to do. Im being blamed and i feel like shit. I honesty just want to die.
