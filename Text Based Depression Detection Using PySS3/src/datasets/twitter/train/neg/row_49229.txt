After reading a Reddit post, I think I'm finally ready to die.Today, I read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/99q9n5/redditors_who_have_been_clinically_dead_what_did/) thread of comments about what it was like to die, I think I am ready to take my own life, it sounds so unbelievably peaceful.  Finally my torment can be over, I'm going to kill myself now. Thanks Mom and Dad for being such terrible parents to your 15 year old son, thank you to everyone who has bullied me and made me feel so numb. Goodbye :)
