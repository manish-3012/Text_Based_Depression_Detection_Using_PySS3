Iron pills ruined my lifeVery long story short, I took some iron pills, health supplements, they ruined my stomach and they gave me gastritis and ulcers, I'm now a cripple 

Can't walk properly, no energy, get two hours sleep everything looks ugly now, tremors, weak, short of breath, brain fog. Feel like I'm in hell, broken bones before this is nothing like it

Had a lot going for, never thought of suicide or death but I already attempted and in a loony bin ATM.

Feels completely helpless, I ruined a great life
