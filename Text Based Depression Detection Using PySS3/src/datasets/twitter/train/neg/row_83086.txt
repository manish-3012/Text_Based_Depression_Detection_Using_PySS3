I dont want to live in America anymoreI just feel like its America this, America that these days, Im just fed up with it.

I just cant deal with anymore 400LB scooter driving Fast food gulping warmongering Climate change denying ultra religious Police state Americans I'm tired of life in the Midwest
Half of me is considering going out buying a shotgun at a local bass pro shops or Walmart and just doing the deed.

the other half of me is more level headed and mentally clear but still I feel like im giving myself an Identity crisis. 

I would like to move to New Zealand (southland specifically)  but I keep running into trouble with the paperwork. Im a white suburban 22 year old college student who lives with his parents My parents want me to finish my degree but honestly that could take 3 more years. Part of me is unsure if the states can handle 3 more years without erupting into all out civil war.

I just want out of this crazy place I want to go somewhere where freedom of speech still exists, to a place where people actually CARE about the environment, a land where healthcare is a thing and where people actually care for one another.

The other reason why I wanna move to new Zealand is Birds, I want to help save kiwi and kakapo and help out cheeky kea parrots. I totally understand and agree with their predator control policy I know sure I probably wont get to work with actual birds directly but by participating in a country that reduces its plastic pollution I would be indirectly helping them and If I wanted I could also donate to charitys
