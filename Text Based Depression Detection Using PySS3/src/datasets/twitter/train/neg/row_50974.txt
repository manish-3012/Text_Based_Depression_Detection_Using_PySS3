I lurked here for a while and actually stopped because I thought I was doing better.Guess that was a lie.

I tried seriously once, and the psychiatrists knew it so they kept me for observation for 3 months. It was the methodology versus anything else. I won't go into details because it was almost perfect except that you decided to come into break into my room.

I've been a good person for the last 9 years. Though I no longer feel the urge to care. I tried really hard to. I got my heart broken by you so far that I became asexual. I recently had a relationship for a week that I fucked up. I don't want to talk about it because she is another redditor.

This past week was shit.

The end.
