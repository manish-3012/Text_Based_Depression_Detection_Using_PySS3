I have no purpose in lifeI feel like I have my priorities the wrong way round and I've come to accept the fact that I'm worthless in every aspect of life. I refuse to make any attempt to push forward as there's really no point anymore and the only thing I've ever really strived for is a perfect relationship with someone where we can guide each other through life. I'm a dick and I've only made and kept a handful of friends through my life and it feels like a lot of them are moving on now as we're all 18 and I'm still not contributing anything. I'm too depressed to even attempt anything.
The last 6~(ish) people I've tried anything with have the worst shittest most annoying excuses ever to not want to try being more than friends and now I don't even think I can keep it up anymore I just want to live a normal life but everyone reminds me that I'm far from normal
