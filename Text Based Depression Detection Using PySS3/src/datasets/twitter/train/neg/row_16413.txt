It always comes in the night.Here I am once again, one more night. I don't understand why I want to end it. I feel alone, scared of changes, wishing suddenly I wouldn't wake up. I know I don't have the courage to do it but wish suddenly something would put me to sleep. The worst part is waking up tomorrow and thinking why I had this thoughts. I want to be alone and have someone at the same time. To feel something or to lean on. I need a hand.
