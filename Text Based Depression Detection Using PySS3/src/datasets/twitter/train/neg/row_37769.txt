I am ready. Now I just have to wait.There  is no point on keep going. I am worthless, I've trick everyone else on  thinking I am good and I am happy. The truth is I am a piece of shit, I  don't deserve any thing I have and I am lonely and nobody likes me. I  don't have any friends where I live, and my friends back home already  forgot about myself. My family is far away, they might miss me but they  will be ok without me. Nobody likes me and nobody loves me. I am tired  to be a fraud and a lair. Please save your pity messages and comments, I  am just posting this to make sense on my suicide note.

I  am ready to kill myself. Two days ago I bought the rope and a pack of  razor blades. Yesterday I spent the entire day reading books and police  reports to know how to properly hang myself. I already made the knot and  the rope is ready to hang myself to the door knob. I already tried it a  couple of times and is very effective to cut oxygen flow to brain. Now I  just have to wait for my roommate to leave so I could be alone. In the  mean time I'll write a note for my family.

I am sorry for taking this long to do this, and for the people that will find my body.
