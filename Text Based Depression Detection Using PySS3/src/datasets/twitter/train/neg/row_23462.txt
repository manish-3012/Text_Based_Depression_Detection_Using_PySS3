Ultimate drink of deathI know nobody is going to read this, Iâ€™m not worth anyoneâ€™s time I donâ€™t even know why Iâ€™m bothering to write this. The last few times Iâ€™ve posted on here I didnâ€™t get anywhere. 

I donâ€™t have much ways to go, most everything that can kill me is locked up. I have acetone.. and this weird chemical thingy. Itâ€™s an acid I think. hahahhaha lol mix them together to make the ultimate death. why did that make me smile huh even the thought dying makes me happier than anything else anymore.

I would take pills but sadly their all locked up. Iâ€™ve tried them befor it it failed :( I donâ€™t think I took enough. but if I drank an acid surely thatâ€™d kill me. why not drink perfum to, I may as well smell fresh if I die. 

lol drinks axe body spray omfg why am I making death jokes hehe they are funny though I can just imagine them finding my body and it smells like axe body spray. no better way to die than axe lmao 

well if Iâ€™m going to do it I may as well be funny beforehand. nobodies worthless because their organs are very very worth it. dunno if mine will be afterwards.. 

im feeling nervous. I wasnâ€™t the last times Iâ€™ve tried I guess now that this could be painful it just scares me. 
hm alright, Iâ€™m going to make the ultimate drink of death lol 

I hope I have a rememberable death post ? I guess weâ€™ll it maybe just been interesting to read at least. lol what am I saying no one gonna have bothered
