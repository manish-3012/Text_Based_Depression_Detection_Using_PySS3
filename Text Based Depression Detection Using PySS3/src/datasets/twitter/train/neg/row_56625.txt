funnyI just had to talk down a close friend of mine and I feel like I cannot breathe I mean it was almost funny because I feel the exact same way as them yet I am saying how much they need to keep on living their life when I do not even want to live mine I vomited after it was over and now I know for sure I will never let anybody know if I ever do it myself I will go somewhere nobody could find me and just disappear in their mind
