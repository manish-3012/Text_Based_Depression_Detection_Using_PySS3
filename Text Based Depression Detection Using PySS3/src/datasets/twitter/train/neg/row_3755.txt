I think I am at breaking point. I feel dead inside and I don't know who the woman in the mirror is. I have never wanted to die so much. I won't last until the end of these school holidays. I can't go back to work. I can't do it. I won't be able to function. I want to die. My suicidal note is the most beautiful thing I have ever written. I feel like I am in a dream and this is not deal but I can't wake up and I feel like I am floating and I am not real and this is not real. I am existing not living and I can't do this anymore. I am tired of feeling so unhappy and dead. I can't get help or I will lose my teaching license
