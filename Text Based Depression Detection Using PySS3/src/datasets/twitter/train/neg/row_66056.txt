hurtingim 19 and im hurt. i dont know how im still here. ive been like this for so long im just numb to everything at this point. i constantly think about suicide. i like the idea of just dropping down onto my knees and after taking a deep breath, shoot my self in the head. another option would be to overdose on my meds and just fall asleep listening to my favorite songs. i hate my family. i have like 1 friend, i hate myself and i hate school. i like some of my classes but my marks suck and im just sick of school. ive missed out on everything and i feel like i will continue to miss out. i never had a girlfriend even though im a good looking guy i just need some work and discipline. this bothers me the most because im just so lonely and i want to be loved. ive reached out and i just feel like ive made no progress even though i was diagnosed. perhaps deep down i do think there is potential for me i just cant escape
