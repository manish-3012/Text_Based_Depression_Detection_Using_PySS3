(?)I'm really sorry to bother you guys and take up space that others could use. I'm pretty much at the end of my tether right now, and I am alone and I have nobody to talk to about this. I'm not even sure if I should be typing this, publicly. Things like this always seem to back fire.

I've been thinking about suicide for days now. I can tell I'm headed for a bad patch, but I don't know what to do to stop it. I have been to the doctors before and they pass me from person to person, telling me I'm okay and that everything is fine. I've ended up in hospital twice before because the professionals didn't believe me when I said I was seriously considering acting on my thoughts of suicide.

I don't have any friends to talk to about what I'm struggling with. My mother has her own problems and I don't want to worry her yet again with some pathetic drama I am going through. It is my fault my life has crumbled into nothing, it is my fault I have no friends, it is my fault that I am like this. I am obviously just not cut out for life.

I had a conversation with my mum once where she said that if I truly wanted to kill myself, I shouldn't stay for her or my brother. I'd do it for myself and that was okay. I keep thinking about this over and over and it is.. troubling, I guess.

I have tried therapy, medicine, talking, not talking, exercise, and all of these things. They've not helped and I'm still as unhappy as before.

I think I just wish I was loved. I think I just need to man up and deal with this shit, but I can't. Situations beyond my control are grinding me down and I don't have the strength to fight it anymore.

I'm very nearly done.

I'm sorry for the wall of text. Any advice would be very much appreciated, and thank you for reading all of this.
