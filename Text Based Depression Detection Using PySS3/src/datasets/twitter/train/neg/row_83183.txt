suicide is my only way outeveryday is just the same. it doesnâ€™t matter if itâ€™s a good or bad day, itâ€™s over. the day is over. never to be seen again. living feels like a chore. sleeping is my favorite activity but then you wake up and realize where you are. everything is just hate. the world is hate. if i kill myself i can be somewhere where everyone is happy and loving toward each other.
