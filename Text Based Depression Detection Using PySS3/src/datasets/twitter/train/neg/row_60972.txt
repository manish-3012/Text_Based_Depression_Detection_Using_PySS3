hello so i've been drinking non stop for about an hour and i really can't take this solitude anymore.  i really serve no other purpose but to feel like shit day in and day out, why are people saying that things will turn out better for me or that there are endless opportunies when realistically all i'll end up doing is just prolonging my pointless life and never reach my goals. i'm so lost in life.
