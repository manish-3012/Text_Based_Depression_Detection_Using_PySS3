Is there a point in living?I am 15, and school has been getting worst for me, i don't do homework any more because I try to do stuff to keep my mind off of suicide, but then when I don't do it, my family yells at me for not doing it, which makes me feel worst. I think about dying all the time, and people say kys as a joke at school, and It just makes me think about it even more. I have no friends at school, so I feel alone and I don't have anyone to talk to about my suicide. At school I try and hide my suicide, but some days I just feel like a piece of shit (which have gotten more common). I make mistakes every day which makes me feel worst about myself. I have almost killed myself a couple of times because of the rough days i have had. I made a noose, and i'm thinking about killing myself in the near future. I don't know who would care if I am gone, my family wouldn't and people at my school wouldn't, they would be happier if i was gone. I have been thinking about killing myself for a couple of years now, but all of a sudden it has just gotten worst. I haven't talked to anyone about my suicide because I think they would make me feel even worst. I don't even think there is a point to live anymore.
I have gotten to the point of not being motivated to do anything, I just want everything to end.
