I was the only person he could trust. Treat people like people!Bad format because mobile.
Back in sixth grade there was this kind of annoying kid people seemed to dislike. I even kind of disliked him at first, until we became friends.

When I found out more about him, it turned out he was a wonderful person. I naturally tried to get people to stop telling him to go away or ignore him, but I wasnâ€™t a very assertive person and only got a few people to be friends with him.  

A few months go by and during that time weâ€™re good friends. One day in math class (we sit next to each coincidentally) while everyone chattering away he confesses: He told me that in the second grade he tried to kill himself 3 times. He said that whenever heâ€™s sad he has to take his banana pills (I assume dopamine pills) and was saying all of this in a kind of cheery tone of voice. I just couldnâ€™t smile because of how grim it was. 

I havenâ€™t told any of my close friends yet that used to call him annoying. Iâ€™m posting this here as a point that you never know someoneâ€™s back story. I only managed to become close friends with him before he could confess, and I was probably the only person he could trust.
