My only support system is gone.Since people hated me all throughout school, and some hate me even now, I've had pretty much no one in my life. My family didn't care when I said I was suicidal, so I was convinced that I wasn't meant to live. My only friend was this girl online who was empathetic and friendly, I always felt better when talking to her. But like everyone else, she soon grew tired of me, and it's clear from her last comment that she doesn't want to talk anymore. I was starting to have hope that I could one day make friends or even have a SO, but at this rate I don't think I'm going to be liked by anyone. I've decided to just die instead. So I don't have to constantly be reminded of how everyone hates me and how much I failed at life.
