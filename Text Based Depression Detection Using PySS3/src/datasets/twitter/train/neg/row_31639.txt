I relapsed again. Now my suicidal thoughts are worse than never.I have a history of mental illness since around 9. At the time, my father was severely emotionally abusive towards me and my mother wasnâ€™t always present. Growing up, my dad was hard on me, although he was loving, my good memories of him are plagued by the times heâ€™d call me worthless, weak and pathetic for being unable to do things right. And the times where he threatens to kill himself or my pets if I didnâ€™t do what he wanted amongst other things. Iâ€™ve had thoughts of wanting to end it since then but at around 12-13, my depression peaked. My sister was diagnosed with cancer and I just broke. I didnâ€™t have any support group because people have a tendency to leave me after short periods of time. 

Eventually, my parents found out about the plethora of cuts on my wrist and found help for me. After that, I was diagnosed with depression and was given medication. For about a year or so after, I was doing well. I spent 5-6 months alone, seeing no one other than family members and my therapist. 

Over the years I would relapse quite often and I was then diagnosed again, this time with Bipolar 2. Fast forward to now, a few years later, after a chain of events including a talk with my mom and dad that went really really South, a friend which triggers the hell out of me with her jokes about substance abuse, abandonment, realizations and etc. Iâ€™m relapsing again, but this time the suicidal thoughts are worse than ever.

The fact that I believe nothing matters doesnâ€™t really help either. To me, when I die I wonâ€™t feel any regret, pain, doubt, sadness and I wonâ€™t see people miss me and cry for me if they do. If I hold a gun to my head, I realized that even in fear, I can count 1..2...3 click, bang. Then itâ€™s all over. I know it isnâ€™t that easy, but thatâ€™s just how I think of it. The fear of killing myself wouldnâ€™t matter because Iâ€™d be dead. I think of other things too, but I prefer not to elaborate right now. 

Last night, I pointed a pair of sharp scissors on my wrist, then my chest and then my neck. I pressed down because I wanted just die but I stopped myself. At this point whenever I see anything I just think of scenarios of how I can kill myself with it. Itâ€™s really inconvenient and I want to bang my head against the wall because I donâ€™t want to think this way. 

At this point I donâ€™t know if I want to live or die, because right now, death doesnâ€™t sound that bad. 

Iâ€™m sorry for all this. Itâ€™s really random and might not make sense, and thatâ€™s because Iâ€™m just writing what Iâ€™m thinking at the moment. Thereâ€™s a lot of details that I donâ€™t want to mention and yeah...I apologize.
