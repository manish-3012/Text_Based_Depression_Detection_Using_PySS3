Funny how so many people think 2020 was a bad yearSo many people agree that 2020 was a bad year, because of the forced isolation, the lack of employment opportunities, the anguish of not knowing if they will make ends meet, the lack of human connection... life has been like that for a lot of people way before 2020. Now imagine if you had to live like that for the rest of your life, a lot of people would ask for an early exit... and I wouldn't really know what to tell them.
