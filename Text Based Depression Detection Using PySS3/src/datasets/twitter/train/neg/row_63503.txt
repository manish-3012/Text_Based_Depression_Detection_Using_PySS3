Failing college as an international studentI am a college student in Australia. I have always struggled with depression and anxiety as a kid, but studying abroad has made things even more difficult. In the beginning, i lived with my relatives but they were very abusive to me. So I moved out to live with friends. These so called â€œfriendsâ€ of mine donâ€™t care about me much, since they always hang out without me. I often feel alone and misunderstood. Itâ€™s hard being ostracized all the time. I have friends back in my hometown, but they have moved on. Whenever I see them posting happy pictures on social media, I feel jealous and angry with myself. Even though I have spent some years in college, I failed the majority of the courses I had taken. Itâ€™s pure luck on my part that they havenâ€™t kicked me out yet. I have not told this to anyone. Everyday, the guilt and loneliness eat me from the inside. I often at the top of my class before college, so my parents and people around me have high expectation for me. They donâ€™t know I struggle everyday with crippling perfectionism, social anxiety and depression. Itâ€™s hard for me to live everyday and eat and shower and breath, let alone studying. I am scared of letting my parents know. My dad pays everything and he has always expect me to excel. He is very scary when he gets angry and part of the reason why I am constantly suicidal. Recently my best friend just got a boyfriend which made me feel even worse. I have never hold hand with a boy, let alone date. I always feel undesirable and unloved, and maybe thatâ€™s why nobody is interested in me.
