UPDATE: After Tuesday I'll have nothing to live forOriginal post:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/e4teto/after\_tuesday\_ill\_have\_nothing\_to\_live\_for/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/e4teto/after_tuesday_ill_have_nothing_to_live_for/) 

Over the weekend, I posted on this subreddit saying that after a concert I was planning on going to that I would be killing myself. I went to the concert last night. And I think it changed my life.  


I got there early to be at the front of the stage, stood through some good opening acts for two hours and patiently waited for my favorite performer to come out. This man is Amigo the Devil, regardless of your thoughts on his music, I'd like you to continue reading this post.  


I knew every single word to the songs and had fun. Towards the halfway point of his set, Danny (his actual name) sang a song that I hadn't expected to hear at a live show. 'First Day of the End of My Life' is a slow, somber song about a girl's last thoughts before she kills herself. As a woman myself and someone who (obviously) has dealt with depression and suicidal thoughts, this song really spoke to me and it's been a song that I've found incredibly comforting. He performed the song at the show, which was odd considering most every other song was upbeat.  


I just cried during the entire live song. No one stopped me to ask what was wrong (I went by myself) and I was grateful for that. It was a euphoric experience. Just listening to him struggle to get through a song that clearly meant a lot to him while I did the exact same six feet away.   


After the song and throughout the show, he mentioned his own struggle with depression. I'll never forget what he said, "I kept fighting against it for years. But then I realized that that was the exact opposite of what I have to do. Depression is something you live with. You live with it, parallel to it, not fight it."  


And I think he said the exact thing I've been needing to hear. I've been fighting this for a long time, a long fucking time. I kept thinking that if I just fight it and push it deep down that I wouldn't have to deal with it. But that's what I need to do, I need to deal with it because it's a part of my life now. I can't get rid of depression forever, it's a fight I'll never win. But I can befriend it. I can get to know it. I can get along with it and learn to live that way.  


It won't fix me. I'll always have depression and I'll always have those dark nights, days, weeks where I think the only answer is to join the dead. But he said what I needed to hear. Maybe some others need to hear it too. 

I got the chance to meet him after the show. I'm not one for conversation and I definitely didn't want to cry in front of him, so I just said hi and told him how awesome it was. I regret not saying more but I have a feeling there will be more chances to say it when I go to his future shows. 

So, thanks everyone for listening. Maybe it will help, maybe it won't. But I'm glad so many people cared about me in my first post. I'll try to be more active here on my main subreddit in the future. I hope everyone lives a really long, pain free life.
