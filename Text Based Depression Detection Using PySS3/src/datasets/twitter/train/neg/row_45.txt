I feel so hopelessHello, I guess this is my attempt at a lifeline or something.

Okay, so I guess the best way to begin this is to just tell you straight up that Iâ€™m gay. This wouldnâ€™t be an issue if I didnâ€™t have strictly conservative parents, I know a lot of people have it worse off than me, but I feel like most of my problems stem from this.

I havenâ€™t been diagnosed as anything really, but I donâ€™t really care because it doesnâ€™t take a fucking expertâ€™s opinion to tell you there is something genuinely fucking wrong with me. Lately Iâ€™ve been feeling more and more suicidal, and have been planning my suicide more and more and how I could enact it with little to no effort whatsoever. And right before the time of this post in fact, Iâ€™ve cut myself for the first time. Very shallow cuts, 7 of them. Worst part of it was trying to get the bleeding to stop, even now.  That and Iâ€™ve been feeling like absolute SHIT consistently for 4 months now, so yeah thereâ€™s definitely something wrong.

To further go into detail about the cutting, looking back at it, I snapped and started cutting, going deeper than anything Iâ€™ve tried to cut and with such force and pressure. Iâ€™m glad there was only an exacto knife nearby, if anything else I think I may have bled out. What scares me about this is 1. how I snapped and started cutting myself and how fast I went to cut myself and 2. How the fuck Iâ€™m going to hide the cuts and if someone asks what excuse I could possibly come up with.

At the time of typing this, yesterday during work I was so miserable that I contemplated walking out climbing up a tree, tying my hoodie sleeves on both the tree and my next and just letting myself fall. I obviously didnâ€™t do this, and even if I were to walk out, Iâ€™d probably wouldnâ€™t because I felt like if I did, Iâ€™d just spread my suffering to my family. 

About my family : As I stated previously, theyâ€™re an adamant religious bunch, and they have no tolerance for gays, heresy and mental illness, so I have to act as if I were something I were not around them, and I think the facade is taking a toll on my mind because then I feel like I have no actual personality and that I just have to be fake around people to make them happy at the time. Iâ€™ll be honest, itâ€™s hard sometimes but I feel no sense of â€œselfnessâ€ I have never EVER even gave them a hint that I would ever be gay, I try to make it seem like gay isnâ€™t even a comprehensible subject and that it is something so outlandish it shouldnâ€™t exist. However, recently I have told my mother that I am feeling anxious about everything, stressed over tiny things and that Iâ€™m feeling like absolute shit and Iâ€™ve been considering suicide and she just yells at me and tells me Iâ€™m lazy and that even I couldnâ€™t amount to anything if I gave it all of my willpower, and what hurts more than the words is the expectation being shattered. I just want someone to understand me, and to love me for what I am, and genuinely acknowledge that there is something wrong with me, and that I need help, but it just makes me so fucking sad that itâ€™s never going to happen, I donâ€™t even tell this sort of stuff to my one friend because it just ruins the atmosphere and brings the mood down, so I canâ€™t just do that. I feel like I genuinely have nobody, I feel so isolated and alone. I know there are those who have it so much worse off than me, and I try to rationalize the situation in consideration of the fact, but I canâ€™t help but feeling so fucking bad.

I am scared that Iâ€™m going to kill myself soon, I just want things to stop being shit, Iâ€™ve been feeling like this on and off for almost 5
Years no, but in the past 4 months, I genuinely have been feeling this way daily and very recently have had only suicide on my mind. I just want the pain to end, I just want to not be alone, and want someone to hug me and tell me Iâ€™m valid.
