The universe is telling me it's time to goI can already picture myself jumping off that balcony and hitting the hard ground head-first, breaking my neck in the process hopefully and ensuring a quick and painless death. I can already picture the onlookers, all shocked like they have no idea why I did it. I can already picture my dad when he gets the news, killing himself because he has no other reason to live without me. I can picture my former friend-group, being relieved, angry, and mostly apathetic because I've cried wolf for so fucking long now. I feel like I'm going to do it this time. I shouldn't hurt my dad and anyone who still cares like that, but I'm a selfish asshole in death as I've been in life. I already went over the reasons I'm doing it on /r/BPD. I feel no longer human. The innocent child I once was is just a fucking monster I have to kill.
