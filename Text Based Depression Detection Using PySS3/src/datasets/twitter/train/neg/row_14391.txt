idk who else to say this toand i am also scared to tell anyone (friends, family, therapist) but im at a rly bad point in life and think about killing myself every day. everytime i get out of the house to do w/e or hang out w friends, i constantly think about leaving the group and just ending it by a nearby train or something.

i dont have a plan or intentions of hurting myself or carrying anything out but the thoughts have been getting worse every day and i dont want to tell anyone bc i do this all the time and theyre sick of hearing it im sure.
