I want to help and get help backI feel so alone, I feel the need to listen to someone and talk about my problems to someone.
There's so much going on and I don't want to give up, there seems to be no solution I really need a friend...
I might give up this week if things get worse.

Can someone chat with me?
I'm ready to listen to you too.
