I'm probably going to kill myselfI dont know why I'm posting this here, I don't even bother posting much. I'm just so sick of it. Ive been feeling like this for years, it's only now that I realised that it never gets better. There's no point. Ive already bought everything i need to do this. I'm in the middle of planning it. I've thought a lot about how I'm going to do it. I'm just so sick of being used by people and thrown away when they find out I'm worthless.

This is it. I've been trying and trying and trying to find a solution to all my problems. Maybe this is it. Thinking about the future fills me with dread. It's so empty, I feel hollow. I know everyone is thinking about how much of a failure I am too, I don't amount to their expectations. I don't even have parents any more.

Finding a solution to this problem of this life is the only thing I can do now. I think I might go through with it this time. Im not sure. My head hurts.
