I think about suicide a lot.I'm 17 and the only thing I do all day is play League Of Legends. I have a ton of acquaintances, but no real good friends I hang out with. I never leave my house. I don't get bullied or anything at school I'm actually kind of well liked, but I don't make conversation well so I don't have many friends. I've never had a serious girlfriend. I've had a couple for a few weeks. But last week I met this really nice and beautiful girl and we started to talk. I asked her out and she said yes. The day came for the date and she never showed up. She stopped messaging me for 3 days and in school she looks right past me as if she doesn't even know who I am. Did I do something wrong? She seemed really interested in me then she just stopped talking to me straight up. I did see her holding hands with a guy this morning though. I just kind of feel like I don't matter. I'm not smart and I'll probably never grow up to do anything, and I'm 17 and still don't have my first kiss. I've never done anything exciting ever, I sit at home all day in the dark, go to sleep, wake up, go to school, come home and repeat. No one loves me and I don't think anyone ever will. I just have no way to get this depressed mood out of here...

Oh well... good bye
