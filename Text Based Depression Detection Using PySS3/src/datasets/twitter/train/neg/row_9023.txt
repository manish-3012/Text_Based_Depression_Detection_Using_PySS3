I have someone that wants to kill themselves tonight. HELP ME STOP THEM.She is in another city, so I can't physically be there. And I have no number of any one of her friends or family. WHAT DO I DO??!??!??!?

She is in full distress after a night of drinking, and there is a good chance she might kill herself by swallowing pills.
