Help.I have straight Fs and my attendance is horrible. I canâ€™t face my dad when the school year ends. I have 3 days left to figure out how I want to die. My friends hate me and send me videos of them hanging out and they donâ€™t invite me. Iâ€™ve stopped going to therapy and my medicine is clearly not working. The guilt from my actions in school are overwhelming and the only solution to this is death. Iâ€™ll take any drugs I can get my hands on and lie to people just to get some cash and I hate myself for it. I donâ€™t see a future for myself and if I do have one it will not be good. I have access to a gun but itâ€™s my dads and I donâ€™t want him to feel responsible for any of this. Iâ€™m a disappointment to my family because my social skills are gross and whenever my grandpa or dad asks me â€œhey, do you plan on doing any sports?â€ I can barely bring myself to say no because my dad was a football player in high school and every time I say no my heart sinks lower and lower knowing how disappointed they are. Those 3 days are counting down and the closer I get to the end I just want to die more.
