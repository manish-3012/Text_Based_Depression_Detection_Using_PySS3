What happens if I tell my therapist/GP I've made plans?For reference, this is the UK, I know things vary a lot between the UK and US.

I'm seeing a therapist on Tuesday, but I'm not sure how far I should go into detail with my suicide plans. I will say I'm suicidal, but I've always denied any plans I've made. I'd say I'm worse than ever now, but I'm worried about any repercussions from saying the truth.

Thanks.
