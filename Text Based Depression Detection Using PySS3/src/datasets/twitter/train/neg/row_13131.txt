I want to kill myself to get a message across to my countryâ€™s shite education system.Iâ€™m 18, in the final year of secondary school in my country. I take exams in June. The past 6 years have been nothing but pain, anxiety, and depression. Iâ€™m not sure how Iâ€™ll do it yet but I guess you could say Iâ€™m making plans. Iâ€™ve decided that if/when I decide to die, I will do it vocally, strongly, like the fighter I am so that it will shock people so much itâ€™ll send a message to the Education board of my country, and maybe if Iâ€™m lucky itâ€™ll get across to other countries too. This school system is long-outdated and isnâ€™t relevant anymore. I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m gonna kill myself before, during the exams or after when I get my results back, but I feel like my reason for suicide will be because of this shite system that has destroyed me as a person. No more, Iâ€™m taking one for the team. I donâ€™t want anyone to ever suffer from this bullshit ever again.
