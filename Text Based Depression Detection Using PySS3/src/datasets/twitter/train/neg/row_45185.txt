Expired pills OD?Pretty sure it's more effective when they are 4 years expired painkillers, this time it will work. Fuck this world, it only exists for suffering. 

No one seems to care enough. Perhaps only one person, but that one person won't beat the rest of the world that's against me. 

Everything always gets worse. Even when I try to make it better it gets worse and worse. 

Vent? Note? Idk.. I'm just so tired. I want to but I can't. I'm so scared but I have to and its making me even more scared. 
A world of suffering.
