Attention whore post number 9999999999I feel disgusting. I shouldnâ€™t post this as I donâ€™t even deserve the help but fuck it. I hallucinate. Theyâ€™re like imaginary friends but way more vivid. And I canâ€™t make them go away ( not that Iâ€™d want to...) Iâ€™ve had this stupid juvenile thought in my head that If I die Iâ€™d see them. Like theyâ€™d be my afterlife. But theyâ€™re not the thing making me want to kms. Iâ€™ve gender dysphoria an abusive mom and a fuck ton of self hatred. My plan is as follows: wait till my parents buy a new bottle of windex. 2 take it up to my room in the middle of the night. 3 drink it all while listening to gloomy Sunday ( might as well make my death as much of a joke as my life) 4 die ( hopefully) 5 see my â€œ imaginary friendsâ€ in the â€œ afterlifeâ€ ( I hope). This whole thing is probably a fucking horrible plan but I have nothing else to live for...
