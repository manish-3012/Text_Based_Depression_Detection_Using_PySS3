[NOT URGENT] Don't read unless you have spare time please, I don't want to annoy anyone.The thought of hell existing is the only thing keeping me alive, and just barely.

I am 13 and I have thought of jumping out of my window (9 stories) a lot of times(I can't even get a gun to have a 99% chance of death since I'm in greece), but every time I remember that "APPARENTLY" if you kill yourself you go to hell. I am scared of even the 1% possibility of this being true, but if things get bad enough, I'm going to kill myself either way.

I am from greece so there isn't really suicide prevention here, and even if there is I wouldn't feel comfortable being 13 and calling them.

Don't worry about what you say to me. And sorry for my english.
