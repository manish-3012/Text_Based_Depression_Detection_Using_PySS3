Will I ever find love as a 5'5 ish 5'6 male?Ik another sad and or vent post but I'm genuinely curious. 

I'm 19m and never had a girlfriend, never kissed anyone, never even held hands with a girl. The loneliness and isolation is literally torture and I cry myself to sleep every night. 

I just want to be in a loving wholesome relationship. I dont care about having sex or swapping partners often or any of that shit. I would be VERY happy with just meeting one person falling in love and spending my life with them. 

I know allot of guys are not aware when a girl likes them but personally I believe I am a very aware and observant person. Really shy and introverted let's me think and observe things allot and holy shit its fucking sad. The only girl who ever liked me a was a slightly overweight girl in middle school that I didnt feel the same for. Honestly the fact that she had a crush on me is keeping me going on the slim hope that someone can love me. 

Objectively speaking I would be considered ugly I think? I'm short for a guy, have a big nose, and have a receding hairline. (Fuck genetics) I'm not overweight and go to the gym 6 days a week so I am fit. And if I look in the mirror I dont think I'm ugly but that fact only one girl has liked me in 19 years says otherwise.

It fucking sucks because I think I'm a good person at least, very thoughtful and caring and loving deep conversation and connecting with others. I believe I get along with others really good as well. 

I would LOVE to be their for someone. To provide love and affection. To spend time and bond with someone. To have a family would make me so happy. 

I feel so alone and these 6 months of lockdown in the U.S has made it even worse. 

I just want to be loved for fucks sake.
