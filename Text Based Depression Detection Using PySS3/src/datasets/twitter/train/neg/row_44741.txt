falling like a bottleThe green bottle left my hand and gracefully arced up a score before finally succumbing to gravity and falling ever faster until it smashed against some unknown solid surface in a dark alleyway 10 stories below. 

I've been thinking about jumping for the past two hours. I woke up to a call from my mother. It was mostly her yelling at me for being an academic failure and a slut and a probable future failure. This stupid window only swings open six inches so I'd have to shoot it out first. Death will be a lot better than going home.

p.s. sorry if I don't respond instantly, I bled onto my laptop and have to clean it off as it's causing keys to stick.
