I can see it all perfectly in my head, even if I don't have the guts to go through with itI take a warm shower, and linger there, feeling the hot water cascade over me, almost burning me. Iâ€™m crying and smiling under the water. Relief begins in my stomach and spreads to my fingertips. When I get dressed, I put on my favourite shirt. I blow-dry and curl my hair. I put on makeup, and the girl in the mirror is beautiful in her calm.

I do the dishes and clean the kitchen so my sister comes home to a tidy house. I make my bed, and, as an afterthought, make hers too. I pick up my cat, press my face into his soft fur, stroke his ears as he purrs and looks at me with his luminous green eyes. I wonder if heâ€™ll understand. Do cats have any concept of such things? I ask him, but he just keeps looking at me with those big eyes, purring and reticent as always.

I take a taxi to the forest about five kilometres from my house. Itâ€™s full of alien trees, tall pines that were never supposed to grow here. They stand silent sentinel, an army of watchers, and as I pass between them, I feel safe in their ranks. The air is all moss-green and cold, and my breath mists in tiny clouds from my lips. Dead leaves whisper under my boots as I hike deeper into the forest, brushing dew-drops from bushes as I pass.

This is a popular trail, but this time of day, itâ€™s deserted. Iâ€™ve heard horror stories of girls dragged into the undergrowth, raped and beaten and left for dead. Bizarrely, I am afraid, and hope to reach my destination safely.

And where is my destination? Iâ€™m not sure yet, but I think Iâ€™ll know it when I see it. I push onwards, leaving the trail, venturing further into the embrace of the trees. I want to go where nobody else has gone. I donâ€™t want anyone to find me, not for a while.

Watery sunlight filters through the treetops far above me, and my footsteps are muffled by a sweet-smelling carpet of fallen needles. Birdsong echoes from branch to branch, and a squirrel darts across my path, bright eyes and bushy tail flashing in a stray dapple of sun. Iâ€™m smiling, and all at once, I feel complete. I feel part of this forest, breathing with it, smelling its wet-leaf smells and hearing its quiet business stirring in my own head. Iâ€™ve reached my spot, I think. This is it.

From my bag, I take the sturdy hemp rope, and loop it over a high branch. I pull out the folding stool and set it up beneath the branch, and climb up on to it. I am afraid, but the fear feels far away, distant to the calm that has come over me.
In my pocket is my ID, a little bit of money left over from the cab fare, and a handwritten note. I spent a long time writing it, because it would be the last thing left of me, and I wanted it to be perfect. I donâ€™t want to cause anyone any more pain than necessary.

Smiling, I take one last deep breath of the damp forest air, tasting pine needles and trapping some birdsong in my lungs. Then I exhale, releasing the birdsong, and kick the stool from under my feet.

I hope it isnâ€™t a child who finds me. I hope my eyes are closed, so whoever does find me doesnâ€™t have to look into them. I hope my note is enough. I hope my parentsâ€™ hearts donâ€™t break, and I hope my sister can still go on her long-awaited holiday to Prague with her boyfriend, and I hope her boyfriend forgives me for dying on his birthday. I hope my one true love, so far away and so broken and hopeless, never hears of my death. I would spare him that. I donâ€™t want him thinking itâ€™s his fault. I hope the world is a little kinder; I hope that, somehow, my death, my sacrifice, will appease some karmic god, and that my last selfish act will have some sort of selfless ripple in the universe. Itâ€™s a vain hope, but I suppose I can afford it to myself; one last delusion. If a dying girl canâ€™t kid herself that her death means something, then who can?

I hope they can forgive me for leaving them behind. I love you all.

Edit: I'm not encouraging suicide. I don't think I'll even be able to kill myself, and I definitely don't want anyone else to harm themselves in any way. What I've written here is a fantasy, and it's romanticised. I'd like to think death would be as calm and peaceful as I've described it, but I really can't say if it will be. It was pretty cathartic to write it out, though, and I wanted to share it. I don't mean to hurt anyone or encourage anyone to hurt themselves, so please don't take it that way.
