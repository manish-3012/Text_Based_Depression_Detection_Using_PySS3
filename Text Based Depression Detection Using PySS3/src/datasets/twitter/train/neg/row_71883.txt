Why do I feel like this?Since this time last year, I have felt a deep sadness every single day of my life. I used to be so happy and optimistic and I would look forward to everything and see the best in everyone. Now It is the exact opposite. I am struggling and I don't know what to do. I know I don't think I would kill myself, but I just don't want to be alive anymore I feel like I have no real purpose and I just constantly stay miserable. I feel like I am living a nightmare. I like to make music but here lately I feel so awful that I don't even want to leave my bed. I don't want to do this anymore and honestly I don't know what to do. I tell me friends that I am miserable but they all just say 'yeah I know how you feel' or something similar. I feel broken whenever I leave my house I hope that an 18 wheeler blind sides me or something prevents me from making it to where I am going. I used to consider myself and strong person and I think that is just dragging me down further please help me.
