How to get out of depression?I am severely depressed.

I am 17 1/2 (F) and recently found out about this.


I did knew something was wrong with me but as everyone keep saying "don't worry, we all get those gloomy days. It will pass." So I never paid much attention to it.


But it got so worst that I stopped going to school. After months of missing school, I finally dropped out of high school today.


I thought I could just take the GED test but I can't.

I don't know how to fix myself. I can't do anything.

I loved studying and now I can't get myself to scan a page.

I feel tired and drained.


I don't know how I got myself into this mess.

Two years ago, I was studying hard, making goals to not only be the veladictorian and getting into Penn state uni but also being a better person. I was taking care of my health,  helping my parents out and constantly Woking towards being a better daughter, sister, friend etc.



Now I am gone.


I feel like I am fading or something.

I can't explain myself 


I tried tracking down the main causes of my depression and these are what I remember


1. I felt neglected by my parents. I wasn't feeling loved and I still don't. (I stopped trying to be closer to them. I just want them to be as far away from me as possible)

2. I tried the isolation thing. I tried to isolate myself from everyone when I really felt like no one cared about me.

3. Test anxiety


4. Fear of failure.


Now I just feel worthless.


I saw a therapist but she wasnt much helpful.


I get motivated and do good for two weeks and then bam, fall down again.


I talked to my sis, she hates me now because she thinks I am being a drama queen.



I don't want to commit suicide but I don't want to live like this either.


I don't see the future I have worked hard for 


I don't know how I let this happen to me.
