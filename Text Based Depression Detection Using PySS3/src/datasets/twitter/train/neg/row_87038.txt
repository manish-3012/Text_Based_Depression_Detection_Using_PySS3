LonelySo the past 5 years Iâ€™ve felt completely lonely. Iâ€™m married and live with my partner, I know she isnâ€™t attracted to me. Asides her, I have no one else. No co workers I can call friends, no family, just me. Itâ€™s gotten to the point where I believe if I died, no one would know or care. 

I donâ€™t know what to do, I miss my siblings, I want to feel loved. I havnt felt this way in ages but fuck I want to die
