Does anyone else feel suicidal when they think about their future?Like i'll be having a happy time, then i'll think about my future and how i'll have less and less free time and more and more responsibilities, and it'll always turn me to the bitter truth which is that im probably not going to be happy and having these good situations anymore.

Working a job I hate, having pretty much no time to do hobbies, being a nobody. I just want to end my life once i'm 20, i feel like i've lived a perfect amount of it if that's the case.
