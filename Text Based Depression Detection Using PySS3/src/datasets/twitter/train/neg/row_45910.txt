I want to become a statisticI want to do my part. If the suicide rate rises, people in power might take the future generation's mental health into consideration. I can't help myself bu I can sacrifice my life to make the future generations lives better. I'm useless and this will give me one thing to be proud of but how can I be proud of it when I'm dead? Still I want to help others out. I was unlucky.
