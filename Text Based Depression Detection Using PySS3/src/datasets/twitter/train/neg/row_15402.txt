Iâ€™m disposableIâ€™m tired of people â€œtryingâ€ to understand how I feel. Theyâ€™ll never get it Iâ€™m so alone in this existence, trapped in my head. Iâ€™m tired of the way people treat me, like Iâ€™m disposable like I have no purpose. I absorb the sins of others so they can live free....what about me. Iâ€™ve been abandoned my whole life.
