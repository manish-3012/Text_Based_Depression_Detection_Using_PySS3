Here's the thing..I've been suicidal most of my life..  At first when I'd get really depressed, when I was a teen, early adult, I would grab whatever bottle of pills and swallow them.  Someone would find me and I'd end up waking up in the hospital a day later.  Then, about 11/12 years ago I was really depressed.  Things were very dark, and I was deeply hurt.  My wife had left, and her and her parents were taking her to a divorce attorney and making things that what nothing but daggers through my heart, and stood for everything I wasn't.  It made it had to breathe, wake up in the morning, get out of bed etc..  I was devastated, but I was still trying, but nobody wanted to listen.  So, I made the decision to end my life.  I read online, I ordered the meds, went out of state and booked a hotel for a couple of nights.  I took the pills and was found 16 hours later.  A helicopter ride, couple of ambulances, and 6 days later I miraculously woke up from a coma.  So, the last 5 years have been up and down.  I get really down, but have recovered for a month or two at a time where I felt up.  The last few months have been very, very bad.  I feel totally hopeless.  I ordered sodium nitrite online thinking about taking it to end my life.  However, the last time I had a serious attempt I felt so at peace about it.  I was actually happy and at peace the day before I did it.  This time, it feels different.  I can't reach that sort of peace I felt.  I feel like I may be making a mistake if I do it.  I've thought about it so much, I would rather just let my family down once and get it over with. I just don't know..
