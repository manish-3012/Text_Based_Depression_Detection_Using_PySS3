I wish for it all to endI have to vent, sorry

I just don't understand how people can be happy and have their life under control. I feel an emptiness that expands exponentionally by the minute... It consumed me a long time ago and I cannot escape it. I tried to force my brain to make me feel happy by smoking weed and I have tried to heal my negaitve feelings and emotions by going to a psychiatrist/psychotherapist and by using psylocibin and LSD. Nothing has ever helped or even showed me what I should do to escape this emptiness. I never felt useful or that I belonged anywhere, everywhere I go I feel like I am a burden and that I should go back to my bed and cry myself into the next day, like I have been doing for the last eight or nine months.

I have had so many urges to end it all in the past two weeks that I do not even know if I am sane or if I have something phisically wrong with my brain.

All I do know is that the only reason I have not killed myself is because of my girlfriend. When I first met her almost two and a half years ago I have gotten so much hope from her and I still do, but every day becomes harder and harder to keep the smile she painted on my face. I just want to be a good boyfriend and a good person overall and I do not know how much time I have left untill my mind breaks and I off myself.

I do not want to kill myself, but the pressure I feel every day is becoming so debilitating that I feel like I am going to lose control of my mind and body one last time and finally put an end to it all.
