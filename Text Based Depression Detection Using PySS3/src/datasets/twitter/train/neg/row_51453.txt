I'm really trying to hold onI'm convinced I'm going to go nowhere in life.  
I'm so tired. I'm mentally and physically drained. I'm trying to hold onto the reasons that I wanna stay alive, like my friends, my cat, my sister, because i know they all care about me. But it's so hard when the bad thoughts are getting louder and louder to the point where it just drowns out the positive ones. I just really don't want to do it anymore. I don't want to keep living just to keep being used and hurt. I'm tired of feeling like a failure. I don't want this anymore.
