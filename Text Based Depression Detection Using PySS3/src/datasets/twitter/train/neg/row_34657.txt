I really want to overdose tonightNo one listens to me. No one can help. The people who would usually help are busy or otherwise unable to reapond. I don't know how to hold on.

I don't want to hurt my friends, family and my boyfriend, but staying just for them is beginning not to be enough. I'm so close to just doing it.

Help me please.
