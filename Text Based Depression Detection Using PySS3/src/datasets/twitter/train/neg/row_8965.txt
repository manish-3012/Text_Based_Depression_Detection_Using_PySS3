vicious cycle. this is itSo many years of the pain eating away at me inside. 

So many years of always thinking of those things that happened to me growing up. So much anger that I moved away from my family over six months ago and changed my number because of the anger inside. No connection to family. No friends in this new city. I've lost the knowledge of what being happy even means anymore. So much anger. The same monotonous cycle of work and school every day. I force myself to act happy at work so nobody asks if i'm ok. Do you have any idea what its like to be taken advantage of so young and have to deal with that every day for the rest of your life

It has been six years since losing my best friend to suicide. Never recovering from that is like a poison that never leaves your body and slowly eats away at your soul. I can't get close to anyone for fear of losing someone and not wanting to feel that loss again. I've lost touch with how to even try to date anymore. Everyone and everything just makes me so angry everywhere I go. I hate seeing people smile. The torture of almost losing my own father to suicide. I have a coward family and that pathetic blood runs through me. 

I don't know what to do anymore. 

I think of ridding myself of this pain every day. I hate myself and how pathetic I feel every day. Nobody likes me and I have no friends. 

6 years of wanting to end this pain every damn day. this is it
