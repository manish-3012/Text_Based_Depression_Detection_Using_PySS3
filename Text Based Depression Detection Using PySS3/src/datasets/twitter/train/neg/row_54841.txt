Resigning to liveNot really sure if this is the right place to post. But Iâ€™ve kind of spent the last 2 days determined that I was gonna end my life. I tried and contemplated different ways. And today Iâ€™ve realized that I donâ€™t really have the courage to follow through. Iâ€™m so scared of failing and living worse. So I gave up and I feel so god damned broken right now.
Iâ€™m with family now, but everything they say and tell me is just hurting so much more inside. I feel guilty for wanting to end my life and I feel more guilty that I couldnâ€™t do it.
