Iâ€™m tiredI have tried everything. Meds, therapy, DBT, ECT, the list goes on. In the end, after all these years, nothing truly gets better. In the last two months I have completely cut off any and every connections have.  I donâ€™t leave my house anymore. I donâ€™t even want to. I give up. I just canâ€™t anymore. Iâ€™m done. I canâ€™t do this anymore....
