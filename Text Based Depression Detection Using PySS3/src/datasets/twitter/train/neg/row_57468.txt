I can't stop constantly thinking about ending it...This may just be the result of this being the worst month in my life. My mother had a small aneurysm, almost died and can't speak right. My sister tried to overdose on pills and is now hospitalized. My girlfriend of 3 years broke up with me and won't speak to me (she was my main pillar of support) and the girl I'm currently seeing treats me like shit...

I've had a history of depression and suicidal thoughts, but it's never been as bad as it is now. Every few minutes or so I start thinking about killing myself. I take anxiety medication and it helps, but not completely. 

What's next? I just want the drama to end. 

How can I stop thinking about ending it constantly?
