Beginning to lose controla  week ago I posted here: https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/32m9lq/would_people_miss_me_if_i_die/ and I would like to see and get more advice.

As I said in my previous post and 16 years of age and I am attending my first year of college. And I feel like I have nothing to live for. I have no social life outside college in the real world although I do play computer games with close friends regularly but I feel like there is no point in living feel i  like if I would kill myself no no one would miss me and that (like all life) there is nothing to live for.

I feel that I'm doing pretty well college but due to my bow self-esteem and my shit  self-worth and I still feel like I will never amount to anything.

Whether this feeling is due to my teenage years or some  un-diagnosed mental illness feel like I should end it now while the going rate for l life is pointless.

I should also add that I have made many acquaintances in college and I would consider some friends.

I suppose my point of this post is s do I have anything to lose? If I kill myself that is.
