If I canâ€™t get better then Iâ€™ll end itIâ€™m going to start doing things that are good for my wellbeing and see how things change. Exercise, meditation, eating better, start doing old hobbies again, things like that. Iâ€™ve been alone for a while. I donâ€™t feel connected to anyone. I want to but I just cant. Maybe once I start doing better for myself I find someone I can really connect with. Maybe Iâ€™ll even find a girl along the way. Talking doesnâ€™t help. Iâ€™m so lonely. Iâ€™m trapped in my mind.
