Too weakI have a lot of problems with family. There's so many injustices around me, but I can't do anything about them. I'm too powerless and weak. A lot of people already hate me because of the way I was born, so it makes my matters worse. I'm not strong enough for this world. I used to be, but I can't gain that strength again and I don't know how. I tried to get help and it was one of the biggest mistakes of my life.

I want to leave.
