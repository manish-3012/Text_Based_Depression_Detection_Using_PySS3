Why do you bother?It's not like any of you really care about us. We mean, quite literally, pretty much nothing to you. If the people in my life, in our lives, haven't been able to do anything, why do you think that you are capable of doing *jackshit*? You know the only thing keeping me around anymore? Guilt and fear. I don't want what few people who care about me to have to deal with my death. The drama, the funeral, the questions and blame. I don't want to have to be responsible for that. I'm afraid of what would happen if I *do* decide to stop being a coward. As unpopular as it seems to be on reddit, I'm still a Christian, even if I do reject most of the doctrine spewed today. How am I going to be able to face my grandparents, my ancestors, the thousands who never got to live the lives they should have gotten, or my Creator? Why the *fuck* would any of you care about that? You don't know me, you don't know any of us, you are biologically imparied from being able to form any meaningful feelings or connections beyond "that makes me feel bad". So cut the bullshit.
