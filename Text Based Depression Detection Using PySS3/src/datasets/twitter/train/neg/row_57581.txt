My life seems perfect... But I still hate myselfHey Reddit you all might hate me for this but My story isn't very typical. 

I don't have a bad life, in fact Some would say I have a great one. I have two loving parents, live in a middle class neighborhood, am top ranked in my class, have a great GF, and get almost anything I want. 

Despite all of this I still hate myself... I can't stop thinking about how much I want to just end it all... I constantly feel shitty and hate the people around me... I hate my family even thought they do nothing wrong... In fact I hate everything.... Nothing in life makes me happy.... My life is one big shitty stage where I have to act like a normal person...

I don't know what to do I hate my "perfect life" and wan to end it... Why shouldent I?
