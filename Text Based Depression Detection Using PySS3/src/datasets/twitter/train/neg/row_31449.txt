The person I loved most in the world died 4.5 years ago and I still feel acute grief. Looks like suicide might be the answerI loved him so much. I still cry hysterically every single day and listen to his voicemails. I just cannot take the fact that he is gone. I will never, ever get over this. I want to die because I am in so much pain from it. I can't face life without him anymore
