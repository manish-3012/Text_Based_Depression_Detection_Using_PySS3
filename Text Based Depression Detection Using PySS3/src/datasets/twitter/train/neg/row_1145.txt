I won't even be able to say goodbyeI'm not dead and yet not quite alive either. Sometimes I don't even feel anything. I was going for a walk today, and felt so enraged and desperate I threw my phone and randomly started screaming. Whats wrong with me? I have considered almost every way of dying, but I know it'll hurt my family (I have no friends).  I just can't be responsible for passing my heavy burden onto them, when they realize what I've done. My mom told me suicide is selfish, but whats the point of living in a world where I am so lost? The worst part besides hurting them is that the one I love won't even care, and is better off without me. I won't even be able to sat goodbye. Why am I even writing this? I'm too afraid to die anyway. At least for now.
