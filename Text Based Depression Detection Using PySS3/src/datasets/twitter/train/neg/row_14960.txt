Feel like walking into a hospital and...I'm such a bother to people.  I can't control my mouth and everything I say makes people hate me.  I feel like walking into a hospital and putting a shotgun in my mouth and blowing my cerebellum away.  I'll be brain dead, but they'll save my organs quick enough so they will still be working.  At least someone will benefit from my misery.
