I don't want to die...I just don't want to exist anymoreThere are better days and worse days, but it seems almost nothing gets better

When I was a child I had severe asthma. Even when I went to run on PE I would suffer an attack. Somehow It turned better when I was like 9 years old. I remember I was having some kind of pills.

Then, I had precocious puberty and was the first on my class to develop secondary sexual characteristics too. And nowadays I have an hormonal disorder with overdeveloped sexual characteristics that make my life so hard bacusw of how I look, and because of how my body feels, I'm always aching because it's too much weight.
I also probably have ovarian cysts or so, doctors are still searching what's it.

When I was a child also, I used to be bullied at school. Mostly people ignoring me, calling me things, or telling me to go away.
I also experienced death early, since when I was 5 I had a little sister who died in 2 years. Then my grandfather died when I was 11, my aunt when I was 13, one of my grandmothers when I was 18 and another now, I am 23.

I also have been psychologically abused by my parents since I was little.

It started as some things going a little far of how a child should be treated, as like they always punishing me by taking away my toys when I was a child because of any little mistake I would make, they never listening to what I had to say, telling me to shut up, etc. They did also hit me sometimes and some time after I didn't even remember why I was punished. I don't remember very much things of my childhood and that's another thing that hurts me. But I remember the days I had traumas.
