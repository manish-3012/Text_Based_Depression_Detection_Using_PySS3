I can't do it anymore.I've been struggling with depression for years now, and my life is utterly empty. I hoped things would get better eventually, and I really tried to make it that way but everything has been shit for over 3 years now. I can't stand to keep feeling as miserable as this. I was trying to hold on until the end of the month, but I can't even wait that long. I think it needs to be now.
