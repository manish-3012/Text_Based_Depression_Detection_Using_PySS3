Off my chest.
It's getting harder and harder for me to distract myself from the things that are keeping me down. 



&gt;
&gt;* I don't love my fiance. I'm kind of deluding myself into thinking that I do love them but we're past that honeymoon stage so things may feel different. I'm being financially supported by them right now and I'm torn between doing the right thing and being selfish and hoping that maybe my feelings will change. They know I've had issues with feelings towards them and they assure me that it's okay. I feel like I'm using them. The thing is, they're one of only two people I talk to that I have things in common with. Right now it just feels like we're friends with benefits. I've been somewhat emotionally numb to people. I don't feel like I love my parents but I'd be sad if they died. I'm kind of hoping something will just change one day and I'll be hopelessly in love. Sometimes I think it's my depression preventing things. We're in a long term LDR if it matters. 
&gt;
&gt;* My teeth are disgusting yellow, cavity filled things that in the past few weeks have been starting to fall apart. I am embarrassed to smile. I'm getting work done but it seems hopeless when I see how much is still left to do and that it gets worse and not better.  
&gt;
&gt;* My moms cancer might not be gone. She had chemo and a mastectomy and a month or two after that now she says the area where she had the surgery is acting up again. Her other breast is apparently showing signs like the other did. No official news from the doctors but I'm still worried.
&gt;
&gt;* My grandpa died last December and while I had a good cry when I found out the news, aside from feeling a little sad every now and then I feel numb to it. I didn't go to the funeral because I was out of the country. 
&gt;
&gt;* I'm overweight and I'm sick and tired of looking and feeling this way. I'm so out of shape that I can't do simple things without being out of breath and sweating a lot and it's embarrassing.
&gt;* My cat is older now and he's pretty much the only thing keeping me going. I cry when I think that he might be gone at any time. I've had him since just after all of the bullshit happened in my life so he's been around for pretty much all of it.
&gt;* I don't take care of myself, my pets or where I live as well as I should. I'd rather just sleep all the time. Sometimes I do.
&gt;
&gt;* I keep losing interest in things that I used to like. I can't get enjoyment out of things for long. If I do, it's a temporary distraction.
&gt;
&gt;* I've been in foster care and many years down the road I'm still dealing with all that happened before, during and after.
&gt;
&gt;* I feel guilty over things that happened over 10 years ago.
&gt;
&gt;* I avoid unpleasant situations which has lead me to drop out of school more than once, lose financial aid I had from the government and more.
&gt;
&gt;* I don't really see or talk to many people on a daily basis. I feel pretty alone.
&gt;
&gt;* I feel like just giving up even more than I have and ending it sometimes. I'm too much of a chicken to do it and I know some people would be sad. I also don't believe in an afterlife so I don't want to just throw this life away. I still have some hopes and dreams although they seem unattainable most of the time.
&gt;
&gt;* I suffer from bad social anxiety.
&gt;

I lack motivation to change even though my health and well being are at serious risk. I'm tired of being sad but I don't do anything to change. I rarely go outside anymore. I've been tempted over the years to just give in to a crutch like pot or alcohol but my morals keep me from doing it. I don't want to be that dependable on something else. I'm also on medication so it's not a good idea. I just want an escape, and even though dreaming sometimes helps, I usually have nightmares.

I just feel like a hopelessly selfish person with little to offer and not much to gain. 

I'm sorry if this post isn't very articulate. I just typed it all out on a whim because I needed to tell somebody.
