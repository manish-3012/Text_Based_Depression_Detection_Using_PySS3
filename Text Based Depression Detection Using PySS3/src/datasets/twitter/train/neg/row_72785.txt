Being alive is exhausting.I have people I love so I must remain here, but goddamn sometimes I daydream about just killing myself. Imagine, suddenly I'd have no worries. I'd return to the nothingness like when before I was born.
I don't fit in anywhere. Something just doesn't seem right, I can't put my finger on it. Sometimes I can ignore my feelings, but other times they consume me out of nowhere almost.
Parts of this world are beautiful, but other parts are so ugly that it makes me wonder why we bother at all. I look forward to sleeping so I don't have to think about it. If only I could sleep forever.
