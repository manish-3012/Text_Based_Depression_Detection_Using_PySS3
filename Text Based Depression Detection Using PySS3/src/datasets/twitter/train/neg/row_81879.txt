I've always thought about it. I don't feel as scared.I cut myself again. Ive never done it to attempt suicide. I've thought of suicide for a long time. Honestly before I was a teenager.  But never thought I'd have the balls to do it with a knife. Always thought it was gonna be a gun. But the knife feels sharp and the thoughts of it sliding across my wrists are easy. Could I even do it here though?
