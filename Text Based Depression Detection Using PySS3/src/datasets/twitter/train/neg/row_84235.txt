Please just tell me to keep goingIâ€™m at a partial hospitalization program for eating disorders right now and because of my insurance, I havenâ€™t been able to receive treatment for the last three days. Iâ€™ve been having disassociative episodes, flashbacks, and more destructive urges lately. I had to argue with my family to go to the psych ward, to go to residential care, and then to come here. I may have to fight again to go to a different residential as recommended by my therapist but Iâ€™m so tired of fighting. Iâ€™m fighting so hard to stay alive but my family wants me to be magically better without actually getting treatment. If anyones reading this I would really appreciate just some words of encouragement. Hope everyoneâ€™s staying safe and sane.
