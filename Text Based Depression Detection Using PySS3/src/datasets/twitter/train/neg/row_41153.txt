I keep losing those I care aboutI donâ€™t know how to keep going. I... keep losing people that I care about. 

My cousin just died on Sunday, a man I thought was a friend... decided to throw me away, after trying to drive me away by hurting me. I let him throw me away. My only other friendships... are falling apart, and I feel so powerless to stop them. 

I have to move out of my home for the past couple years as well, in a global virus outbreak, where I canâ€™t even hold my sobbing family members, or have a funeral for my family. 

Iâ€™m... just so tired. Iâ€™m so tired of losing, and losing, and... losing. Iâ€™m so tired of trying. Of being thrown away. Of justifying my continued existence. 
Theyâ€™ll all leave me. Iâ€™ll... be alone. Why wait? 
Why... keep fighting...

Iâ€™m so tired. I just want to stop.
