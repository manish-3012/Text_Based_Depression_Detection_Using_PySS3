(F 16) Gonna end itMy whole life has been shit. My dad was an alcoholic, beating me almost everyday, my mom didn't give a fuck, I'm glad those fuckers died, my dad was drunk driving, he crashed and they both died, that's when I was 4. I was put in an orphanage until I was 6, I was adopted by good people. Age 6-10 was ok, but at 11, I was bullied by almost everyone, some of the things they called me are emo, fag, loser, I started cutting. At age 14 people saw my cuts, only insulting me more, I can't do this anymore, I'm gonna put the blade on my throat and let my worries fade away.

Edit: Thank you people of Reddit, you've helped a lot! Gonna keep living! Love you all!
