Nothing is even real anymoreNothing fucking matters so I don't know why I'm bothering dealing with this mundane shit everyday that makes me so miserable. I've gotten horribly fat and have been unemployed for a few months now and am just generally a huge piece of shit. My ex died because of the mess I caused, I'm known to be a home wrecking piece of shit and I just bring destruction to everything I am part of. My mother is disappointed in me and makes it known, I just don't have the balls to actually put a fucking gun to my head and end it. I intend to overdose and just be done with this shit because I cannot take one more fucking day of this goddamn bullshit.
