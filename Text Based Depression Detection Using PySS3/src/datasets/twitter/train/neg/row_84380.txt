I found a way out, and Iâ€™m taking it. I feel at peace.I finally have a peaceful way to go. Iâ€™m doing it tomorrow night, when my family is out. For the first time in a long time I feel at peace. Itâ€™s a relieving feeling, knowing that I wonâ€™t have to live with myself for much longer. 

What I hate about myself isnâ€™t something I can alter. Not without extensive plastic surgery, but I havenâ€™t got the money for that. I hate my face. Trust me, I realize how pathetic that sounds, but my appearance is the root of my depression. I tried so hard to accept myself, but Iâ€™ve been trapped in a vicious cycle of self-hate for years, and Iâ€™m exhausted. 

When I look in the mirror, I want to cry. I sit for hours in my room taking pictures of myself, thinking that maybe, if I get the angle right, or the lighting, Iâ€™ll see a beautiful girl when I turn the camera around. Iâ€™m always disappointed. 

My sister is extremely beautiful. She could drop everything and become a model this very second if she felt like it. I know itâ€™s shitty to be jealous, but I canâ€™t help it; I wish more than anything that I looked like my sister. 

I know that looks arenâ€™t always everything, but Iâ€™m a shy person, and I donâ€™t know how to talk to people. My personality is â€œquiet.â€ I repel people. Iâ€™ve done everything I possibly can to improve my face outside of surgery. Iâ€™m fit, Iâ€™m good with makeup, I put my best foot forward, but Iâ€™m still never good enough for my own standards. 

The most fucked up thing is that I know Iâ€™m not ugly. Iâ€™m average. People have told me that Iâ€™m not ugly. I should be grateful for having been born without any deformities or illnesses. I should be ok with being average; but I know that I wonâ€™t ever be able to accept myself. Iâ€™ll always compare myself to beautiful women and wonder why I couldnâ€™t have been born with a lovely face. It hurts so much, knowing that I can never love myself looking like this. But itâ€™s a fact that Iâ€™ve come to accept over years and years of feeling this way. So Iâ€™m not going to torture myself anymore. 

Iâ€™m aware of how pathetic this all sounds, but I had to get it off my chest, even if itâ€™s to a bunch of strangers. See you all in another life.
