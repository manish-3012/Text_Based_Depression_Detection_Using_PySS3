I donâ€™t want to but I think Iâ€™m getting closer to not being able to stop myself this timeI have really serious mental health issues, I was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder at the beginning of this year and that has been a roller coaster that I canâ€™t tell pretty much anyone about because the stigma about bpd is horrendous so I constantly feel alone. Everyone says Iâ€™ll never have stable or healthy relationships because people with bpd â€œcanâ€™tâ€ and that makes me want to die all by itself because I hate to be alone. I am just so tired and lonely and sad that at this point I canâ€™t get anything done. Iâ€™m taking a fifth year in college right now because I was hospitalized twice so I couldnâ€™t finish on time but now Iâ€™m failing all of my classes, all of my friends have moved away because they graduated, I think Iâ€™m letting my parents down so I havenâ€™t told them Iâ€™m doing so bad and come the end of this semester Iâ€™ll probably have failed out of college.
I donâ€™t want to be alive and have never felt as if Iâ€™d be sad or afraid to die, my only problem is that I donâ€™t want to hurt those that I live and also Iâ€™m terrified of an attempt not working. Itâ€™s so hard to continue living only for others though, only so theyâ€™re not hurt. Iâ€™m just so tired and I feel like I get closer everyday. Iâ€™ve been cutting like crazy again and basically running out of concealable space and every time I see my therapist something just seems to come over me where I feel great and canâ€™t remember to tell her everything bad thatâ€™s happening and then I leave and feel shameful that I couldnâ€™t tell the truth. I feel like a failure even at therapy because I canâ€™t tell her whatâ€™s going on. I donâ€™t know what to do.
