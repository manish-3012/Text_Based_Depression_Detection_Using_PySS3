Just need some help!I need help. I was out with my friend and we met a girl. The girl was more interested in me but my friend wanted more. It ended up in a discussion. Hated that situation. Well I stayed with her and he left. I messed up with  her. It was 3 or 4am and I just wanted to leave. Not getting laid but just leave. I went with her home. Stayed for an hour and left because it felt not right. I have depression, an anxiety disorder which is killing me. While I am sitting here my whole body is filled with anxiety. I cried. I cried because I said to myself that I am worth it. For one moment, this thought was louder than my negative thoughts. Thoughts that I messed up in life. Thoughts that I am a failure. One moment of less pain. 



But 10 minutes later I was back in this dark place in myself. Everything hurts. Tension in my face. Pain. Something I can't live with any longer. 



Swimming, running, nothing works to get that pain out. Nothing works. That's the moment when I just want to end it all. Never ever standing up again. But something in me still wants to live. It's a constant fight.
