Someone needs to explain to me right now what the point of living is.Its constant stress. I spend most of my waking hours getting ready for work, working, getting home from work. I could change it but where do I find the time and resources to go back to school? And what career do I even get into? Ive already tried with programming and Im incapable of that. And that sort of thing is what I wanted to do. I realize now that I really am too stupid to do the things I wanted to do. And I mean past tense. I'm well past the point of enjoying things anymore. Also ,most people are very frustrating to deal with. I get mad very easily with people and I usually just embarass myself. I deleted my old account out of embarrassment. I can't help it. I get so mad I just want to punch things and call People names. I hate people. I don't even get taken seriously when I stand up for myself. I wanted to fit in but I just get made fun of or taken advantage of. I try being more assertive, I get angry, nothing works. No one takes me seriously and everyone always treats me like Im stupid so I guess I must be. I'm in pain all the time. I don't have any faith that a therapist will help. I have no reason to believe they would. I just don't want to be here anymore. I'm tired. I hate it here.
