STOP giving a damn thought about what others think!First step of happiness: be an idiot (idiots and a lot more happier than smartasses) and stop giving a F about what everyone thinks about you. When it comes to your happiness and wellbeing, you don't owe anyone anything. You owe YOU, and that's it.

So forget about the rest, take a deep breathe, and focus on being the YOU you want to be, the one that would make you happy, hell do the stupid stuff you want to do (don't harm others please), and you'll see how being happy about yourself will boost confidence and start attracting a lot of people and positive things!

Been there done it. I am not happy but I am trying goddamn hard. It takes time and you may need to fake it at the beginning but step by step it becomes easier.
