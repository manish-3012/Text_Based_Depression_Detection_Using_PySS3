I want to die I am going to fail my GCSEs and my whole world is falling apartI'm done. I wanted to be a vet. I can't do it. I'm not fit for this world. I'm on antidepressants they helped but I'm fucked. My whole world is over. I can't do it. I'm planning to start cutting again, and lead up to kill myself.

 I'm going to drop out, I am fucked and my family are putting so much pressure on me. I called my mum a stupid bitch which I regret, but they kept pressuring me and I hit my boiling point. She said she doesn't care what I do, she gives up with me. 

My life is over.
