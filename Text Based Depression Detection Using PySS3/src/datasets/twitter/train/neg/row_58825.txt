This world doesnâ€™t deserve to have someone like me in it.I have thought long and hard about all of them:

-Mom: always nags me and tells me that itâ€™s not fair to pinpoint depression with childhood experiences because she â€œtried her hardestâ€. Well I did too, bitch, but look where I am now. I know the problem very well, she gave birth to me and I was too good for the world that she didnâ€™t even know how to handle me properly. 

-Dad: tried a tough love approach and always wanted me to push further I guess, but all he did was send off vibes that all my work wasnâ€™t good enough. Iâ€™ve won honorary school awards, I got into my high schoolâ€™s infamous engineering program, Iâ€™m an A list honors student, and teachers see me as a â€œgood boyâ€, but all my dad could say is â€œeh, you can go further than that.â€ Oh yeah, he also said â€œdepression and anxiety is all in oneâ€™s head, just get out there and find the cure to real illnesses like cancer!â€ Fuck him. Isnâ€™t obvious to him that Iâ€™m better than he couldâ€™ve ever been when he was my age? Iâ€™m above him on a completely different level, so why the hell is he to talk down to me. 

-Younger Brother: I didnâ€™t always get along with him, but Iâ€™ve started to like his company in recent years. He just feels like some acquaintance. He couldnâ€™t understand how much better I am, and itâ€™s kinda sad that even though weâ€™re brothers, Iâ€™m clearly nothing like an average boy like him. 

-Other Relatives: Donâ€™t care about them, donâ€™t see them often. However my grandma was surely someone to talk to, I guess she can somewhat comprehend how superior I am. 

-School Person 1: I give him a good rank in my books, he clearly sees me in a respectful light. Though heâ€™s not nearly close to me when it comes to education, I can still say thatâ€™s heâ€™s exceptionally smart. Heâ€™d understand whyâ€™d I want to leave such a filthy Earth, and he probably wonâ€™t be sad if I died, but even if he did I really donâ€™t care. 

-School Person 2: He canâ€™t seems to realize who I am compared to him. And compared to School Person 1 heâ€™s a dumbass, but heâ€™s still in the so called â€œfriend groupâ€ and he probably wouldnâ€™t care if I died. On the other hand heâ€™s loaded and has a lot of cash that he spends on us without expecting us to pay him back the debt, so thatâ€™s respectable. 

-School Person 3: Sheâ€™s bitchy, and tries to challenge me, but itâ€™s so blatantly obvious that Iâ€™m always better. She has some wit, sheâ€™s fairly athletic, and is probably a fucking dyke. There are lots of other â€œschool peopleâ€, but they arenâ€™t worth speaking about, itâ€™s just those 3 that I thought of the most. 

-Teachers: There just easy to walk over. I can talk down to whoever I want, but then put on a respectable act whenever theyâ€™re around and they just dote on me. 

-House Pets: My dog and cat wonâ€™t miss me because they are fucking animals. I donâ€™t even know why people think about how their pets feel when they consider suicide. 

-Therapist: My parents got me a therapist after I went to a mental clinic and got diagnosed with NPD, and possibly ASPD, and she can go fuck herself. Thereâ€™s no point for me to go to a trash therapist. 

-A Person I Somehow Know: I donâ€™t even remember how I first met her, but she complicates things a lot. She treats me like Iâ€™m the best person in the whole world, and I am, I know that already, but something about being her favorite person makes me question my superiority. Everyone should realize how great I am, but they donâ€™t, but she does and it makes me feel something and Iâ€™m not sure I like it. I generally donâ€™t feel things, I usually feel some rushes of excitement when something interesting happens, but I get bored pretty quickly. Sheâ€™s a complete dumbass, she canâ€™t read any normal books without getting bored easily so she reads nothing but manga and graphic novels, sheâ€™s an ok baker, she breaks the stereotype that Asians should be decent at math, and an over all B list student. I donâ€™t know why I even bother to know all this stuff about her. She barely has any friends so she just follows me around everywhere, sheâ€™s obviously in love with me, sheâ€™s also probably has depression, and she used to get bullied a lot. People would just tease her in front of everyone else and it was pretty amusing to see her get laughed at, however it kept happening and the dumbass teachers wouldnâ€™t do anything about it, even if sheâ€™d cry about her feelings getting hurt. At some point I got tired of hearing her cry, so I told the group of boys who usually pick on her to piss off. They backed off pretty easily and ever since then they just ignore her. There were quiet a few girls who had crushes on me, but Iâ€™m Asexual and have no interest in relationships with such plain looking annoying bitches. However my girl makes me feel differently and I donâ€™t like it. She told me she doesnâ€™t care about sexual or romantic relationships and is happy to be by me. Still, I donâ€™t feel the same and I shouldnâ€™t care, but I do find amusement in hugging her and making her blush. She is an art student and I guess sheâ€™s ok at painting, so I complemented her artwork and she started crying because â€œit made her so happy that the inspiration for her art work actually likes itâ€. She deals with suicidal thoughts and I found myself talking her out of once. Itâ€™ll be difficult because I want her to live but if I commit suicide then sheâ€™ll follow my actions. But when I do actually take my own life, sheâ€™ll be the only one Iâ€™ll write a suicide letter to. No one else deserves to have my last words, so it will just be her. I think the reason why I seem to care for her is because she actually treats me the way I should be treated, but I think Iâ€™m starting to hate her because she fucks my brain and makes it harder for me to want to commit suicide.

I just want to know what to do, Iâ€™m on a throwaway account so I donâ€™t embarrass myself if someone I know finds out and realizes someone great like me is on a forum like this.
