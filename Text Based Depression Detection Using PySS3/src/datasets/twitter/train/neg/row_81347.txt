My cousin committed suicide today..She was a year younger than me.. She has a five year old daughter.. I just got out of the psych ward of the hospital myself last week... I just found out I have bipolar disorder.. She did it over a break up..  I almost did over a break up, too.... I feel like I should have reached out... I had no idea we were going through the same kind of thing..  I had no idea. I knew she had depression issues, but I never thought that she would even be suicidal.

She was so pretty and so talented..  She had so much going for her.. So much that I don't have.. And I really don't even know what to do. I've never even lost someone this close to me, especially from suicide..

I always thought if someone in the family was going to finally kill themselves, it would be me.. I guess it's genetic.. I've tried so many times before myself, and now I hear that she's been trying for years too.. And neither of us knew about the other one..  I'm just in complete shock.
