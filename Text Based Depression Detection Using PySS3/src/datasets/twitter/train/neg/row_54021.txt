The more I think about it... life just sucks.. for me.Iâ€™m 18 years old and Iâ€™m just really lost with what to do with my life and seems easier to just end it.

I have a girlfriend that weâ€™ve been together for a year and I really do love her. 

Iâ€™m currently in college. Just taking one class this term but Iâ€™m having such a hard time trying to commit to finishing it. I suck at school. I barely made it past high school. Today I have to register for the winter term and itâ€™s just pushing me over and I donâ€™t think I can do it anymore. 

I donâ€™t know how Iâ€™m gonna be successful without college. How am I supposed to get a good job to eventually support a family when Iâ€™m older. It just seems so much easier to end it all for myself. 

I just canâ€™t see the point in life anymore if I canâ€™t solve this problem. Everyone else around me seems fine while Iâ€™m just stuck in the back trying to catch up and failing endlessly.
