I know I have so much to live for. That's what makes it worse.I dont know how to start this. I dont know if this is the right place for me. I dont think I'll kill myself. I can't. As I write this, I have my toddler asleep on my chest. My kindergartner is asleep in the next room. My husband just left for work. But I feel so irreparably broken. I just want it to stop. 

I'm getting help. Im medicated. It isn't enough. Im afraid to tell my doctor it isn't enough because we're running out of pills to try. Im afraid I'm too broken. 

I have a plan. I've had a plan. It's like a fantasy vacation I play out in my head. I go to the beach. I leave my keys and my phone in my shoes on the sand. I take all the pills I have left. And I swim. I swim out as far as I can. I fall asleep. I go under. No one has to find me or clean up after me. 

I'm really trying. But everytime I feel like I'm doing ok something knocks me down again. I so tired. Just so completely tired. I keep throwing things at this hole in my chest but I can't fill it. The medication isn't working. The self harm burns on my leg aren't working. My family who loves me so fucking much isn't working. What the fuck is wrong with me?

I desperately want to be ok. I want to be happy. I want to be ok. But swimming out to fall asleep feels like the only way.
