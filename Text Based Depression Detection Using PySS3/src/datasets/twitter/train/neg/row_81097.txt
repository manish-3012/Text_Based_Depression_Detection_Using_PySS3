OkaySo this is basically me trying to tell everyone why this should be the end for me. My name is Ryan. I'm 18 and living in the UK. I'm not madly in love with any girls, I'm not broken hearted and I'm not scared. I'm lonely. I have friends but their company doesn't necessarily make me feel OK in myself and my surroundings. I dropped out of college with no qualifications other than my GCSE's. I have no job, no aims and nothing to show for the 18 years I have walked the earth. I understand there is so much to live for but I always find myself thinking that maybe these things that everyone sees as reasons for living just aren't reasons that work for me. I am too under qualified to get any jobs and I can't join the army due to my past suicide attempt. There is nothing for me in this world.

Believe me when I say I have tried to find methods of occupying myself or getting a living. I have a couple hobbies (BMXing and Computer Building) but still I find myself bored. I was looking for apprenticeships at the end of 2014 but never managed to find one which did nothing but knock my confidence right down to an all time low. I just feel that maybe ending it is the only way I should and could go in this world.

Goodbye.
