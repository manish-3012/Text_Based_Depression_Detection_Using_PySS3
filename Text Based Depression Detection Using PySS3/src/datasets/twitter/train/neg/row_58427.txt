I just donâ€™t knowThree kids wife behind on bills and mortgage and things about to be turned off. I have a never ending pile of shit to do and can not find it to do anything. 
Spending so much time thinking things through only to make a mistake and Fuck something up. 
Run a business and itâ€™s the first year itâ€™s rough. Wasnâ€™t more than I thought I just assumed Iâ€™d had more help. I donâ€™t even know why I am writing thing because it doesnâ€™t matter. I cry whenever I look at my kids faces. I sat in my van for three hours last night not wanting to go home before they went to sleep. I canâ€™t avoid them. 
I want to do better but everything is too overwhelming. I have pleaded for Help but have not been able to get my wife to understand. I am unable to fix or situation and am failing them in so many ways.
