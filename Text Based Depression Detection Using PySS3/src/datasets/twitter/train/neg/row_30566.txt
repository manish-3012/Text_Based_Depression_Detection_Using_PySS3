Tonight is the night I end it all. Nothing left and no one to care.I've lost everything, no family, no friends, no job, no life. I've got nothing left to live for and no one to go on caring for. I've made up my mind and this is the end. I needed to say this somewhere because no one will ever find anything I'd write on paper.
