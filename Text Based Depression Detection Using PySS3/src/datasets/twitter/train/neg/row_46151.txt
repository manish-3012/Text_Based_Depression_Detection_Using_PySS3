Not to that point yet but it is climbing...Made a new throwaway and I guess whenever I need to talk to someone/all of reddit, Ill just pop onto here. So on to the actual reason why I'm typing. My ap exam is tomorrow and I just can't gain any motivation to study. On top of all that, I have a crapload of hw to finish up. I don't want to stay up late tonight to finish it all because then I will be tired for my exam later tomorrow. The feeling of dread is slowly creeping its way back into my head but I know that after tomorrow, all I have to do is hw then wait till friday to pass and I am done with highschool for the rest of my entire fucking life. Also getting a laptop which is awesome but I am terrified of taking the exam. I really have no idea what to expect from it as it is my first time taking an AP exam. Super scared and have no clue what to do.
