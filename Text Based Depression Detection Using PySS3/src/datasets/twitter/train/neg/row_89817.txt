Why should I stay here?I've been fighting my mind for as long as I can remember. But I have nothing to complain about, none of my emotions make sense, they're fake, I don't understand why they seem so real. The only reason I'm still here is because of people close to be because suicide is "selfish" but isn't it selfish for other people to try to keep me here too? It's MY life and I shouldn't have to stay alive because someone else wants me to but I can't bring myself to do it until there's no one left close to me. I can't keep fighting this anymore. I cause more damage now that I will when I'm dead. I'll quickly be forgotten and everyone who "cares" can move on without me pulling then down. It's ideal for everyone.
