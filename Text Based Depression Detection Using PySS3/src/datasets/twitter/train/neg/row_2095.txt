Negativity taking over my life, how do I become more positive?Everything I say and think is negative. I've become very bad company, even for myself. I try not to but it's completely consumed me. 

I've gotten to a point where my future isn't looking good, I've been going down a deep dark hole for about half a decade now, maybe longer I have no sense of time anymore. I'm completely isolated from people, no friends, no real job, no motivation to pull it all together and when I force myself I get overwhelmed and breakdown. No one around understands and I feel like I'd be doing everyone a favour by just ending it. 

I've been abused as a child and a lot of old wounds have been opening up. I fucking hate when people tell me to just "forgive and forget", I want to heal but that doesn't mean I have to forgive or forgot. I want to move on and achieve some of my goals in life but I can't do that the way I am now.

Is there any advice out there on how to practice being more positive? 

I don't want die but my mind keeps going there. I honestly have nothing worth living for and I'm tired of suffering. The only way out is it end it or pull myself together enough to make something worth living for.
