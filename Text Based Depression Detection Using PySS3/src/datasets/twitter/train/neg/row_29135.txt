I can't take this anymore.

Hello everyone,I'm new here and might not get everything correct.
I'm Henry,a 15-yearold male from Finland.
And,I'm depressed.
I've been "bullied" mentally,physically and verbally for many years.This,has given me low self-esteem,depression,suicidal thoughts,the list goes on.


I've been to therapy,which if anything,made things worse.When others heard about it,they just got another reason to insult me.
I've attempted suicide twice.
It's more and less "I don't want to die,but I don't want to live either"
I've lost my will of living.
I just feel worthless,useless, like a waste of space.
I do have one hobby,football.Even then,when I feel like I achieved something,I get thrown back to ground level.It hurts.
I've once,only once,got to the point of self-harm,and when it happened,I did a slit to my right leg in the shape of an hourglass,as I was going to attempt suicide later that day.


It doesn't help being lonely either.
I have some "friends",friends in quotes as one day they might be best friends,the next day practically tell me to go kill myself.

I can't take this anymore.I need somebody to listen.

With tears,Henry.
