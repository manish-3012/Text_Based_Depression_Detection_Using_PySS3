am I on the path to bring suicidal?Shit hasnt been going well lately. Not horrible but not good. I was planning on going shopping for a self defense gun this week but cant get tbe idea of...you know.

I dont think I would ever do it. But I do worry that I might be able to flip and say â€œfuck itâ€. Is this normal or is this darker than I think it is. In my 40â€™s. Have a great chick. Own my home. I dont know why the negative bs pops in my head. And when something shitty happens, even if not bad at all I think of eating a .38!! wtf! Is this what depression is like? Am I on a bad path?
