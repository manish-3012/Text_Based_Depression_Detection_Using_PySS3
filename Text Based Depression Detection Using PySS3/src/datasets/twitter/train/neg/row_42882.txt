Worst it's ever beenI was raised with abusive parents. 
As a result, I have PTSD and that makes all social relationships incredibly difficult.

I'm homeless, sponging off of the only people who care enough to not let me live with abuse or in a homeless shelter. 

I am super stupid. Not kidding. I'm an idiot.

I have no hobbies, I have no one that actually cares about me (beyond guilt), and I have no money or prospects at all.

The real thing that gets me though, is that I have no one on my side. 
At all. 
No one cares, and the people who say they care hurt me, no matter what I do or say. 

I could kill myself right now, and a total of 3 people would be upset for a while, and then get on with their lives.

I'm annoying, and I have nothing to offer, no hope.
No one cares. I don't blame them. I just need to be gone, nothing dramatic, nothing obscene. 
I don't want it to be tragic. It would be a lie.

There is no right choice for me to make. 
I can't be right, I can't be good. 
Everything I do, no matter what, I will always be wrong and I will always be unlikable. 
And that's my own problem, no one elses. 
It doesn't get better, I've been waiting and waiting and it's a waste. I'm just making things worse. 

I need to be gone.
