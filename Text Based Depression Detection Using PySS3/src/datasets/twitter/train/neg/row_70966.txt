I took 28 aspirin pills and 16 anadin Wednesday night, Thursday I felt shit, very sleepy, felt sick, usual, lost my hearing a little bit but it all went back to normal. Friday, still had issues with tinnitus and feeling sick but again, went back to normal, I did overdose again Friday on 8 anadin&amp; 4 paracetamol but was fine. Today I took 28 aspirin tablets and just a bit of bad heart burn but thatâ€™s it, no other reaction. Why? I should be throwing up or in pain or dead. Iâ€™m 20, female.
