I don't know where to go.Hi, not sure if I'm capable of letting out a backstory on my situation right now. I am not searching or consolation, but I am seeking advice/help. For the longest time I was feeling aggressively suicidal (for the past two years in fact). But for the past 60 days I have not been particulary suicidal (for instance I have held knives for hours in the past, all of that has stopped now), yet I find myself deeply depressed. I'm unable to see anything bright in my life, I have asked on SW/reddit (which I must say in many ways have saved my life. To all of you out there who has been of support to me, I thank you). Through the assistance of people on SW I think, or rather I know for a fact that I am depressed. I've always just blamed myself in the past for these feelings, telling myself it's just because I'm weak. I think that I've managed to look past that horrid understanding of myself. Someone even told me that depression is not even part of me (Have I gone through all of these years thinking that this is just who I am...). To the person that told me that, thank you. In fact you are the only reason I am typing this out right now (pushed me over, helped me realize my own situation). Enough ranting, what I wanted help with is how am I supposed to get in contact with someone that can help me? I'm really unsure where to look, and I have no idea how to approach this (doing something knew always makes me crumble). If you can be as elaborate as possible that would be nice, like if you've experienced the conversation etc. Could you tell me how it went, what I need to be vary of. Most importantly I want guidance about where to look for help. Not sure if this is important, but I've never gotten any help before (I haven't even told my parents). There is 1 person in know in person that knows. Thanks for the help in advance. (I think I might become suicidal again when the rush of tests begin.) Please help me.
