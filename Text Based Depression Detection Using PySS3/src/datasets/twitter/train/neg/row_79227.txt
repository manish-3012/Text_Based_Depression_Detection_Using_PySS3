I feel lost.I'm 29 living with my parents. Have been for three years now. I can't seem to move forward. They had moved me home because I was sucidal and drinking a lot. Also I'm bi polar. Things will be going okay for awhile. Not drinking but not really do anything to better my life. Then I'll hit a point get really down and drink and cause chaos for my family. I don't hurt anyone physically but emotionally. Two days ago I got black out drunk and walked to my step grandmothers house and yelled at her for being mean to my stepdad. He was so embarrassed and angry. They let the police take me to hospital. The last few days has been nothing but my parents telling me they don't feel safe in their own house. That my stepdad is a business man and that he's been asked what happened that night. He so embarrassed. This is the first time it's been this public. But I've really had enough of hurting them. I've had enough of it all. The lack of emotion I feel sometimes and them getting upset at me for not being responsive. my mind is a mess. I'm tired of this fucking cycle of just being, then excited then immediately crash down.
