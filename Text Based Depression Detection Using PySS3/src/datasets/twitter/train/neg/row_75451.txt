Its always been my faultHello, in the past I never really had someone to talk to, and even now its still hard to talk to people about my problems, so instead I'll just post about it to relieve a sort of burden that has been eating me up for the past years, before i was born both my parents had their own families, my mom with 2 sons and my dad with 3 children, though my mom and dads family shattered and they met and had me 1 year later. the 3 of us moved to a different place because of my fathers work, and after such my mother and father would fight every day resulting in my father beating my mother multiple times, and i knew that if it wasn't for me my mother would have dumped him since they aren't married (my father is still married to another woman though they can't separate due to it being too expensive), and that filled me with deep regret knowing that my mother had abandoned her two children for me just to be beaten by my dad, everyday I would be reminded by these past memories because of my mothers cuts in her wrists, at school i was bullied lots for my appearance and to top it off I had a a heart condition that made me fall into deep depression, and when I did tell my mother about it, the only thing that changed was that every time we finished up and argument she would yell and accuse me that afterwards i would hurt myself again in an angry manner, all of this happened by the time I turned age 7, I prayed and prayed for my life to get better, and in some resorts it did, my dad stopped beating my mom and I started to have good friends that are there for me, but no matter what I did to try to forget i just couldn't, I'm 15 now and even If I think about my friends, and how both my mother and father didn't abandon me i still can't help but feel like if i hadn't existed my family's problems would have not happened. I always felt like shit and a useless individual but I never tell anyone about it so no one knows I'm like this. Sorry for making it too long its just that I wanted to put this out there, thank you for reading it this far tho, makes me feel a little better.
