My depression is getting worseFor years now I have wanted to kill myself and I still don't know why but it's getting scary and im scared to exist. You know the depression symptoms right? Search on Google if you dont tho. My depression is all the symptoms on steroids but this one part is driving me insane. My hallucinations. I hallucinate things that were traumatic like when someone stole my identity but now it's scary. I see myself hanging from a noose EVERYWHERE I GO and I see people crowding around me telling me to kill myself and when that happens I break down. I can never take that. Even with friends I just crawl up and cry and scream. That does not help with everything else. Right now I'm in f****ing middle school and someone is stalking me which ABSOLUTELY does not help with the hallucinations. I practice suicide every other day just to get used to it. To normalize it. To prepare. I have 2 reputations. 1. The depressed kid that you should stay away from because he's probably going to shoot up a school. Or he's the joker. I'll explain the joker. Because I have depression my version is that happiness is dull and short. When I want to laugh I can't and I don't want to be a mean person so I want to laugh but I have bad sound control so I just scream laughing followed by a cough cause I've been sick for like 4 months, then partner that with my random crying coughing and sometimes laughter and you get the joker. Time to talk about the stalker. I don't like her but she doesn't care. She somehow weasled her way into all my friends group between all periods and she tries getting as close to me as possible. She stares at me and touches me at every opportunity. But I can't tell the principal cause my friends would hate me and I can't tell my friends cause they know I'm going insane. I can't handle another day. I'm terrified of my own brain and when you're scared to exist. You might have a problem.
