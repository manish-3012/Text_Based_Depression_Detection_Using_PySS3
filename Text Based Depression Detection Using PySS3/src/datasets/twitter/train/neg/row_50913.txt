I'm still bleedingI'm still bleeding and I don't know where the cut came from. 

No one can see it. It's not actually a cut on my body, but rather inside me. It bleeds and bleeds and bleeds. It swells up my body where I can't move in the morning. It leaks through my eyes and it clogs my throat, to the point where I'm sure I cannot cry for help. 

It hurts so much. Every day. No good doctor can give me a bandage strong enough to hold it back. Everyday I wonder how other people can do it.... how they can be happy and smile and laugh the way they do? How they can have friends who love them? How they can have a family to support them in every which way that exists? How can they breathe without thinking about it? Where is THEIR cut? Where are THEIR tears? 

I hate everything I am and it's honestly not even that bad. I just give up. I hate constantly feeling dead when I'm still breathing. I'm a mumbling, walking corpse. I get headaches. I just want to stay in bed forever. I'm so tired, so sleepy. It's even hard to breath, because at this point I have to remind myself to do so. 

...I can't do this anymore. I don't know what to do.
