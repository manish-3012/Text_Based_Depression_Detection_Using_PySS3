I can't keep goingI've lived with depression for a long time. I did saw it getting better, I can't deny that, but it was never enough to make me believe live was something whort having. 

So for more than six months I lived not to seek happiness, not to accomplish goals or dreams, but to avoid grief for my family and friends. But  I am afraid life is a burden to heavy for me to carry.
