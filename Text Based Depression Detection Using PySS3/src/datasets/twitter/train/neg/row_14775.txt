I've Made the Decision to End My LifeJust need to get this off my chest. Today, I officially made the decision to kill myself, which will most likely happen later next month. The only things keeping me from doing it now are 1) I want to get my personal affairs in order and 2) I'm visiting my family very soon and may as well see them one last time before I go. The funny thing is my life isn't even that bad. But as cheesy as it sounds, death is waiting for me at my doorstep, and I don't think there's any getting around it. That's all I want to say right now. Just needed an avenue to release some of my post-decision musings.
