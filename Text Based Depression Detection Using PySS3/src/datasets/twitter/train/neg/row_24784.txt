Just want someone to talk toMost of the time I'm ok, but sometimes I become suicidal again. I'm not at immediate risk but it's so horrible knowing that I can want to die or want to hurt myself. I wish I never thought that. I wish those thoughts never occurred to me.

Sorry if I'm rambling a bit. Does anyone know of ways to relieve the want to hurt yourself? I though of screaming into a pillow - anyone else got any more ideas? 

My parents don't know that I want to die sometimes - they only know that I have been depressed and still get low sometimes. Any one else in the same situation? Just looking for someone to chat to I guess.

Thank you.
