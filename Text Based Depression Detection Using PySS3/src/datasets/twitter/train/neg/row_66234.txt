It's like suicide is always lurking aroundMost of my friends have some kind of mental illness, depression being almost a default, and myself included. And there's always an unspoken tension when someone doesn't respond for too long, or when they disappear from the internet or when they joke about killing themselves. And, being suicidal myself, I never know how to react. I never know what to say, because it's not like it would change their minds (I know it wouldn't change mine but I tend to keep that stuff to myself not to trigger them more) thing is... it's so fucking tiring. I feel guilty for the few times when depression doesn't have that grip around my neck, like it's unfair for me to feel any slight happiness when my friends aren't as fine. It's just fucking exhausting to never know what's gonna happen next, and it almost feels unfair when they just drip their issues on me when I try my best not to do the same
