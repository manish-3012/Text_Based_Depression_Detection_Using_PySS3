I think im doing it in the next few hoursI have problems going to school for 4/5 years now and it has gotten worse every year. I finished my last school 2 months ago and am now in a new one, which started 2 weeks ago. I was there only on the first day. Its ruining my life but i just cant get myself to go. Even though i know its not hard to just sit there for 5 hours a day i just cant do it. I want to be able to go so badly but i cant no matter what. So school starts in an hour and if i skip again today my mom will send me to a psychiatrist. Fuck it i dont even have the time right now to write all this shit im just gonna hang myself as soon as she goes to work i guess
