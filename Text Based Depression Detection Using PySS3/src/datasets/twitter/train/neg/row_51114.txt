Diagnosed This week I got officially diagnosed from a psychiatrist and prescribed me antidepressants. 


 I'm so happy to know that I'm not faking it for attention or anything, and glad I'll be getting the help I need.

  It's been so long since I've been happy I'm eager to see the results. 

 I may be having some side effects, I'm really dizzy and my balance is off but hopefully this will work!
