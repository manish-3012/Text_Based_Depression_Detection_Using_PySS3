Maybe if I attempt and fail, it will cure me of my suicidal ideationI've felt suicidal since I was 10, and now I'm 19. Probably like most people on here, I don't really want to die, I want a happy life! but I feel like my life is such a nightmare it is the only way out. My I know I'm young but my life is such a wreck and I would rather die now than prolong my suffering for another decade or too. My depression and anxiety coupled with me about to become a college dropout makes it feels inevitable. When I was 14 I ate a weed brownie and had a horrible reaction/pretty much overdosed, and started hallucinating that I was in another dimension and I seriously thought I had died. At the time I had been struggling with suicidal thoughts for a few years and the feeling that I had died was the most terrifying thing I have ever felt. I quickly realized I hadn't and promised myself I would never try to kill myself. I guess it is akin to the people who survived jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge and said they felt intense regret while falling. Of course, things have gotten much worse in my life and I feel like I need to be close to death again to FINALLY cure myself. I have a method that might kill me, might not. It's like Russian Roulette. My sister uses a very strong sleeping medication (stronger than Ambien, won't go into details) that I know for sure could kill me or put me in a coma. I think that if it actually killed me though, she would blame herself for inadvertently "providing" it and would probably live with guilt on top of the loss of her sister. I know everything I just wrote makes me sound insane but it's probably because I am.
