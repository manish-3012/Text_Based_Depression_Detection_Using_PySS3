I'm coming more often to this sub lately...Because I feel like shit and because of a reason I don't know, I'm waiting until the end of the year to kill myself. At the moment I'm not living a real life right now. Just go to work, go home, playing video games, eat, sleep and repeat... over and over again because I don't have any motivation for anything else...

Maybe it's getting more often because I want to help people before I'm done. You shouldn't end up like me. Worthless, pointless. I know people would normally tell now, no one is worthless or anything like that but please don't do that.
