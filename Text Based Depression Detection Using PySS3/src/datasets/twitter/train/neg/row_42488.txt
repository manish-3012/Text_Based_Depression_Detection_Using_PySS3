I don't think i can keep goingI turned 14 today, yay...
But i thought of ending it all for a while now and i just can't. Waking up in the morning i think maybe i'll just swallow enough pills to just drift off.

I don't know i've also been thinking about just drinking enough to go as painlessly as possible.... Practicaly nobody cares about me except my family but that's it. I can't tell them because i'm scared. I once told some people at school about it and they asked "are you going to kill yourself" but not in a concerned way, as in excited. There is an odd peace to it knowing you have an exit all the time. 

Nobody cares about me, i can just end it and nobody would notice. I have no reason to wake up in the morning.
