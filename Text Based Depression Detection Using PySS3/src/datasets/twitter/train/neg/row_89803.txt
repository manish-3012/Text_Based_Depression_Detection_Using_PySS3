Friend needs helpI am writing for a friend who lives in the US. We just met online playing games and got to know each other.

I think his financial difficulties plus having no friends to hang out with irl is making him depressed. Once he said, "it's hard to have a gf when you're broke and have no car, etc". He isn't a bum or bad looking but he self\-deprecate. It's hard to meet people once you're out of school and it doesn't help having an introvert personality. In the past, he mentioned he did some psychedelic drugs and cut himself. Now he just drink/smoke and complain about feeling stuck and being lonely. Recently, he told me he put a gun in his mouth and almost did it. Before this, he was awake for 48 hours and drinking. I asked him if he can get rid of the gun and try to get some sleep after work but I didn't get any response yet.

I guess I just want to ask if you have any other ideas what I can do for him other than just talk? He doesn't listen to me and I don't want to act like nothing happened. I think he is too stubborn to get professional help but I can ask him to try. It is much better for him to have someone to talk to in person. Where to start, who to call? Suicide prevention hotline, support groups?

I made this account just for this purpose and I'm new to Reddit. Thank you for your time and help!
