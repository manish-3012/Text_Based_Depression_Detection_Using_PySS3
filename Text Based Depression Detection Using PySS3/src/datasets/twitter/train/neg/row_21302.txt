Soundboarding Before I LeaveThe most important aspect of my life has crumbled and I just don't think I can pick up the pieces. My partner excused me of raping him because I did not tell him to stop touching me after we got both got high. We haven't actually broken up yet but I think he is going to leave me. I was engaged to him and that seems to be off now, I think. I just can't live with myself like this. How am I supposed to keep going if I hurt the most important person in my life. I just feel I don't deserve to walk the same Earth as him anymore. I don't know what to do with the pain I'm feeling, and I feel like ending it is my best option. I have been actively suicidal for 13 days now (split in two halfs, I had one good day) so I feel like the feeling won't let up. I'm just nervous because I'm scared for the person who will find my worthless body. I live in a city so it's hard to find enough privacy to just disappear. I don't really wnat to die, but I feel like its the only way this pain will go away.
