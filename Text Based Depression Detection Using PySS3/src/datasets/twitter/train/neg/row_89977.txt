Not sure if trying is worth it anymoreI've been trying to get my life sorted out but it never works out and ultimately I always fail. It's 6 months into the year and I haven't achieved anything. Time just passes by and nothing ever changes. I'm a high school drop out, 2 time tafe course drop out and the only job I've ever done was being a cashier for a year when I was 15, and I'm 20 now. I have no real skills or ambitions. I've been thinking about doing another tafe course starting mid year but I'm honestly not sure if it's even something worth trying. I know I'm probably just going to drop out again. 
Most of my friends either have left me or have become very distant. I'm not close to many of my family members. There is no one here. I could just dissapear and nobody would notice or care for my absence. I don't know what to do. Killing myself seems like the only rational option here. It seems like the kindest thing I can do for everyone around me. I'm never going to get better, I keep thinking tomorrow will be better! next week will be better! next year will be better! But it never is, if anything everything is getting worse because I'm progressively becoming more and more isolated.
I genuinely just don't know what else I can do except die.
