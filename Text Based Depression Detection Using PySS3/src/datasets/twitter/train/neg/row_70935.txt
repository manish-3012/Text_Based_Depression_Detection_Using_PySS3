GoodbyeHopefully, this is my last post. I'm not posting this for attention or pity, it's merely to show I was here, I was a person. 

Right now nothing and everything hurts at the same time. I can't breathe, I can't stop crying. Why am I this weak, it's a disgrace to humankind. 

I can't take this anymore. I'm sorry to all the people I love, even If the love was not returned. 

Thanks for the memories life. Goodbye.
