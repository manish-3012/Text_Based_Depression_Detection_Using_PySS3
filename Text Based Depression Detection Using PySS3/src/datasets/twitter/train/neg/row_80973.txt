I'm done.It's this one suicide pact keeping me alive at the moment. It's sad; only fourteen years old and ready to off myself. To be honest, if my best friend weren't MIA at the moment, and I didn't want him to come back and realize I've killed myself, it would've been done by now. Parents are refusing to help me about my depression, and I'm honestly just... I'm fucking done.
