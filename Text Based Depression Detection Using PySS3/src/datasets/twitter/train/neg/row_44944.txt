ByeI've thought this over several times. I feel this is my only option. I can't pay penance for all that I have done wrong. Now, I am empty and void of any happiness. In all honesty, it's a pity that it has come to this. While I am sorry I will bring pain to those around me, this is what's best. I will soon be free of suffering.
