I'm worried that my girlfriend is going to kill herself.Were both 16, been going out about 4 months. She was in my house last week when I noticed scars on her upper arm, I played it off but called her that night to talk about it.

What I gathered is her mother has depression and she sometimes has these freak attacks, from what I know she doesn't hurt her but she does scare her and i hate that, she also has 2 younger brothers and a step dad living in the house. The scars looked old so I wasn't too worried. 

Yesterday she hadn't text me from 4pm to 9pm so I knew something was up, I finally got it out of her, her mother had one of these freak attacks and she went into her bedroom and tried to OD.
Her mother came in in hysterics saying she's gonna call the police and all that.

I spent the whole night crying but she assured me she wasn't in the right mindset and that she won't do it again, I also asked out of interest when the last time she cut was and she said last week but it was the first time in a year. 
I love her with everything I have in me and I'm just afraid that one day I will get a call telling me she passed.

Also to note her real dad killed himself when she was 18 months, and she's going to Counselling for that.
