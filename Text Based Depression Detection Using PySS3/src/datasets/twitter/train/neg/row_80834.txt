I want to scream at them to let me goI lost access to one of my essential medications a week ago, and I feel just like I did before I was taking it: desperate to die.


I've been in bed for a week now. 
Unable to focus, I can't do anything.
I can't drive without that medication, I can't function, my brain is dulled.


I have ceased to be a functional human being - I can barely write anymore, my brain feels too static.


Basically, I feel like I'm on psychological life support, and praying for death. 


But people keep begging me to stay, even though I am MISERABLE and LOSING MY MIND.


And I am beginning to bitterly resent and hate every single one of them.


My boyfriend cries and cries when I tell him how I feel, and how I DESPERATELY just want to go so I can feel some sort of RELIEF.


Before, I was sympathetic, and had the resolve to try harder. Now, I am bitter, resentful, and I find his pleas to keep my miserable self alive not only selfish, but pathetic. I'm breaking up with him today, cause I can't live like this, and this is unhealthy and unfair towards him. 



It's not just him, though - my family too. My loved ones. And I get it, death of a loved one is hard and naturally wants to be avoided. But I can't DO THIS ANYMORE, and I feel like I'm being forced to.


Why are people so fucking selfish? 
They cut your lifeline, but then beg you to stay. 
It's cruel.


Sorry for the rant, I am just exhausted. 

TLDR: I want to die, but people keep begging me to live, and I am beginning to resent/hate them for it.

EDIT: Forgot TLDR, minor grammar edits.
