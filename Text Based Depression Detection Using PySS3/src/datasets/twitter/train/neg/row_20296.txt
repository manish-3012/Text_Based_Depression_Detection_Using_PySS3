Most effective WayI know this is a weird question to ask on a subreddit trying to *prevent* suicide, but I wanted to ask what the most effective/least painful way is to kill yourself. My asking this question doesn't mean I want to know because I want to kill myself, but I want to know for if I will later in life. When answering, please consider the accessibility of the 'weapon'; for example, in EU (Where I live), you are not allowed to have a gun like in USA.
