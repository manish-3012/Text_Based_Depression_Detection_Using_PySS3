I tried, i did.So, i was really motivated to get fit and study and becoming something. Today i got a 9 and a 10 at chemistry and i felt good. Came home and i told my parents and i thought after i talked with them they will understand my mental state, they don't.
They insulted me, threatened to stuck a fork in my forehead and they took my pc.
Gonna run tomorrow when ill get dropped at school and i will live on the streets and when ill get tired ima take the bus. I am so sorry for myself, my life is a living hell, i wouldnt wish this to my worst enemy.
