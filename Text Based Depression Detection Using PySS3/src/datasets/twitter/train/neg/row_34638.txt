Whatâ€™s the point of living when weâ€™ll always suffer with pain for the rest of our lives?I hate hearing the phrase â€œpain is temporaryâ€ because that also means that happiness is temporary. 

Even after we experience a short amount of happiness and stop feeling pain, weâ€™ll eventually have to go through suffering yet again. 

The cycle of happiness and pain always comes and goes throughout our lives. And the pain that Iâ€™m feeling right now isnâ€™t something I want to feel again (if I get out of it).

This is too much for me. 

So whatâ€™s the point of living? I donâ€™t care if pain makes me stronger because Iâ€™m still going to be in some sort of pain in the future regardless.
