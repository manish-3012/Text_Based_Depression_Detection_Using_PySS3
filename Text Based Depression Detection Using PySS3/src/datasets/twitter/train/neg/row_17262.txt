I can't think straight anymore, but I just want to die.Suicidal thoughts are neverending lately, as much as I like to tell myself I could never attempt again, or I'd never be willing to go through with it I fear that one day it'll all be too much. I don't want to cause my family pain, I already feel like a burden as it is but this mental turmoile won't seem to end. I am sick of being a broken person, I feel like nothing can fix me at this point, I was abused for years and there is no changing that. I was only 13 the first time I was sexually assaulted by my then bf, I am 17 now but it still haunts me to this day. I can't stand the dissociation anymore, nothing makes sense and I am absolutely sickened by myself. I am always suppressing all the pain, anger, and disgust I feel but I fear that one day it'll all be too much, I don't know how to let out the emotions when it's all too much. I have someone who supports me but he can't cure the diseased person I am, and I worry that he will eventually be sickened by my presence. I feel hopeless, overwhelmed, and like a ghost of a person. I could go on and on but the main point that I'm trying to say is that I can't deal with this shit anymore, it doesn't feel worth it.
