I need to be convinced to kill myself. Not a cry for help. I want to die.I'll never be happy. I don't make anyone's life better. I'm a burden on the only person I have a significant relationship with. Every single person who's meant anything to me, with one exception, has been ripped away in an extremely untimely fashion as if someone's out to get me.

I just don't have the balls to do it. So convince me. Please help me end my misery.
