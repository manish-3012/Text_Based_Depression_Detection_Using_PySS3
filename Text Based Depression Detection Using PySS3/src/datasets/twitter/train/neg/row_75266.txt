I think I'm literally over everythingI don't know how to explain. I've tried so many times and never found a cathartic (is that the right word?) response.
I'm tired and bored. I was planning to end my life last year but it failed. I got over it for a bit, even grew so damn much. My career has evolved and I have my own house rental for a change. I don't know what to say?
I'm still over life. The buzz is gone. I have thousands of reasons to be alive, I just don't want to be here.
My dream was to share my heart with someone whom understood me but here I am, alone and fat and a cesspool of psychological problems.
Those who tormented me as a kid, those who were fed with a silver spoon, they're all doing okay.
I don't want them to be okay, I know that's terrible. I don't want them to suffer,I just don't want them to be so happy. It's unjust. I hate it all and most of all I hate my fucking self for no doing better.
I'm filled with rsge and bitterness. I almost legitimately wasnt the world to burn while I watch.
Why am I so hateful? I don't get it.
Just wanted to vent that out.
