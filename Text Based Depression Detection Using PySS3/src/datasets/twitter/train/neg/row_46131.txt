Just another lonely midnight.Thereâ€™s something comforting about the night. Most people are asleep and are as equally productive as me. The sound of the rain is a lullaby that carries them away. I lay here trying to decide if I even want to see the sunrise. How funny it is to find myself in this dark room with nothing to dream about but how I want to end my life. The physical pain tugs at my sleeve to remind me itâ€™s still there. My depression, a cradle for my insecurities tonight. I will eventually fall asleep with the same and sole hope I have; to not wake up to see tomorrow.
