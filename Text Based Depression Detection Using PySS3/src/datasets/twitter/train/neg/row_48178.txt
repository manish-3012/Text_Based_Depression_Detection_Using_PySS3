Sun and everything under. Iâ€™m actually thinking of committing suicide today. I have no reason to continue. I hate my life and everything in it.I can no longer control these impulses and continue to make things worse off. What is a person to do when they are in so much pain and have zero hope? I think death would be better than life. But I only have one life so it seems silly to throw it away. My relationship is strained to the max. I donâ€™t care about anyone but myself or canâ€™t see past myself to be of benefit to them. I donâ€™t want to be here, I want to die, and get rid of these feelings so so so so so so so bad!!!!!
