i genuinely hate myselfiâ€™m graduating high school this year so theyâ€™ve been streaming all our scholarships and awards ceremonies.. i won a couple scholarships in smaller amounts but i was so pissed off at the other people who won more money and got more recognition. iâ€™ve always struggled with feeling left out and feeling unappreciated, and watching people that are spoiled, mean, and undeserving win awards and other things that i feel like i should have won upset me so much.... and then i get mad at myself for being ungrateful and angry, which then makes me so depressed. i work my ass off and it feels like nobody acknowledges me or anything i do. in quarantine ive been desperately reaching out to friends and no one wants to talk to me. when i get upset my family doesnâ€™t understand and i feel so alone. i survived an attempt last year but i just feel so so empty and useless again. my feelings donâ€™t feel real or valid and i hate every thought that goes through my head. idk what iâ€™m doing anymore. iâ€™ll probably delete this when i realize how stupid i was to post it.
