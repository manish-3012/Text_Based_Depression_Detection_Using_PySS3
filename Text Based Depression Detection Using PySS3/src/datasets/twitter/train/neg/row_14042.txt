Should i end it allThis is a throw away account so yeah.I came here just to ask opinions of other people since i am not good at talking to people in real life.Should i kill myself because since i was a child my life was shit.My dad and my mom were divorced before i remembered anything and the hated each other. I used to stay with my dad but now i stay with my mom. I have no friends because i have bad memories since i used to be isolated and bullied as a kid so that kinda affected my self esteem and my will to talk to new people. I also feel like a burden to my parents cause my mum is low on money i just feel i am at fault for causing her situation. My mum works morning til night and she is always tired. I cant talk to my brother cause he also has his problems so i dont want to burden him with mine . I have nothing going for me because i have no friends , my family is in shambles , i have depression and anxiety and im bad at everything. It does not help that i always feel inferior to my brother. I dont hate him but he has always been the person i want to be so i feel jellous of him. My mum always has to devide what little of her time to us . This makes me feel terrible cause she is not in a good financial spot and she gets little rest. I feel i should just kill myself because i dont have much going for me and it will help my mum with her financial issues and my brother will get more attention from her. I just always feel like everything is my fault somehow and something believe it. I have always felt outcast so i think no one will feel that sad if im gone. So what should i do. Kill myself or not.
