My parents found my suicide noteI couldnâ€™t be more depressed. She found the pills and the suicide note in my backpack because I was gonna get off the school bus,not go home,and overdose in the woods. But she found it before I got the chance too. And she made me talk when I didnâ€™t wanna talk. She wouldnâ€™t let me talk to people who could actually help me,because I know she couldnâ€™t. Iâ€™m gonna find more pills.
