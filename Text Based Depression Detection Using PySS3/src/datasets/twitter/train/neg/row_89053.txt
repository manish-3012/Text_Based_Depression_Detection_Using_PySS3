Regressing...The day I lose the battle is the day I finally decide to do it. In such a way that there will be no return. The time I do decide to do it will be unannounced. But like my choice to use, once I resolve to kill myself - no amount of psychiatric help or medication will reverse my decision. If I lose the battle, I lose the battle. Nothing will change my mind at that point. My demons will have won. 

I retain hopeful optimism but it's being consumed by cynical nihilism.. And in this, I regress further into my defense. 

But today is not the day I lose the battle..

I'm gonna go use again.
