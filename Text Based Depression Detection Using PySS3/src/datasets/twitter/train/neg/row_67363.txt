I'm doneI'm so angry at the world right now. I try and try but I have nothing and no one. Well, I do have a mother who is so controlling and always disappointed in me. I go to work and come home. I haven't been fucked in 12 years. She took over parenting my son but I really do try to act happy for him and take him places. I joined a friendship site but they message me once and then nothing. I just scratched up my arms I'm ready to go live under a bridge.
