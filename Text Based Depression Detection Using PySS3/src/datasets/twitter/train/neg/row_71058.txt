I wish I were dead.I am 20 years old and I have been depressed for at least 6 years, maybe longer and I don't know how much longer I can handle/cope with my depression and suicidal thoughts. Everyday it seems that I think of different ways I can die, but I never want to actually kill myself. I always wish that I would die in a freak accident so the people that care about me don't have to suffer through everything that goes with killing yourself. I have been talking to a doctor to help me, and I am taking antidepressants at the moment as well,  but I just don't have any motivation or anything to live for. I dropped out of community college after failing out of normal college  and I don't know what to do with my life. I have also never done anything with a girl and by anything I literally mean anything. I never had a girlfriend, never kissed anyone, and never even asked anyone on a date as well. I have a couple of good friends but I don't have a best friend and i feel so lonely that it hurts. My family has been always telling me how good of a person I am and how I will get through this part in my life. . . but I don't know if I can. I'm sorry for how long this is but trust me if I included everything this post would be 100x longer.
