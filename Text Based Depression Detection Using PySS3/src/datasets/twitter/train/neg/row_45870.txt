I am SO confusedI dream and fantasize about getting cut, shot, raped, etc. it makes me happier and if I don't think about it before sleeping I feel.. Empty? I used to cut but I stopped. I didn't want to regret the scars. But I did it in a visible place. Do I crave attention? Honestly life has dealt me a pretty shit hand. In my first 17 years of life I had to deal with losing my family, obesity, bullying, verbal abuse by guardians, guardians divorcing, guardians going to jail, blackmailing, and some other shit. 

I honestly don't know what's going on with me. I'm in honors. If you ask anyone they'll say I'm funny and pretty upbeat. I have extreme fits of rage now and then(once a month?) where ive made people cry. It feels so good to let go like that. I never regret it which makes me feel bad.

I just do not know. I think I'm normal. I know people have it worse. Am I wrong? Do I seek attention? Is that it? What the fuck is wrong with me. :/

Edit: 2 hours. No help. Goin for it.
