I've done and had enoughI've had a pretty good life, achieved a lot, done a lot of stuff in 42 and a half years that most people don't manage in a whole lifetime. But all things must end, it's been a hell of a ride but it's time for me to get off. I don't want anything more, the only thing I want I keep screwing up so that's it. In the immortal words of DNA "so long and thanks for all the fish". Tonight I start the last great journey.
