I'm close to my breaking pointHey, I'm a 21yo, bi, and gender questioning. My last relationship ended ubruptly with my partner kicking me out to live with my mother who herself kicked me out when I was 15.

My siblings hate me and anything I have ever confidently told them has been thrown back into my face so I no longer have trust. My mother is a fundamentalist Christian so my gender/sexuallity problems are just be being confused accoriding to her. My father is a drug addict who is in and out of rehab and the mental ward in the hospital who is very abusive and lives on his own.

Today I was beaten with a guitar by my 12 year old sister who snuck up behind me because she has massive temper tantrums when she doesn't get her way. My brother told me I am useless and that I only get used until someone better can be found to replace me (something which I believe and I had told him I feel).

I just want to end it all. I have no where, I have no one, and I just don't know what to do anymore.
