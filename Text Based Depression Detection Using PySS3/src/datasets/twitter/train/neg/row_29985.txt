Nothing makes me happy, everything makes me cry and I'm not motivated to change.I've struggled with body image issues for about 5 years and was depressed for a while 3 years ago until I met my girlfriend. The last 3 months I've lacked motivation which made me become lazy, get really bored and become depressed. My girlfriend broke up with me a month ago. She was the only thing that made me happy during the 2 months I was depressed before she broke up with me. 

She made this 10x worse than it already was and I was already considering milling myself before she broke up with me. I'm so done with the crying. I'm alone all day and I spend 4+ hours a day with tears coming out of my eyes. Everything reminds me of her and it makes me cry. When I'm not crying about her I'm crying about the fact that I just can't be happy. I see happy things and I cry because I want that but I can't have it. I could get better if I was motivated but I'm not motivated and nothing can motivate me.

I tried to kill myself a couple days ago. I sent my ex a text explaining it's not her fault. She talked me out of doing it then but I still want to. I needed her she was the last thing that made me happy. I can't live crying and doing nothing every day I need to kill myself I can't be motivated.
