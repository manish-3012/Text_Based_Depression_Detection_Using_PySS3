lonely and worthlessi want to kill myself because two people on fb in a row (like literally the very first two posts in my newsfeed) are getting married and my friend who i commiserate with about being single and lonely is getting back with his skinny cute quirky ex and most of my other friends are in relationships and then thereâ€™s me who hasnâ€™t had a stable love life ever. i never will either. so whatâ€™s the point of even trying to find someone at this point since itâ€™s never going to happen. iâ€™ve tried countless times to find people on apps but nothingâ€™s ever come to fruition (or even past a first date). plus i live in a city where i have no friends so i canâ€™t meet someone irl. basically iâ€™m done with all of this stupid fucking bullshit and will be self harming and/or attempting suicide either tonight or in the coming weeks leading up to new years. i cannot do this anymore. i need a relationship to be happy and thatâ€™s obviously not going to happen so iâ€™m just preparing to end my life.
