My partner's deadMy partner died on the 18th and I can't take this. I've had suicidal ideation for a long time and once he got sick, he was chronically ill, much of it focused on only if he passed before me. He has. 

As a gay widow, there are no resources for me. Even calling the suicide hotline I was told to talk to religious groups about his death, which I won't do. I spent a week wearing myself thin trying to find a grief counselor and gave up when I have been told by everyone - the hospital where he died, the local LGBT health center, the suicide hotline - that it will be three months before I can get help. The suicide hotline will find me and put me on a three day involuntary hold if I tell them I have a plan but it would be an ongoing series of holds, not therapy or medication, and that sounds worse than living right now. 

I have traveled to see family for the holiday. It's my goodbye to them. When I get my partner's remains on Wednesday or Thursday, depending on the crematorium, I will do the deed. I have an anaphylactic allergy so it should be quick and effective. 

There are many people who love me. They have been trying to help. But I can't live without him.
