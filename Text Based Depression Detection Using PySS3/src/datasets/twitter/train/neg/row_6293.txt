Boy threatened to kill himself because of my friend.Thereâ€™s this weird guy whoâ€™s obsessed with my best friend and wants to be with her but she clearly doesnâ€™t and politely ignores him. Their school has just broke off for summer but he keeps sending her messages and my friend has even become worried that he might stalk her.
He has not threatened to kill himself because of her and she had to talk him out of it. What cam I do or tell her to do??!
