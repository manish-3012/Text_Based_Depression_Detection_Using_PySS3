It's one of those days and I'm backA lot has changed for me over the past year. I've achieved a lot, I've grown a lot. On days like this though, it feels like it's all just one step off a bridge away from being pointless. Which it is. It's just exhausting being so alone all the time. I've created such a good facade for myself that I, me, the real me is just invisible. No one knows that I exist, the version of me that would end my career, and destroy what little in the way of human relationships that I have. I've heard that it's quite unlikely that a trans woman of colour will make it to thirty. I have less than a year left now, but it truly feels like I've overstayed my welcome in this world, an abomination that never should have existed.
