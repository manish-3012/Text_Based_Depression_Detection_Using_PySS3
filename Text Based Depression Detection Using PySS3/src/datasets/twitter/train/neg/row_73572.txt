I'm turning 18 tomorrowI'm a loser. I'm 18 and still don't have a car. Wasted your teen years by not having sex. All of you might think I'm a loser too well you're right. I used to frequent thecoli.com but left after they kept flaming me for not having sex in high school it might not mean much to any of you but I actually wanted to so it hits home. Those guys were right I missed my prime and I missed girls prime as they said girls were most attractive in HS, it scares me because the 20 something year old girls at my gym look kinda old. I'm a loser I also don't have a car but I'm hoping I'll be able to afford one sometime in this year. I'm moving out on my own and I'll see how life treats me for now, I backed out of the whole suicide thing but I ain't wrapped too tight so I might get back at that now.  I hate going to my gym because it's all sports bras and short shorts that could qualify as underwear haha. I don't know anymore this seems like the only way to end my life because I'll never be normal like you guys and I'm going to die a virgin anyway might as well speed up the process. Shit I hate my life

I know this is the wrong place for someone like me but at least somebody will know why I died while my family members will be grasping at straws.
