Ugly, unsuccessful, and unlovableLife isnâ€™t what Iâ€™d dreamed itâ€™d be. When I was a kid, I always thought I would grow up to be beautiful and have a successful career. Now Iâ€™m just a failure that only went to community college and has no good physical assets. Iâ€™m not physically beautiful (Iâ€™m quite unfortunate looking.) Iâ€™m not talented or skilled. I have no motivation to live or even breathe anymore. Living for 20+ years has been the worst experience. 

I see young people out living their lives and graduating college. Iâ€™m an ugly failure that has never dated or been told Iâ€™m attractive. Iâ€™m just ignored and looked over. People give me this distasteful look every time I look at them, like Iâ€™m not pleasing to their eyes so I donâ€™t deserve their attention. I wonâ€™t go to college and I wonâ€™t ever be attractive. I have nothing and unfortunately, I am nothing in the cruel eyes of society. Iâ€™ll find the courage to end myself one day when Iâ€™ve just had enough. Right now Iâ€™m barely hanging on.
