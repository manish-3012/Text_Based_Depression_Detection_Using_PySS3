I think Iâ€™m readyI love my s/o. But my home life is miserable. 

Without giving too many details, I can only say Iâ€™m surely ready to end it all. 

Iâ€™m only sad and scared because I donâ€™t want the ones I love to feel hurt after I leave. Theyâ€™ve hurt me a lot. I could leave an entire list of everything theyâ€™ve done thatâ€™s led me to commit. But...at the same time I donâ€™t want to hurt them. 

What now?
