no one will see thisIâ€™m 14, my name is Ali, and Iâ€™ve wanted to commit suicide for 6 years. 
It all started when I was 8. I saw a 9 year old girl who had hung herself with a belt and thought, â€œwhy canâ€™t that be me?â€
Itâ€™s fucked, I know.

I keep going despite knowing there is nothing for me at the end of the road.
I canâ€™t see myself living past 20.
The only reason Iâ€™m posting this is because itâ€™s suicide presentation day or whatever
So if you care or something, um, thanks. And if not, I understand as well.
Bye.
