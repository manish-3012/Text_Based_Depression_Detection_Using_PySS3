I am at my boiling point. So I am 16 year old female who is diagnosed with anxiety and depression. I was in a mental institute before and I just started Prozac. I was on Zoloft a year ago. Anywho, today, I hit my boiling point.

I'm constantly frustrated and upset, because I have anxiety. I'm very moody also. So it's really hard for me. I smoked weed on Valentines Day and I fucked up doing so. I had a bad time, because my period was on its way. And that means mood swings to hell, so weed worsened it. I was fine till about Sunday. I didn't get enough sleep. And when I'm tired, hungry, ect. I freak out.

So since Monday I've been iffy, but today I freaked out after being really hungry. I couldn't control my thoughts, I was thinking about suicide and I got really emotional. I talked to my friend, but I only felt better only for a bit. 

I was okay. Now I'm not. I can't sleep. I feel like I'm going crazy. My mind is in so many places at once. I can't sleep and I am frustrated and tired and suicide sounds really good right now. Really good.
