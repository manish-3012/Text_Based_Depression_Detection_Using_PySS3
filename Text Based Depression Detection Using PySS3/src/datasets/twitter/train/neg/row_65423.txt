Afraid its too lateI am afraid its too late for me.

I have addiction issues and my life is a wreck. I can't think of a reason to go on most days.

I know things could get better but I know i have a living hell to go through to even have a chance to be good again.

I ruined my life... not sure if I want to continue at all.
