Tonight is the nightI've prolonged it long enough with a lot of failed attempts to turn my life around. But I stayed. I guess in hopes that I could find some help before it got too bad. I couldn't find any. Whether that was because I got turned away, couldn't afford it, or got stuck waiting for someone to answer. So I'm done now. I'm not typing this to make someone care, I know no one does, I just had to get it out. I'm scared and hurting, but that will be gone now.
