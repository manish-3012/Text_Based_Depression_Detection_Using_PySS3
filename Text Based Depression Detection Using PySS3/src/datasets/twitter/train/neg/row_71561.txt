Been fantasizing about death a lot more frequently.Hi. Just found this sub and read a fair share of posts. It makes me sad reading all of it. But I understand.

I'm not sure if this is against any of the rules, so please delete if ever.

I'm not suicidal. At least I don't think I am. I do have a lot of thoughts about it though. Now more than ever due to all that's happening in the world. Constantly getting screwed over. Everyone has stuff to deal with. Everyone has their reasons for being sad.

Is fantasizing about death okay? Like, Imagining how it'd be like without you, the different ways you could go out, whether from suicide, old age, or complete accident. Who'll actually show up to your funeral, what people will remember you for, if anything at all. Etc.

I personally don't believe I have the strength to do it. I don't want to. I have so much to live for and so many things I still want to do and accomplish in life. Sure, I am not happy at all most of the time, but I will keep myself together. 

I feel like this probably I promised to a close friend back in highschool that I wouldn't do it. I feel like the bond was that strong for me that I would hate to break that promise. No matter how much I may be hurting in the present time.

But still, I think about it in my free time. Sorta just a way to pass time I guess. Is that okay? It's not like I actively want to or am constantly plotting my inevitable death. I'm not making some grand scheme, it just sorta comes to mind sometimes. I can't imagine it being healthy.

(I don't really know where I'm going with this post. I dunno. I think I just want to know if anyone feels the same way.)
