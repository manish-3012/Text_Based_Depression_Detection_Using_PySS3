I was driving around and realized no one gives a shitAfter a hard week that followed a hard month and a hard year and that year following a hard existence.... I'm currently having a midlife crisis at the age of only 19. I guess I should call it more of an ongoing crisis. I'm currently sitting in my car parked on the side of the road because I couldn't control the steering wheel and I'm wondering where the nearest bridge is so I can jump off of it. Looking through my phone to find someone, anyone who would give a damn and listen to me but no one.... fucking no one.
