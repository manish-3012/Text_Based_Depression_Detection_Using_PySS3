I did something stupidIâ€™ve been having a tough time lately, feeling really depressed and crying all the time. Iâ€™ve had all these racing thoughts in my head and I couldnâ€™t take it anymore and hurt myself. I could really use some kind words to help me get through this, I donâ€™t want to give up.
