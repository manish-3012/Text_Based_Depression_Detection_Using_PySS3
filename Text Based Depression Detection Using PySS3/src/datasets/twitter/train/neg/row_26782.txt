Most people on here have at least livedNo matter how desperate people are, on this sub reddit, at least they lived. Some are married, with kids, have jobs, travelled, done this, done that. Wanna know what it's like to not be alive? Im 21 male, virgin, never really had a relationship, unfit, unattractive, fragile, sensitive, no friends, no future, barely passed high school, no job, isolated, only contact is my mom. I am zombie... not even human... What could be worse?

My 13 year old dog died in front of me, because of me. Can anyone list any situation worse than mine??? Like seriously? Every single fking post I see here have lives I would wish I had...
