Turkish person on SW. How do I help?On a forum I post on, someone from Turkey has threatened suicide.  I want to help them, but I don't know who I should contact.  I don't know their real name.  I have their forum name, and they have accounts on facebook/twitter/youtube with the same name.  He has pictures of himself posted on facebook as well.

Does anyone know what I should do?  I feel I have a moral obligation to report but I don't know how.
