Life would be so much easier if I didn't have to think.This is going to be a mess but idk where else to post this. If the format is fucked up, I apologise.

Sometimes I just can't stop thinking about all of the reasons I'd be better off dead. I'm barely human, I can't function like everyone else can. I'm constantly reminded of every shitty thing in my life no matter where I go or what I do. I'll never be able to forget any of this, I have vivid memories of every little thing I've fucked up.

I can't get through life without self harm. It's the only thing I have at this point, other than my boyfriend. There's almost nothing in this life that makes me happy anymore &amp; it fucking sucks. I've tried to talk to him about quitting but he said something about how he doesn't want me to. That's beside the point, but like, idk. I just feel so lost. I'm trying to find something that'll make me stop thinking forever &amp; suicide is the only answer.

Of course I get a temporary release from cutting myself but it isn't enough &amp; it never will be. Plus, it's ruining my life. It would be so much easier to kill myself than to go through this shit. I don't want to feel or think or even exist. I'll always be reminded of my past experiences, like the long period of sexual abuse &amp; rape, my abusive father, &amp; my fucked up family. Even if I live long enough to move out I'll be plagued by those issues for the rest of my life.

When I get like this my boyfriend says things like, "Think of our future, it'll get better" but I don't think it will. Things never get better. He makes me happy but it's not really enough to keep me alive for the next couple of years that I'm stuck in this fucking house. 

I don't know why I'm even writing this. I'm too much of a coward to actually end it. I came pretty fucking close a couple of months ago but of course I couldn't do it. I wish I would've succeeded
