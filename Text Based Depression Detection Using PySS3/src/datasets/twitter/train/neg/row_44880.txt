Needing some words of encouragement..Recently life has taken a swing for the worse.  I am feeling incredibly low and while I do not plan to kill myself, this thought about ending my life comes up and it speaks loudly in my head.  I want to say things get better, but it doesn't ring true to me right now.  

Long story short... I am going to school full time, working full time, and really not seeing my family.  When I have seen them it is for short time periods.  Christmas is looking to be non-existent for my three kiddos, and to top it off, our water heater died last night.  The stress that is surrounding me is intense and it hurts mentally, even some physical pain.  I dunno what to do or where to go, but I need to get these thoughts out.
