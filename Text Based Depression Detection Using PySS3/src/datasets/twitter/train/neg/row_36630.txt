Suicidal thoughts after fucking up on my examHello everyone. I'm starting to have suicidal thoughts after I miserably failed to submit an assignement. This resulted in me having a very low mark and therefore I've failed my exam. I still have a chance to pass the exam in september but despite that, I'm suicidal. Because failing the exam means no money, which means I cannot go to Switzerland, continue e-sports, etc., which would my life...worthless.
