How much X n Booze?1 g of xanax /kg of weight is considered the lethal dosage of alprazolam itself. So - just saying - I should take 95 g of xanax which are about 38000 pills. So Xanax is pretty safe. But what about its interactions with alcohol ingestion?
Is there any math to help figuring out how much alprazolam per kg of weight, per cl of alcohol ingested is lethal?
