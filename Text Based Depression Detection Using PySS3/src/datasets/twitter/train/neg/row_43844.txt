Instead of writing suicide notes, i created a twitter account insteadI have so many things to say, and i think itll be documented well in there. It's on private right now. Once i am ready to commit suicide, i will deactivate all my social media accounts and publicize it instead. Sure, my friends do know that im suicidal but they only know the surface. Nobody knows other than my friends. I used to write in my google keep notes but those were too disorganized. I dont have the eneergy to summarize what ive been experiencing, since theres just too much to say and im really bad at explaining so i hope that that twt acc will help for my family and friends to know a little bit of my reason. I dont know if they will read all of it, maybe theyll get bored.

Im starting to plan my suicide. Maybe i'll do it next year, or this year. Depends on my mood and triggers. Im so overwhelmed from everything especially in school. I know school isnt everything, but it kinda is to me. Excelling in it is the only thing im good at. If i fail this semester, thats it. Im done. I'll go.
