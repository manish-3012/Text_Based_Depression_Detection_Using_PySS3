how do i get rid of this?I get intermittent suicidal thoughts, it is always there, like a ghost on my back, whenever I see a possibility to hit rock bottom, the suicidal thoughts, they invite themselves into my mind automatically. My language to myself these days "oh, you cannot do that??, well you can always die".

Going ahead, I see myself to be too weak against the suicidal thoughts, they are gaining monstrous momentum against me these days. What seems like a depression prolongs because of these suicidal thoughts. I have recently developed a fear for heights because I know I could jump anytime and end all of this.

Am scared. I don't wanna go to a therapist(no money), do you guys have like a recovery plan or something like that. 

I have been hitting the gym lately and that has worked wonders. Learned that I can get suicidal and also go to the gym at the same time. They were supposed to take me out of depression (presumed), but gym was not all that helpful. I have put on muscles and shoulder but I keep saying to myself "you die now, you'll slightly be buff, that is the only difference".

I had a phase last week, I just sat on my couch for three days continuous, no movement, ideating suicide. I kinda freaked myself out, but this me who is talking now is long gone when suicidal thoughts are around. Mind keeps fixtating on it. I recover from it, am ashamed of myself and fall back to similar thoughts, depressing self-hate of some sort. 

ok, never mind, plz suggest me a plan to eradicate this mechanism that I have put time into. Mechanism that slides me into a possible suicide candidate effortlessly. Mechanism that stops my physical actions and makes me sit down and suffocate.

I want out (not death, but death for wanting to die), help. I have the sane mind to put this here now, this might not last. help. Suggest something or the other, like a plan of sorts. Please.
