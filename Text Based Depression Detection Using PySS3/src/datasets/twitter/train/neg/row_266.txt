How do I make homemade poison. (F 14)I want to sleep and never wake up again. My mom wouldn't have to spend her money on 5 people ever again. She wouldn't have to waste her money on tax for someone who can't even focus right to do their summer school work. One less fatass to take care of who's too attached to people. One less failure in the world. I wouldn't be an annoyance to my siblings any more. I wouldn't have to face my social anxiety. My friends wouldn't have to worry about me. I don't want them to feel upset about me leaving. I just wanna die. None of my hobbies are making me feel happy. I just want to be happy, without a care in the world.
