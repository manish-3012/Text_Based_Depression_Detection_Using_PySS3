Iâ€™m tired of wallowing in my sadness but I canâ€™t stop.Iâ€™m constantly feeling down and depressed and I hate it because it feels like the only emotion I can accept. Something good happens? Push away the happiness and be sad. Something exciting happens? Push away the excitement and be sad. Itâ€™s almost like Iâ€™m numb to all emotions but a few.

Itâ€™s been happening since I was 11. Thereâ€™s many things that could have caused this but I donâ€™t know what exactly it is. Itâ€™s been worse than ever this year. Iâ€™ve started cutting, Iâ€™ve been messing up friendships for no reason. Iâ€™m so scared and confused and I want it to stop. The only way out I feel is suicide but I donâ€™t want to give up. Giving up is the only consistent thing Iâ€™ve done in my life over the years, and by giving up now would prove my worthlessness.

It doesnâ€™t help to know that Iâ€™m born in a world where people of this generation might not live past the age of 30 due to things past generations did. I also live in a generation where I feel I wonâ€™t be accepted for who I am or who I will be. Itâ€™s getting tiring and repetitive, having the same thoughts over and over again. I wish my mind was blank. I wish I didnâ€™t have to think, which brings me back to the suicide topic. This might as well be my last rant, because I feel ranting like this will only make things worse.
