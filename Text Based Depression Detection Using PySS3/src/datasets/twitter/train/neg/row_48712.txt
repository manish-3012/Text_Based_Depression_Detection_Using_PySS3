I'm done tryingI guess I'll tell the story of how I feel, and why I have 2 attempts behind my back. 

I feel as though I exist in an endless ocean, hanging on to a soggy plank, I drift In my endless abyss of misery, pondering of a solution, but finding no way out, and having no one to help you. 

I mean, people care about me, but they live in the safety of their shores, endless years away, with no understanding what anything is like, where the water is warm and shallow, where they believe they umderatand what is going on beyond the horizon, they can send advice, tell me to hang on a bit longer, and I try, I truly do, the get out of my miserable ocean that is my life, but after swimming for a while I realize that it will not affect anything, infinite minus anything is still as much, it will never end, no matter how hard or far I swim, life is like a race with no end, and no reason to keep going. 

So I should just end my misery, drown myself in the painful yet numb cold, deep, dark, unknown I call death.
