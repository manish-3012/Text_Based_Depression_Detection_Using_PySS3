SighIt just get harder and harder to find new ways to cope/ new reasons to want to push and I feel like Ive given everything but each day I fight less and less to be happy and keep the depression to a low.   I constantly think of all the different ways I can off myself and quiet frankly none of those thoughts even make me second guess death.  I just want it now and I feel like no matter the path I take sooner than later I'm gonna put myself into the ground.    Im just tired of always being angry and always being depressed
