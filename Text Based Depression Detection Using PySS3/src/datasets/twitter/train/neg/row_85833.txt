No one caresI just want it all to go I don't feel anything anymore. I feel like nothing. I'm just a mistake or as my mom calls it an "oppsie baby". She told me she wishes she aborted me and I wish she did it to. If I died no one would care. I cut myself alot and it makes me feel better for the night but I've almost attempted several times had the knife up to my wrist ready. But didn't do it I don't know why. I want the pain to end I want my life to end.
Why
