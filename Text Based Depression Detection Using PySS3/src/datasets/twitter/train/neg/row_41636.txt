I've been spiraling downhill... Again.Hey y'all, it's been a few months since I last opened up, and I wish I could say I got better.

Feel free to look back to recent posts about how I was doing, because nothing exactly has changed in those aspects.

I'm a cosmetology student and recent high school grad after the most stressful 2 years of my life. I'm glad I graduated high school, but joining beauty school is still to this day my biggest regret.

But when it comes to getting worse; I've gone farther downhill then I ever have before.

I took it upon myself to seperate myself from everyone that I had left because I knew I couldn't keep a smile up long enough to actually be a joy to be around. 

I've been high, everyday since around the time I turned 18 back in October. Things weren't going too bad until eventually I tried to be sober for a week. Then I lost basically all of my friends, and my parents were in Costa Rica... my suicidal thoughts came back stronger then ever and now they won't go away. I self harmed on two occasions and had two extremely bad anxiety attacks. I've never self harmed before, and my anxiety was never this bad. One, during a night I was already trying to end it, and another when a minor thing happened in a video game..

I'm sick of feeling like a burden.

My final say is I'm debating with myself to check into an inpaitent facility, but I don't know if I'm mentally fucked enough that it'll actually make me better, not worse. My main concerns is the month left I have at cosmetology. I'll be working over 30 hours a week in my schools salon because I need to hit a deadline by the 15th of this month. At the same time the question if dropping out is still there as well.

I have no one I can trust right now and my parents either don't understand (dad) or blow things out of context (mom) and I don't know what to do.
