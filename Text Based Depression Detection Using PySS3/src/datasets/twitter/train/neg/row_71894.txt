Iâ€™ve been trying so hard to get betterIâ€™m doing everything I can. Trying meds. Trying therapy. Learning about self compassion. I still hate myself and want to die. I really think life is just endless suffering.

The election has me very disappointed, too. I just donâ€™t feel like I can cope today. I want to go home and crawl into bed. I might just leave work early, but Iâ€™ll feel awful about that too.
