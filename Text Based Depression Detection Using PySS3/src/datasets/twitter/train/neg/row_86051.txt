I donâ€™t want to live if Iâ€™m always going to be aloneI never had any relationships because I felt like I never belonged and because I just know I donâ€™t have the looks and personality that people like. Iâ€™ve been alone for my entire life and I feel like a broken human being. I donâ€™t know how to hug someone or do anything physical because Iâ€™ve never done it. Now Iâ€™m in my 20s and I have no hope of things getting better. A quiet awkward loner with no ambition has no place in this world. Itâ€™s clear to me that I was never meant to thrive in this world. So itâ€™s only natural that I end it because I wasnâ€™t made for this world. Iâ€™m tired of the suffering  that goes on every single day and no amount of talking or hoping fixes things. Things stay the same at best and get much more hellish at worst. I fucking hate my existence. Being alone like I have all my life is hell and I wouldnâ€™t wish this on anyone. This shit alone is a killer and fucks you up especially mentally. I just want out.
