I canâ€™t do it anymoreItâ€™s the one year anniversary of my dads death today and Iâ€™m so alone and everything is wrong. Iâ€™m still not sleeping. all I do is cry it seems. I have no friends. I have no hobbies. I have a fiancÃ© who is amazing but I just feel not good enough for him and that he would be better off without me. 

Canâ€™t even afford to get to college until next month and I have a test in 2 weeks. Literally have Â£2 

I just feel so done everything hurts so much and Iâ€™m just so tired. I donâ€™t know what to do I really hurt
