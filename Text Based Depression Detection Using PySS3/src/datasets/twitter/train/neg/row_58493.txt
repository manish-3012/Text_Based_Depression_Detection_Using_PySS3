I thought I was getting better.I stopped having suicidal thoughts and I stopped acting on them about 3 months ago. I don't know what happened but I suddenly stopped having that desire to die. 

I left my abusive partner about a month ago and it's been hard finding my feet but I haven't wanted to kill myself. 
But over the past two days I've had all of those feelings come back. Im fucking miserable. 

I took a long bath this afternoon and just cried and cried till it hurt to try and subside my urges. Usually crying or distracting myself works but it didnt.

I don't know what to do. Im scared this feeling has come back. I thought I was getting better.
