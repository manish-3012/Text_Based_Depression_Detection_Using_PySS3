reason to live?really think this time is my time, just lost my girlfriend which was my last reason

my dad left when I was too young to remember mom died when I was 18

only loving relatives are an aunt and uncle who I havenâ€™t seen in 8 years

donâ€™t talk to anyone, have no friends and no idea how to make them

Iâ€™m morbidly underweight with no real drive to eat anything more than a bowl of cereal or a pop tart a day

canâ€™t workout because I have a bad heart

Just kinda a waste of space, donâ€™t really have a reason to live and the more I think about it the more I wanna do it
