I really hate myselfI hate how I disappoint my family and I hate how Iâ€™m not a good enough friend and I hate how my family keeps trying to make me fat and I hate how I just canâ€™t stop eating and I hate how fat I am and I hate how my dads got cancer and heâ€™s going to die and I hate how selfish I am by being sad when Iâ€™m not the one dying and Iâ€™m not the one who has a few years to live and how Iâ€™m not the one whoâ€™ll never see my daughter turn eighteen or my son thirteen and I hate how I can never commit to my learning and I hate how Iâ€™m an autistic little bitch who makes everyone around me miserable and I hate how I always let my team down and I hate that I hate my life when so many other people have it worse and I hate how everyone will always be better than me and I hate how I ruin everything for everyone and I hate how I canâ€™t grow up and stop crying every night and having panic attacks despite the fact Iâ€™m already thirteen and I hate how bad I am at everything and I hate how I can never do anything right and I hate that I canâ€™t fucking do the right thing and lull myself when I know itâ€™s what will be better for everyone else but I canâ€™t because Iâ€™m too scared and I hate how I canâ€™t throw up when eating makes me feel so fucking dirty and I hate how I canâ€™t even cut because I canâ€™t even be fucking sad right and I hate how I never think about anyone but myself and I hate how ugly I am and I hate that my mum is stressed because we get into arguments so much and she has crohns and I hate that Iâ€™m not a better daughter when I know my parents deserve the world and I hate how unfair it is that my dads dying whenâ€™s heâ€™s such a good person and I should be the one dying because he doesnâ€™t deserve to die and I do. 

I hope one day I can finally pluck up the courage and fucking loll myself because I ruin everyone elseâ€™s lives and Iâ€™ll never amount to anything so it would only help the people around me. I wish I wasnâ€™t such a fucking selfish freak so I would just fucking do it. 

Iâ€™d really like someone to talk to. Just for a bit. Please.
