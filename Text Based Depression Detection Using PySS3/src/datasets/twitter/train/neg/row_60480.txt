I'm doing that thing where I research means of suicide again.I have this strong urge to drive to a state with lax gun laws so I can end this shit. it's finals week rn and I'm realising now that I may lose my scholarship which means going into thousands of debt or dropping out. and if I stopped out, I'd have nothing. I wouldn't have anything else for me in this world and I'd be ready to die.
