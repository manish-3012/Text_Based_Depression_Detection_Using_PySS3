Thereâ€™s nothingI canâ€™t try anymore. 

Suffering from C-PTSD, I disappointed myself because I quit work. I couldnâ€™t take the chance to go in and flip about the way I was afraid I would. I already did a little bit that whole week. 

All the triggers. The way I tried to shut up... staying in the situation that made me worse every day... I ran away again.

Now Iâ€™m sitting here, going broke, no hope. I donâ€™t even deserve to forgive myself again. I wanted treatment but I canâ€™t get to it and I have no money for it.

Dying is my only option...
I canâ€™t function around anyone anymore....
I sit every day alone, thinking of nothing, or death.
