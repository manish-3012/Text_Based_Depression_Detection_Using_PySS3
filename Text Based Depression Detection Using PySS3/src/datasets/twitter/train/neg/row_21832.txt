Getting the motivation to do something with my lifeI have chronic depression, social anxiety and a life long lack of motivation. I thought when I started getting a passion for weightlifting that I would be set back on the right track (and I felt like I was for awhile) but Ive gone to the gym like 5 times this entire year. I took time off from school to get better, to get treatment, but it only made me more depressed and isolated.

Now I'm in a situation where I haven't made a new friend in years, I've been single my entire life, I'm going to a new school soon even though social anxiety makes school such a miserable experience. 

I was trying to read those motivational posts and watch those videos. It sucks because I know that the only way to turn my life around for the better is to start being proactive about it, but I just can't convince myself that its even worth it. I've been depressed for so long that it's become a part of me, and its almost like I'm addicted to being depressed.

At this point the effort it would take to even put me in a slightly better place seems so insurmountable that I can't stop thinking about how much easier it would be to kill myself. I just have no desire to do anything at all or become anything. Fuck its tough because its not like I want to die, but at the same time I don't have any desire to better my life. Then when I think about how lucky and sheltered I am, it's make me feel like I'm just a ranting, entitled manchild or something.
