GoodbyeI've had enough of everything. I feel like no matter what I do, I can't improve my situation. 

Family always distressed and always complaining. 

I've honestly felt like a huge burden on my friends lately. Not like they would ever complain, but no one deserves to seal with me. 

I've been focusing too much on the negatives of everything and anything and I can't possibly continue everyday like this. I get sad by focusing on the negatives, bitter by focusing on stupid things and just really hopeless overall.

I'm planning on ending things this weekend. I will be able to finally do something good for once.
