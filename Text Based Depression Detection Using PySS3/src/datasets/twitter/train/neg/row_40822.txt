I just want it to fucking end.I'm no stranger to these thoughts, but every time it gets worse and worse until I lay a fuckload of pills on the table with a bottle of whiskey next to them, their sitting on my desk at the moment and I'm trying to pluck the courage from my soul to just do it already. 

I'm only 16 for fuck sake and everything in my life is moving up but god damn I hate every moment of breathing, I wish a lightning bolt would hit me so I didn't have to do it myself, but as usual god has a fucked up sense of humour around me. 

The very moment I got my first story published I wondered how I would die and almost did it that night, Then my first day of College (Which was quite a good day) Ended in me slitting my wrists and wanting to hang myself. 

And I just broke up with my Cunt girlfriend who I only had for a casual fuck, it was me who did the breaking up and at first I was happy but now I want to god damn die. 

If any of you have any sort of super-powers or magic spells to instantly kill anyone then please pick me. At least it'd be a more exciting way to go than pills and whiskey.
