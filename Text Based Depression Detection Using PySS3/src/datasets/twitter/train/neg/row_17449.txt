Trying to understandwhy I have thoughts of suicide literally all the time? Even when its completely irrelevant to what Im doing. Im like ALWAYS thinking about it. Why is that ? Even when Im relatively successful at convincing myself theres such a thing as sustainable happiness brought about by something with intrinsic value Im still thinking about it. Like an earworm, a song thats stuck in your head and wont stop. Gets very annoying.
