There's a voice screaming in my head that I need to die.. and I believe it.I wish someone would understand, but **no one** can, and I'm not sure I want anyone to. I'm too heavy. I will **never** have kids. I will **never** do well in a job. I don't know what I'm living for. I'm sorry.

 I don't think I'm ending my life anytime soon, but the idea is there.
