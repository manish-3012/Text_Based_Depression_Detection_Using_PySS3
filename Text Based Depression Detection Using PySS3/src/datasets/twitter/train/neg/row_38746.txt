I'm tiredIts been a little while since I've felt this bad. I thought I was getting better. I think I've just been lying to myself. 

My skin feels too tight and its like everything inside of me is trying to push out through my throat. I don't have anyone in this city that cares whether I'm alive in the morning or not. I miss my parents. I miss home. I can't go home. 

I'm useless. I'm nothing. I've always been invisible, and no one misses the invisible. I wish I was good at something. I wish I could feel like I was doing anything other than drowning.

I wonder how long it would be before my roommates found me if I was dead. They'd probably be happy for it. I'm a burden, and they make sure I know that. 

I think I'm ready to finally just end it all. To just stop the clock and finally rest.
