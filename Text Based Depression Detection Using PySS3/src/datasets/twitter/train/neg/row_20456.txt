There's no reason to live for me.Long distance relationship. Don't do that. You think that it's working fine, but then you realise how small information do you know about your loved one. You realise that not only (s)he's fine without you, but (s)he finds him/herself better without you.  
That was my first relationship, and it lasted 1 year. But in one year, we only met around 20 times, so not so much.  
I'm sorry for broken English but now I'm too frustrated to keep an eye on my writing.  
I don't know what will happen tomorrow.  
The sun went down. It will never came back for me.
