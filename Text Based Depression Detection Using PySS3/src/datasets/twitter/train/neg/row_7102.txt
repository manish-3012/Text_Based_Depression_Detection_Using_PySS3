Hopeless loopIm anxious about everything. I got a fitbit to try to get healthy but now I just have anxiety all the time about my calories and steps. Its like when I was anorexic and its not healthy. I feel so alone and hopeless. I dont have anything to live for. Right now I'm too nervous to go over to a persons house because their 10 year old kid is there and im scared to talk to him because i don't interact well with people and I've never been around kids before. Im just trying to get xanax so I can stop this panic attact that's been brewing since noon
