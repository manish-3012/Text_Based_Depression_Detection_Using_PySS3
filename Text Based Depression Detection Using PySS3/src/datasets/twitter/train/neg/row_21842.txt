I feel so alone and tiredThe tired is probably from my lack of sleep with having a newborn around. I feel like I got hit with the hardest punch of post partum depression ever. I went from feeling OK about everything to ready to kill myself every night. Everything hurts. My body hurts, my feelings are hurt. I don't want to see anyone except my mom. I don't want this baby anymore. I can't look at the baby's father without feeling such anger and wanting to hit him. I literally fantasize about walking into his room and just beating him and making him feel the pain he puts me through. I want to stop taking my blood pressure medication and let my preeclampsia take its course and just die from liver failure.

Everyone around me loves me dearly but it doesn't seem to make a difference anymore.
