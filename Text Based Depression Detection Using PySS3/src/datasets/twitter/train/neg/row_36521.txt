hopeless loveI am barely a legal adult. I have been hospitalized for bipolar disorder once in my life and I feel so much worse than that time. 

I am going though a late term miscarriage with a baby I do not know if I want. My boyfriend hates me and compared me to another girl. No one loves me and assumes I am using them to  escape from my emotions. I just wanted Adam to be happy. 
I always put him first and he never loved me it seems. He uses me constantly and makes me want to die. I love him though. 

I have nothing to live for. I don't know what to do. 

I just quit.
