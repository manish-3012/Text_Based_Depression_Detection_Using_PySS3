i want to be in painsometimes my hands shake and i just want to smash them with a hammer. i talk to myself so much but i don't really ever have anything nice to say to myself, but i still feel like I'm a better friend to myself than anyone else will ever be. is there someone out there for me? sometimes i really hope not. i always convince myself that I'm best alone. any time spent on me is time wasted. i just want to die. I'm sure people would barely notice or care. it seems that when people say they feel bad that someone they knew, maybe at school or work, kills themself it's more selfish than they'd ever admit. does anyone really care about my life? or do they just care about the uniform routine of their own. i feel like everyone would be more sad that now something is different. people don't like change, but a lot of people don't like me either. so maybe my death would be a good change. the kind that everyone wants in their life. sometimes you want to become rich, maybe famous, maybe you just want to meet that special someone, you just want to be happy, you want your life to change in a good way. i feel like everyone around me could only ever be happy if i died slowly and painfully. maybe I'm their good change. not my life, but my death.
