A friend's girlfriend talked about killing herself.First i want to excuse if this wasn't the appropriate place for this. A friend girlfriend just said she thinks about killing herself. But before that, here comes some context. My friend is dating this girl for about one year, lets call her Michelle. She is a very nice person but since the begining she was slightly different. She would frequently start a conversation and then suddenly meshing a lot of subjects that in the end doesn't make sense at all. I would find her behaviour funny. And oftenly joked about it with my girlfriend. It happens that this weekend i made a a dinner and invited my people to come and this friend too. It all happened good until today, when i was talking to my girfriend and she told me that Michelle talked some nonsense things as usual and one specific word made me feel shocked, it was suicide. She said that she thought it was just a silly thing but i was just freezed. Instantly after i took knowledge about the issue i just felt horrible. I could just see what i always read here, that is, people who is near the person but is unable to detect the signs or ends up making jokes without realizing the "stranger behaviour" could be a mask to something deeper. I instantly educated my girlfriend about it and that anyone that says something like that must be taken very serioulsy. I just imagined the scene of somebody calling and saing she killed herself and everybody just saying " ohh i never thought she would really do it". Now i am aware of the problem and will never underestimate it. I feel like i should talk to my friend about it but i don't know how he might feel because i know it is something very private. But i know i had to talk to him the sooner i can. I know she already made therapy but didn't liked it, do anyone has any suggestions on how to deal with this ? Or any similar experience with someone closer that talked about suicide ? Thanks everyone for the attention.
