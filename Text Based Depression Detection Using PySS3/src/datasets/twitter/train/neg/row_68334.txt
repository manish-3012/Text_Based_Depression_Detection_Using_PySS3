2 nights ago i tried but couldnt bring myself to leave my family with nothingGun in hand and the thought of not being divorced from a previous marriage that would have left my SO and kids having to deal with my "wife" (not divorced)  being left with my half of the house which my SO is co-owner and my kids is why i cant. Feel broken, unloved and completely by myself in my head but cant make them suffer for my failure in life. Not really looking for anything, but make sure you arent going to ruin other peoples lives with your actions.
