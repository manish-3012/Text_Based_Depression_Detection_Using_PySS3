life isnt for methe thing is that i have a feeling that this life is just not for me. like. it's not that i have no desires but my desires are out of the reach. like totally not possible in this world you know? from the day i can remember i wanted this pretty life that would make me happy. and i know im talented in some things i know im not stupid and i know that i have people that love me in my life but that just isn't what i need. for years i feel so fuckin lonely so fuckin empty. the only thing that keeps me alive is the fuckin kpop boyband because when im lookin at them doin some funny shits or listening to their music im not thinkin about how fuckin sad i am and i feel so pathetic because of it. but this reality is just fuckin sad and i can't anymore. even people that love me, do they rlly? people are fake and toxic and life is cruel. my family have always told me im too pure and naive but fuck im twenty years old and tuns of shits that some can't even dream about happened to me so where the fuck am i pure or naive. i just want to be happy and its fuckin tearing me apart that i KNOW that i wont ever be happy because in this world it doesn't work like that for ugly, poor and depressed people like me. i would be way happier dead and that's the fact. n no, i don't wanna  help i just wanna tell this to someone but i just know that no one really cares and baby dont try to tell me otherwise i tried so many times i tried to save me i tried everything.
