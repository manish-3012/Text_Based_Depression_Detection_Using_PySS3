Nearing homelessnessI got an eviction notice today as I've been unable to pay my rent, even though I have a steady job it doesn't cut it and I'm really struggling. I feel lost and I don't know what to do. I'm in a foreign country and going back to my homeland is not an option (for safety reasons). I've been looking for a new place that's cheaper but I just gave up because I felt it was impossible. In a few days I'm gonna be on the street, I have no one and I feel like this is the end of the line for me. I don't know what to do and I just want to end it all
