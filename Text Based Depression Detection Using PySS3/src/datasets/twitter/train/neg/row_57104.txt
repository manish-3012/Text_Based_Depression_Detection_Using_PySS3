I don't think I deserve the support I get because I'm a liar.When I was a teenager around 14, I came out as trans to my family. I didn't get kicked out or anything, but my dad and his partner (we shared a house with a woman who was basically like his wife, but they weren't actually married. Not really sure if there's a word for that) I guess thought it would pass, because I wasn't allowed to go on any kind of hormone blockers, transition socially, and whenever I tried to talk to them about it it kind of got pushed under the rug/put off. She used to be in healthcare and had him convinced I either wasn't really trans or that it wasn't time for anything. I eventually became SH-ey/suicidal and did attempt once, though my family never found out. I basically couldn't talk with my Dad about anything because it would psyche me out. Things eventually got better, and my dad and his partner seperated due to unrelated issues, but now I still basically can't tell my dad anything because it stresses me out too much, even though rationally I know the conversation will go well. I got into a habit of lying about weird insignificant things, and long story short I'm 19 now and working full time, but my Dad's under the impression that I've been taking morning college classes and working only part time because I couldn't figure out how to tell him I didn't want to go to college straight out of highschool. I took some dual credit through HS too, and now he thinks I'm about to have my associate's and move on to taking classes at the local Uni in about a month. He says he's so proud. I don't know how to change it and wish I could just get out of this world. The only thing that keeps me here is how much it would hurt my family if I left.
