Well, I got a gunI'm not yet sure if I'm going to use it, but it was so easy to get! God bless 'muricuh. Just 15 minutes of paperwork in a sporting goods store, and that's it...walked out with a Remington single-shot 12-guage shotgun, with a small box of 00 buckshot. 

At the very least, I'm excited to be a gun owner, even though my intent was to use it for suicide. I guess I can hold onto it for the time being until the mood strikes me, but now, I have the means at my disposal for...disposal. HAH.

I already went into my reasoning in another thread...let me get it for you, [in case you're curious](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/tybp9/i_need_help/).

Wat y'all think!?!??! %D
