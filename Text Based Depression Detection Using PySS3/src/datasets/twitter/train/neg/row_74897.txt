Losing willI went through my first major bout of depression when I was around 15. I'm 21 now, and while it's waxed and waned, it's never truly gone away. I'm so tired of having my first response to every problem be 'well, you could just kill yourself.' It's so draining to constantly feel like this, and it's having an effect on my life, relationships and studies. I feel like I'm just wasted potential. I don't feel like anyone would miss me if I were gone, and I have no one to reach out to. I also deal with some fairly severe anxiety and self confidence issues and it's all getting too much for me.

I don't know what else to do. Every day it's getting harder. If I could think of a painless method I'd have done something by now. I've found myself on the brink quite a few times but I've always chickened out; even so, it's getting to the point where I think I'm going to just do it soon. I'm sorry if I messed up the post, I'm new here. I just didn't know where else to go.
