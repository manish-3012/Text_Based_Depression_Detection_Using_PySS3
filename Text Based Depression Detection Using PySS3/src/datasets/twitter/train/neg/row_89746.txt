Keeps getting worse. starting to feel horrible loneliness Ive been depressed as long as i  can remember moving between varying degrees of unhappiness at 2-3 months at a time. recently ive begun feeling a terrible loneliness. im popular enough at school, have  a lot of friends but feel like if i ended it no one would even notice except for my best friend and my family. Before when i was younger i had no problem with the thought of dying, but now im coming to grips with the fact that i will die no matter what. even if i dont want to its beyond my control. i feel like anything i do is pointless. eventaully any lasting impact will be dead, and even farther in the future every star in the universe will die. since january this year there hasnt been a day where serious suicidal thoughts havent crossed my mind. ive started to think "i hate myself" whenever i walk by a mirror. I have no idea why. i consider myself attractive and have no problems with self esteem. 
im having trouble dealing with the recent increase of these horribly sad thoughts, and this is by far the worst ive ever felt through all of my depressive cycles. I feel like its unfair i have to deal with this. im only 16. the only time i feel enjoyment is when im with im in a relationship with. I dont know what to do with myself anymore. i just want it to stop, i honestly cant take anymore.
