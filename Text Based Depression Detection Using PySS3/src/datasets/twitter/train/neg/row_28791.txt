Can you answer me a question?What's the point? I hate hearing this cliche question, but it needs to be answered. I have never received a sufficient answer. Maybe I don't want one. I realize there is no straightforward answer. But seriously, what is the point? We live a couple years and die. We have a couple laughs and a lot more cries. At least that's what it seems like. I'm not saying life is so terrible that why live it. I'm saying why live, if there is no point. Even if someone lived a completely enjoyable and fulfilling life, why does it matter?

 I've given this question uncountable hours of thought. I've talked about it with my girlfriend. Maybe we're both crazy, but we agree that there is no point to living. We've even agreed that love is not enough to live. Let's say there is a God. So. Why does that matter. That doesn't change anything. There are many things us humans don't understand. What I don't understand is why live?
