Living with chronic illness and feeling hopelessSo a bit of a back story Iâ€™m 21 and I was born with 5 heart problems and multiple other health problems. I have always had the thought of suicide. About a month and a half a go my cousin I grew up with committed suicide. I have been super depressed since and ever since then I have been having thoughts of doing it myself. Here lately it feels as if Iâ€™m a disappointment to everyone and nothing I do is good enough for anyone. I feel hopeless and see no point in living. I know that if I do anything it would crush my friend and possibly some of my family.
