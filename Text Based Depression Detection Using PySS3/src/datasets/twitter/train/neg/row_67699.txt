dark memories never fadeI feel like im at the end of the road this last week, I have a lot of secrets I haven't told anyone and I have a really dark secret I've told two people. I'll start off by saying that I told my best friend and brother (at separate times) that I was raped by one of my brothers friends when I was 6 and he was 13. My best friends response was kind of just that I should tell my brother and that I dont need therapy because I seem okay, my brothers response was that I just shouldnt let this define me as a person and he kept asking me questions that made me feel like he thought I was lying about it and he also told me to get therapy. The other thing traumatic that happened was me being on a hardcore meth binge in 2012, I was only 16 at the time and I cant even remember the first time I did it, I remember staying up for 80 hours at a time and crawling on the ground with flashlights looking for leftover crystals to smoke and stealing from my neighbors and friends to fuel this addiction, I'm thankful that I was able to stop after a month or so but the way it stopped wasn't exactly pleasant. The main person I used to tweak out with was a friend and after a month of hardcore meth binging he wanted to move in with me and my parents and start selling it out of my house, I told him we cant do that because I dont want my family involved and that same weekend he came to my house with a strange dude and a gun and asked me "Are your parents awake?" I told him they weren't and he asked "Do they have a gun?" I responded that they do have a gun and his final response before SPRINTING out of my room at full speed and ransacking my house was "Well they better not wake up because if they do; I'll kill them" They didn't kill my parents and they were later arrested and served 3 months (thanks california) Other reasons that have pushed me to this point are the fact that my parents 100% did not want me to be born, my brother is 30, my sister is 33 and I am 22, they were supposed to be done having kids before my mother got pregnant with me. That basically meant that I received little to no attention from my parents, my father worked a night shift and slept all day so I've never really had a conversation with him nor can I because he speaks primarily spanish and can hardly speak english and I never learned spanish because I was never around him. Both my parents are good people but they got themselves in a ton of debt in between my siblings being born and me being born, this meant that they withdrew all their retirement funds to put my sister through college and bought her a car, she totaled that car and they bought her a new one, she also totaled that one and they helped her buy another one. They bought my brother two cars and helped co sign his last car he bought 6 years ago, the only time my parents have offered to help me was when they tried getting me to help buy THEM a car in their names and they would let me drive it, I don't live with them anymore but I still have to send them money monthly to help them with expenses since they are very old and my father is retired and my mom got fired from her job that paid well in 2014 and she settled for a job she is 200% over qualified for, she has a masters degree in business management and gets paid 14 dollars and hour and every time I tell her shes better than that she just shrugs me off and tells me thats the job she wants to retire from, I dont have any resent towards my parents, I have resent towards myself for even being born in the first place, everytime i look in the mirror I see a disgusting human being who deserves the worst in life, when I take my clothes off it is amplified by my disgusting body hair that has been the main subject for many people being grossed out or insulting me. I am so fucking tired of everything and two days ago I basically just ragequit my whole friend circle because they keep fucking ditching me, i told them it bothers me when they ditch me and they basically just laughed it off. What is the point of continuing? I'm 22 and I'm a grunt at my job, I hardly graduated high school so theres basically no chance of me getting into college and my teeth are completely FUCKED, i have to spent two thousand dollars I dont have on getting root canals, the pain is nothing compared to what i feel inside, i cant type anymore because im crying at this point
