no need for a title; the username is sufficient.I am one of the most stupid people on the planet; in whichever way you define a set of stupid people, you will find that I am invariably its member. The most true statement
about me is that I am stupid.

I cannot even live my own life without the help of my mother; I am a fucking 35 year old unemployed, kissless, virgin, man-child. Having been scared of people for all my life, I have no clue about building friendships and relationships. I am passive, and a mute; I want to speak, but I cannot speak since I can't remember much, and speaking causes anxiety, stress and exhaustion. 

I want to say that I want to live my life, but all I want to do is to live /a/ life. And even with that discount, I do not know how to /live/.

People tell me to learn things, but I do not know how to learn. Mistakes bring breakdowns; coping with those nervous fallouts leave me with very little chance of learning. Instead of learning how to build a relationship, my go-to choice is to live without a relationship.

It is heart-breaking to see people marrying, having kids and families. I see people talk, and I am unable to understand the reason they need to talk. Why the fuck does my mind want intimate experiences on one had, and then draw a blank on the other when asked the reason for talking?

To all those people whose hearts I have broken because of my ignorance and stupidity; please, please forgive me. I should not have been born, nor should I have been in your life. O God.
