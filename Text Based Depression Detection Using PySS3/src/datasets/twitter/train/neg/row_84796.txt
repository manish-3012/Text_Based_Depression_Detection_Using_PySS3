I feel unimportant and like I have nothing to live forNobody loves me or cares about me. I should just do it so I can stop bothering everybody. I have it all prepared I just need to write a note and I'll be ready. I wish someone needed me in this world or felt like I had some kind of importance or affect on their life. Instead I'm going to die the same way I live. Alone and with an empty heart
