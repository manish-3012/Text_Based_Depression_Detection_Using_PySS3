In my own headHere I sit again... Everyone else is asleep and I'm up in my room alone with my own thoughts. I honestly hate myself. Idk why... I feel alone even when I'm right next to someone. I've broken promises to my mom, sister and nieces. I had to pick up the bottle again and now I'm back where I was last year. 346 days thrown away....

A failure, loser, alcoholic, "fat lazy piece of shit" (according to my stepdad) who apparently can't have a opinion because "you've never worked a day on your life".

I'm done with the bullshit. Im done with all the failures. I'm just done....
