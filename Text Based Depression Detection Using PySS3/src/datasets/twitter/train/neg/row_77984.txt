Tired of living...I'm tired of living. I always tried to stay for this long for my family, my friends. But, sometimes I just, feel so tired of existing. It's mentally draining on me, because damn well I know I'm replaceable, and I would be shrugged off as another case of forgotten to the world. 

I desperately try staying for this long, each hour is even more draining than ever. Every day I contemplate whether if I disappeared it would be the best option for everyone. I'm a burden to this world. I know it... Everyone that knows me, would be happier if I just went away.
