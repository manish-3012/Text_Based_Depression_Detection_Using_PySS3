I'm in a really rough situationI posted to /r/OkCupid in this [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/OkCupid/comments/uqt94/in_a_difficult_spot_went_on_a_couple_dates_with_a/) and I'm just not feeling like a real really good about myself at all.  I've gotten some good posts but the worst are reinforcinging everything i hate about myself.  I just feel like shit and I'm really at the brink.
