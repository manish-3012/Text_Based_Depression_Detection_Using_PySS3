In a hospital waiting room by myself while the man that caused this sleeps comfy at homeOn Thursday at 4 am I caught my boyfriend cheating on me.   He still hasn't apppologized, he has encouraged me to kill myself, bought fresh razor blades for me, beat me up, and told me he isn't sorry and that I'm a worthless fatass.  Last night I cut every bit of skin I could reach and took a bunch of zanaflex.  I begged him to take me to a hospital and he wouldn't so I had to drive myself while nodding out, praying I'd crash into a pole.

It's been 2 hours sitting here now. I'm completely alone. The hospital keeps saying I'm just going Through withdrawal but I'm not I don't even use anything
