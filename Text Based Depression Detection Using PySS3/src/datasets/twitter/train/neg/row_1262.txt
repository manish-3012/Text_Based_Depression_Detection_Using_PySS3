When your parents don't understandI've dealt with depression for so long. Many stories, and a few attempts.
I'm in a better place at the moment, but have my moments.
The biggest understanding when you are okay is that, you dont want to reach out, because you dont want to be a burden, and when it's gotten so bad, you dont want to make your friends feel awful or guilty because you couldnt go to them, even though you wanted to.
The worst is when someone who is supposed to be there from your birth and tells you you're worthless and should just do it. You really choose your family. Choose wisely, theres always someone who wants to help you, and someone who will understand and listen. Even though I had my moments where I didnt even believe that
Thanks for the small vent
