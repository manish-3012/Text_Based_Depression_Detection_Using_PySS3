Suicidal all my lifeMy life has been shit, 
I cry myself to sleep almost everyday now,
asking myself "Why me?"
This is embarrassing and I don't want to talk without anyone in real life, because I don't want people think I'm "seeking attention"

I don't know,
I've always been able to express my true self on the internet better than face-to-face.
