I can't find a reason worth staying.I finally got a job. It sucks, I ended my night in agony. I'm fat at standing on hard cement for hours on end kills my feet and back. Its easy, but fucking mindless. Within minutes of being there I am sucked into the cattiness between co-workers. I am on my last leg. My parents have been taking care of my rent, and can't/don't want to help me anymore. They have payed my rent for over a year now and I just turned 25. the plumbing is messed up at my home so I have shut the water off. I have a dog there that needs care and I barely come by once a day to make sure he has food and water. I need to take him to the shelter, because he needs a better life. But I am scared he might not get adopted, although hes extremely friendly and I put a lot of effort into training him. I have a boyfriend, he cares about me but he is quite a bit younger than me. He doesn't understand, he shouldn't have to deal with this. I am starting to think he wants out but doesn't know how to go about it. Our relationship has been on the rocks for a couple of months now, and I think its really just my inability to be happy.

I have nothing I enjoy doing other than video games, nothing that inspires or motivates me. I freak out when around people, I freeze up, I can barely think of the right thing to say, my urge is to go hide in my car, or not leave home and I have to fight that with everything I have. Nothing that could be in life feels worth the effort I need to put forward to get there. I can't see my way out of this. I don't know what to do. Everything sounds like a lame excuse when I read it back to myself, but I am starting to care less and less, maybe I am being a little bitch about everything, but in death nothing will matter, I won't feel, and I wont care.
