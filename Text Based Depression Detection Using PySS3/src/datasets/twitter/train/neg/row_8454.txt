Seriously considering ending my miserable life.I live in a shitty country. 

I'm a child of a single mother, living with her, my grandma and older sister. I'm a 20 year old female, in university.

But the most important part about me is that I am a failure. 

My grades are average at best, I have no job, all my friends are smarter and academically/romantically more successful than I am.

I guess what made me post today is the fact that all this was pointed out by my mother a couple of hours earlier. And she is absolutely right about everything. I have no value.

I gained a lot of weight during 2011. I'm overweight. Add that to the list.

I've never had anyone love me.

Despite all this, the thing that really makes me want to kill myself is the bitter, bitter disappointment of my mother. She said that she is done supporting my sister and I, that from now on, she's looking after herself and herself only, because she is certain that we'll never do anything with our lives.

My mind is in shambles. If my own mother doesn't believe in me, then what the fuck am I still doing here?
