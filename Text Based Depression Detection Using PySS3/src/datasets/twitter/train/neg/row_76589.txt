"Hope for the best and prepare for the worst."One day ago I have tried again to contact one girl on social media that I really liked in school, in fact I have already done that but she blocked me a year ago on my main account after I talked to her, but now I had all the courage to do it again on my alt account to add her as a friend to have access to her profile (because it's set on private) and private messages too (they are set to friends only), and right now I haven't even checked if she did it or not, since I only sent her a friend request late in night (I was really scared to push that "Add as friend" button entire day, it was that scary for me, because I was worrying about the outcome and possibilities almost all day long). Well, I really don't know  if it will work out or not, but right now I want to check if she added me, declined the friend request or straight up blocked me and I am also really scared to do that. So, should I check it? If she declined it or even blocked me again, I guess I will try to commit suicide and it's going to be just enough reason to do it, because it will just stack up on top of my other problems in life and other really bad stuff that I don't like. 

P. S. Sorry if it wasn't related to anything that has been posted here, I just wanted to share my side of the story, I guess we'll see how it goes.
