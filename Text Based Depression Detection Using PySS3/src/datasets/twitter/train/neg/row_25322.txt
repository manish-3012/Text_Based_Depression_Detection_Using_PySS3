Last day on EarthHi
I'm an ordinary student (I study at a good university, but I don't think that it makes me special). Today Iâ€™m having a representation theory test, after which Iâ€™ll take a little walk and kill myself.
Nothing makes me happy and despite all my abilities and a possible scientific career, I think about committing suicide, since I do not see anything good in my existence. 

Take care of your loved ones and give them the belief that someone needs them.
