My plan to end the tortureI'm sick of all this shit I have to put up with. People leave me out and others mock that I'm alone. I'm slowly losing my mind. Tomorrow, at school I'm going to take all the medicine I can find in the drawer and if I'm left out again, it will be the last time. I have one friend that i suddenly stopped messaging at new years because I found out people were talking behind my back from her and I just wanted to be alone but I started messaging her today as a final "goodbye please don't hate me". I'm sorry if this makes no sense in the end, I'm in a scrambled mindset
