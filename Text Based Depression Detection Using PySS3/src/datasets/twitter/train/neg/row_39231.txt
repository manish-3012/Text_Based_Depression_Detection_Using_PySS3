A thank you noteThis thank you note might not be what you're expecting,

I want to say thank you reddit for sticking with me in rough times and always there for me when i really need your help you guys are like the friend i never had
The thing is i'm at that point in life where the choices are to go on and live forever a failure or to kill myself and die happy
I've been bullied by my whole class
I'm at the brink of not graduating my class for this year
My "friends" are slowly pulling away

I'm an annoying little bitch and i can't stop hating myself because of that

I'm so fucking stupid it's not even funny

Right now i'm holding a noose to end it all
Reply what you want but i'll probably be dead the next hour or so

So what i'm trying to say is that you guys are awesome for trying to save many strangers life and i hope you all the best in your life, i hope it's not as painful as mine. I write this note because i don't have anyone significant in my life to give a suicide note to except you guys.
