I hate lifeI got fucking laid off from sprint after t mobile bought them, now In severe financial debt, canâ€™t receive unemployment benefits because something says Iâ€™m already receiving them when Iâ€™m not. Cried for hours after being fired because I knew that meant so long to reality, and got brought to a mental institute for a few days because â€œpeople are angry when that happens not upset, and just because you lost your job doesnâ€™t mean you are gonna dieâ€ I have so many things I gotta pay off to stay out of severe debt and that job paid well. The next best I can get into is fucking McDonaldâ€™s and their barely minimum wage rat hole. Thereâ€™s no point in being in debt and not being able to do anything about it if you can easily end it all. If anyone knows a painless way please tell me, Iâ€™m looking for one and I donâ€™t want pain on the way out.
