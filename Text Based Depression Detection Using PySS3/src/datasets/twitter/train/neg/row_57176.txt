$700 Involuntary Hospital Bill I Can't AffordLong story short I was forced by police to go to the hospital for making suicidal statements while drunk (parents overheard and reported me). Well I was locked in a hospital room all day and they did NOTHING to treat me for alcohol overdose despite the fact that I'd consumed 2 bottles of wine in like an hour. Well I was sent a bill for $700 for that one night. The next morning when I'd sobered up I tried to convince them my comments were due to being intoxicated but they still forced me to go to a mental hospital for 7 days. 

Anyway I have no money and neither does my family. They have sent me threatening letters saying if I don't pay the $700, I will be sent to collections and have bad credit. So I'm locked up and told I'm basically sub-human and unfit to participate in society, but yet they expect me to be productive enough to come up with $700 to pay them? LOL. My parents offered to pay but they are already broke and highly in debt trying to take care of all my various siblings. The whole lock-up and massive bill makes me only want to die EVEN MORE.
