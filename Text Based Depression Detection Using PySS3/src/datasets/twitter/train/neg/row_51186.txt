I will goHey, im Felix.
I have depression since i was 13, right now im 17, i have been happy for one year but now live just hits me harder and harder in the face. Today i totally fucked up, ive lost the only "friend" i could talk about that stuff by a f*cking stupid mistake. i would tell someone who just cares a bit in pm. Well, im pretty down. i dont think i will survive the Night. 

See you at whereever it ends.
Felix
