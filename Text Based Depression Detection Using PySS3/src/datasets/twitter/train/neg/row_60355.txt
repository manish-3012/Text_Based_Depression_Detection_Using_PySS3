feel like i can't get out of the world i createdin my mind, i live a completely different version of life. it's daydreaming, but to such an intense extent that it has replaced parts of actual reality. i imagine myself having friends, having conversations, having deep emotional bonds with those around me. the people in question can be anyone, really. usually ex friends, ex boyfriends but it can be someone i've just met, or someone i saw on the metro that caught my eye and my brain whirled a story together. the stories are so intense and immersive that i often catch myself doing things like laughing, talking or whispering, andmaking facial expressions as if my body was really in these daydreams. the happiness and excitement i feel in those daydreams, when i'm having a good time with a friend for example, is so real that i cant help but smile and my stomach tightens the way it does when you're about to go down a rollercoaster. i dont have that in real life.

 in real life i have no friends, i have recently also broken up with my ldr boyfriend which officially meant i no longer have a connection with any person outside of my family, which consists of my mom, dad and sister.i'm close with my sister, not so much parents.

it's so sad, man. i know. but i don't know how to stop. i have gone too far and now i don't know how to come back. even writing this was hard because i am so not used to expressing myself anymore. i can feel my mind wanting to pull me back into daydreaming. one of my only coping mechanisms is imagining myself in therapy sessions, and letting myself vent everything out and try to calm things down, or assess a situation or just stop myself from committing suicide. i managed to get 12 free sessions of (actual) therapy and went to one before covid hit and everything closed, but i find it so hard to just like... form coherent sentences? i feel like i don't know how to speak anymore. even with typing this, i feel like its just all random babble that goes all over the place, this whole issue has been going on for around three years but these last two have been a really steep downward spiral. i feel too scared to try and get therapy now because i know it will be on webcam or over the phone. i just can't do without talking to someone in person, someone i can see and just physically have near me.

i feel like i have lost the ability to connect with other humans. i am rotting from the inside out. i fear its too late to undo what ive done to my life. 

i have been free of self harm for 4 years now but lately the urge has been so strong that i think i willcave in soon. the craving becomes so intense that i can feel this tenseness, almost tingling feeling under my skin anticipating the sharp pain of the blade. even after all these years, the feeling is imprinted into my skin.

i just need to let this out to someone outside of my imagination. i feel like this loneliness is going to kill me. i can't take it anymore. i hate myself for what ive done. i don't know what to do anymore
