Iâ€™m tired of tough loveI I just want someone to give me a hug and say theyâ€™ll help me with my struggles. I just want someone to help me get out of bed and motivate me to accomplish my goals. I wish people would notice me actually trying. I hate being told to just act happy and â€œdo esteemable actions.â€ But thatâ€™ll never happen. I guess itâ€™s best to die now.
