Help.i really need someone. I dont know what to do, a year ago I was a a coligate athlete with a full scholarship studying nursing with a ton of friends, life was great. The whole time i was using drugs just recreationally nothing too serious. I have since been thrown out of school and lost everything and everyone in my life since then. Including everyone in my family, now i go day to day sticking a needle in my arm just to try to forget. But the last few days have really been it. I need someone to talk to badly. I want to die. So horribly just want to die. Please help me. Please. Im really about to do this. Theres no one for me to call, nothing im homeless. Please help. This is really going to be it i think. Im sorry for how this potentially will effect anyone who does care. Please just pm talk about anything i just need someone to talk to. Im alone always roaming streets. I cant do this anymore i am begging anyone who sees this. Thanks, im sorry.
