Grades are in the gutter, mom is abusive, need help. Need more options.Throwaway here because friends know my reddit username. Don't want them to find out.

My grades are in the gutter. And by that, I mean some C's, a couple B's and couple of A's. My mom turns (and will turn) really abusive and destructive against me when she sees those grades (that is, when she gets the report card via e-mail). I have until January 14th to do something. Currently in 10th grade, 16 years old.

To note, she threatens to send me to prep school in America if my grades are crap. They evidently are.

I'm trying really really hard to see how far up I can get my grades.

Abusive: she will beat the ever-loving shit out of me. Verbal assault and insults have no effect on me. Sometimes will kick me out of the house for a minute, then changes her mind and beats me again.

I currently live in Jordan; my step-dad (who I know as "dad" - we're close) is either unable to/doesn't want to do anything about it. I can't run away, not in the middle of winter. I do not have anywhere else to go, nor do I know what the US Embassy will do to help me. But my step-dad has no legal parental rights over me - my deadbeat of a biological dad doesn't want to give up his rights. Asshole doesn't pay shit for child support and uses my rights (which he can take away as he pleases) as leverage against my mom.

I can't do much. I need options. Please. I have until January 14th.
