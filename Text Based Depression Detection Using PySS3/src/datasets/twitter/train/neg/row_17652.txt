Been feeling depressive recently.14 and I'm already feeling like I'm worth nothing, I'm academically incompetent, I have no real life friends, I don't have anything at all that makes me want to wake up in the morning, I don't feel comfortable talking to my parents or siblings, I just want it all to be over. I'm sure I'm the 10 billionth person to say all these things but I don't feel comfortable saying any of this anywhere else but beyhind a keyboard.
