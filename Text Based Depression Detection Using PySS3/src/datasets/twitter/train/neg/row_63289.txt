At a lossI am a poster here, but throwaway account for reasons. 

Not sure where to air this but I feel comfortable here and Midnight Organ Fight has been getting me through it as best as possible. 

Today, my suspicions of my now ex came to light. Sheâ€™d been cheating on me with her last ex and lied about it all the way through to me. The first time I caught it, she was blowing him off but did meet up with him to â€˜talkâ€™ but who knows if thatâ€™s true. 

This ex was someone who she told me assaulted her and she got a restraining order on while she was with me. Turns out, that was a lie too. 

The first time I let it go because I loved her, and took her word that sheâ€™d stop talking to em. 

Last night, I found the nail in the coffin, absolutely lewd comments, plans for a weekend getaway, love and moving in together (weâ€™ve lived together for a few months). When I questioned it she still lied and kept it going until the bitter end. 

I know itâ€™s good that Iâ€™m made the jump and packed all her stuff but for someone whoâ€™s suffering from an anxiety disorder and depression itâ€™s so hard not to think what I did wrong or that I caused all of this. She tells me she was unhappy but why not talk to me about it when I asked? Or end it yourself? Why put someone through all of that. 

Also, to add insult to all of this, I lost my job last week and prior to that she was trying to get her ex hired. We worked together, how could she not see the fault in all of that? 

Iâ€™m at such a loss right now but trying to persevere.
