I just want to not existI have had enough of feeling like this. 

I feel like shit 24/7. I have depression &amp; social anxiety.  I have no friends, I think I'm in love with someone I can't have. And even if I could, there is a side to her personality I hate. But I keep talking to her, I'm trying to help her with her issues. She is the closest thing I have to a friend. 

I have a history with self harm, and recently I started again. I think I've become addicted to it. It's the best thing I have right now. 

Everytime I'm left alone with my thoughts, I realise how much I hate myself, and how little I can do about it. I have high sex drive, but I haven't been with anyone in almost 3 years. That frustration is adding to things for me now. I would like to be able to go out, go back to a woman's place, etc. But I can't do that. Even better would be a fwb type deal for me, but I don't know if I could handle her being with other people too. 

I know this is all over the place, but I'm done caring. 
I just want to not exist anymore. There is no reason for me to be around still. I offer nothing to no one. Despite knowing what I can and want to offer, I never get the chance to. 

I guess this could be goodbye, if anyone cared.
