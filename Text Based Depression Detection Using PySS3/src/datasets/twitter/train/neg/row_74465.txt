Bye guysI think tonightâ€™s the night. I donâ€™t see any point anymore. itâ€™s been a blast but itâ€™s my time to go. thank you guys for the support youâ€™ve shown me in the past. My lifeâ€™s been getting worse and worse for months and iâ€™ve realised that this life just isnâ€™t made for me. As a buddhist i believe that when i die iâ€™ll be reincarnated, but by killing myself, i wonâ€™t achieve that. I donâ€™t want to. I just want it to end. Once again, thank you everyone. Donâ€™t have too much fun without me :)
