Life, are you trying to tell me something?I've been struggling with some very serious issues and been thinking a lot about suicide recently. Like so many of us, I want the easy, painless, sure-fire death that just doesn't exist.

I've been fighting like hell to keep going and come up with ways to fix my problems. Today was the day I'd planned to do it, but I'm still hanging on. People in here are so amazingly great. We may be suicidal hot messes, but we're good folks inside. 

Today I treated myself with Chinese for lunch.

*My fortune cookie was empty*. I know it was just an unfortunate coincidence, but it sure felt like a big "fuck you" from life.
