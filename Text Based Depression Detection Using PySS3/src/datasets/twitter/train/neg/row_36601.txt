AdviceIâ€™ve been talking to my friends tonight about mental health and 2 of them opened up about how they are doing and that their mental health was crap. I deal with mental health problems, mainly anxiety and have a history of self harming. I tried to understand but I now feel if I tell them then I will be seen as an attention seeker when really I just want to talk to them about my problems but Iâ€™m struggling.
