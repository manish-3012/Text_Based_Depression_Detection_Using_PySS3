My feelings during the final days.I figure that people over the internet are a closer family than those in my own house. I guess that means I'll write this to you. I always wanted to be a scientist. Ever since I was a little kid. I would read and study and watch just to flood my imagination of what I could do. I can't help but think that all the people who helped me try to reach that dream will feel betrayed. My parents, my teachers. All for naught. That is what is tearing into me as I write. The fact that I fucked it up for myself and everyone. The fact that yet another person has met the scythe. The fact that I'm scared and all I can do to stop it is the one thing that will make it worse for everyone else. So fucking tired of it. 

I'm sorry about my ramblings and especially so if they come off as just a whiny perspective on things.
