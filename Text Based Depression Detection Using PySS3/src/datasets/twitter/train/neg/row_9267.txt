my life is great but I'd rather dieI'm a 16 year old female. My life is good, I am doing amazingly at school, I have a couple of close friends I can talk to, I go out and do usual teenagery things. I feel so privileged compared to most people on this sub. I'm so excited for my future, to go to uni and get a good job. My family life isn't good- disabled mum and borderline abusive sister (she used to be much worse) but I can deal with that now, my sister could be trashing my room and I can just sit with a straight face and let it not bother me. Despite my life being good and not being more sad than a usual person- i can't shake off these suicidal thoughts I've been having since I was a child. A couple of months ago, I attempted suicide, ended up in ICU for a few days, got discharged and got seen by the children's mental health service. Okay cool- had a few appointments, opened up about everything and virtually told that there was nothing wrong with me despite saying that I thought I was still at risk.


Everyday, I always think of killing myself no matter what mood i'm in, I could be ecstatic and just think 'wouldn't this be a great moment to end it'. It's a record player in my head, every few days or so i'll fantasize about a different method I could use. Despite looking forward to the future i'm more excited to die. Now I know that I am capable of attempting, it gives me more strength to do it again and hopefully succeed.
