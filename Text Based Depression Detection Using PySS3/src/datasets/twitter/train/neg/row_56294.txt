Honestly just ready to stay up tonight and keep trying until I get it over withItâ€™s been a stressful day. Iâ€™ve had countless intrusive thoughts, Iâ€™ve had self harm problems, I got yelled at by my abusive dad for not doing enough and not taking care of myself when he doesnâ€™t understand how hard that is, Iâ€™ve dealt with not feeling adequate and feelings of being a burden to just about everyone that loves me. 

It was my best friends birthday today and I even wasted his time by having him listen to me and my dumb problems while he sat there and helped me out. I probably ruined the whole mood of his birthday, and I wouldnâ€™t be surprised if I did. Hopefully he wonâ€™t have to deal with me anymore after this.

Hopefully no one will.

Iâ€™m tired of not doing enough, of not being enough, or feeling like the only thing Iâ€™m gonna do with my life is fail at every goal I want to achieve and end up sticking by as a bum at home. Why should anyone have to put up with me anymore?

Goodbye, I guess. I bet this rant was dumb just like everything else I do, but I figured I should get it out there anyways.
