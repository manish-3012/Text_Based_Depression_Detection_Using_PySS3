something.something inside me broke. something inside me. somewhere. something snapped. in the last two or so weeks. 

the part inside me that makes me function as a real person died. 

there are longings. yes. some way to bring back whoever got lost. 
but. mostly. thereâ€™s just emptiness. 

pain so deep it numbs my whole body. 

i wake up almost every day. tired. 
just. exhausted. 

this kind of exhaustion isnâ€™t physical. although sometimes it sits in my body. 
it feels like a big brick is sitting in the middle of my chest and i canâ€™t breathe?

*how* can there be so much pain? 

acres and acres of deep exhausting pain. 

i think about my death every day. 
every day i get closer to driving the knife into my wrists. 

i canâ€™t wait. 

the day to not be in pain anymore is coming and i just. canâ€™t. wait.
