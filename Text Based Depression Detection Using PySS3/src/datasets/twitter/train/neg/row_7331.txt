I'm not depressed. I see myself for the pathetic dumb ugly trash that I am.It's not depression speaking. I've lived long enough to know, objectively, I really AM that dumb, that awkward, that ugly. 

So knowing that, there's no need for me to put up with life anymore, pretending that "things will get better" because again I know for a fact that they won't. 

And anyway the world's (or at least my country) gone to shit probably permanently. No better time, no more obvious cue. 

I'll write my note tonight after work.
