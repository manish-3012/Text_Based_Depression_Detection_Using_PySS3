There's a bridge next to my jobSo I've been thinking about it for a while. What's the purpose of life? I feel rejected more than anything. I feel ugly. I have an addiction to grindr and I can't stop using it for validation except I don't really get any validation. I just get ignored so im thinking of doing it tomorrow before work. I know after this , this will be it but what else do I got to lose. I have a big heart but guys seem to not care or maybe it's just cause I'm black and I hit up too many white guys. But fuck. Sometimes I just wanna talk yet they won't even talk to me. I know it's just an app but when no one ever comes up to you in person or ignores you then what else? I can't even focus on my hmwk because of this.  I just wish I was white. Im disgusting and ugly because of my skin color so I think tomorrow will be the day.
