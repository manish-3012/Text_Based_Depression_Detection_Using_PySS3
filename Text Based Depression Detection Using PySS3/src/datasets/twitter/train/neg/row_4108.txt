It's too late. Only a slight glimmer of hope.Doesn't matter what happens now...i've pretty much raised my white flag. Anymore bad events that occur before this year ends (I end) will just send me over the edge even faster. Right now I'm hanging by a thread of hope that someone, somewhere will hire me and I can start moving on with my life. This is not living. I am dying a little. Every. Single. Day. Until no more me. Everyday I wake up in the shoes of what my mother wants me to do. Not what I want to do. At this age, it is sad. Defeating. Disappointing. And having a  narcissistic mother doesn't help at all. I told her, begged her to let me have my way. I told her i won't survive another year like this. She said, go die then. Well. Whatever, I'm all talked out. To parents, friends, exs, everybody. I just want to disappear. Live this year as much as possible pleasing my mother like i always have, and having the little time i have left to enjoy life. Because there will not be another year of this. I will not pass another birthday alone, no celebrations for the past few years because it only enhances my failures as a person. Fin.
