Fuck my lifeIâ€™m just done.. what else can I possibly do? Iâ€™m basically facing a giant brick wall. I need plungers to climb to the other side of the wall but the plungers are on the other side. So basically I need plungers to climb the wall but I need to climb the wall to get the plungers. Thatâ€™s pretty much my life in a nutshell

Itâ€™s actually kind of funny.. actually no this isnâ€™t funny at all. If things had just gone the way they were SUPPOSED to go I wouldnâ€™t be venting

Iâ€™m not talking about the pandemic ruining my plans. Itâ€™s my fucking parents that keep ruining my plans. They were the ones that prevented me from going to a job interview because of their irrational fears of COVID 19. I found a way to make money by delivering with postmates. I was going to use that money to fund my business but that had to be taken away too because my parents are now door dashing. Because both of my parents having jobs apparently isnâ€™t paying the bills

Itâ€™s because most of that money is going to my momâ€™s non profit organization. It wouldnâ€™t even be a problem if it didnâ€™t affect our lives but it does. She always pays the phone bill late, we have resorted to free school food to survive

Then sheâ€™ll complain about us never having enough money for anything and blaming everyone else but herself. If youâ€™re going to invest that kind of money into a business you donâ€™t GET to complain about being broke. Thatâ€™s what my starter pack meme was making fun of. People like her

Iâ€™m broke because of her incompetence. Not my laziness. I had ways of making money but she had to fucking take it all away

Now Iâ€™m struggling as well and thereâ€™s nothing I can do about it. I only have 5 dollars to my name. This is just a rant. Nobody is going to give me good advice but Iâ€™m not here for advice. Itâ€™s just a rant because Iâ€™ll be banned if I vent anywhere else
