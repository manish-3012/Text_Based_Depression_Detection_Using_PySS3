i just don't care anymoreHey guys so this isn't a super long thing but idk it's just like, what's the point. I don't even know where to start other than just what's the point. 

So I failed out of college like 3 months ago. Right after that I started talking to this girl and things were absolutely amazing for the first like 2 months. We dated for awhile. Then she just ghosted on me and now we're talking again but she's just using me to get free 100s on homework assignments and papers, like that's clearly all it is. And it's just like, why. If this is what life is then I don't want to do it

She's the only person who ever liked me, and now has just completely discarded me. Doesn't care at all. I wish she would just hate me because then at least I matter

All I do is go to the gym, then go to work and stay as late there as I possibly can doing work and then just talking to coworkers, then come home and text Ashley for a little while and cry myself to sleep. That's it that's all I do every day. And I'm tired of it. I was going to jump after I failed college but I stuck around to see what happens with Ashley but since that didn't work out, why not go ahead and do it. Seriously why not. I just can't get up the courage but I have a bottle of vodka so I'm hoping maybe I can drink a lot of that and have the courage to finally jump. Fuck this, it's not worth it.
