Iâ€™ve hit such a low pointIm doing intensive research on all the methods of suicide. This is the closest iâ€™ve come to actually doing it. Hell, I probably wouldâ€™ve done it by now if I had the right resources. What is the fucking point? itâ€™s been 6 years. it keeps getting worse. is it so much to ask for to just be happy.
