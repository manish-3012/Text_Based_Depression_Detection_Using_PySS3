Days away from the end.I don't think I will kill myself tonight.

But I can slowly feel myself reaching the end of my rope. I'm tired, my body feels sore, I just have this sick, empty feeling in my chest all the time. I can hardly stand to get out of my bed at all. I want to spend days alone, just with my thoughts. My thoughts that hurt me.

My dad died five months ago. Suddenly, unexpectedly. I tried CPR. I watched as the EMTs couldn't revive him. We're about to lose our house. My relationship with my boyfriend, my best friend, is on the verge of ending, due to no fault other than my own. I have no future, no achievements, nothing to my name. I hurt everyone around me. I'm crazy. I spend every day wanting to self harm. I'm sick to my stomach thinking about my life. I don't see a way out of it. No way out -- except the end. 

I'm scared. I don't know how to ask for help. But I know I won't last much longer.
