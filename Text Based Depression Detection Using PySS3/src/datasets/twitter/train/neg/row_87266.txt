Can someone please pray for me. Please contact my wife for me and ask her to remember the good and forget and forgive thrbadI used to have so many girlfriends after always being called ugly by 22 I had turned it around was always called hot and handsome and traveled to dozens of coutnries.

MY jealous mom. Dad, uncle. Aunt, and my second cousins all hated on me so much and fuked it up.

Only my wife knew the truth and told me let's move out and I should cut out those people but I didn't.

MY idiot dad would betray me and make me look bad by my uncle who controlled our family millions for some reason then when he got cut off he calls me crying trying to make me turn on my uncle.

MY uncle had my wife's number and would call her which is unacceptable. So would my uncles wife and talk about her problems making me look bad.

When my wife got pregnant when I was 22 my mom wasn't happy and acted like it's the end of the world even though her dumbass self always said "look people ur age have kids and a wife and house and family"

This led me to snort oxycodone and abuse drugs until I started injecting it.

One day in april 2018 I said I'm driving the canyons but went to get drugs. My wife hated that and next day she left me.

MY lifr has been miserable since. Lost everything my friends my life my cars worth over $150,000 my $300k per year business.

I can't continue unless I'm with her. Deep down I know she loves me too but is too stubborn to admit it.,neither one of us have had sex for two years. She obsessed with her ex that she dumped twice who's already married and hates me for it.

Coyle skmeone maybe here please offer to contact her for me and talk to her about me?
