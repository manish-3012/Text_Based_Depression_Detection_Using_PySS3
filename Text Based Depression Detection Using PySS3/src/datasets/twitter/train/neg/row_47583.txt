I donâ€™t want to be in the psychiatric ward again.I want to end my life because Iâ€™m scared my illness will get worse and Iâ€™ll be involuntarily sent to the psychiatric ward again. I was there a few weeks ago and the one where I live sucks. They wonâ€™t even allow you to read, youâ€™re forced to basically sit on your bed in a room for days with only your mind (which makes everything worse, at least in my case) In my head, I figured that if Iâ€™m dead, I wonâ€™t have to deal with this. I really donâ€™t know what to do anymore.
