GoodbyeTomorrow is it for me. I'm lived for 14 years, of which 14 of them have been living hell. I may be young, but I do believe I've lived long enough. I do not believe I'm mentally ill, just rational in my actions. Suffering is inevitable - until death of course. Why not just end it earlier? I don't have many resources, but it's going to be painful, and I know it. But what I do know is that it'll be worth it in the end.

Goodbye.
