Why bother tryingIâ€™m not at risk for immediate suicide at the moment however I do want to share a feeling I think might be relatable and could use some advice. What reason do I have to put any effort into anything if I feel like itâ€™ll only backfire? My life has mostly just been a series of vein attempts of living a life Iâ€™m happy with. It seems any time I have the motivation to accomplish anything, even the smallest tasks, I somehow fail. And I soon learned that Iâ€™m better off not trying at all and that has led me to where Iâ€™m at now, a college dropout living with my mom with no solid plans for a future. In college I was suicidal and still kind of am but after being in quarantine for months and being idle I have this desire to actually put effort into something once more. Is it even worth it or will I just come to the same conclusion as I did before? Which is, that I should just stop trying.
