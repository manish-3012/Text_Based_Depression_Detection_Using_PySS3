I tried to talk to a school counsellorIt didn't work. I talked to her and organised to meet her at 2:30 today but she was talking to another student until 3:15 leaving me 15 mins before the end of school. All I got to ask was "theoretically, if a student told you they had suicidal thoughts, who would you have to tell?". Her answer "I would have to tell the parents". In a sticky situation now cause no way do I want my parents to know again. They freaked out so much the first time I told my boyfriend which told them. Only problem is the counsellor obviously knows I'm suicidal now from me asking that question.
