i feel like such a fraudi have suicidal thoughts everyday. when i am alone, when i am with family/friends  you know the usual. but there will be times where im laughing and having fun my brain thinks that my thoughts are just fake because if i was really suffering then i wouldnâ€™t be able to enjoy certain moments. i hate my head.
