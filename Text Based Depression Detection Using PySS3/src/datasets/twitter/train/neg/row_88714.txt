My brother wants to commit suicide. What do I do?Iâ€™m 26 my brother is 24 and he is stuck on killing himself. We are broke and make just enough money to get by. He doesnâ€™t have health insurance so he couldnâ€™t afford to talk to a psychiatrist or see a doctor. He says heâ€™s depressed and just wants life to end already. It is all he talks about now. He wants to find an easy way to kill himself because he wants nothing in life and the world is a terrible place. He wants to buy a gun or do too much heroin from what he says. Heâ€™s a recovering heroin addict that has been off and on lately. He has no ambition or drive. He has no hobbies, nothing. I donâ€™t know what to do or how to help him. I try telling him to think of what would make him happy and work towards those goals but he always has something negative to say or doesnâ€™t want any of it. He just wants to be dead.
