I am very done.Cut a long story short, my trusted long term partner suddenly ghosted me for the 3 months of quarantine after taking my virginity and then came back to dump me over text (it was brutal). I am still utterly heartbroken and disillusioned. My close friends have all moved away to college while I was rejected from my wanted school and forced to stay here in my hometown. I can't get a job and am stuck at home with my alcoholic depressed parents for the next year at least. 

I am completely and utterly alone. 

I was depending solely on making friends in college clubs but now it's all online and clubs are cancelled. I can't hold up the slightest shred of optimism anymore. I genuinely do not know what to do.

I'm seriously considering killing myself. I know that things 'will get better in the future' or whatever bs but I don't think I can hold on long enough to see that. I try to get up and be positive and exercise and everything but by the end of the day I'm worn down and disappointed and cry all night. I've done nothing wrong to anyone but the universe is laughing at me and throwing down more and more shit. I promised myself 6 months ago things would improve and they've only gotten worse. 

I keep seeing stories of people partying or moving into their dorms or with their s/o making the most of this last year and its like salt to wound. If I couldn't have love or my course, at the very very least I just wanted to have friends. I tried to reconnect with some people but it's like I'm broken or something. 

I have absolutely nothing. I don't know what to do.
