I tried to get help but they don't care.I talked to my doctor and a therapist and  they don't listen to me they brush off any thing i say and only hear the key words they want. Fuck these sugar pills my doctor keeps prescribing me. I have lost all hope in getting any help I'm growing more and more suicidal everyday. I had a dream last night i jumped off a roof and hit the ground and everything went black. Maybe that's how I'm meant to die
