Iâ€™m so tired of trying to be strongI left my insurance job and started working at a doggy day care which doesnâ€™t pay well and Iâ€™m struggling in debt. My sister wants to get an apartment together but I canâ€™t afford it. I also lost my virginity at 25 and it was amazing but of course it was short lived. Iâ€™m sitting in my room crying and sobbing because I feel worthless and a failure. I have these thoughts that creep in telling me Iâ€™m not going to make it to Christmas. I wish I had someone who can hold me and tell me itâ€™s going to be ok.
