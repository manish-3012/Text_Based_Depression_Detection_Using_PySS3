My life is so pointless and hopelessI wasted my time and money getting a bachelor's degree that hasn't done shit for me, and that was 3 years ago.  I didn't even get to enjoy the social part of college because I'm a weirdo and I lived at home and commuted to school

I work at a fast food restaurant at 26 years old at the bottom of the chain.  26 with a degree working at a fucking fast food place.  What the hell.  I've tried my best to get a career job but I haven't even gotten an email back for my efforts.  

Life is so goddamn pointless.  I have type 1 diabetes and it feels like a marathon that never ends, only if you stumble or fall you could die a painful death from diabetic complications.  

What's the point of waking up each morning and trying if it'll get you no where?  Especially if you could die at any moment from some dumb ass disease 

There are people out there who make money so easily.  "Just invest in rental properties", "Run a UPS drop shop", "become a real estate agent".  Like making money is just a joke and they do it for fun.  I'm here scraping the bottom of the barrel to pay off my student loans and live with my parents and there are people out there with more money than they know what to do with.  

I'm so tired of life.  My best effort doesn't get me anywhere near a rich person's casual effort.  I'm stuck here living with my parents.  Living with a disease that will inevitably kill me one day, either directly from complications, or from suicide when I lose a limb.  

I'm so fucking tired.  I just want to sleep forever
