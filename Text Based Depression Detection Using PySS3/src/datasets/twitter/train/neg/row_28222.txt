8 years; new here.I'm new on this subreddit and didn't know where to turn. I guess I just feel like happiness is just a fleeting moment in my life. What is good, never lasts.

I guess the majority of my depression started when I was 14. I was a virgin and ended up being drugged and gang raped by 3 guys. My 'friends' weren't there for me and denied that they did anything wrong. The case was thrown out because there was no proof that it wasn't consensual. 

After that happened, my parents took away my phone and internet because I was getting death threats. I couldn't go to school (not that I wanted to) and I didn't leave my house.

A couple of months go by and I find out I'm pregnant. I could still get an abortion at that time but my mom didn't let me. I gave her up for adoption and it was another loss. 

A year later I am able to start socializing again. I go out with some friends and the girls I was with left. I figured it'd be okay since I was in my neighborhood. The boys I knew said that they promised their friend I would have sex with him. Apparently they heard I was easy. So it happened again. This memory was repressed until very recently. I didn't tell anyone because I was ostracized the first time. 

I turned to alcohol and drugs to cope. When I was 16, my friend and I overdosed and I almost killed him.

I've had a few abusive relationships including one where my boyfriend set his dog on fire. The most recent abusive relationship included being choked in a bar. 

I'm so lost and every day I keep asking what I did wrong to deserve my life. 

When I was 20 I said that if things don't improve by the time I'm 30, I would commit suicide. 8 more years.
