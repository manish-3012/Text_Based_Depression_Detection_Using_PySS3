Confused and FrustratedThis is obviously a throw-away account.

I am not yet in crisis.  But I know I am swiftly reaching that point.

I am 30 years old, not married.  I have two advanced degrees.  I work two jobs.  I am fairly successful.  I am disabled, but it's something that I can work with.  I fought for everything I have.

I have a caring but dysfunctional family.  They are less well-off than me financially, and sometimes I feel as though the only thing KEEPING me from going into crisis is the fact that I am the only one keeping the different groups of my family afloat.  I don't say this to brag.  I say this for perspective.  It should not be this way.

I shouldn't feel this way, but I feel so empty.  Not in the spiritual or religious sense.  Just... like there's a hole.  A malfunction.  I have horrible luck in relationships, but there are people worse off than I am.

I have been screened for depression.  After several rounds of different medications, I was taken off of all of the pills.  They just did not seem to make a dent.

I feel so ungrateful.

Like I said, I'm not in crisis.  But I just needed to get this out.
