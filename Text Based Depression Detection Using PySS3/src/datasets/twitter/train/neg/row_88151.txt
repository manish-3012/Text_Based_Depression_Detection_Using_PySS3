Think I fucked upSo yesterday I swallowed pretty much all of my medication with the intent to die. I've (barely) thrown up once and had to use the bathroom twice, but otherwise I feel fine. I don't know what to do right now. On the one hand I feel like I want to keep waiting and hope something clicks and finishes the job, but on the other I feel like with how much I downed last night, I should be dead already. Yet somehow I'm still here like all I did was eat some bad food. I think I have a somewhat renewed interest in living because of this (I spent time looking through the symptoms on overdosing on the medicines I took, but I have experienced only two symptoms), but honestly I'm scared about having to see the expression on my mother's face if I tell her that I just tried to kill myself. I'm not afraid of dying, but that honestly is a look I don't want to see. I don't really know why I'm posting this, but I guess I'm really confused right now. It's like that scene in Pulp Fiction where Jules Winnfield just realized he should have died from the gunshots and gets spiritual. I guess I've entered a contemplative state and need some guidance. Don't really trust my wisdom right now so for once in my life I'm reaching out.
