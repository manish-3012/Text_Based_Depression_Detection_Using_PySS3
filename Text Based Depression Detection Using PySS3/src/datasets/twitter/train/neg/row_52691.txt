Need helpTrying to get better but  I keep having suicidal thoughts. I want to get better and trying my hardest but I think Iâ€™m severely bipolar. When Iâ€™m with my family and friends Iâ€™m having a good time but, at times I hold myself back from becoming fully happy because I know my happiness wonâ€™t last. Iâ€™ve had depression probably all my life and this is kinda new to me but Iâ€™m at the edge and for some reason I always find myself coming back to the edge. 

Iâ€™m not scared of death. Iâ€™m scared of leaving my family and friends guilt ridden and confused because Iâ€™ve portrayed myself as a happy person all my life Theyâ€™re going to be sad and confused on why I did it. 

The thing is my mind and thoughts are in a constant war between wanting to kill myself or becoming better. Iâ€™m very pessimistic about life because Iâ€™ve had a very shit life. I didnâ€™t learn how to cope with it in a healthy way and it manifested in a lot of shitty ways of what I thought was right, but a lot of what I thought was right was a lie I told myself so it was easier to cope with.

Iâ€™ve started realizing a lot of my wrongdoings a few months ago and Iâ€™ve been reevaluating my entire life on what would be a good step forward in a positive direction, but the things Iâ€™ve done in the past just makes me want to kill myself even more because they were that bad and Iâ€™ve hurt people along the way. 

I canâ€™t forgive myself for some of the things Iâ€™ve done, and having to fight this thing inside my head is exhausting. Itâ€™s tiring and Iâ€™m at the end of my rope. Iâ€™m not scared of death, but knowing I can end all my pain by jumping off a bridge is tempting because I hate this depression for what itâ€™s doing to me and I would finally be free if I actually committed. 


TLDR; I want to get better but knowing I can end all the pain by jumping off a bridge is holding me back. I donâ€™t have anyone to talk to.
