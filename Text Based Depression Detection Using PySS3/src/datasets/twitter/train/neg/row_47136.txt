I hate lifeI hate life, school (Year 8 btw), want to die but Islam says no. I'm scared because I trust my religion but I want to die. I'm stuck, please help me. FYI punishment for suicide is temporary Hell. Also, please try and see things in my view and don't say things like 'be an atheist then so you can break the rules'. I might say it but my heart's set on being a Muslim.
