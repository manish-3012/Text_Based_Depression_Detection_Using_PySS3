Still breathing for herMy mother is whom I refer to. 
Shes the love of my life and only support system I ever really had... its dawned on me that my desire is to drown due to the fact I'm 28, still living at home, no job or skills or ambition or energy to acquire one. I have no friends (literally) and I feel disabled like without my mum I wouldnt survive in the world which I barely do now and my body dysmorphia/skin ailments/overall health are just worsening as times goes on... I'm writing this purely to connect with anyone because I've never felt so close to termination in all my years of bed ridden depression.
