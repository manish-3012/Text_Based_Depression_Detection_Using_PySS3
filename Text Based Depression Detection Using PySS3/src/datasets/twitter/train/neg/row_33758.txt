Just a rant dont need to comment (sorry if too long)I want to die I cant take it anymore I constantly feel pathetic weak angry and stupid I fuck everything up in my life I push people away for loving me and I cant love them back because I hate myself so I end up alone and angrier and sadder it's a constant cycle of self hurt and I'm sick of it. I pushed the one person I thought I could actually love away I think forever and shes never coming back and it hurts and Its my fault I hurt her and she loved me so much but that's what I do I hurt people after being loved because I hate myself and ruin shit all my friends I end up distancing myself or try to and the ones that stay I either dont like and are jerks or I'm not that close to and pretend around them and I constantly wear a mask around people most people dont know I want to kill myself they think of me has the happy friend but it hurts because it's become automatic when I interact with people I instantly change and I cant stop it I push my emotions down and lock them and she was the only person I was truly me with but not anymore now I bury them deep down and keep them there and it fucking hurts after two years of having someone to help you and getting it taken away so fast and not even having someone to blame but yourself fucking hurts and to add on to it when I am alive all I do is hurt people speak my siblings and people close to me since I wear a mask when I go to school everything gets bottled up and when I come home I let it out angrily and generally be a dick to everyone and fuck with my siblings and I fucking hate myself for it (my younger brother is *was* one of the happiest people I know)but everything fucked him up my step dad his dad basically hates him he only talks to him angrily and constantly gets mad at him and I basically bully him to the point where he wants to die and I cant fuxking live with myself knowing I've done that I should be helping him but instead I hurt him and generally when my family is together they get along until i join than I start conflict so I know they'd be better off without me and I cant or wont kill myself because my family who would suffer because of that like all my mom has for the most part is her children were her reason to live (her husband is a dick most of the time she hates her job amd her surrounding family sucks)and if she knew what one of them was going through shed loose it and if one of them killed them selves I dont think shed be able to deal with that and I dont want to do that to her and them because my siblings depend on her and its probably an excuse to not do it but still but I cant fucking take it anymore I'm miserable all the time the one thing that gave me purpose I pushed away and now I feel empty again and I'm miserable all the time and I barely get happiness from most things if so it's at the surface level I'm bored and tired I just want to escape this or end it I tell myself I just need a break but the feeling doesnt go away but I'm to much of a pussy to even attempt to try since I've felt like this for 4 years and I've never even tried which makes this seem fake but I dont know I dont want to continue and dont know if I can and i joined this subreddit to try to help people or find people deal with the same stuff but I usually am to afraid to comment because I'm scared of messing someone's life up with my advice
