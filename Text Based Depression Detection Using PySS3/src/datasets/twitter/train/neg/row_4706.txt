Might as well give this a shotI'm a freshman in high school, all boys, I've got depression, anxiety and occasional suicidal thoughts. Most of the time I feel empty, a husk of my former self. I'm talking to a counselor and all that. Very rarely I'll feel motivated and I'll do everyday things with pride and gusto, but I know hat I'll come down from that "high". I don't cut, drink, smoke, do drugs or any of that. I want to avoid cutting by any means necessary. I'm also a huge procrastinator. I hate to give my emotions validity because if so, I feel like I'm making up and excuse. I know I'm so young that I often sell myself short when I do have "mental illnesses" because I feel that these problems aren't "real" depression.
