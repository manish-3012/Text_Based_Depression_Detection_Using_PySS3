Out of the mental hospital, can't seem to leave it behind. No hope.I was forcibly committed to a locked psych hospital fter a suicide attempt. I was locked in a grey cell and forced to strip. My glasses were taken away. The world became a blur and so, so terrifying. I've been out for 3 months. The only reason I haven't tried to off myself again is because I'm absolutely petrified of waking up back in that windowless cell. I'm worse than when I went in. Before, all I had to deal with was a chemical imbalance and getting my meds sorted out. 


No I can't go a day without flashbacks, and panic attacks, and crying, and being too afraid to show emotion(I wouldn't have been let out if I showed anything other than being fine and stable and so fucking great) I just feel desolate and I'm always terrified. 


I can only function now when I don't think or feel. I stay distracted. But it's not helping anymore. Every day it gets harder and i know if i start crying and feeling and thinking again I wont be able to keep on going. 

i'll be back in that horrible place, with the urine stained blankets from previous patients/prisoners on the cement floor and nothing but derision from the cruel nurses. I can't stop crying right now. I think it might be too late for me. I can't stop. Why did they have to do this to me I was going to be okay and going to get on the right meds and now I can't even function oh god i hate my life why can't everything just stop and the world keep going on and my family friends loved ones and boyfriend be fine and find nothing but happiness and not mourn at all im such a burden they'll be better off without me.

The only break I'll get is when I'm dead. I'm so exhausted. I can't keep picking myself up. I dont want to anymore. There is no point.
