My friend picked me upI was trying to get out of my house. My dad and I went at each other the entire day and I was about at my wits end self harming and crying throughout the day. I told my friend I wanted to get out of the house. He said something when I got picked up about being more responsible about certain things and it triggered me further. When we got to his house I walked away in the freezing weather and snow. I was crying so hard and I couldn't go inside his house. Like 20 minutes or so later my mom picked me up on the street to go home. I feel terrible. I've never felt this bad and I can't remember having a day this consistently awful. I don't know if I'm just venting or looking for someone. Everyone just leaves anyways.
