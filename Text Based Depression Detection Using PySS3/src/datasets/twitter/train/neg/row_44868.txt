oh no she's back and it's even worsei never thought i would be back here so early. i posted yesterday. i'm seriously considering killing myself. if you haven't met me yet, hi i'm mae (nickname to hide my identity) i'm 15 years old. i know there is so much life ahead of me but i don't know if i care enough to experience it. i've been planning it out and how i'm going do it. i'm not sure when yet. i'm sorry in advance. i really did want to try but i think i'm stuck here in my head until i really follow through with my plan sometime in the next few months.
