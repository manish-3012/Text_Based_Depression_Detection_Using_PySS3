I don't have to do anythingI don't have to talk to anyone, I don't have to reply, I don't have to worry about them not replying to  me. I don't have to do the math thing, I don't have to study, I don't have to read, I don't have to update myself, I don't have to improve myself. I don't have to clean nor organize my room. I don't have to eat, I don't have to brush my teeth, I don't have to talk to my parents. I don't have to finish the movie im watching, write a text about two people I never met, I don't have to worry about anything. I don't have to worry about not being loved or cared for. I don't have to do anything today

It's may 20th :)
