How much can I disclose to my therapist before she calls the cops to kidnap me?I am unfortunately pretty suicidal. I have a plan set up, the means to carry it out (my car + the required item in my trunk) and am getting more tempted by the day.

To be honest, I can't see any reason I would want to live. I am scared of everything and I have horrible anxiety and depression. Doctors &amp; my therapist will not authorize any medication because I tried to overdose a few years ago. I hate myself, my parents hate me, gender dysphoria is overwhelming, and the only reason I am still alive is because of my partner.

Because of them, I would like to find a reason to live. I want to ask my therapist for help. How much can I say before she will call the police on me? I do not want the police to attempt to kidnap me. If they try, I fully intend to run away and kill myself because I will not go back to a psych ward. I will not do it.

I am walking a fine line here... How much of this can I say without things going really bad?
