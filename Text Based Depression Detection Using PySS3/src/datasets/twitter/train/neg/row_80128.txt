Boyfriend suicidal.  Emotionally blackmailing mother in the house for two more days.  Desperate!My boyfriend (28) has a mother who hates me (29) and emotionally blackmails him.  She is visiting and I have stayed out of the house as much as possible in the interest of keeping the peace.  I came home tonight with my daughter to find my boyfriend very drunk, crying, and threatening to take and entire bottle of Tylenol.  His mother has been pouring him full of liquor against my protests.  She needs to leave right away, as he is not okay when she is around.  She makes him very mentally unwell.  I am terrified of him committing suicide as he is Japanese and internalizes blame.  I don't know how to help him, please help!
