i attempted suicideThis was a while back , I got picked up from school early and got home but my parents had to go back to work . ( i wasnâ€™t feeling well ) but obviously i lied and i still feel bad about lying about that but i just didnâ€™t want to be at school . I went to the kitchen and got a knife and i couldnâ€™t help keep crying. As much as i passed the knife over my wrists I was to afraid to actually cut myself and i was lightly pressing it for like about 30 minutes . The whole time my dog was staring at me like if she knew . I felt so bad and so angry at myself because i was so afraid of actually doing it . I donâ€™t know how iâ€™m doing right now but the thought of killing myself is always there no matter what . Sometimes i can be fine and then just suddenly a big wave of sadness hits me and i think about how if i told anyone about this i would seem like iâ€™d be making it up or that i â€œ have so much to live for â€œ . Iâ€™m just tired of waking up and trying . I go to school and try to forget but i can never escape this sadness . Sometimes i just want to not feel at all , I donâ€™t want to feel happiness or pain or worry . Itâ€™s just hard to validate your feelings when nowadays every teenager thinks saying â€œ iâ€™m gonna kill myself â€œ is a joke . The only way iâ€™d get people to give me attention is if i killed myself ( not that i want attention ) i just want to feel at peace ...
