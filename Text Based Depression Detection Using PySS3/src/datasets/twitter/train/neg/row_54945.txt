Dad attacked me. I called cops. Now I feel depressed and angry at myself.He was drunk. Arguing with my mom. I stepped in to try to calm him down. Outraged, he tried to choke me. Mom got in between us before he could do any real damage. Slight scratches near my lips and a very noticeable one at my neck.

He's a good guy when not drunk. He's been getting more aggressive as I've aged. This time he actually came at me with total intent on hurting me, mindlessly swearing nonsense at me, pushing me back further into the house. So in a panic I called the police, after I locked myself in a room.

He's being held at the police station. I feel terrible. Family has been in total distraught over this inevitable situation (mom has been tolerating his drunken verbal abuse forever). And I feel I'm the blame for making my mom go through this now.

I was just trying to protect my mom and sis. But I feel my decision was too extreme. I feel like I have actually severed my relationship with my dad, something I tried so hard my whole life to get. Now I feel like total shit. I keep thinking of jumping out my window. I'm just sad. Mom has been feeling so sick, I blame myself for that. I'm scared to move on after this, it's not right for me to try to take an exit but I feel like so much crap right now. That I had my own dad arrested and maybe will cause my parents to divorce just makes me feel so dumb and worthless.

I'm helpless.
