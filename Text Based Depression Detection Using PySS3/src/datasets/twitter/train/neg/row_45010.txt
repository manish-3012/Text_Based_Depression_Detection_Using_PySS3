Iâ€™m most likely going to kill myself.I tried homeschooling, didnâ€™t work.my parents really donâ€™t believe in suicide or equal child to adult rights or self harm. I wake up everyday thinking about how bad my life is and then go to practice and be the group clown, I laugh and smile in front of everyoneâ€™s face and because my dad basically buys me everything I want. everybody thinks my life is perfect. I havenâ€™t made any friends in the past 2 years. Iâ€™ve became antisocial and I didnâ€™t think I could get depressed because I can get almost everything I want and I didnâ€™t want to take away from someone who is actually diagnosed with depression. My parents also donâ€™t believe in counselors so I have no friends to tell or no adult to tell. My mom is one of the main reasons I want to kill myself. I have never disrespected her, she yells at me like Iâ€™m a doll on the shelf. When she yells at me I just sit there and cry and she gets louder and louder and calls me out my name and calls me ungrateful and disrespectful. I try everything in my power to make sure she is happy but whenever she is mad she yells at me because she knows I wonâ€™t talk back but she doesnâ€™t yell at my siblings because she knows they will yell back. I told her already I donâ€™t like be yelled at and she said she doesnâ€™t care. She just yelled at me just a second ago and I tried standing up for myself by telling her she doesnâ€™t listen to my feelings and she doesnâ€™t let me get my point across I guess she didnâ€™t like it and she yelled and out her hand in my face spitting on me and told me to shut up because sheâ€™s the parent. I tried packing a few of my things. Because I was just going to go stay with my sister because she kills my mental health I tried telling my mom that and she said sheâ€™s going through all the mellow drama and Iâ€™m doing to much. My dad hears the whole thing but doesnâ€™t say anything. I canâ€™t keep getting talked to the way I do and pushed under the rug and then she doesnâ€™t realize my mental health has went down the drain. Sheâ€™s worried about me keeping my grades up to play basketball. I havenâ€™t had a good day in the past couple months and I really have no more tears to cry, I have no one to lean on. But yeah lol sorry about the rant. I know there is people in here going through something worse than me, so I apologize but I had to get it out. But might as well put my own self out of my misery lol.
