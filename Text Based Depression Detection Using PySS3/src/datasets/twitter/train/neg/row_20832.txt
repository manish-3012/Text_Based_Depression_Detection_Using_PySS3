Gonna slit my wrists soon.Was gonna rent a room and do it there so my brother and sister wouldnâ€™t accidentally walk in on my body, but I forgot my debit card at home. Family thinks Im at work. Iâ€™m currently at the beach, Iâ€™ve been drinking and smoking, building up the resolve to go through with it. Gonna do it within the next few hours. I just feel so alone. Might call the hotline though.
