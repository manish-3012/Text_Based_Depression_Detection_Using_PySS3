No career options, no skills. Whatâ€™s the pointMost young women my age are excited to go to college and start their careers. In fact, most of my female friends make Aâ€™s and have many career options, as well as social skills. 

Then thereâ€™s me. 

I have no real place in society, and do not make any valuable contributions to society. Iâ€™m literally stupid, and a socially awkward mess who is clumsy and cant follow simple orders.

I cannot even put into words how many tears Iâ€™ve cried over school. 
Iâ€™ve despised school ever since I was 8. Every day of high school, I spent crying in the bathroom begging God that weâ€™d win the lottery so I would never have to go to school again. 

Iâ€™ve failed every class since 5th grade. My dad has spent thousands on tutoring, and my classes that I would have to pay to retake. I felt so guilty for making my dad spend all that money on me.

I have no desire to go back to school, I have no desire to even get a job as I have no social skills and every social environment brings me so much fear and anxiety. 

What am I going to do in life if Iâ€™m this useless? Iâ€™m stupid, I canâ€™t even pass classes let alone follow simple instructions given by a boss, Iâ€™m too confused for that. I have no social skills and no respect for authority. 

All Iâ€™ve ever wanted to be was a homemaker and a homebody, however thatâ€™s just not possible in todayâ€™s economy. No one understands when I tell them this, they just think Iâ€™m lazy. 

I spend most of my days in fear for my future, and especially now because of coronavirus, I havenâ€™t interacted with strangers in a long time and Itâ€™s made my social anxiety worse. 

I feel so trapped and useless, I was simply not made for todayâ€™s world. I wish I wasnâ€™t so dumb, I wish I was effortlessly smart like my sister and socially competent. Iâ€™m having suicidal thoughts again.
