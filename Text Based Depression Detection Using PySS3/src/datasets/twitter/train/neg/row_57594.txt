really scaredIm writing this in a daze because im afraid right now and didnt know where to ask for help and this is the only place I could think to ask for some kind of help. I dont even know what im asking I just have so many viciously horrible mental health problems that are destroying me. Nothing appalling that makes me a terrible person but im still incredibly ashamed and embarrassed by them and I never tell a soul. Thats the biggest problem because I can never ever see myself truly telling anyone else who I really am. I know if I ever want to get better theres a huge fight ahead of me and I dont think I have it in me. Especially not tonight, its all gotten too much tonight and I dont know what the hell im going to do. I realise this is entirely vague and unhelpful but I need to do something
