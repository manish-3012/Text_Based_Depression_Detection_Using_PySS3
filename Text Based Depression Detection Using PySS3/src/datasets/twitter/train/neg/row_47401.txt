I stopped feeling anything, and it all seems meaninglessI can't feel anything. I don't feel happiness or anger or sadness or anything. Nothing moves me like it used to. People say they care about me, but in the long run, im just another someone they know. I don't mean enough to be cared about. 

I haven't laughed properly in years. I haven't felt sober happiness for such a long time, it seems so hopeless. The only time I've laughed was when I was on an acid trip, and as soon as I came down it all turned back to shit. 

Everything I used to love - playing basketball, painting, going out with friends - I don't enjoy it anymore. It all seems pointless. Life in general, it's just pointless. Who am I? No one to you, no one to anyone. Why am I posting? I don't know. 

It feels like I'm just existing. I'm just here, doing nothing and being nothing. I'm too mediocre to amount to anything, and in the long run I'll just be miserable. So what's the point?
