Im unable to feel the good emotions.This is coming from the time I'm not feeling down.It's not just that I'm not seeing that I've had joy,I've tried to feel excited by doing stuff that is universally exciting I realized it was bad looking back on my experiences with rollercoasters.But that's besides the point,for some reason I get half emotion-half dull aching migraine when I start to feel happy.Imagine you have a bottle  of soap  and someone  pours water into it.That's what I feel like,it's like my feelings are half feeling half anguish.My happiness and excitement  immediately  dissipate  once I start to feel them.
