Itâ€™s my Birthday and I want to die more then ever.Today is my birthday so I went to a Starbucks Drive Through to get my birthday drink. Other then that I havenâ€™t left the house for anything other then essentials and even then hardly ever because my Father is high risk. I come home to my sister screaming at my saying Iâ€™m a hypocrite because I beg and plead for her to take this virus seriously. She has her Trump supporter boyfriend over constantly and disappears for hours at a time doing god knows what. Iâ€™ve pretty much resigned myself to the fact that we are not going to survive this virus but itâ€™s just so frustrating.
