feel like a useless leech, have suicidal thoughts, wanna change before having no more reason to liveI have always been the weird kid nobody likes, got some friends but no strong friendship with faith and that kind of stuff, never knew my father, complicated relation with my mother (she can't let me be independant so it made me unable to sort things out).
I'm in college for just 2 or 3 weeks but it have been a tremendous change. I moved in a fait with my girlfriend and my lack of autonomy made me a pain in the ass for her. She has always been here for me but it became more and more difficult for her to support me.
The last week we had a big argument. I tried to do what is awaited for me to do but almost half-an-hour ago, we talked. She seemed wrathfull and kind of depressed so I asked what's wrong and she answared that after my lies she do not trust me anymore.
Although I'm on the way to became a better, more autonomous person, seems like I have definitly broken something between us, and I think all my efforts will never be a stong enough adhesive tape to glue back all the fragments.
After our discussion I thought about suicide though I know it is obviously not the right solution. We talked again 5 minutes before that post. I changed my mind, I know I donc wanna end my life, there's so much I wanna do.
My request is : how could I stop being The despicable parasite I actually am ? Is there a solution to rapidly became autonomous and and to stop lies ? Also is there a efficient way to keep away from my mind those damn dark thoughts when the spraked inside my head ?
