Dropped out of college, lost motivation to continue pursuing life.I stopped going to classes for the last month and a half of school. Skipped finals. Failed out (well, I withdrew before I got any notification of academic failure) and went five states away back home, where Iâ€™m just sitting here waiting on my next move...

My brother is cleaning out a house so I can come move in with him in about a month... then heâ€™ll go back to school and Iâ€™m more than likely going to enlist in the military until I come up with a â€œplanâ€â€”that is, unless the military BECOMES my career.

But the truth is Iâ€™m only doing any of the stuff after my dropout because Iâ€™m expected to. I donâ€™t have any motivation to follow through with any it; Iâ€™m going to do it, but only because I already told people I was going to. 

I donâ€™t even know what I want from life. Huge part of me feels like Iâ€™m just going to be stuck flying under the radar (everybodyâ€™s radar) the rest of my life, in spite of all the effort Iâ€™ve put into standing out as an example of who I strive to be... I donâ€™t want to live that way. But itâ€™s been the pattern for my entire life no matter how hard or smart I try. This is hell.

Iâ€™m considering just finding a really quiet place, away from my family so theyâ€™d never know, and figuring out how to never return from it. Iâ€™m not in a super dark place nor do I have half as many depressed symptoms as I used to, but Iâ€™m alone and without achievement. I canâ€™t do it for much longer.
