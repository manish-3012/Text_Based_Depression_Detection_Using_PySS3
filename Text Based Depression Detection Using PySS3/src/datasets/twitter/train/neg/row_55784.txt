I survived cancer twice, in the process I destroyed my life and now I want to die.I managed to beat a very aggressive form of cancer...twice....after I beat it the first time I became an alcoholic and cheated on my husband. My marriage is shit. I have no one else to blame but myself and all I can think about is killing myself. I feel like its a wasted life....so many others who have died of cancer are more deserving of this life than I am. My husband says he wants to work it out but every discussion leads to him making snarky and mean comments about me cheating on him. I know we need therapy...in the mean time we are fighting like cats and dogs. Every time we have a big fight I get a little closer to getting the courage to take my life. I really don't want to be here anymore.
