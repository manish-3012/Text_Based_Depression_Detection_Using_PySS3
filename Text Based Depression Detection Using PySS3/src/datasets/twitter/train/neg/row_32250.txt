How to explain being suicidalI recently had a friend tell me that he didn't understand suicide or what it's like to have those thoughts. As I gave him the best on-the-spot explanation I could, I saw a light go on in his face. So, I wanted to pass it on as a way to help others explain what it is like to be suicidal.

Being suicidal is like being held captive with a knife to your throat; you're scared and you cry, and you fight for your life, but you know that you are also the captor, and the person who wants you dead is you. It is ... a war within yourself.

This may not explain how everyone feels, but it has been my experience with it. I hope it helps.
