Get stressed, can't clear my head of cutting.I'm female and 17, When I get stressed especially now duing the time of masses of work for us BTECs, also having to cope in a long term/long distant relationship, also have no help for my anxiety and depression because I am too scared to go on medication because of what my parents might think and also I feel I have no time to spare for therapy. When I get stressed I start to shake and have a very stiff body and the worse thing is I can't get self harm out of my head, what can I do?
