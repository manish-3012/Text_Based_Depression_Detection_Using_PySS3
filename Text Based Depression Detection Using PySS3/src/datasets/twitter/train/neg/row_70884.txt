I should kill myself because I'm not willing to accept responsibility in lifeI'm talking about REAL responsibilities. 

I should kill myself because I will never be able to live for something outside of myself. I will never live in such a way that I am able to take care of my aging parents and my siblings. I will never set out with the goal of finding some way to help people. I will never be able to live that way. Never. I can't. I can't exist to take care of other people because I'm just going to die afterwards and then what? I just can't. 

I can't live for other people. I can't live with other people in mind. I just cannot handle life. I cannot handle doing things for the sake of others. I feel like I need to be focused on my own needs and wants. It feels completely necessary, as if doing things for other people makes me feel burdened and oddly uncomfortable.

 I should just die then. My actual plan in life is to become homeless when shit hits the fan and hopefully try to build my own life from there without any ties to anyone.
