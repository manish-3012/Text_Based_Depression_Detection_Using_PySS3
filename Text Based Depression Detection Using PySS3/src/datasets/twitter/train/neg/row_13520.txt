no hope for a tolerable lifeI destroyed my career due to mental illness and am now unemployed and broke. I have no hope of getting another job due to the catastrophic way I left my last one. My education and everything I worked for in life are now wasted. Every day is torment from the moment I wake up and remember what happened. I haven't left the house except to go to the doctor in four months, since I got out of the hospital. I am a burden on my family and they can't support me much longer. I am terrified of dying, but suicide is my only path out of here. I can't bear to live like this. I used to have dignity and now I am the lowest of the low.
