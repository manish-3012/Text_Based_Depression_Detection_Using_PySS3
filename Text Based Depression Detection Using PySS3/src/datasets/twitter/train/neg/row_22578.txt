Last night I put a plastic bag over my head.I was in bed, put the bag over my head and I tied it tight. Started feeling drowsy. I only took it off because I don't want my family to have to sort through the garbage dump that is my house while grieving. My gf was suicidal when we got together and I think she'll probably kill herself too when I'm gone. That's keeping me here tbh.

I think I might have fucked my life up through carelessness and not paying attention and I don't think there is a way to fix it. Can't think of a way out and don't have the energy to find a solution, if there is one.

If my family find out how much I've fucked up that exposes some lies I told to try and hide what I did to try and buy myself time to fix it. Well I didn't fix it and the longer I leave it the worse it gets. When they find out then they will probably be angry with me to the point that their grieving might not mean as much to me. I shut down when people are angry at me and that will be the extra bit I need to go through with it hopefully.

I don't even really know why I'm here making a post. I don't want [maybe?] help and I can see a clear path towards the end.
