She died youngRecently my wife of 9 years passed away unexpectedly at 32 a little over a week ago. We had been together since high school. She had multiple sclerosis and every day was a struggle for her.  She never gave up and was my hero.  Despite her struggle she did everything for me.  Now that she's gone I don't know what to do with myself.  I've never lived alone before because we were always two.  I just don't want to live in a world without her.  The only solace I get is thoughts of ending my life.  I just don't know how I am to go on without her.....
