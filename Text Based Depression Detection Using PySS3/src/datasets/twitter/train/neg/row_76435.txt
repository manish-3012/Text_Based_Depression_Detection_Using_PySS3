life is like a sphere; there's no pointThere is truly no point for me to be alive. There is no future to look forward to. There hasn't been. I have far too many permanent, debilitating health issues that will progressively worsen as life goes on, if I choose it. I have worn out my welcome - among friends, peers, family, my SO. The latter of whom can't even talk to me anymore without my existence causing her misery and stress. I don't want her to suffer through that just because of me. She deserves better. I thought I was 'better' but I have only been a burden with all of my health problems. 

Too many friends of mine have passed recently. One killed themself; while I cried at the loss, I also couldn't help but think "they really were the smart one to get out of this hell, weren't they?"

I have lived a life of abuse, and it doesn't seem to ever end. I am sick of being a victim, a "survivor." I am sick of the fear of it continuing. I am homeless, with no chances of climbing my way out of it. There is no hope for me.  

It's just the truth that I will find control in my life for once, by controlling how it ends. One day, I'll be able to follow through.
