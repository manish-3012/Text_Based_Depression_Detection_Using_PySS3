Hard work gone to waste, i don't want to be alive.So I live in Australia and I've been studying a Diploma in ICT Networking since February this year. I have been basically using every hour of my life since the start of this year to finish my studies,staying up as late as 4 AM going days without sleep just to finish assessments i need to have done. My Diploma is the only thing i am doing and yet i am finding it so damn hard, I have 2 assessments due today and i am no where near done, I haven't slept for 3 days and i am terrified I'll fail this whole thing. (For Context, i had to pay a fee in order to continue my Diploma after i failed a unit last semester. About 1.5k just to carry on.) I have so much debt due to student loans, my fast food job doesn't give me shifts anymore so i am not making anything and onto of that all my medical related issues are just piling up now.. i was recently diagnosed with Dysthymia and Asperger's Syndrome. I am 17 now, turning 18 soon, what the hell i am i gonna do with next to zero work experience. I am not physically fit at all so the army is out the question even if i wanted to.

The only out i see is death. What the hell do i do with my self..? All the hard work I've put in is nothing but a waste and yet everyone else around me finds it so easy. My mother is constantly calling me " Intelligent " which is rubbish, If that was truly the case i wouldn't have so many issues just doing basic tasks.
