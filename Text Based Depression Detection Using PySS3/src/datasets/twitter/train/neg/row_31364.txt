Just venting. Don't bother reading.I've been depressed for a long time now, was starting to feel a little better lately. Tonight however, I'm feeling bad again and started wondering what I was worth.

I'm 33, single and have been living on wellfare for most of my life. I actually came to the conclusion that the only item in my appartment that I actually worked for was my tv. Everything else in here are either gifts or stuff I bought with money that other people worked for. Their taxmoney. I'm nothing more than a burden on society. I'm a worthless piece of trash. I haven't accomplished anything in life. I only cost money and resources.

Even if I were to get 'better', what would be the reason? Can anyone tell me? What's the reason to keep living? To become a productive member of society? To 'fit in'? To consume? To work 50 hours a week, earn money only to spend it on crap I don't need? Will that make me feel better? I'll still be sitting here alone every night, just staring at my monitor, wondering what to do with my life.

The only person that would actually care if I live or die is my mom. My friends would forget about me in a heartbeat. My family wouldn't really care. I don't see or hear any of my family. No uncles, no aunts, no cousins, nobody. My dad's side of the family doesn't even want anything to do with me... Am I that repulsive? I have 1 good friend, that's it. And I can't even talk about my problems with him because I have serious trust issues.

I want it all to end. I'm tired of living but I'm scared of dying.
