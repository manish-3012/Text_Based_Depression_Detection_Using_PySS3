I'm so close to doing it, but at the same time I can't.I've been wanting to kill myself for a long while, then a few weeks ago my mom buys a 9mm pistol and some rounds. I keep thinking to myself "Now's the chance, grab the damn thing and finish it!" But I just freeze up before I even touch the case of the pistol. I don't know why, I hate everything about me. It's not like anyone will miss me when I do it. I've been trying to hold it together, but I don't know how long I can keep this up.

*sigh* I'm not even really sure anymore, I feel empty and alone. It's my fault though. 

Sorry if you're reading this, I just needed to vent...
