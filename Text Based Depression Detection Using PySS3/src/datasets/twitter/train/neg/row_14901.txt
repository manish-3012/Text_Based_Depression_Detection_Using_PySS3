please help me i dont think i can go on any moreI'm 23 and my problems are giant giant mountains and everything in my life is just so wrong and dark and fucked up.  I miss my ex girlfriend every day of whom my relationship ended with in February. All my insurmountable problems and insane 13 years of extreme unhappiness and how much I miss her are pushing me to end it.  I can't overcome my problems.  I can't stop missing and thinking about her.  I have tried so hard for so long and now see and know there is no way my suffering will ever end except with my death.  I dont have a reason to hope. I don't have a reason to believe.  The problems I face are not able to be overcome.  I can't do this anymore. It's been months and months of the same feelings, I see the end in my eyes because I can't live any more.  I know the suffering that people have and I have aren't justified and don't happen for a reason, and I've essentially lost all my belief in god and truly everything else.  Please help me before I kill myself because I have so many infinite reasons to die and none to live even another day.  I have no more options, I can't suffer any longer
