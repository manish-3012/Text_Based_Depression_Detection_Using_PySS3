What the hell happens to a doctor when their patients kill themselves?My GP keeps insisting to see me every goddamned few days since he learned from my psychiatrist that I'm suicidal. He "wants to help" but he's not trained for that, he doesn't have the way with words and honestly, he makes me feel like I'm worse than I am and one foot into my grave already.

(How am I really? Exam season stress in a mind obsessed with overachieving. I don't have time to think about myself, which is nice, but that's ending soon. I stare blankly at my books a lot and don't know anything about what I'm reading because I feel like I was half-present all semester so I'm learning things, that's kind of nice too.) 

He really does not know how to handle a person with mental health issues despite "having dealt with them himself" when he was my age. He even calls me on my cellphone from his own cellphone just to check on me, gave me his number, his email, asks me to call him if I feel suicidal and call 911 if I feel like I'm about to try to hurt myself. 

I cannot be mad at him for trying to help even if his ways are pretty gauche, but I have trust issues and have a hard time believing someone who says they genuinely care or just want to help me.

He keeps repeating "I don't want you to die" and once, last Friday, he went "I don't want you to die becaus-- nevermind, I just don't want you to end your life, I'll squeeze you into my schedule on Monday."

I'm wondering about something: Does he get anything from me being alive? Would my passing affect him in any way aside from the fact that I'd be one patient less on his list?

If any of you guys know, let me know, because I have trouble trusting his overbearing ways.
