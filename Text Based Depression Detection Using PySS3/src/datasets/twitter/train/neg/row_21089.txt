Is it wrong to think I belong in the dark?I feel like I cant look at things without feeling bad about them. Like theyâ€™re painfully alive and I just donâ€™t know how to approach them. Like objects and colors. When I close my eyes in the dark, I feel like I belong to that space for eternity and feel at peace. I feel trapped by this world. I can feel something is there that is suffocating me. All these expectations and responsibilities that I cannot shake. 
All these people who no longer care about me but yet their ghosts haunt me with their words and expressions, expecting and waiting for me to be real to them.

I feel like I need to die
