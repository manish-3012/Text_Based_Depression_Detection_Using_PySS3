I donâ€™t know how to get the help I needI posted here a few days ago from a separate account. The short version of everything is I tried to kill my self a month ago today, failed pathetically, ended up in a psych ward for 6 days and thought I was doing better. Not completely but I thought I was on the right track. For the past 2 weeks though itâ€™s been building and I had a plan to kill myself Friday but I got through the night.

I called hotlines and texted them all week and for the past 4-5 days itâ€™s been everyday, sometimes multiple times a day. Nothing seems to be helping and keeping me safe. I told my best friend on Thursday night, promised not to do it then obviously had a change of heart. Told her again on Friday night out of guilt and she made me feel selfish (which is good I suppose) to the point where it delayed me doing it. Also talked to a hotline that night 3 times. 

My best friend vowed to help me even though I told her she shouldnâ€™t have to and I feel absolutely horrible, like Iâ€™m making her. But also the idea of receiving help from her is reassuring and I want it. Nothing has happened yet though and itâ€™s 2 days later. I know nothing will change immediately but I was hoping for some more support from her, like maybe just her texting me first instead of me desperately hoping she will text me back and not be too busy. We havenâ€™t talked all day, we usually talk daily. 

Basically my plan has only been delayed until tomorrow night, with the hopes of anything good happening to stop me within the time frame between now and then. I donâ€™t know how to get this help from my friend that she promised and I donâ€™t know how to get help from these hotlines. Any advice would be great. I donâ€™t trust myself to stop myself. 

And yeah. I know Iâ€™m being selfish and probably looking for attention from my friend and Iâ€™m sorry. I hate myself for that. I donâ€™t know how to stop any of this on my own though.
