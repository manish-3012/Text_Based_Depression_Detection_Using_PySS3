Please believe meI think about killing myself everyday. I dont feel anything anymore. Why do my mom and dad treat me like im a bad person. I always try my best to be good to everyone. Why have people always treated me like scim of the earth, like im the evil person i dont get to be treated with kindness. I feel so awful. I dont ever understand why. I cant tell if im sane or not. Why does everyone shit on me when im begging them for kindness and empathy. Im so tired, i think im broken, i cant see my way out of this situation. I just want to be treated better like everyone else. Im either going insane or i am actually being singled out for some fucked up reason. I never há»§rt anyone, i only turn it inwards and harm myself, i cry and i starve. When i talk truthfully about whats going on, my dad pushes me to do it, he must think that im pretending, i keep crying and begging him to believe me but he doesnt. He yells at me like im the most evil person. I beg my mom to take me back, i want to go back to live with her but she doesnt want me. I swear im good, i just need someone to be kind to me and ill never harm myself again. And i  swear im not doing it for attention, i just cant help it, it just feels so overwhelming that i have to let it out. Please dont yell at me. Im already feeling awful as is. Please believe me that im not a bad person, im not calculating like they say. Why dont anyone believe me. I just want to be seen and be treated with fairness. Someone telling me that they believe me, someone showing me empathy... this is the only thing i ask for. Maybe i was born too sensitive, i think im not fit for life. Is my life and the people in it especially awful or is everyone like this for a good reason? I cant tell anymore. I dont think i can, i think thats why i cant live anymore. Its too painful and cÃ²nfusing. I dont know anything, im genuinely scared
