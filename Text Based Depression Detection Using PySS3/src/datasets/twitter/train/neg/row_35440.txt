GuiltyI feel ashamed of eating. Itâ€™s a weird thing that I submit to atleast once a day. But afterwards and during I feel like a fucking fraud. Like I think so much about suicide and wanting to fuck up my entire body with drugs and shit n yet here I am eating. Eating food better spend on someone actually deserving, someone who appreciates it more than me. I hate breathing, eating, drinking, I hate being alive. Iâ€™m guilty of saying Ima kill myself to people who I just wanted attention from. I didnâ€™t get it and I feel fucking terrible. Now no one hits me up, I talk to no one and I feel isolated and alone. I actually wish death on me everyday but I donâ€™t tell anyone. Why would I tell other people how I feel if I donâ€™t have the actual guts to pull it off? Why tell a lie?!?! Why the fuck would I involve more people to care about me if I really were to kill myself? I hate this all and I wanna be done. I donâ€™t wanna feel, see, hear, breathe, or even give someone the chance to know me cuz at the end of the day, my sadness brings others down too. And I donâ€™t wish upon anyone this feeling ever.
