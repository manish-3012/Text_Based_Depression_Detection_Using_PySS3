Possibly Carcinoma...and nobody cares.Exactly what the title says. The doctor saw a growth on my scalp that she says is most likely benign. She did not emphasize that I should go get it checked out but said, "if you go see a dermatologist they can probably remove that and take it to a lab. It's probably benign but your hair is thinning". 

Well...if it is carcinoma then at least I have a valid reason as to why I constantly feel awful. Still, nobody has cared, nobody does care, and I probably won't bother even getting it checked out. If the doctor isn't screaming at me to rush to a dermatologist right away, it probably isn't a big deal anyway.
