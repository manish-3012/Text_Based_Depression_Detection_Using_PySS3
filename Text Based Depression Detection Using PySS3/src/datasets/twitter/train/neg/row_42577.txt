i cant take it , i need help pleasei'm a 19 m  who has been suffering of suicidal thoughts for 3 years now , and i cant take it anymore , i wish people ( friends and family ) surrounding me notice what i'm going through and how hard it is for me to put up a happy face 24/7 , but i can't blame them for it , i'm very good at hiding my emotions and bottling them up , everyone thinks i lead a happy life because that's what i make them see ( if that makes sense ) . I'm posting this to seek help from you guys , i really need it . i cant talk about my feelings or stuff i go through to my friends ( if my family realises that i have suicidal  thoughts i will be put in hospital immediately , suicide is considered forbidden in islam and whoever does it goes to hell apparently ,  little do they know im not even muslim  ) that's why i find it easier to talk with strangers ( this is my first time talking about my feelings publicly ) . im at the point where i'm looking for painless ways to end it all ( even tho every way is painful ) 
"i don't want to die , i just don't want to live " 
i thought about getting a therapist , but  i live in morocco , you already know the outcome ;
1- most therapists here have zero experience and only got the job because they bought diplomas 
2- a session with a therapist costs tons of money , and i dont want my parents to know i'm visiting a therapist which means i'll have to pay it myself , and i'm a full time college student 
3- when talking to a therapist , you're normally supposed to tell them everything , which is a no  in my case because im a closeted gay male living in a muslim country , being gay in islam is haram ( forbidden ) and gay people here are exposed to danger if they come out publicly . 
oh and i tried calling morocco suicidal hotlines but apparently they work for only 6 hours a week ,  and when i try calling during work ours , i get  a voicemail  everytime ( gotta love a country that doesn't even care about its citizens health )
