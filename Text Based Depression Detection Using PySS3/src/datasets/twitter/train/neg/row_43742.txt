help me.(14M)I canâ€™t do it anymore. I literally have everything a kid could ask for. A family, food, money, education. Iâ€™m just an ungrateful little shit. Well Iâ€™m not. Iâ€™m grateful but I donâ€™t care about it. I feel like I donâ€™t deserve to be here. Everyone I. This subreddit is having major mental problems and they have reasons. Iâ€™m lucky. Yet everyday I make a new plan. Drowning myself. Stabbing my heart. Jumping. Killing others when I go down. I need help. I need it soon , Iâ€™m desperate. 



please. . .
