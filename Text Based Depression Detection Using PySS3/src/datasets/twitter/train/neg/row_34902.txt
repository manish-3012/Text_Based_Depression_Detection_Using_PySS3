I am deadI am dead. My lifeless body decays. All of the chemical bonds in my tissues break down into baser forms. There are gases, my energy is released. All of the order is gone, all of the memories, all the capabilities, all the limits. The nervous system and neurons are no longer a system, they're sludge. Heart and lungs are odd flesh. And nothing is left of me. This larger being, the human society, is the only thing left after I'm gone.  A single cell with a few other cells connected to me. I was an unimportant part, doing something vague and then I died. But I did live, and was a part. It doesn't feel like anything anymore. Now I just know. I remember how much I cared about what I felt, but I can't remember what it felt like. I don't feel anything. I just know. Only living creatures can feel. I know everything. I feel nothing. I can't remember feelings. And those other versions of me that are living feel everything, and know nothing, they learn and feel. I am going back to life, to feel and learn. I'm ready now.
