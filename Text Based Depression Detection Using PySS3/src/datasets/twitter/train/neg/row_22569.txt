SuicidalI feel like such a waste of space and like nothing will help me cope or feel better. A close friend of mine died recentally of which im not coping with. I was in hospital for a bit after trying to commit suicide. Nothing seems to work. Im just sick of it. I just fail at everything. Im high and extremelly suicidal. I feel like if i end it all would be better and that everyones just better off without me. If i od today who would care?. Im seriously concidering an od.
