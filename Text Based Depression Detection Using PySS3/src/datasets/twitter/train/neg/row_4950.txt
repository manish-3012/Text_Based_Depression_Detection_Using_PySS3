A friend of mine just went MIA on messenger... (not sure where to post. If iâ€™m in the wrong place, pls direct me) We used to work together, and a few months ago we reconnected over messenger. Heâ€™s been battling hard with his depression, and a few weeks ago he started posting a lot about his suicidal ideations. Around the same time, he started to push me away, too. I wasnâ€™t sure if it was because the conversation had run dry, or maybe he was just enjoying his conversation with other people more than me, or if it was just the mental illness. I reached out a few times, tried to let him know that iâ€™m here to talk, but he left me on read. I let it go, gave him space, this was a few weeks ago. Today, i sent him a stupid meme over messenger, and commented on a post. In the mean time, heâ€™s been posting a lot (sarcastically, satirically, but frequently) about his ideations. I went to respond on fb, and iâ€™m either blocked or he deleted his account. My googling is leading me to believe that he deleted his account, but ultimately i donâ€™t knowâ€”i might be blocked. I donâ€™t have his number.... I feel so sick right now.... idk, maybe iâ€™m jumping to conclusions??  
  
  
  
I have lost a lot of people. Several to suicide.
