24 year old female, planning on suicide once I start to age in my 40â€™sIâ€™ve had suicidal urges and one attempt when I was a teenager. Iâ€™m currently 24, and as each year passes, Iâ€™m overwhelmed with a sense of impending doom. Iâ€™m afraid of aging. I dread my identity becoming compromised by the forces of inevitable biology. Iâ€™m terrified of no longer being seen as beautiful or relevant in the eyes of society. But unfortunately, there is an expiration date on beauty. Unless I can afford immensely expensive facelifts, Botox and skin care products, Iâ€™m doomed. And at the rate my life is going right now, I donâ€™t foresee wealth in my future. I plan to end my life at 48, if something else doesnâ€™t do me in before time. Most 48 year old women proclaim to want to be in their late 20â€™s again- why would I want to live like that? I have a bucket list and careful planning written down on how to go about it. Also, does anyone else feel this way? Iâ€™ve googled my reason for planned suicide but the results have turned up very short
