Well fuckI might get expelled from my school. My parents donâ€™t want to talk to me at all. My sister has already told them to stop I am spoiled and itâ€™s all their fault. What am I going to do. I wanted to get out of Pakistan but itâ€™s a fantasy. All the dreams I have are gone poof. My friends they donâ€™t even know me most of my friends are online. What am doing here nothing. I genuinely want to die and I am afraid I might react upon it. All the goals I wanted to achieve are impossible this downward spiral wonâ€™t end well I just donâ€™t have a reason to live now I am still considering what should i do but I thinking and itâ€™s not going to good
