I AM TIRED OF VOMITING ALL OVER MYSELF LIKE A GODDAMN INFANTi have chronic anxiety. the anxiety makes it hard for me to eat and makes me throw up. today i didn't even make it to the fucking toilet before i fucking exploded puke all over myself and my bedsheets. i wouldn't wish this on anyone. it's like being bulimic but much worse. my mom had to come up and clean up my puke. i was in the midst of a major meltdown and i couldnt do anything. it's one thing to puke all over yourself from anxiety, it's another to feel the embarrassment of having your mommy clean up after your mess like a child. 


my mind is a lovely cocktail of disorders and disabilities. autism, dyspraxia, depression, anxiety, ADD, ADHD, all at the same time. it is very hard for me to have any kind of independence. i'm 23 years old and still living with my parents, which isn't out of the ordinary in this day and age, but i depend on them a lot more than i should. i have no drivers license, so they're really the only ones who could take me anywhere. i've really been losing hope that i will ever live a normal life, and my future seems very bleak. i really feel like taking my own life because i don't see things getting better. i am sick of living with a broken brain.
