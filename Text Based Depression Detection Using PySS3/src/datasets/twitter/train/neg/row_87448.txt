Iâ€™m a pathetic mess.I have so much shit wrong with me that I canâ€™t even deal with. I never thought it was physically possible to have so many things fucked up in the head with one person but apparently my mind is just screwed up beyond repair.
I have Aspergers, social anxiety, depression, selective mutism, PTSD, possible BPD (I havenâ€™t been diagnosed officially but my previous psychologist said it was highly likely), the list goes on.
I have an addiction to self harm and the only reason Iâ€™ve stopped (and by stopped I mean the last time I did it was a few weeks ago) is for my boyfriend because I donâ€™t like seeing him hurt or upset from my own actions. He blames himself when itâ€™s not his fault at all. But itâ€™s the only goddamn thing I have that takes away all the noise in my head for at least a little while. Nothing else helps me. Iâ€™ve seen countless therapists and tried dozens of medication. 

Iâ€™ve been having panic attacks daily. I had to go on leave from uni last year because of my ex-boyfriend abusing me and sending me death threats and calling me all during the night to yell at me. I was a complete mess and was cutting myself constantly and even overdosed and still managed to show up to class the next day even though I felt like I was dying.
Then I met my current boyfriend and heâ€™s been absolutely amazing and so supportive of me, more than anyone else has ever been in my life, and yet itâ€™s still not enough. I still feel sad, I still get so depressed and insecure, even though I know he loves me. I want him to be enough for me, so why do I still feel so broken?
I started back at uni this week because I wanted a fresh start and to give it my best, but my panic attacks are getting worse that I donâ€™t even know if I can continue. I want to do this art degree, but Iâ€™ve lost my passion for art and drawing. I feel thereâ€™s no point to doing something I donâ€™t care about anymore, even though I want to care. I want to have passion. But nothing brings me joy anymore. I feel like I shouldnâ€™t even be alive.

I feel like I should be back in the psych ward but I donâ€™t want to mess up my studies and worry my boyfriend. Heâ€™s so normal compared to me and Iâ€™m worried that if he keeps seeing this awful fucked up sides of me, that heâ€™ll leave me. Not that Iâ€™d blame him. Heâ€™s such a genuine, kind person who deserves a normal girlfriend, not a chaotic mess.

Even cutting my studies down to part time is still too much for my brain to handle. I feel like I canâ€™t concentrate or make sense of anything, I feel I have no purpose in life and that Iâ€™ll never be truly happy or satisfied. Iâ€™ve been cutting and trying to kill myself since I was 12 and I have no idea why Iâ€™m not dead yet. I guess Iâ€™m just too pathetic to even go all the way even though Iâ€™ve desperately tried. Iâ€™m a high school dropout and still managed to get into uni somehow, and yet Iâ€™m fucking it all up. Iâ€™m already 23 and still have no idea what the fuck Iâ€™m doing with my life.

Iâ€™m sorry for the long rant, I just have no one to talk to. I donâ€™t have any friends anymore because I decided to stop letting people walk all over me and treat me like shit, but itâ€™s left me with no one there. Sometimes I feel like it was a mistake, that fake friends would be better than none.

Sorry for anyone that reads this. Just take solace in the fact your life is probably better than mine and I envy you for that.
