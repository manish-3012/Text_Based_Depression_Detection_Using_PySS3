I think I'm close to making a planI haven't felt this way in a few months. I'm actually being distracted by it at work, which is constantly busy and there's no time to think. I'm very quiet, but try to talk to coworkers, but today I feel myself not speaking. Even the customers are asking if everything is okay, because I'm usually very customer service-like. I've been thinking about how I could end it, what I'd have to do. I'm scared of what the person closest to me would say if I told them. I don't want to be locked up again, and I'd cry if I ever had to go back, but I don't feel safe out here.
It doesn't hurt anymore, but it is weighing heavy on my heart. When will it finally end..
