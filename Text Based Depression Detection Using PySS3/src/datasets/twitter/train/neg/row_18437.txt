x?xI know for certain I'm not going to live to 30, nor do I want to.

what I'm battling now is whether or not I continue to 27, or end my life right now (17) and spare me the purposeless suffering of my existence, only 2 things holding me back, my family and more selfishly but importantly, my dreams and aspirations.

Only problem is, my dreams seem more like delusions. I simply do not have the energy to find and pursue a passion,  I cant work a 9-5 for 70 years then die, I would ironically, rather be dead, growing old is over idealized, we are all going to bite the dust, why not spare the torment?
