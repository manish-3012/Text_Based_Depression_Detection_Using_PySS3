definitely going to end itive lost all hope. i feel played and fucking hopeless. i always fail and come back to this place of wanting to fucking die. im so sick of my life being so up and down i just want someone to love me. is that too much to ask? i will always be alone i guess. he hasnt texted me since he dropped me off so i guess its over it just fucking hurts man like fuck i was so excited this shit always happens to me why cant i get the love i deserve and have been searching for and want so badly? its never going to happen for me so whats the point in going on? i have nothing to live for without him.
