everythings too muchi have 90 days worth of my medication right here, and i know where the guns in my house are kept if needed. 

im 17, and i really dont see anything good coming up. im tired of fighting this feeling and i know its so cliche but the negatives really do overpower any happiness i feel. i just need someone, anyone, to help. im so selfish and i deserve to die.
