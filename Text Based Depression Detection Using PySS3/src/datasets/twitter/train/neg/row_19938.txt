I can'tI'm useless.

I can't even bring a smile to my best friend's face.

I'm just that dark cloud that lingers over peoples' heads, making their day gloomy. And they try to change that black cloud to white, but it doesn't work, and they eventually give up and go far enough away that the cloud can't follow them. 

I'm not needed. Everyone will be much happier once I'm gone. They might not realize this now, but they will. Suddenly that cloud will disappear, and it'll be like a huge weight has been removed from their lives.
I couldn't keep my job. I can't be a source of support for my friends. I'm just that huge negative power plant that makes everyone miserable.

They'll be happy once I'm gone. 

Talking about how they'll be obligated to attend my funeral, that they'll be sad... but no one has the money to afford a funeral. The State will cremate me. There will be no viewing, no funeral, nothing. 
Death is all I have left.

I can't keep being such a burden.
