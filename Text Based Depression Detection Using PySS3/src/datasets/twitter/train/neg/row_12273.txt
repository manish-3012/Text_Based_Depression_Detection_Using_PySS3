I wish I didn't existIt's funny too, I'm reasonably successful, fit and all that.
But I'm so lonely
It all feels like a grand spectacle I keep showing through sheer willpower.
It feels like a piece of my soul has been ripped out and I can't find it
The hole hurts so much anytime I let it
I'm just really really alone
Sometimes it feels like the pain isn't worth it

I hope this isn't disrespectful, since it is very unlikely that I will kill myself, if past events are any indication.

But I figured I might write it out for once
