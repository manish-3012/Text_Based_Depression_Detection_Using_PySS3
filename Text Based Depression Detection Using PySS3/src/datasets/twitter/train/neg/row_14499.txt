Life is shit.Iâ€™m tired of living like this. 99% of the time Iâ€™m either depressed to the point of suicide, or extremely bored to the point I do stupid shit that makes things even worse. I really donâ€™t enjoy anything about life most of the time, and just kind of exist if Iâ€™m not in severe pain because of the depression. And then every few months Iâ€™ll become happy and satisfied and actually have motivation to do things, but it only lasts for a day or two at most and then back to the boredom or depression. The only thing thatâ€™s keeping me back is not having a good suicide method, and not wanting to leave my mom and cat. But even those are becoming less and less important. I honestly donâ€™t know if Iâ€™ll survive until January, when I finally have an appointment with a psychiatrist.
