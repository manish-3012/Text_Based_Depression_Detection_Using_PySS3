I know I shouldn't kill myselfI know I shouldn't kill myself. It would cause so much pain for the few that care but I am so tempted. Things seemed to have gotten better but in reality nothing really changed. I hate myself for becoming like this again. I live on the 45th floor and I keep looking out different windows to see where I would land. I know I am too weak to do this but I keep thinking I someday might just do it
