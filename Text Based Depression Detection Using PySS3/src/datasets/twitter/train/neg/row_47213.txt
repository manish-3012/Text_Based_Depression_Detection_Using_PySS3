To be honest, I'm not sure if I want to live or die.I'm sorry if this isn't appropriate for this subreddit. I've never attempted to kill myself, but I have given it a lot of thought. I don't think I ever will because honestly I'm too afraid of dying, and part of me wishes I weren't. However, I keep thinking about how I would do it, and how I feel like maybe it's the best option. Right now I don't really have a lot of reason to get up in the morning. I just graduated this past May, and cannot find a job. As a result, I've had to move in with my parents. For a while, the best part of my life, and the only thing that made me happy was a girl I foolishly fell in love with. It was foolish because she's engaged, and I continued to fool myself into believing something could happen. I finally slowly realized that it was impossible. Anymore, all I want to do is sleep. I try to get out during the day, but it doesn't seem to help, so I often stay in. The thing is, people tell me my life will get better, but right now it's really hard for me to believe, and I find myself with less and less hope everyday. I tend to perform poorly in social situations, and find myself to be frustrated, miserable, and left out. Because of that, I've started to avoid being social, which isn't a whole lot better. I look at my life and I realize that I don't have much to look forward to, and I just wish more and more that I weren't so afraid of dying so that I could maybe accept that I need to go.
