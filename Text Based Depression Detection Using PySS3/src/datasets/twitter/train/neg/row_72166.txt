I Donâ€™t Want To DieI just donâ€™t want to live anymore.

I live a semi-successful life. Iâ€™m comfortable with my life, which is what Iâ€™ve always wanted.

I donâ€™t have any issues with dating women. Iâ€™ve turned away a lot of very attractive women in my eyes, but mainly because I have my own issues.

I donâ€™t hate myself.

But my desire to die is like an itch I canâ€™t scratch. I just want to not exist anymore.

Please help
