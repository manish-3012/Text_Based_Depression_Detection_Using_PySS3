I don't think there is anything wrong. I think this is just me. I think I'm just broken.A normal person would not be thrown into such a depression  because of one fucking comment. A normal person would trust the opinions of the people they love and trust over a snide jab from a crazy bitch. But the truth of the matter is that what she said makes sense to me. I am a failure. I'm almost thirty years old and I can't get a real goddamn job. I can't take care of myself or the people I love. I'm a fucking burden on them and nobody needs this albatross in their life. I make the worst choices, every time I get the chance too. I can tell myself I have a plan and a path all I want, but the truth is I'm a goddamn loser. I'm pretty sure people can smell it on me. Here's the loser, the failure, the weak one, take what you can get while the getting is good. 

So here I am, falling back into the same goddamn patterns when I was an emo teenager. All I can see are these cancerous jellyfish that live in my wrists, my chest, my throat and all I want to do is rip them out. I want to scratch the word failure into the wall with my fingernails. And, I swear to goddamn god, all I can hear is the beginning of the song letterbomb over and over in my mind. Nobody likes you, everyone left you, they're all out without you, having fun. Nobody likes you, everyone left you, they're all out without you having fun. Just on repeat and I can't make it go away. 

Even in a suicidal rage I'm a goddamn  trope and a stereotype. All I need is the notebook of bad poetry and a rusty razor blade. Christ, can't I even  be depressed in an original fashion?
