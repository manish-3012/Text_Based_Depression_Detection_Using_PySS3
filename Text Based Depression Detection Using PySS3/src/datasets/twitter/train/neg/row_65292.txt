Running awayI'm a 23 year old male. I'm about 9 months into a PhD in theoretical physics. I was top of my undergraduate class. I have a girlfriend, my own apartment, and a shit-ton of money that I've inherited from a grandparent. 

I feel so...*trapped*. I feel like I'm this tiny little person holding up a huge cardboard cutout of myself, and no one sees the real little me. They all think I'm super-physics-genius-man, when I'm not, I'm just (relatively) hard working and a bit lucky. I've had various episodes of depression starting in my early teens, continuing to now.

I used to consider suicide regularly. I still do, but lately I've been considering running away as a sort of half-way step. I've got around $100k in the bank, so I really could go just about anywhere. The only thing that's stopping me is the logistics of how to stop my family/friends knowing where I am and what I'm doing, but without cutting them out completely (i.e. not become a 'missing person' like you see on the news). I also don't know if they would welcome me back if I left them for a while.

I don't know quite why I'm posting this here, I just wanted to tell someone. If anyone's got any tips on mitigating the negative aspects of running away I'd appreciate it.
