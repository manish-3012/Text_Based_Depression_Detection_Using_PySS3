What IfI am not sure that I would call myself suicidal; yet, it is something that I think about a lot. I think about what will happen after this life. I think about turning off the flame to this candle to just end all of the pain and endless darkness. I keep thinking that I have found my hope - my redemption, but to be honest, I am not sure if that is possible anymore. I do not know if I am worthy of redemption. I used to believe that everyone deserved a chance at it, but I think that I am a different case. I have betrayed the only people that I care about. I am of little value. Nothing really has value anymore. I can convince myself sometimes that I am happy, but in all sincerity, I know that it is not true. I am not a lovable person right now. "You are too emotionally unstable for me to associate with." "In life women have the option to choose to be a person or an object. You, my dear, have chosen to be an object." I know that it is true. I am not the person I thought I was. Now I only think about the darkness. I do not take joy in the things that I used to. I take joy in thoughts of the darkness. I don't wish to end the pain anymore. I just want to remain fixed in it - at least it is a feeling.
