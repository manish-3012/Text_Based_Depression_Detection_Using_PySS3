DisappointmentJust sat out on my porch for the last 2 hours wishing more than anything that my partner would drive up. I knew he wouldn't but it gave me the smallest hope in a moment. I'm so worried about getting through tomorrow on my own and I wish he'd have understood why I needed him. It hurts so much to feel so alone.
