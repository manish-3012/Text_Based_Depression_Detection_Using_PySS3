I think I am going to get fired today....So its just about 6am now and I will soon start getting ready for what might be my last shift. If they do fire me..i will want to kill myself..I'm very sick with something and don't think i can work anywhere else. Hell this is the easiest job ever! If I can't work here where can I work?

I have ruined many jobs before hand and this may be no different.

I fear that if given yet another chance in life and chance AT life, that I would just do what i am doing all over again.

I don't trust myself to be trusted with anything. I brake everything I own.

OK here goes Wish me luck reddit.. I will be back with any further details


EDIT: Did not get fired yesterday. Which is very surprising. I thought I defently was after all the time I've been taking off because of my current situation(my health)
