That time I opened up on r/confessionsI basically explained how I had bullied. How I was a horrendously mean person at one point. The first comment I saw called me a psychopath, along with something else. I blocked it out of my mind.

There were maybe four comments, possibly more, I have no idea to be honest. That was the only one I saw, however that comment broke me apart. I attempted suicide after that comment. Well, kind of. I started off cutting with the intent to die, eventually I kept cutting, but not with the intent to die, yet not caring if I did.

I cut really bad. It's been over a year and a couple or my scars are still swollen. I guess I didn't cut anything important.

It's crazy how one comment triggered me so much, and I didn't even read all of them. Only a single comment.

The craziest part is how a community that I went to for support attacked me. Meanwhile, the person who I bullied is still talking to me, almost as if we are friends again. She forgave me.

It's painful just thinking about this memory.
