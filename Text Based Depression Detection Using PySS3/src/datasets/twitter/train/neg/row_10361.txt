I feel like a lost causeTitle says it all. Iâ€™ve felt like a lost cause lately because I canâ€™t get my ex out of my head or my heart. I care a lot about her and miss her like fucking crazy and I havenâ€™t heard from her since last Wednesday. We didnâ€™t end on bad terms even though she cheated on me and I was hospitalized for suicidal thoughts. I feel hopeless and like a complete waste of time to anyone. Iâ€™m 26 and never lived up to my own expectations and I feel like Iâ€™ve been letting everyone down. My friends tell me Iâ€™m the strongest person they know after everything Iâ€™ve endured which when I look back at it and how I felt I think I was being over dramatic and childish. My career is shit Iâ€™m in a dead end job, I live with my parents. I feel like Iâ€™m a pathetic loser who will have nothing to show in life. Iâ€™ve been going to therapy even though I canâ€™t afford it but its days like today when I know sheâ€™s not working this weekend that I want to be with her or at least talk to her. 

Edit: TL;DR no one seems to give a shit about this ghost.
