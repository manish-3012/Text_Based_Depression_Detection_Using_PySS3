Back on the old bs.I've been depressed and suicidal for a long time, I've seen and done it all, you get the picture.

For the last few weeks, I actually felt good. I didn't want to die. I genuinely had the will to live and I was confident that I could make something of myself. Usually this feelings lasts for no more than two days. I was honestly getting used to feeling good, but then I fucked up.

To keep it short, I'll just say that I said something to someone, and instead of hearing me out, they lost their shit and got me into a bad position by running their mouth. What I said to them was a problem I had with them, and I explained how their behavior pisses me off to no end, but they just denied they behave that way. Now I look like the villain, reminding me just how powerless I am.

Now everything is fucked up. I cut off my only supportive friend a few days ago. I'm stuck in a bad living situation with no way out. I don't have the money to move somewhere else, I don't have a job right now and I'm in a really unfortunate location because any work is a good three hour walk away, and I'm too much of a bitch to walk that twice a day (especially in scorching hot summer). I don't have any other transportation. 

I quit cutting myself for a while, but now I'm back to cutting daily, strongly considering suicide and losing all faith in myself for the future. It's funny how every time I end up back here it feels like the first time, even though this has happened hundreds of times. No idea what to do at this point.

Anyone in a similar situation? Or does anyone have anything to say?
