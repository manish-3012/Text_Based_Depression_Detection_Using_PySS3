I'm just not cool enough or attractive enoughBeen dealing with depression and anxiety all my life. When I was younger I was able to mask the pain pretty well but when I got older (especially after high school) the mask was torn off.

I'm 26M and have never ever had a girlfriend. I've had attractive girls show interest but I somehow would mess it up. r/Rateme gave me a 4.75/10 rating my game has to be super on point in order for me to have success.... something that has never happened.

Right now I have this oneitis over a girl who added me on IG. She's so beautiful and her photos of instagram are all with beautiful people. We worked together and she showed obvious signs of interest but she also has a BF who she's known for 10 years and been with off and on for 4. She acted like she was going to leave this dude but then changed her mind?

I'm trying to be more social so I got more active with IG. I followed some people I thought liked me but they don't want to follow back. I know that sounds so kiddish but it showed me something. I even messaged a couple of them just to say what's up and got NO MESSAGES back. I just unfollowed like 60 people who I "knew" and it feels horrible. You can see them following new people all the time on the feed but they can't follow me? I'm just not cool enough.

Never having a girlfriend or getting the girl you like, being overweight (though changing), not having many friends, not being that talented or having a unique skill, etc., starts to take its toll on you. I have random bursts of tears for like 10 seconds at a time as I just lay in my bed and think of the failures, no one has my corner besides family, and how old I'm getting and that I'm running out of time. It sucks!
