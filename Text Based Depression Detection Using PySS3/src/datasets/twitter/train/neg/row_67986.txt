Iâ€™m lostIdk where to turn. I donâ€™t want to bring anyone down irl so I canâ€™t talk to people. Iâ€™m just lost now. My future is gone, Iâ€™m going to accomplish nothing if I stay around. I lost the girl I loved and I canâ€™t move on. I donâ€™t spend time with my friends anymore. Iâ€™m so alone... all the time. I donâ€™t have my family anymore, which is kind of fine, because I donâ€™t have to be abused anymore, but I donâ€™t have anyone I can rely on. Itâ€™s only me. I cant take it. Iâ€™ve written suicide notes to the people I care about, including instructions with what to do with my body (donating it if possible, may as well do some good with my life, even if it is in death). Going to text all that out to people tomorrow, more than likely. I love hiking, so I have a pretty spot in the forest picked out. Need to get rope though. Idek why Iâ€™m posting here. I donâ€™t particularly want to die. It kinda scares me, in all honesty. Iâ€™m just too tired to go on.
