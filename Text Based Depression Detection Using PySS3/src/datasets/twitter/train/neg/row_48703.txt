What keeps you alive guys?For me it's curiosity , life I bad but it's also like a movie , it's addictive and you really want to see what's next despite the fact that you won't have a good time

Politicians are retarded , people talk shit , they riot like idiots for football clubs , Trump is the president of the US (I'd vote him because he is fun and says silly things)

We live inside a fucking rediculous comedy!

What's your reason for not ending it?
