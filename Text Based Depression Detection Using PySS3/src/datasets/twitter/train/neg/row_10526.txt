Thereâ€™s a gun next to me and it feels like it is calling me.I am struggling today. I made it one year; I proved I could do it. Great. 
But today, things arenâ€™t great. Iâ€™m looking at this gun, and thinking how quickly I could leave this world. This gun, this idea of suicide, they feel inescapable sometimes. It feels comfortable at all times, like an old lover. 
Itâ€™s calling to me now, and I donâ€™t know how not to answer.
