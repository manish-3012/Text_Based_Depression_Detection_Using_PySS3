To anyone considering suicide, hear me out and come to me if you need a friend :)Exactly one month ago today, one of my very close friends decided he needed to take his own life. Although I am grateful that his pain is finally gone, I am utterly devastated and in shock at the loss of such a beautiful person and talent. After this happened, I found a new appreciation in the people around me, family to friends to just the passer by. A few years ago, I was in the same situation and I thought there was no other way to make it all stop, and to get my peace that I so longed for. As someone who knows a feeling similar to yours, of hopelessness, emptiness, and the surprising calm that you reach when you make your decision, please try to keep fighting. Its hard, and its going to be hard, but then what in life is worth fighting for if you don't actually have to fight for it? There are always people out there that are willing to be your friends, and there is always going to be that lone ray of hope that manages to drag you out of the despair you have been in. My apologies if this comes off as depressing, or sinister, but I feel like things need to be told the way they really are. Just remember, it is never too late, and you are NEVER too far gone to turn back around. Talk to me, talk to anyone over at [r/trees](http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/) and no you don't have to be a stoner, just reach out to people and try to find the thing that you need in your life.
