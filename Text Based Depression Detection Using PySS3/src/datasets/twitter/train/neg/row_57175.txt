How do I make sure my body gets found?I want to do it tonight. I considered sending a delayed email but I don't really trust technology and I don't even know who to send it to. My RA? Campus PD? I need a good half hour to make sure I'm dead before the police/ambulance arrive. I have considered calling a suicide hotline and letting them  track me down but I feel like the timeline is too uncertain and they may arrive when I have brain damage but before I've fully died.
