Trying to get help but itâ€™s difficultIâ€™m in Canada and Iâ€™m from the us. I forgot my Zoloft so Iâ€™ve been withdrawing for a week. Iâ€™m constantly lightheaded and dizzy. Iâ€™m getting migraines. And I want to be dead.  

I went to a pharmacist and they said I can try taking Tylenol instead (?) but they canâ€™t help me otherwise. Canâ€™t get a drs appt. 

I tried calling three different crisis centers/hotlines but no one is picking up. I canâ€™t live Ike this anymore.
