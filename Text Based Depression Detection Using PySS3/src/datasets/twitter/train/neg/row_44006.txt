Being poor and ugly sucksAll my problems stem from not being wealthy and not being attractive. 

Whoever said money canâ€™t buy happiness is full of shit. If I had money all my problems would go away. I wouldnâ€™t have to worry about college tuition, I could buy myself a new phone and replace this piece of fucking garbage that Iâ€™m currently typing on that dies in less than 30 minutes when Iâ€™m just listening to music. I could buy myself everything that I donâ€™t have in my life. I could go on the Europe trip that I paid for but didnâ€™t go on because I didnâ€™t have enough money to cover expenses. I could buy myself a fucking car to drive myself to school since I donâ€™t have rich parents thatâ€™ll do it for me.

I get it, you canâ€™t have everything in life. Not everyone can be rich, thatâ€™s cool. But instead of being attractive to compensate for being poor Iâ€™m fucking ugly. I have ugly teeth, ugly hair, ugly face, ugly body, unbelievably scrawny ass arms and legs. Because Iâ€™m not rich or attractive I have no friends. Not once have I ever been invited over to someoneâ€™s house or to a party or gone out. People I talk to only talk to me at school and even thatâ€™s a lie because they only talk to me if forced to otherwise they go with their other friend groups.

Life fucking sucks if youâ€™re not rich or attractive. And to top off this fucking miserable shitty ass life in gonna burn in Hell forever when I kill myself which sucks because why the fuck was I brought into existence if all I was gonna do was suffer. Iâ€™m going to hell anyways so I might as well just speak my kind freely about god. He lets millions of innocent people who WANT to live die but then creates people like me who DONâ€™T want to live. How is that fair? I wish I had never been born.

Iâ€™m gonna kms sometime in March. Iâ€™m gonna get high af and take a bunch of sleeping pills and then cut my scrawny ass arms elbow to wrists and put my shitty ass earbuds in and let my blood puddle on my bed as the life slips away from me.
