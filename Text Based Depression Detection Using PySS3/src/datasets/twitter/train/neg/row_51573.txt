Starting to feel like I'm heading in this direction and I feel lost and stuck, like I won't be able to get out.I think I'm starting to just run out of energy for life.  I've been stuck in grad school for longer than any of my co-workers in my lab.  I've not been able to get new friendships with people (many of my friends have left for new jobs).  Those friendships I thought could be something good, ended rather abruptly and bluntly, meanwhile I've been destructive to one I've wholeheartedly wanted and I want to fix how I feel in that one, but don't know if they'll want that.
My therapist asked why all of my discussions with her come with no emotion, and I feel like I can only put in enough emotional energy to be upset, or happy, or sad briefly and then I have nothing left to give emotion wise.  I think this has eaten into every aspect of my life but right now I don't feel the motivation to care or do something about it.
I've always told my therapist and to some extent, close friends, that I feel like I will want to end my life when I finally am absolutely alone.  And I feel like day by day by indecision to move forward with things is just gonna slowly push people and opportunities away.  Most days, I'm sad to have woken up again, sometimes the only thing that was keeping me excited for it was getting to say hello to someone else going through a difficult time and knowing that they were still here.

I don't know why I posted this here.  Maybe to just get it out without overburdening people.  Anyways...
