I have detested life since I was a child, I want to die but lack the courage.I am not only suicidal but an intellectual absurdist, even if my life was pure bliss (btw it is hell) Iâ€™d still want to die, you could say I have a suicidal personality disorder or something like this. Anyway Iâ€™ve never had the courage to go through with it any tips on how I should kill myself or commit to a date and time to do it.
