Not feeling any reason to live anymoreHello, my life literally sucks, i hate most people around me atm, i dont have what to talk about, because i got no interests in life. I cant find hobby, cuz i got no motivation to do anything. Life is just pure shit and im stuck doing nothing everyday with no purpose. I dont know why should i live anymore, if i would have a gun i would kill myself without even thinking, cuz gun relates to me to relieve of pain, for real. All the others ways of sucide i never consider, but gun i would enjoy ending this with one bullet. I know noone so ussles in this world as me, everyone knows what to do and why to do something, i got no idea wtf im doing and why.
