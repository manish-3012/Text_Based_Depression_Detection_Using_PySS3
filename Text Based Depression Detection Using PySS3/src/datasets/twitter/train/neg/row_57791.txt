i....*i was planning my suicide for this friday, the 21st. i prepared since wednesday cleaning, organizing, fasting, and gathering up materials for a hanging. i however decided not to go through with it. i made notes to every person in my life that i care deeply for, as well as a suicide note addressed to anyone who would read it. i then made 450 hand written notes to everyone in my senior class, and as i was creating them i had a lot of time to think. i realized that i should wait. all the notes i wrote to those closest to me showed me how much i matter in their lives and how my absence would affect them deeply. even if i don't really understand that now i think i will come to my senses eventually. this feeling of wanting my existence to end prematurely is something i will never get rid of, i'm just not going to act on it for the sake of others. my thought is to wait for the new year and if by that time if i'm still ready to leave, i will go. my notes and everything else are prepared so i will wait. i will wait until 010918. then my time will come, and i will embrace my transition wholeheartedly. thank you for listening. :)*
