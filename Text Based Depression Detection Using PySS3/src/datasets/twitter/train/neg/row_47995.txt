Nothing helps anymore, I feel hopelessMy psycologist told me that any time I have the urge to do something to myself I need to call him immediately but I don't even want to, even If I do the bad thoughts will come back...I feel so discouraged and I think nothing will help me. It's like I can't think straight, I can only think about doing something awful to myself withouth thinking about consequences. I thought things would get better and tried to be strong for years but now I feel drained. I can't stand being myself and living anymore.
