Nothing is ever going to get better.Everything is getting worse. Although people try to understand, no one does or ever 
will. I've never been good enough for my mum, and I never will be. She only tries to hug me or tell me she loves me after she realises that she's said something mean (a rarity). I'll never be good enough for anyone in my family; for anyone at all. I'm a disgusting person. I look nice on the outside, but I have these fucked up thoughts. I will never be able to secure a job. I never know what I want. I'm just not cut out for this world. 

I was on my death bed and scared of death. Now I wish it would come. Quick, before I change my mind again..
