Darkness.I've seen the true darkness inside of myself and let me tell you. It's fucking horrific. I've been this way since I was maybe 7-8 and its only continued to get stronger throughout my life but now I sense that it's coming to a furor. I know I should just kill myself, it's the only way to fix whats wrong with me, it's the only way to rid the world of my darkness. Why can't I do it? Why do I always stop myself? I hold the knife up to my chest and wish with all my might that I could just plunge it in and let go but slowly my hand drops and the urge passes and I somehow decide that I'll do it another day. No one understands how sick I am and I can't explain for the risks involved. I'm not making sense. Nothing makes sense. I want to die. 
I don't want to be sick anymore. I don't want to be the broken little boy living inside of the shell of a young man anymore. I don't want to be the evil that made me. I don't want to be the darkness I see in my heart and mind. I don't want to exist anymore. It should be so easy to just have done with it, one swift, hard movement and I could find my peace.
