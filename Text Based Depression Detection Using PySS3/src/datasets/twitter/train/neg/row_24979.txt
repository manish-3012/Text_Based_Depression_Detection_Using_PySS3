I looked up ways to kill myself today. I wonder if that's a sign..Living is interesting, but i think i had enough... I have so much to do and so many things to catch up on if i continue to live... I think i don't have the energy to do it. I'm 25 this year and i haven't completed a thing in my life due to my atttention problem. I know im smart, but it doesn't matter if you can't hardness it and focus. I wish i could make my parents proud, but i can't. I haven't even finished high school. how fucking long will it take to finish things now? I wish i could bring a girl home and tell my parents this is the person i want to be the rest of my life with and watch their happy faces... But no one wants to date someone that haven't completed anything in their life, and i understand that. All i wanted was to be able to focus and be at the same lenght as my friends, but they sail futher and futher away... i just wanted to be normal. I'm jealous of people with kids.. I wish i could have that, little mini me to grow old with.. But what can i give anyway.

I promised myself i would at least try to make my life a little meaningful for others before i die. Last year, i saved a 16yr girl. She have told me multiple times she wouldn't be alive if it weren't for me. I'm glad i managed to save someone. Finally i was a little useful... I wonder if my parents would be somewhat okay if i died? Even if i don't wanna be here, they can still live and have happy days right? And my two younger brothers.. i wonder if they would forgive me. All i wanted was to just be a good big brother... i hope i did a good job.. i hope they learned something valuable from me. And even if im not there they can still contiune and support each other.

I have this fantasy, im sitting at a bench watching the sunset. Then i ask myself, was my life worth living? Yea it wasn't that bad, i had quite fun. Then i think about my good times and disappear. I have a ridiculous high desire to fulfill this fantasy these days.
