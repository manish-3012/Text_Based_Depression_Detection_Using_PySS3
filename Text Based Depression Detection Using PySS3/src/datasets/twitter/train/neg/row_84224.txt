Nothing works. Now I'm stuck living.Why is every method so horrible, why didn't it work the last 15 times? Why did it have to hurt so much, why didn't I faint or black out like it said I would. Why do I have to keep living, nobody cares so why do I have to wait. Why do I have to be so fucking depressed every second of my life, Why am I never happy, Why do I have to fake happiness around my family everyday, Why can't I ever sleep at a good time, Why do I have to call the suicide hotline so much. Why does everyone leave me, Why do people act like they care and leave because I havent gotten better from them telling me it's gonna be okay? No, nothing is going to be okay. Why do I have to do everything myself.
