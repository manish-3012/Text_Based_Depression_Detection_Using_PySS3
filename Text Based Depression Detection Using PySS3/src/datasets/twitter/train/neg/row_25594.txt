Am I the only one that sometimes thinks of what Iâ€™d put in my suicide note and how it would effect the people I mention in it?I had a friend that completely ditched me because I was depressed. She has even worse depression than I do, and I fell into a bad state (that I hadnâ€™t been in in awhile) and she decided she didnâ€™t want to be my friend anymore because I wasnâ€™t taking care of myself and I was just making my own situation worse by avoiding all my problems. I was isolating myself, as I do, when Iâ€™m overwhelmed with anxiety, and I felt that she of all people should understand how it feels. Her doing this (without any explanation, she just cut me off and started ignoring me) caused me to try and talk it out but of course we both started getting mad at each other. That fight happened a couple weeks ago and while I know Iâ€™ve done all I can do to fix things since then and that itâ€™s just not worth it to worry anymore, I just canâ€™t help but be filled with dread when I see her.

Anyways, Iâ€™ve always found myself wondering what would happen if I killed myself and left a note behind explaining the negative toll she had on me. This is probably unhealthy to do so, right? To think of this kind of stuff? Does anyone know why I do this? Is it beneficial for me in any way to dream of the person causing my only anxiety at the moment to finally realize how horribly they made me feel? I feel so selfish to think of this kind of thing.

For the record, I have not gotten around to actually writing a note. It would probably be good for me to write out my feelings and maybe journal, but if I write out a note specifically Iâ€™ll probably just be encouraging myself to end things. I donâ€™t have any plans to do so; Iâ€™m fortunate to be okay with most other things going on right now.

But I came here to see if anyone else often wonders this kind of thing?
