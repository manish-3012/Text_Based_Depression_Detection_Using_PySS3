Iâ€™m so tiredIâ€™m laying down in on my bed with about 20 Benadryl pills and a bottle of Smirnoff. I see no reason to be alive. People keep leaving me. People keep abandoning me. I canâ€™t keep anybody around me for long. My sister hates me, my boyfriend left, my father barely talks to me. Such a large family I have and not a soul wants to be around me. I feel so worthless. What the fuck was I even born for? I donâ€™t even want a next life. With my luck Iâ€™ll remember this one while the next one is worse. 

I wish there was a small corner in this world for me, but thatâ€™s not possible.
