I think I just need to type this out.Currently: Sitting in my car in a parking lot. Itâ€™s been one hour. I should stay here at least one more hour before going home. Because I told my boyfriend Iâ€™d be gone a couple hours to let him have the house to himself. We got into a fight yesterday, he didnâ€™t come to bed until 5:30am when he assumed Iâ€™d be asleep, and then this morning he stayed upstairs the whole time pretty much just to avoid me. So I left to give him space.

That isnâ€™t a major problem. But itâ€™s hurtful and isolating. I have zero friends. My family lives 2000 miles away but they very rarely reach out to me at all anymore. So it kind of feels like I have no one.

The whole solution to our fight would be me just apologizing and being happy and welcoming to him again. But I canâ€™t do that. Because I have issues I guess. I just want him to come to me. I donâ€™t want him to let me leave. But he did. He didnâ€™t care and he probably prefers that I am gone.

Again, this isnâ€™t a major problem. I think itâ€™s just the cherry on top of everything else. Iâ€™ve been thinking about killing myself seriously for about a week now. These thoughts have been with me most of my life. Usually not this serious though. But still its exhausting.

I am a functional person. But only just functional. I canâ€™t do anything more in life than the bare minimum. I simply donâ€™t have the energy. I am really just tired of living in pain and fear every single day.

I have tried to pull myself up by the bootstraps and make my life better. But in the end I just canâ€™t. Iâ€™ve tried medication but at best it makes me numb and doesnâ€™t really fix anything. Iâ€™ve tried therapy. There are some good things about it but in the end... still solves nothing.

So, this started over thanksgiving. It was with my boyfriends family. I had a bad toothache, so lo and behold his sister-in-law is a nurse and decided to call me in some pain meds. Tbh I would have been happy with ibuprofen. But now I have this big bottle of Tramadol just sitting in a drawer. I never took any of it because Iâ€™m kind of anti-medicine and felt like it would just knock me out.

But I canâ€™t quit thinking about just giving up and taking the whole bottle of pills. I researched it and it actually causes a lot of deaths every year from overdoses. I think it could work. Itâ€™s a real option.

The only issue is... what if it doesnâ€™t? Thereâ€™s a chance I could end up in a coma or give myself brain damage or heart damage. I donâ€™t want to fuck my life over even more.

But, I am losing endurance. I have been on this planet for almost 28 years now. And really it just sucks. Life is not fun. Itâ€™s not happy or good. Itâ€™s so, so difficult. Everyone hurts you. Everyone is selfish, me included. This is not a good place and I think I would prefer nothingness.
