I keep posting to this stupid sub hoping someone will save meI donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m expecting. Sometimes someone will pm me and itâ€™s really nice but it doesnâ€™t last more than a day or two. I want someone to make a cure for my stomach issues, someone to hold my hand and help me feel better about my body, I want a therapist that can actually break me out of my disordered eating. Can someone save me please?
