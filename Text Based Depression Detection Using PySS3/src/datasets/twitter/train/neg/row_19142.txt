I don't know how to keep living with unbearable chronic pain, I can only think of death.I am a 20 year old man. I've been living in daily pain since May 2017.

For two months it had gotten better, I thought I was actually getting better finally, however the pain came back a few days ago with the same strength as before. I promised myself I wouldn't go through this again, and that I would end it for good if it ever came back as horrible.

This is no life. I was 18 years old when the illness started, and I was on my last year of high school. I had to drop out, I had to become home bound, I've had to deal with the pain at every waking moment, I'm literally shaking from pain right now.

This is a life long disease. Very rare by the way, I am one of the unlucky few to get this f\*king sh\*t.

Worst of all, it was not something I was born with, I was perfectly healthy.  In fact, this literally came overnight: 7th May 2017, I am an 18 year old man willing to put everything to have a bright future and help humanity in every way I could through software engineering, but then, 8th May 2017, I'm in bed struggling with an extremely strange pain that came out of nowhere.

It's fine. It happens. The human body fails, and modern medicine still doesn't have a cure for many things. But why should I let this go on if I can stop it?
