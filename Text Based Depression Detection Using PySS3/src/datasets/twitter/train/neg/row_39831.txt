I'm 27Â½ years old. I'm a chick with a lot of irreparable issues and I want to dieHi everyone. I'm Iona (I own a house) 

I'm 27 and a half years old and I'm suffering to the point where I've been severely suicidal for the last 6 months. I have plans to kill myself. I don't have the courage to take a gun to my head, or throw myself off a bridge. But I thought about OD. 

 

I have: 

1) Borderline Personality Disorder

2) Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder (I feel dead and detached from reality, every second of the day for over 6 years. It won't go away. I've taken every drug, done every talking therapy) 

3) I have severe Depression and Anxiety 

4) I have never known love (never had a boyfriend, never known how)

5) I have no money, nothing to my name

6) I have no job, no full education to do the career that I think I could do

7) No husband, no kids (my personality disorder would just harm them, hurt them)

8) I self harmed (I deliberately stopped myself from sleeping for over 4 years; my hair has fallen out, I have prematurely aged, my body aches every second of the day, I've got arthritis, constant hypertension in my thighs)

9) I don't know who I am. I'm traumatized, I've been abandoned and abused.

I want to go, to leave my pain and suffering behind. My 20s have been miserable and so far behind in living. I keep comparing myself to other girls my age and what they're doing, their success.

I have never felt good enough, pretty enough, smart enough, cool enough. I hate life and I can't live it anymore.
