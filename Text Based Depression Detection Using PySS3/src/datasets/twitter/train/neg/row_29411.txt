Power in each of us
In this moment, the Universe wants you to knowâ€¦..please donâ€™t let anyone ever convince you that your voice doesnâ€™t matter, that your vote doesnâ€™t count, or that your contribution isnâ€™t a pivotal offering in the tipping point of human consciousness.
You are that essential to the sum of the whole. You have an important mission to live out. You have special gifts, qualities, and attributes to share. You have a light to shine, with a frequency that contains a brightness that only you can bring forth. Whether you feel this depth of esteem, are awaiting permission to think this highly of yourself, or feel left out of a world you deeply want to be a part of, the love of the Universe reaches out to you, no matter your current circumstances, reminding you that you are seen, you are honored, you are respected, you are adored -- exactly the way you are.
Artists donâ€™t make mistakes, they simply make ingenious choices; leaving the rest of the world an infinite amount of time and space to decode the meaning behind each decision. In the same way, the great cosmic artist has rendered its most glorious work of art â€” perfect, whole, and complete. Your lifelong invitation is to embrace the majestic tapestry that is you and to figure out how perfectly you were created by a Source that knows no misstep.
You were created perfectly for the fulfillment of your lifeâ€™s mission, where every choice, decision, word, and reaction conveyed from the depth of your conscious intention yields impeccable results for our awakening world. Whether more ready than ever before, or scared out of your mind to make a mistake, the lights are on and the stage is set as the Universe invites you forward to star in a play that only you can bring to life.
