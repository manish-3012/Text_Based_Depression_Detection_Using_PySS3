I feel like I need to kill myself to prove myself.youâ€™re so horrible to me. you made me, you gave me attachment issues, you made me feel like I need to constantly fight for peoples validation to prove my worth, you made me feel like I wasnâ€™t worth anything unless I gave you money or drugs so why am I THE PROBLEM??? because Iâ€™m now completely aware Iâ€™m fucked up thanks to TWO STUPID FUCKING PARENTS and I donâ€™t know what to do about it??? Because sometimes I have an attitude like every 17 year old??? 

Why are you so nice to everyone around me then your smile immediately leaves once you see my face? Am I really that bad to be around? Iâ€™m sorry. I know you love me deep down but please just let me know. I just want either of you guys to tell me youâ€™re proud or show some interest in anything I do, I feel so worthless because of you both and now itâ€™s too late. 

Donâ€™t fucking cry over me when I jump in front of a train.
