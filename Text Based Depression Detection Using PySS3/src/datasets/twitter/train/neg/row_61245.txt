So I called the suicide hotlineI just got released from jail.

I never expressed any willingness to hurt anyone. I called the suicide hotline that reddit provided and shared my story. After hanging up, and feeling like my issues were tossed aside, in favor of legal intervention, I felt lost.

A half hour later, police knocked at my door. 

I answered, and let them know my rights. They ended up leaving. 

But, Iâ€™m still here and having suicidal ideations. I donâ€™t want to be arrested. I want to feel better. 

Iâ€™m scared to ask for help. Iâ€™m not a criminal.
