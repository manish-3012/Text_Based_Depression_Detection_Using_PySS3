Wanting to commit suicide out of boredom.In my childhood I experienced some â€œstuffâ€ and ever since, I havenâ€™t been able to feel anything. Not sadness, happiness or anything. Everything just seems fake, and Iâ€™m the only real person here. I often get suicidal thoughts because Iâ€™m really bored, I donâ€™t know if thatâ€™s weird or something.
