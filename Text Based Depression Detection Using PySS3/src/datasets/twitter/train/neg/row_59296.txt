life is something for "the route is the goal"- peopleI am not one of those people (if they exist and not just lie to themselves). every existence is a watcher observing a process. but why extend such process? to me, the goal is the goal. and the route is something you wanna keep as easy and short as possible or avoid it completely. please world, take a honest look at life. do you work, because you wanna work? or because you get paid? would you do it without getting paid? the goal is the goal and the route is just torture, wake up omg
