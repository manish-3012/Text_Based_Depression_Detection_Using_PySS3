I fluctuate between depression and optimism.I know Iâ€™ll never get better with my chronic pain and depression. The saddest part is I have no one else to blame but myself. I was the one who chose to have the elective surgery cause I thought it would make me happier but I was wrong. Look at what happened. I removed everyone from my life including my close friends and mom. I canâ€™t even talk to them without feeling guilty and embarrassed. Please donâ€™t say they wonâ€™t mind because my mom would be devastated if she found out what Iâ€™ve been going through. I have so much I want to do in life and my life is pretty much over because of the pain and guilt. I am also paranoid at all times. 

If only I could go back in time.
