I want to get coronavirusUnfortunately I'm in Australia, where we've temporarily snuffed out the virus. Was really looking forward to getting it, on the off chance that my immune system isn't that great and it kills me. There will be a second wave eventually. Then I'll go out and get the virus. I really hope it's strong enough to take me out.
