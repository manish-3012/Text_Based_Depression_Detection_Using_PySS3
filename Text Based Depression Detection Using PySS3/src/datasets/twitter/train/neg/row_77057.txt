I need help, but Im afraidI'm afraid that if I call a hotline or something that theyll call the cops on me and put me back in the hospital. Im afraid of my parents knowing Im suicidal and that they will treat me like Im 5. Im afraid that if I go to therapy I will only feel worse, which is what always happens. Im afraid that if I dont get help I will end up hurting myself, and Im afraid of giving myself premenent injury instead of dying. It feel like no matter what I do it wont end up well. Ive been to therapy for years before, and it has never helped. I dont even think I can be helped, because everything shows that I cant.
