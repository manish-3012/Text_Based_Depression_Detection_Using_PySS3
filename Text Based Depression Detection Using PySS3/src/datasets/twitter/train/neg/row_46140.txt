Ever heard of Dr. Death?Jack Kevorkian was a pathologist that publicly championed a terminalâ€™s patient â€œright to dieâ€ by physician-assisted suicide in the most painless way possible. He assisted over 130 suicides with what he called â€œThe Thanatronâ€ meaning death (machine) in Greek. He was eventually tried four times for assisting suicides and was found guilty of second-degree homicide. He was then sentenced to serve 10-25 years in prison but was released after 8 years on parole. In the verdict, he said, â€œShe made the decision that her existence had lost its purpose. And you cannot judge that.â€ What do you think? I personally like and admire him for what he did.
