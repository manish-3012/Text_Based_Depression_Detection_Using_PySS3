I want to fuck myself up so much thereâ€™s no going back. *severe sh trigger warning*I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m posting to be honest. My situation is dire and itâ€™s just not getting any better. Itâ€™s been 18 months since this all started. Iâ€™ve stabbed myself in the stomach, three times. Thatâ€™s on top of the constant severe cutting, swallowing shit, getting black out drunk and hoping Iâ€™d bleed out. One time I stabbed myself I ended up in ICU and in hospital for 6 months because Iâ€™d fucked my insides up so much I went into intestinal failure, my bowel contents came out through my skin and I was fed through a central line. That was the worst pain Iâ€™ve ever experienced. Iâ€™ve had countless surgeries to fix what I fuck up, one that was massive and required me to see the leading bowel surgeons in the UK. Part of me is grateful we have the health service we do, Iâ€™ve met so many amazing people and I donâ€™t want to let them down. On the other hand I know Iâ€™ve fucked up my insides so much already and I want to do it again. But this time I want to fuck my body up so much thereâ€™s no coming back from it. I had a bowel resection a month ago and I know if I did anything now then the scar tissue would prevent them from being able to do any more surgery. I have everything to do it, apart from alcohol but I donâ€™t need that really. Iâ€™m currently on a one to one supervision to stop me self harming, but they leave when I â€œgo to bedâ€. The only thing stopping me is knowing how much Iâ€™d destroy those people closest to me. Iâ€™d lose my place to live but I wouldnâ€™t care because I wouldnâ€™t be coming back anyway. I want these thoughts to stop so much, but the only way of making them stop is to do them. I donâ€™t want to upset anyone but my situation never improves. This addiction will kill me one day and I just want the people I love to be upset, I want them to be relieved that this is finally over.
