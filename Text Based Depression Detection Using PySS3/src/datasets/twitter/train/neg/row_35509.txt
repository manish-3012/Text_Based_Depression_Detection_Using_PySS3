FiancÃ© told his mother Iâ€™m suicidal and Iâ€™m fucking annoyedSo Iâ€™ve been having suicidal ideation because of multiple reasons including my fiancÃ© being bipolar and treating me like shit on his bouts of rage, and career related stuff and being depressed and all that. 

The reason for this post is that because we are kinda willing to work things out and during casual conversation heâ€™s told me that he has told his mother about my suicidal ideation and plan. 

I feel betrayed and embarrassed and it feels like being outed out of the closet by the only person you trusted your secret. 

Just that I guess, I had nobody to talk about it but you guys.
