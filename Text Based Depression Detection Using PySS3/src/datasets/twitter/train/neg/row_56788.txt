Why shouldn't I?* TMAU, permanent condition
* mysterious illness/chronic pain (undiagnosed)
* emotional abuse from childhood
* feeling "stuck" in life
* cannot hold on to a job even though graduated from Uni
* no other human wants to be around me/consistently devalued from being perceived as unhygienic/diseased because of tmau
* bullied because sheltered life
* cannot see myself supporting myself in the long-term financially
* momentary joys in life cannot balance the weight on my shoulders
* cannot properly fit into society
* tired of mom breathing down my back 24/7
* tired of a few shitty friends that mock me and use me for their entertaining pleasures
* tired of moving all the time to rent &amp; reside in same tiny space with my mother and brother as a late twentier. Cannot hold downs job long enough to move out and shitty housing market. Enraging cycle repeats.
* will never be truly unconditionally loved by another (tmau)
* joys that used to bring me pleasure have gone plain and bland
* shitty situation I do not deserve to be in
* Did I mention, I'm really really tired?

Why shouldn't I?
