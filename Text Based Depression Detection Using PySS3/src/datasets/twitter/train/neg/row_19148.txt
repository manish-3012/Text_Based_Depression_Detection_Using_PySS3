Somebody please talk me out of thisI don't want to live without experiencing true emotions. I am sad when I'm happy and happy when I'm sad. 

Happiness is horrible for me. I get so angry, tired and eventually begin yearning to not be happy.

Likewise, nothing is enjoyable when its the opposite. I can't do anything. I forget to eat and I eat too much. I feel disgusting. I feel dumb. I feel like a disgrace.

I can't express how I feel. I can't describe what I mean. 

But, please, just give me a reason to live. I don't care about still having things to live for or anything. Everyone does. Even people who have no choice other than to stop living. 

I don't want to be an unintelligent fool that can't feel or think for himself. I hate who I am, but I love who I've become. And I despise that.

I'm so sorry for none of this truly making any sense. I can't form paragraphs or anything correctly right now.
