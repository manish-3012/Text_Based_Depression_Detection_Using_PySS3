What do I doIâ€™ve had suicidal thoughts for a while now. I had one attempt that I didnâ€™t go through with about a year ago. Iâ€™m at a loss, The suicidal thoughts just donâ€™t stop and get worse with how long I am awake. I told a doctor once, but my mom convinced me to cancel the set up appointment and go to a religious psychologist. It didnâ€™t help and now my whole family knows. I just donâ€™t know what to do, I am a student still living with family. I donâ€™t want them to know Iâ€™m still suicidal but I want help. The last time I called the suicide prevention line they never picked up. I just need help without the judgement I canâ€™t look my family in the eye and it makes it worse.
