iâ€™m terrified that iâ€™ll never see my best friend againi am extremely suicidal. i am barely hanging on and i have plans to kill myself rather soon. sounds good right? the problem is, i have this best friend. i love him more than anything else in the whole fucking galaxy. i really fucking adore him. heâ€™s my favorite person in the world. whenever i talk to him it just brightens me the fuck up because heâ€™s just fucking amazing and i love the shit out of him. next week is also finals week, last week before i have a big long break from school. i donâ€™t plan on surviving this break. i have three more days to see him in class (we donâ€™t see each other much outside of school, heâ€™s very very busy). i fear i will never see him again after these last three days. that absolutely breaks my fucking heart. i have been sobbing for about an hour and a half thinking about it tonight. thatâ€™s just, not enough time. not enough time to laugh with him or see the fucking light that radiates off his entire fucking persona and, itâ€™s not enough time to hug him, not enough time to tell him i hope he has a good day or to have a good night. not enough time to text him about the shit iâ€™m up to and ask him how he is. not enough time to listen to his voice or look up and see his face or fucking anything. and thatâ€™s not even beginning to think about how heâ€™ll be affected. he will be /devastated/ once he finds out what iâ€™ve done to myself. oh my god i canâ€™t even think about it. holy fucking shit i canâ€™t do this to him. heâ€™s the fucking light of my life. and iâ€™d destroy him if i took my life away. but i know i donâ€™t want to go on. fuck. i donâ€™t know if i can kill myself. just thinking about how kind he is to me. oh, my love. iâ€™m so sorry. i donâ€™t want this to be the end, my dear. iâ€™m going to try for you okay? i love you darling. you deserve the world and i canâ€™t take myself away from you. i adore you. and i canâ€™t let you miss me. 

tl;dr- i think iâ€™m gonna kill myself but i love my best friend and donâ€™t feel okay saying goodbye to him, iâ€™m reconsidering, iâ€™m in a lot a lot of pain about this whole thing. sobbing.
