Ive got that Collegetime sadnessIm looking for similar stories to give me hope. 
I have been wracked by delusions, paranoia and despair after being a stoner all second year. I quit weed, quit porn but at this point (end of 3rd year) I cant help but fear its too late to make friends this late into school. Call me a snowflake but it makes very sad going to class everyday, seeing people in their groups, laughing, etc. I see guys running into girls they know, the girls face lighting up as they begin to talk. All these people i will never know, never know their stories, all here in this shining moment before dispersing into the workforce.
I never skip a social occasion/party but i feel like an 'accepted outsider'
Some men arent meant for family and home. Its a constant struggle. One half says never give up, but the other side says dissapear in the army. Its a constant battle betwen hope and deep regret.
