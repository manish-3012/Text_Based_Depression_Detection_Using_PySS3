why do i ever expect something good to happen?because it won't.. im a nobody.. a complete failure.. who would ever like me? i have a counsellor.. but not even she can help me with how i feel.. i don't wanna live.. but i'm too much of a loser to go through with killing myself.. i listen to music and usually that helps.. but as i sit and type this.. im listening to songs that usually help.. but they dont.. "i'll mend your heart and break it in the same breath".. "Am I all that you never wanted?".. "Cause I promised myself I'd never never hurt you and I did".. those 3 lines are from Dial tones by as it is.. i need to stop talking to others.. i only get depressed and my hopes always get too high.. i really give up with life rn..
