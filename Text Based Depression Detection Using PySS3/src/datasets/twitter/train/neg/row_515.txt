I know what is after life and I want itI had an NDE in 2009 after an ATV accident and I remember the afterlife. It was so beautiful. No pain, complete and utter peace(for lack of a better term)

My  Life is similar to a vacation where youâ€™re staying at an acquaintanceâ€™s house and they tell you â€œmake yourself at home.â€
But youâ€™re still a bit uneasy, and you still tip toe around because you know you canâ€™t get too comfortable, and no matter how many accommodations they can provide, you know that 
It. Is. Not. Your. Home.
It never will be. 

I will be going back home this Friday the 22nd. I already have a place, time,and plan. 

Thank you all for your encouraging words and support.
