I really hope I donâ€™t regret not killing myself. I hope we all do not.Itâ€™s weird, I wanted to kill myself ever since I was 14. Iâ€™m 20 now. Things have changed. Some for the worse, some for the better. I still want to kill myself while Iâ€™m young though. I know I wonâ€™t when I get older.

I havenâ€™t purely because of fear. I mean, weâ€™ve evolved to not do it. Iâ€™m scared of death, scared of pain, scared of jumping off a bridge.

Nevertheless I thought that it doesnâ€™t have to be this way. I hope in 20 years weâ€™ve all found meaning in our lives, I hope weâ€™ve had our way and won. Maybe we wonâ€™t, maybe itâ€™ll all start going downhill, but then again - maybe it wonâ€™t. I feel like weâ€™re so depressed for a reason, maybe weâ€™re chosen. Stay strong.
