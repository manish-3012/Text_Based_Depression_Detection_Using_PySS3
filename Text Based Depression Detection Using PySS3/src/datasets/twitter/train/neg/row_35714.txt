I couldn't do itI wanted to end it earlier this day. I was sitting at the side of the bath when I started shivering really heavily. It's like everytime I want to try it I just become really anxious. Does anyone know how to do it without being afraid and thinking too much?

Ps: please don't come at me with that "it gets better" because it won't help and I don't want it.
