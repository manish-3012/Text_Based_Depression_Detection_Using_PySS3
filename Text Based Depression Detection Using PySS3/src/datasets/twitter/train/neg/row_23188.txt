I feel lost and donâ€™t know what to do. I want to end it but donâ€™t want to hurt those around me...My entire adult life as well as much of my teen years Iâ€™ve had suicidal thoughts. As time goes by the get worse and more real. The way Iâ€™ve found to keep going is by having close friends. They are what keep me alive. 

Life feel unbearable and lonely. No boyfriend and very little hope of actually finding the right guy. Iâ€™ve been through as deep depression of unending death thoughts and ways to make it happen. This is how my best friend got my position. She would make me go out and do fun things. Sheâ€™d come over and pick me up even when I didnâ€™t want to go. 

Now the feelings are back and stronger than ever. I often have thoughts of getting a gun and doing the deed. If someone handed me one I know Iâ€™d take the opportunity and do it with little thought. I donâ€™t ever want to hurt my family and friends though. Lately my best friend has changed and turned into a selfish person showing little consideration of others. It feels like we shouldnâ€™t be friends anymore but she is also my only friend. Losing a friend is like losing a reason to keep going. 

I am on meds and have seen a therapist in the past. I just donâ€™t want to get myself out there to find another therapist (the one I had retired). I need help. I donâ€™t know what kind but I just need help. I donâ€™t want to scar those around me...
