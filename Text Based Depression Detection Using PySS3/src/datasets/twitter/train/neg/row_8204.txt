I just wish i had a solid reason to liveEvery time I open up about my suicidal thoughts to others it's always followed by "Hey don't kill yourself, I'll be sad" followed by immediate change of subject. That's a nice thing to say, but what about me, frankly? Is there a reason I shouldn't kill myself that actually has to do with me? It just seems like a tacit agreement that my life sucks.

 "If you kill yourself it'll never get better" seems to be the closest I can find, but that's ringing less and less true to me. And it's already not getting better. My job is over at the end of the summer, maybe sooner. My lease ends at the same time and I haven't renewed it because I'm tired of living in a college town at my age, but I have no idea where I want to go. I feel like my life has deteriorated past the point of no return. But people don't want me to end it because they'll be sad. This year is kicking my ass. I just feel totally helpless
