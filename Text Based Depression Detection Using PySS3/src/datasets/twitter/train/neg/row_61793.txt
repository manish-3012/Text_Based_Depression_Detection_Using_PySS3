I'm really at the end of my rope. I don't even know what I did.I'm homeless. I had a good home, kids, dogs, cars, computers, an IT consultant for 20 years. I always had someone to help me, to hold me. I was almost an alcoholic because I hit the bottle after my wife cheated on me but I never thought I was one but I had to say I was. I don't do drugs. I was physically abused. I have proof. My ex-wife destroyed everything. I went to my mom's and still my ex went from Texas to Easton and showed up at her door. I've been doing hard labor at minimal wage. I was on something called lamatrogine and clonazapam but didn't want to be on it. My health insurance changed and was canceled. I got hurt at work and am on something called workers compensation. I'm in a lot of pain. I've been in a hotel in Easton PA paying $100 per night just doing nothing. I reached out to shelters but somehow I make too much. I'm in a nightmare. I tell people I wish  could look at god at least once and say what the heck, I never asked for this. I did good. I had kids. They were brought up right. I never hit anyone, never hurt anyone, always helped out. I've gone from having a huge data center to a laptop which I held dear to me, because well it's a Thinkpad and they used them on space shuttles and ISS. I don't have anything but a good phone and this computer and some clothes.

I really need help
. I tried, I really did. You can have my phone number.

It's really a warm place, you know. A warm safe place. You can go there.

If nobody believes you, it's still there. I did a lot in life.
