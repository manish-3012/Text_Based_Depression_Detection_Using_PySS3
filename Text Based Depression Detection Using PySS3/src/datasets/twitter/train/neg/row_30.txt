7 YearsGuys, I've been here before, a few years ago. You were all more or less supportive the last time (more or less) so here's a belated thank you for the kindness.

I've been dealing with an unbelievable degree of stress for a long time now. From repeated experience I'm way better off not hoping for anything whatsoever. For this reason, I've decided not to go into any details on this post. Instead I'm going to put [a link here](http://llawht4.blogspot.com/2012/09/with-every-breath.html) which serves as a reference to these insane events in my life. (I chose a blog entry that happened a few years back because it's less of a rant than normal.) I'm not doing this for you guys to pour over as it's heavy reading...and intense, so don't worry about it. I like to think of it as an "rlexperiment was here"--a marker of my existence.

Please don't reject this post. Please don't force me to share information. Please don't take it against me if I don't reply back to those who might comment. I'm conserving my energy. If you're sincere and good-willed, then know in advance that I appreciate your kind gesture. I might very well die from my circumstances, miserable and alone. But hey! Right now, I'm not in such a bad mood. I'd like to wish you all good cheer and happiness.
