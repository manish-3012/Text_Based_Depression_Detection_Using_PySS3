I've given up trying to be happy and I just need someone to listenI have nobody else I can say this to so I'm putting it here. I used to have someone who made every day better, I was happy then but they're gone now. They never really cared about me and now I know that the happiest period of my life was nothing but a lie. I loved her more than anything in the world and now I don't think I'll ever be able to feel the same way about anyone again.

I've wasted my life sitting alone, hunched over in front of a computer instead of getting out there and living my life. I've never been to a party, gotten drunk, hooked up with someone and it feels like if I don't soon I never will. But I don't know how, I don't know anyone who would let me tag along or make sure I'm doing it safely and I'll end up spending the rest of my life regretting having never had these experiences.

I've been in such a bad place these last few months hat I've fucked up the rest of my life too. My grades have all dropped and I've missed the deadline for my university applications anyway so I'm essentially just thrown my life away. My entire family is disappointed in me because they all believe I could've done so well for myself but none of them understand how badly I'm struggling with everything.

I have nothing to live for anymore. I can't fall in love anymore, I'll spend my life wishing I was someone else and any chances of getting my dream job are down the drain.

I just want all the pain and hopelessness to go away. I want to stop being miserable and the only way I know how is to stop living altogether. I'm planning on doing it next weekend, after I settle a few things first. Then I can finally be free.
