What does it actually matter?If I kill myself right now, I literally don't give a shit about what happens next because I'll be fucken dead. But if I don't kill myself, then I have to worry and stress about shit in future. I'm just saying, I don't really see much reason to keep this up.
Nix myself right now, and it's just done.
