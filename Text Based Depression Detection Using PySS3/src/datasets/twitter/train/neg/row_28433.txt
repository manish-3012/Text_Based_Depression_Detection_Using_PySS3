No one's going to knowSometimes I wish that I was someone important. Like JK Rowling, or Keanu Reeves, so that everyone could point the finger at me and say: "look at this man, he didn't have it easy at all, look at everything he's done in spite of it".  


Like a final moment of glory where everything that happened suddenly makes sense. When suddenly everyone sees your heart and your value, and you're just accepted...  


Why wouldn't the world be impressed if only they knew ? Everyone that spoke ill of me suddenly invalidated... Everyone that stood in my way, with their winner-loser view of the world suddenly silenced... But that never happens. There is no movie of my life, there is no song, and all those sad songs that give me some measure of hope were written for someone cuter, richer, and better than me.  


And when I do kill myself, the world wont even miss a heartbeat... My sister will be sad but she'll move on. I might as well have never existed.
