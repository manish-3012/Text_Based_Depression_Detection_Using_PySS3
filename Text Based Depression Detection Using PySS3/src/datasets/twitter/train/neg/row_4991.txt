How do I get over my fear of death?This is the most optimal time for me to die, and yet I can't bring myself to do it because I'm too scared. It's a combination of things: the fear of pain (I have a very low pain tolerance) and the fear of slipping away from this reality that I'm familiar with and stepping into the unknown. I'm an atheist and a nihilist, so generally I like to believe that after death I can stop existing entirely, but just because I believe this, doesn't make it a fact. What if whatever lies beyond death is something much worse than what I'm experiencing right now and committing suicide is a sort of "out of the pot and into the frying pan" type of deal? I was raised in a religious household, so what if the mere act of suicide would damn me to eternal suffering, whereas to not kill myself now but to instead suffer through this finite existence would lead me to some sort of peace after death? 
I'm sorry, but I had to share my fears somehow. I don't have any friends (surprise, surprise) or anyone in my life who cares, so fuck it, I'll just scream my thoughts into the void. It's kind of a nice comfort.
