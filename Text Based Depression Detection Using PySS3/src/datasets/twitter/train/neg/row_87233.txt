I can't stand anymore. I can't stand living without hope.I lost the girl of my life, I was kinda of a burden to her and this kill me inside. I do have some insecurities but for her that was too much. She is the best girl ever and I really am sure I cannot pursue anything more in life, 'cause I'm a failure. I just can't stop thinking of killing myself, I know exactly how and it keeps popping in my head.
