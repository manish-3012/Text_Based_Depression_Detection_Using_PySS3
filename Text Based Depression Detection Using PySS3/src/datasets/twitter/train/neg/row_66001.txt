Not doing to well, donâ€™t think I should be left aloneWorking 70+ hours per week, not good at my job. Vomiting multiple times a day from the anxiety that itâ€™s caused me. I canâ€™t find satisfaction in anything. I used to like movies and watching formula 1 but I canâ€™t even enjoy those anymore. Terrified of people. I donâ€™t want to upset my mom but even that excuse is growing more futile. Feels like everything is spinning out of control. Donâ€™t know what to do. Itâ€™s really really bad
