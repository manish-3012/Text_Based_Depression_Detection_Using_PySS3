debt deb debt debtlost my job last year, then 3 weeks later lost my second job.. pretty much gave up for the rest of the year.. 

i've always been so bad with money, and its just gotten worse and worse over the years, and now all my stupid decisions are catching up with me, and I have abolutely no money, income, or anything..

I used to be able to freelance.. I used to be able to get work done.. I used to be able to just communicate with people like a normal person. I don't know where I went, I don't know what's wrong with me..

So much debt.. Ill never make enough to make my monthly payments.. much less any form of rent, or anything.

im going to be struggling my whole life. The painful memories of watching my mom in tears while her car gets repoed, and while our house was bought by the bank.. I know thats where Im headed. What's the point, I don't want that.. I don't want to work my life away to barely even survive

i miss feeling emotions..
