Being alive is so much workIm just so tired. Being alive is so much work. I have to wake up and eat and wait until I can sleep again. I feel like Ive done everything I can and I have nothing else to accomplish in this lifetime. I just feel like ready to pass. Im ready. When does it go away? Because if it doesnâ€™t what else can I do?
