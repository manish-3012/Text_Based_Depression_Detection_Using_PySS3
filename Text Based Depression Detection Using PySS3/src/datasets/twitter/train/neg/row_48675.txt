Fulfilling a promiseI know it sounds stupid or hasty, but I made a promise to myself and to my boyfriend that if he broke up with me I would kill myself. Yes, I am aware that saying that is manipulative and wrong. I just felt like I had to force him to stay because I can't bear living without him. Now he is leaving me, but I'm scared of dying. I don't want to hear that there are other people, because I don't think there are. Not like him. I apologize if that is a naive thing to say. I know it seems like a stupid reason to kill myself, but honestly, I just needed an excuse. This has been coming for a long time and I just want to disappear. I don't know why I'm posting here to be honest. Maybe I just want attention, who knows.
