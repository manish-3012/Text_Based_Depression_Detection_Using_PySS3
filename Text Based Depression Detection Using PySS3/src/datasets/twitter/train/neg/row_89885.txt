The pain only keeps getting worsea few days ago i came here posting on how i wasnt able to take life anymore and what was effecting me, and now things have gone from worse to catastrophic, the love of my life left me a few weeks ago, the other day her mother died and she came to me first of all people for comfort but not in person, i asked her if she wanted to spend time that night cause i was worried about her cause she already had depression and self harm, but she said she was busy so i assumed she was with family grieving and let her be, yesterday i spent all day talking to her and comforting her about her mother's death, i spent my day off from work making sure she was okay, and because i knew she was really struggling i asked if she wanted me to go over, she told me that she "already had her cousin and someone else coming over..." i asked her if the other person was a boyfriend.... and of course it was, i got up from my family and walked into my room and broke down and broke down hard. I was there for her when she was being harassed by people and protected her, i would stay up late with her to make sure she was okay and get 2hrs of sleep then go and work, if i wasnt spending the night with her i always had my phone on a loud ringtone so she could wake me up so i could be there for her if she was having issues in the middle of the night, i bought her anything she wanted, i never got mad when she'd go out with her sister and get so drunk that i worried for her life all night, i gave this girl everything and she just moved on so quickly..... she was the only thing that kept me motivated and going in life, she made me feel like i had a reason and purpose to keep living and now that ive lost her and she already has a new boyfriend i cant handle it, every night i wake up upset and depressed, i always have her on my mind, i wake up and fall asleep thinking about her, her smile, her giggle, the way she blushed, and i start to cry because i want her back so badly, to see that from her again, she and i had planned on moving in together and making a life of our own, and now all i have are the fragments of who i am, a broken heart, a want to kill myself, and a longing to have her back.... i just want to end it all..... :(
