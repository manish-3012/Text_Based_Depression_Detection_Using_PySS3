I am 5 months pregnant and am having bad thoughts.I have come a long way and thought I was doing really well, I hadn't had these thoughts in a long time. But I'm alone and recently started doubting myself and talking to my baby's father makes me want to just end it. I've never been so terrified. And now I'm even more scared because I'm not supposed to be having these thoughts and I don't have anyone to talk to..
