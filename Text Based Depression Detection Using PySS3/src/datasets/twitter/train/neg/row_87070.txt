I'm worried about my friend.He's not been doing well and has seriously thought about killing himself in the past, and more recently he's losing what seems like a lot of weight. I don't know how to be supportive very well, I don't know what to say to if he brings it up, I just feel like whatever I say will make things worse.

How do help someone going through these issues?
