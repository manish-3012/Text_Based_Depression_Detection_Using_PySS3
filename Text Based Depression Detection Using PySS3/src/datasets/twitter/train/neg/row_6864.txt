Why am I so fucked up?I'm an 18 year old white man living in Australia. I just feel constantly empty inside, I have no reason to feel the way I do. I just stole 50 bucks off my dad to buy weed, I got kicked out of my mum's house because she found one of my bongs and I thought about going to my dad's gun cabinet and shooting myself in the head, I post naked photos of myself online to make me feel something, I just want to take 20 xannax and not wake up. I am ashamed of who I am as a person and am disgusted in myself. I have a constant feeling like something is looming over me egging me on to fuck up in life. I have my final high school exams in 3 weeks and I just want to fucking end it. The only reason I haven't killed myself at this point is because of my younger brother, younger sister, mum and dad. I don't feel like I have a place in this world am I'm just constantly out of touch. All I do is play video games sleep and go to school. I have zero social life. I have friends at school but I'm becoming more detached from them as I feel they have better relationships between themselves than they have with me, I'm barely passing high school andmy parents are dissapointed in me. I'm on antidepressants but they're doing fuck all. I have no will to live anymore.
