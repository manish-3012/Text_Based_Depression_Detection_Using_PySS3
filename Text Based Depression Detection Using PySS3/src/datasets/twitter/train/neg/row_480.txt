What to sayI went to take my own life last night. Didnâ€™t leave a note, didnâ€™t message anyone. Just was alone with my own thoughts and took a bunch of tablets and sh. I just fell asleep but woke up again. Now I just want to jump into a lake, I canâ€™t swim so thatâ€™s not an issue. I just canâ€™t cope anymore. I donâ€™t feel like I can reach out to anyone anymore either.
