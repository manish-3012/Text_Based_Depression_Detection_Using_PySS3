updatesitâ€™s all happening again in my head. iâ€™m sitting down playing a video game when these stupid thoughts come back. how the hell do i make them go away? i had an amazing day today and i know iâ€™m not crazy about this whole ordeal. i just want it to all stop. i want to think normally without these thoughts creeping back into my mind. my mind alters so fast to â€˜itâ€™s okay! just live your life lol forget about those thoughtsâ€™ to â€˜GOD remember when you did this stupid thingâ€™ to â€˜just stop overthinking lol everyone makes mistakesâ€™ to â€˜yeahh but you could have done this to prevent yourself from being stupidâ€™. honest to god i just want them to stop.
