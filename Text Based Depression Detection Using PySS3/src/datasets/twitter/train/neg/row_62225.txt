Girl friend wants to kill herselfMy girl friend say something about how she wants to die almost every single day. She's suffered fro depression and has severe anxiety and has frequent panic attacks. Lately she's been getting a lot worse and I'm very worried that some day she'll actually do it. Every time I hint that she should speak to a therapist she loses it. What should I do I've always been taught that if someone say they're going to kill themselves you get them help but I'm afraid that if I get her help it'll ruin our relationship. I'm terrified that I'm going to lose my best friend and I don't think there's anything that I can do about it.
