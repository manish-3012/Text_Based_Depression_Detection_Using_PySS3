This world is full of scum.It says it right in the fucking title. This world is corrupt, harsh, cold, and pointless. I would have no reason to even exist if it weren't for someone. One person. Compared to what I've seen, she's the best human being alive today. She's the only thing ridding myself of this endless feeling of misery and pointlessness. I can't let anyone I know about this. Because society is corrupt, and if they get remotely concerned, they'll take me away from her. I just know it. If she dies I WILL kill myself. She's is the kindest, sweetest, most charming person ever.
