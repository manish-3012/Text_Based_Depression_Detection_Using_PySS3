I'm visiting my suicide site tomorrow!My parents have this very small extra apartment with a small bathroom that I decided will be my final location. I'm borrowing keys for it under the pretense that I'm gonna check on the bills and mail but really, I'm surveying the bathroom. On my way there, I'm gonna buy duct tape, plastic wrapping, rubber, etc to plan out how to make it airtight for my charcoal suicide. I am excited and nervous as fuck, I don't know if I'm gonna chicken out again but at least this is a first step to what I want. I really hope a few weeks (or couple of months, depending on how long I'll chicken out), I'll be successful.


I'm fairly sure about the process but if you have extra tips on how to make it more foolproof, hit me up!
