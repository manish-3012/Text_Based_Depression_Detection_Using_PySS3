Where did I go wrong? Boyfriend from hell here.Iâ€™ve lost people out of my life before, a lot. It looks like my girlfriend is gonna leave, I need her to survive. I once had depression and suicidal actions, she helped me feel at peace, she healed me. But somewhere along the way, I changed, I became the boyfriend from hell more and more, and Iâ€™ve started ripping stuff off the walls because none of it means shit compared to her, I love her more than anything, Iâ€™ve never felt like this before about anybody. Iâ€™ve had girlfriends before but sheâ€™s different. I know if she leaves Iâ€™m gonna get back on pills and alcohol, I canâ€™t lose her. It started when she didnâ€™t text me and I finally got through to her and she said she hadnâ€™t been doing anything, it broke my heart because just yesterday everything was fine. I fall in love all over again every time I see her, sheâ€™s the most beautiful girl Iâ€™ve ever seen, and I love her more than anything. I canâ€™t lose her. I donâ€™t even know if sheâ€™ll ever talk to me again and Iâ€™m already dying inside. The pills, the alcohol and razor blades have started to come calling. I donâ€™t want to die, but I donâ€™t have any other choice if she leaves.
