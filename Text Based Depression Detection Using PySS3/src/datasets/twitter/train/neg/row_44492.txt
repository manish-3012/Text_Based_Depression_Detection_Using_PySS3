Need help and want to talk to peopleI have been suffering for about 2.5 years and only this year everything has been going downhill. I have always contemplated suicide but it's like a hazy thought, never actually thought much about it. I've been fighting very hard this year, my mental health going up and down but at this point it's extremely bad and I am seriously thinking I will do it very soon. I seriously do not want to do it but I have gotten to a point where I just go on anymore, the pain is too huge, there is seriously nothing left for me. I have zero interest in school, absolutely struggling, grades turning into absolute shit, anxiety problems, social problems and even more. I really never thought I would get to so low but here I am now. I really do not know how to do it and I do not want to do it, but it is the better choice to do. Everything is shit and I have nothing left, I have tried so hard, I can't go on anymore. I hope that there is any kind souls that wanna talk to me, I would really appreciate it, maybe it would help, hoping to look for some advice. My life is crippling out of control.
