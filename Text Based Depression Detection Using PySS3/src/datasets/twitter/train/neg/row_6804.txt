I'm fucking freaking out.So, I am 19 year old future UCSD student who is trying to get her shit together. I can't find a job over there and my suppose-to-be roommates are bailing out on me the last second (like right before we sign our lease). I got a speeding ticket and was fighting with my family like crazy because of all the stress I am going through. My financial aid got dismissed and I had to write an appeal letter and now my registration might be frozen because of IGETC. I feel like a failure and I really don't want to try anymore. I hardly have any money to move anyways.
