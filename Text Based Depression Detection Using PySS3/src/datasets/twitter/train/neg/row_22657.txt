I honestly don't know what to doIt seems as if everything is slowly getting worse in my life. My family constantly telling me how much of a failure I am. My mother calls me pathetic almost everyday just for playing video games. If I do anything else that has no meaning to her, the insults just get worse. I dropped my classes to work more, yet I'm still always broke. I was in a shortlived relationship with someone who apparently lied about everything. Now he treats me as if I am a leper, and I didn't even do anything to make him just change his feelings randomly. Now I am here...even more shattered than I was before. The future looks dark and pointless. I don't know where to go from here. I've tried to be optimistic this whole time, but even that has run out. I'm at the end of my motivation for living. Waking up is getting more and more difficult. Is there anyone out there that can give me insight as to what I can do before I run out of self control?
