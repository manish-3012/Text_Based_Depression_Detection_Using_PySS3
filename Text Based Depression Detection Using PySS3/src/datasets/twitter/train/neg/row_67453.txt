Itâ€™s really sad how lonely being suicidal isLike, you canâ€™t talk to anyone. 

And if you can, itâ€™s like maybe one or two people. Half of them are probably your medical team, who check in with you once or twice a week, and are paid to care about you. 

You know all your â€œfamily and friends careâ€ but itâ€™s impossible to talk to them. You donâ€™t want them to overreact. You donâ€™t want them to worry. 

You canâ€™t hang out with your friends anymore because you have nothing positive or noteworthy to say. No one wants to go to dinner or to a bar and hear about how you hate living. You donâ€™t want to bring the mood down all the time. 

And the one person you trust to talk to canâ€™t handle all of your stress. You canâ€™t rely on just that person. It takes a toll on them and stresses them out too, so now you start censoring yourself and feel like you canâ€™t tell them everything. 

And then youâ€™re just stuck with your thoughts in your head. Wondering whatâ€™s the best thing to do. 


And then thereâ€™s the planning. 

What to write in your note saying goodbye. What to do with your dog. How to leave your apartment. What date to set. 

I just wish euthanasia was legal so I could die with my friends and family by my side. I wish I could talk freely about my thoughts and plans, and have support in my decision. I wish someone could be by my side in my last moments. 

But no, I have to do this alone. And itâ€™s so lonely. 

Iâ€™m not afraid of dying. Iâ€™m slowly learning to not be afraid if I fail trying to die, and die suffering slowly and painfully. I just wish I wasnâ€™t lonely through it all. I wish someone could hold my hand and hug me before I go.
