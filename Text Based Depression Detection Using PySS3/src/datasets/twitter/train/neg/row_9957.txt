Literally no way outI have a friend that's willing to take me in to escape my abusive parents. We were talking about it the other day, and she requested that I have some kind of plan of action for when I get there so I don't end up stranded in a foreign country. Fair enough.

I quickly realised that there's literally no way out of the way I'm living right now and the way I feel. There's literally nothing I can do to improve anything. I have no options.

It's not even that I want it all to end. I just literally have no other choice. My life is already almost over, there's nowhere left for me to turn.
