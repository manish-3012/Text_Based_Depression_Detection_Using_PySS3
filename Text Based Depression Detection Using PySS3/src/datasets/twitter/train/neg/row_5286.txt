Don't really feel like living anymore?This post might be a little messy because I'm in a pretty weird mental state right now, so I'm sorry in advance. I guess I just don't really want to live anymore even with all the "silver linings" of pushing through it or whatever. I'm not at physical risk right now but the thoughts are still very prominent. I'm transgender, my parents don't accept me, I'd be letting go of my family if I transitioned, and it's been recommended that I get tested for autism because I struggle a lot socially. I'm just really sad all the time but I don't feel like I even have a right to be. I'm about to graduate college and just the idea of entering "the real world" sounds too stressful and makes me have panic attacks. I guess people might miss me if I was gone but they'd move on from it because that's just what people do.

Sorry, I know I sound very unstable right now, but I guess I just don't know what to do anymore. I can't afford therapy and I've exhausted the free options in my area. It's all too hard and I just don't feel like going on anymore.
