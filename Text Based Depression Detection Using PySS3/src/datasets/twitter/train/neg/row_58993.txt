Some more psych ward questions bc Iâ€™m scared as fuckSo if I were to go to a psych ward Iâ€™d probably go to the ER, last time I went to one (i wasnâ€™t admitted but I was evaluated) I was placed in some small hallway with rooms without doors, only curtains, and a single bed with a TV. Thatâ€™s where I waited to be evaluated. If I went there again and was evaluated and it was decided I needed to stay, would I be moved somewhere else or would I have to stay there? It just seemed so depressing there and like no one was doing anything, it didnâ€™t seem like there was a schedule, but I got to order some food from a menu but thatâ€™s the only thing anyone rly did
