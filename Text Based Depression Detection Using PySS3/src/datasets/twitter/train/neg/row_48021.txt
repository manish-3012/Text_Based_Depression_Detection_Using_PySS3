When has â€œpainlessâ€ ever been a option?Iâ€™ve searched like Iâ€™m sure many of you have as well, the most painless/efficient way out with variables such as ...mess , who would find me and closure. This started to feel like the last math problem I had to complete before passing in my exam to check out. Every source Iâ€™ve found seems to be people in my position trying to drive me away from the thoughts and seek â€œhelpâ€ . I figured I would make my own post to gather others thoughts. â€œPainlessâ€ has been non existent for a lot of us since a young age mentally or physically...how would it make sense to take the biggest step â€œpainlesslyâ€ ? Over dosing seems cliche Iâ€™ll admit but it seems to provide comfort knowing my anxiety could be drowned out by benzo and or oxy to keep me numb while I send a 12 gauge slug to my forehead a couple min after alerting 911 they will need to pick up a body.
