How to cope with decorations and other people plans?Hey, it's me, your favorite "all my family is dead" loner again.
I know how stupid it sounds to be triggered by Christmas lights, but this jolly shit gets me.
My "patronum" memory is preparing  Christmas dinner for my mother and grandmother.
I was their caretaker since 11 yo. 
I made their food, gave them baths and change adult diapers with all my love all those years... but on Christmas, I would push myself to literally be sitting in front of the stove to garantee that the food was flawless.
And nowadays, my plan consists on a box of pain meds for Christmas supper.
Is there someone else also getting trouble to contain tears everytime someone says what their families will be having for Jesus (that asshole) birthday?
