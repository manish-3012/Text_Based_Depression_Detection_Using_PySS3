I've been struggling a lot latelyI've been struggling like really bad. I feel like I'm losing everyone around me. I feel like nobody cares no matter how much I scream and cry for help.

A lot of things went down between me and another girl at my dance studio. She's out to get me because I got a special role in one of our dances and I'm in a dance that she's not. 

All she does is tell lies about me. I've never even done anything to her. I've only ever been nice and I thought she was my friend but I guess not. She's one of the reasons why I want to commit suicide. 

Once she told our dance group that I'd been sleeping with a bunch of boys from my school. But yet I'm still a virgin. Thankfully nobody believed her as far as I know but it still hurts. 

 She causes so much stress and anxiety in my life. She yells at me when I do something wrong but as doing as I call her out for doing something wrong she's the victim all of a sudden. I just want her to be gone already or I wanna be gone. Which everyone comes first. Maybe she realizes when I'm gone that it's blood on her hands.
