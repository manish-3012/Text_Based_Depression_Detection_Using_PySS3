I am tired.I am sick. Sick of everything.

I want to end everything.

I really hate people around me including my family.

I feel no one is my true friend. Even my boyfriend.

No one understands me. I constantly keep getting panic attacks due to fighting with my family and I can't even escape because I'm in uni, Asian and everything. It's hard to leave this house to get my own house unless I prob start working for years or be a prostitute or smth.

I am... So done with this world. I am contemplating. I just want everything to be over. I want make them suffer. I know it's bad but I'm done.

I can't even speak my own opinion. I can't even focus on my studies. I can't even have a peace of my mind anywhere.
