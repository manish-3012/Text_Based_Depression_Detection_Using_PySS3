There is the have and have not's in this cold social media ran SocietyI don't know how many years that I have left but I am  getting very tired of living my life in depression and no growth. My whole life, I have had social issues,was a loser and no attractive women has ever been attracted to me. I'm currently 33 years ago and I still don't have my life together and live in my mother's basement. I don't have any friends anymore because all of them are married and have kids. Another thing that is toxic is social media. It makes me feel very depressed when people I know that are my age or younger are progressing in life except for me. I have been trying for 5 years to meet and approach attractive women that I like but it always fails no matter how well I dress and how much money I make or the cologne I wear. Even having a great conversation doesn't help. Over the past 5 years, I have been masturbating to porn lusting over attractive women and having one night stand sex with trannys and fem gay bottoms only just to substitute to fact that attractive women don't won't me. I feel like I have to have sex with someone. I tried to tell my family about my depression but no one gives a shit. Im starting to get to the point of  finding a way to die in my sleep peacefully so that I don't have to wake up in the morning and continue this miserable life on being alone.
