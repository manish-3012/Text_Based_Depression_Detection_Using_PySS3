Here goes nothingI'm not really sure how to go about doing this (I don't even post on "normal" subreddits), but here goes nothing. There's not really much to say about myself. I'm a 21 year old male and I'm so lost that I'm now posting this message to people who will forget I exist by the time they hit the back button on their browser. I guess I'm your typical antisocial loner, although I feel like I could define the condition rather than just meet it. I do remember being happy, however it was so long ago it seems like more of a fantasy than a memory. Even so I believe sheer ignorance to be the only reason for my happiness then. Sometime during high school that switch just flipped in my brain. I started to see all of the negative characteristics of the people around me completely ignoring the positive ones. I still do. The only person in my life that isn't family that I could have actually considered to be a friend I've pushed away because I just can't seem to relate anymore. I feel like there is literally not a single being in this universe that feels the same way I do. And even if there was the odds of me meeting them are astronomically small. Anyway, ever since that change it's becoming increasingly difficult to justify my existence. I'm an Atheist and I am convinced beyond a shadow of a doubt that when we die we simply cease to exist. I imagine it being no different than before we were born. I wish I could just ignore it and enjoy life like so many other people manage to do, but I can't. Some days I can almost convince myself that my life actually matters, but they seem to be fewer and fewer. Suicide is something I have struggled with, contemplated, battled, and lived with. I cannot even remember a single day when I haven't thought about it. I've never taken any action though, but I promised myself that if I do I won't fail. I have an amazingly easy life with a very loving family and they are the only reason I'm still here. Not because I don't want to leave them, but because they don't want me to leave. I am a horrible person. About a year ago I finally gave up the act and told my family how I felt. At first I was hopeful that things might get better, but I immediately realized that they will **never** understand how I feel...and it's not their fault. My mom reacted almost exactly as I assumed she would and she had me go see a doctor. The doctor just kept saying how he couldn't understand why a "perfectly healthy guy" would want to kill himself. It was absolutely amazing to see how differently "normal" people think compared to me. Anyway, he prescribed some anti-depressants and suggested I seek some sort of counseling, but I refused because I am 100% certain it would not make a difference. I took the anti-depressants for a few weeks and there was no change. I still had the ups and downs that I experience on a day-to-day basis. I believe that **I'm** the only one who can change it, but I simply can't (or won't). Anyway, if you took the time to read this I really do appreciate it and if by some miracle you happen to feel this way too please do not hesitate to message me I am desperately alone. It is now 3 A.M. EST so I probably won't respond until tomorrow.
