I recently tried to stab myself in the stomache. To anyone who feels hopeless please read this. Too much sadness hereI didn't tell anyone or left any notes or hints. I walked into the woods at 3 am with a kitchen knife. I was fully prepared to die. But my buddy called, I felt like an idiot, why did i bring my phone? Im just used to carrying it around. But i didn't tell my buddy, I was crying during our conversation. I ended up going home. The next day i told my social worker what happened and they took me to a behavioral health hospital. I came upon some ideas and hindsight! I know we offer think here but hear me out. 
I believe that there is no god, no one is destined for anything, our lives are completely meaningless when we die we will have no brain to remember what happened and eventually earth too will die. I see the world this way. I know everything will end. Until I saw my niece, new born. So innocent, so helpless. I watched the flame from my match burn until it faded. I watched the sun set. I realized that there is beauty in this circle. That my life is limited. I ran to. Nj and found a new job. No one knows me so i got to present a new version of myself. Ofcourse im still very much depressed. By following what i imagine my best self would do i learned to cope. I still don't have friends though ðŸ˜… none the less i can't die here. Not after everything i've gone through. I wont let my mental illness win. The truth is im so scared. Im burning inside. Bit i have to try. I want to be a marine someday. Im holding on to that dream. It's all I have.
