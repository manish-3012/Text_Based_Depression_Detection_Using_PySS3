Reasons I want to dieReasons I want to die:


I've been obsessed with a specific youtuber for 6 years

I regularly think about mistakes from 5+ years ago

I'm going to be depressed for the rest of my life

I'm probably aspergers (unable to read social cues)Â 

Aspergers have high unemployment, high suicide rate, low marriage rate

I've been in and out of university from 18-24, and may still be around for another 3 years if I pass every paper perfectly. 

I can feel myself slipping and falling to academic failure again.Â 

Life just feels pointless.
