My life is over. I can't handle it anymore.I can't take it anymore. I drink everyday. Have to much problems. Have too much pain in my life, has seen too much shit in my past. I can't handle it anymore. I was in therapy but it did not worked for me and all they wanted was more information and that for the past 8 years, they got too much information without helping me. I tried to move out of my country to begin something else and I know, I know that is running away from the problems but sometime it's better to leave, to forget anyone. But I can't because I don't have a job and it's too long right now. I can't wait anymore. I need something to do. I don't like this life anymore. I want to die without pain. I don't want to feel this shit anymore. I don't care about my familie or friends, they never helped me with my problems. I'm serious.
