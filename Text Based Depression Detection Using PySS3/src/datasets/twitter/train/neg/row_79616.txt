Suicidal after years stableToday, I had very serious suicidal thoughts. I don't have easy access to easy means, but I'd probably not be here if I did sort of serious.

The world is just really full of evil. Evil people who want to hurt me and people who think or look like me. Evil people who don't care about the future for their kids - or more importantly, the kid me and my wife were planning on having. Evil people who lie. And those evil people are winning. I see my home country (the US) barreling headlong towards some sort of government collapse (civil war/autocracy/etc.). And of course, we've utterly fucked our planet. In the short 30 years I've been alive, we broke the world - and it was already pretty evil before I was born. I'm tired of waiting for everything to fall apart. I want to get out while the getting is good. Before I have to watch everything I love die.
