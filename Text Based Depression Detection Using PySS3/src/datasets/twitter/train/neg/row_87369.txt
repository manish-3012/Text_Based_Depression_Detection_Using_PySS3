I'm fucking terrified of dying but even more so of living-onHaving some form of suicidal ideation has been my baseline for some time now. However I've never really attempted anything because sadly I'm much too afraid (I'm a doctor but needles, pain, blood etc still fucking terrify me).
Lately though for some reason this whole pandemic has me feeling on edge a bit more than usual. Our institute has been forcing us to be a bit more productive (particularly there's this deadline coming up), and to their credit, they've been extremely helpful; however, I really cannot manage to be productive. Everyone's been so helpful and supportive, I can't help but feel like a total failure.
It honestly feels extremely petty and worthless but for some reason it's been amplifying whatever feelings of worthlessness I've built up over the years.
So much so that I haven't been able to take my mind of suicide for the past couple of days. I've even thought of a bunch of creative ways to go about it. I'm not sure exactly what's going to happen next, I haven't slept all night and just wanted to let it out somehow by writing this post. Maybe this will all blow over, or maybe I'll finally grow the balls to kill myself later. Who knows.
