DrowningI'm a 22 year old F and I just graduated undergrad. I applied to 5 physician assistant schools and so far 3 have given me interview but turned me down flat. I'm on the waitlist for the 4th school but the one I truly wanted to get into hasnt even contacted me (supposed to hear from them anytime from Nov till Jan). I have applied for atleast 20 jobs over the past 3 weeks and have only heard back from 3, none of which gave me a second call back or interview. My college experience was like my most of me childhood experience.... traumatic in a word. While I have learned to cope with alot of life difficulties I can't seem to actually find a reason to be alive. I used to tell myself getting into college would be the light at the end of the tunnel, then I told myself graduating colleg would be the light at the end of the tunnel. But honestly now that I'm done I feel more lost than ever, just totally directionless. It's like I was tossed in the middle of the ocean and told to find land with no directions. Everyone says that once I find a job or get into PA school I will feel better. But I just cant see myself ever being happy. It's been about 3 years now since I started my last depressive episode and it feels never ending. Ofcourse the symptoms come and go but it's always there, just waiting to suffocate me. I take my meds, go to therapy, do yoga and workout but it's still here. Work, school, hobbies all just seems like distractions. They dont fix the black cloud that has followed me since I was 7. Is there an end to this feeling of drowning or is it always going to follow me? I just feel like my soul (if you believe in such a thing) is too tired to keep treading water.

 Thank you for giving me a place to speak my mind.
