Feeling better but scared I'm going to feel like that again and I want to know how to prevent it.I've always been kind of a pretty intensely sad/unhappy person but the last three weeks it seemed like it hit a stopping point, culminating with my breaking down crying multiple times every week, inconsistent/not showering, sleeping all day, and having pretty constant suicidal thoughts all of last week. I decided to make a conscious effort to try to get better/seek help by reaching out to friends and not dwelling on that part of my mind but I'm scared that I'm going to fall back in to it and I just need some advice on what I can do to that. Thanks.
