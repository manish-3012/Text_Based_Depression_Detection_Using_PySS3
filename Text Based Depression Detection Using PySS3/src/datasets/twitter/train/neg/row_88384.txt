Its just to much todayA little background I'm a 26 year old male university student and I've been diagnosed with BPD recently, in high school I was diagnosed with clinical depression and generalized anxiety disorder.

So I don't even know where to start to be honest I just feel generally shitty like nothing is going well in my life right now and it just keeps eating away at me. I've been in a long distance relationship for almost a decade now and we where finally going to move in together this year until covid struck so that was the first nail in the coffin. I was meant to go see her in October for her birthday, I'd stay for a few months and then she was coming home with me for good this time. The second shitty thing is that I lost a two of my pets this year to illness and I know they are just animals but they where family. I also lost two friends to covid over the course of the last 2 months and it just fucking sucks man I miss them and my cats so much. The final nail in the coffin is that I've flunked out of uni this semester. It's obviously my fault I could have done so much better but studying online has been so much harder for me than traditional classes I hate this so much.

I feel like a loser like I thought everything was okay now I've been through so much shit in my life but this is just to much for me to handle in such a short amount of time I just cant. I feel like I'm complaining over nothing but my heart just hurts so fucking bad right now honestly. I grew up in an abusive household, I was constantly beat every day for the littlest things, I was bullied all the way through high school and I was even gang raped in middle school, but I pushed through that shit. I was able to overcome that even though I felt so horrible but today I just don't know I don't think I can keep going. I want to believe me I do and I'm to weak to ever even go over the edge and end it but I'm just empty I feel like I'm already dead to be honest.

I just want to be happy, I wanted a fulfilling life where I get to do the job I've always dreamed of, where I get to marry the woman I love and we get to start a family together like we've always talked about. I don't know I feel like such a baby even posting this but I don't have my therapy session until Monday evening and I needed to let this out now. For anyone who reads this thanks it means a lot that you even took the time to look at what I have to say. God bless and stay safe everyone. Take care.
