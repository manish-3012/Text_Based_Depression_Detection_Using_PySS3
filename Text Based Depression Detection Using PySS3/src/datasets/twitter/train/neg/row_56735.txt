Help Me Help My FriendHello,

My friend is a 40 year old man with a wife and 2 children. His wife is in the process of seperating from him for a few infidelities. When he was discovered he tried to kill himself. He has been threatening and attempting suicide for months now. Today he threw himself off the top of a building. No details yet as to his condition. Talking to him is so intense it brings up strong emotions. I have no idea what to do. He has been hospitalised twice now but it did not do anything for him. The guy wants to die. He has scars on his neck and I don't know. Anybody have any ideas how to help a man that really wants to die?
