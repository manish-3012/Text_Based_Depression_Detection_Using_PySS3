I have never been this close to the edge and I am desperate.I feel like I guess I kind of need to vent and Iâ€™m suicidal so this feels like a safe place? Iâ€™m tired of going to the hospital and seeing therapist and talking to my friends and family.... I KNOW Iâ€™m emotionally draining. Iâ€™m just SO sad. I have fear and anxiety that is all consuming. I feel like Iâ€™m sinking into darkness and I want out. I just want a hug, I want to cuddle, I want someone to tell me itâ€™ll be okay but in the end, when people say that I donâ€™t believe it. I know my mind is poisoned with negative thoughts. If only I could switch up my thoughts. If only I could find the motivation to live. I strongly believe in the healing power of thought but I feel like I canâ€™t grasp it. Or maybe Iâ€™m scared to feel better. I keep telling myself I want to kill myself so hopefully the thoughts turn into actions... thatâ€™s so bad but I need to stop I want to. I feel like a drug addict and my drug is negative thoughts. I donâ€™t know why but I feel like I deserve it. If you got this far thanks for reading.
