I feel akin to a fox caught in a bear trap a few moments before it decides it'll gnaw off its own leg in order to escapeI really feel trapped in this current life with no way out, and it's overwhelming and so scary. I'm becoming increasingly convinced the only way out is death, yet at the same time, like an undercurrent, I have the desire to survive and pursue happiness.

I wish I'd simply not been born.
