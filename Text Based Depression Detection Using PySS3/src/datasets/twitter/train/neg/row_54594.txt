Trying my best to not Suicide. Should I forgive a bastard trash for destroying my life, or should I also destroy his.I have a strategy to help me from committing suicide, but Iâ€™m stuck. Iâ€™m trying my best to be positive. I love myself but hate myself. I want to kill my self so bad sometimes, every time when things go wrong.

My strategy (Iâ€™ll post as comment)helps me a lot, but I canâ€™t help but wonder if Iâ€™m letting a bastard off to easily. I kept quiet in what happened to me and let the bastard live a happy life while I was withering. Luckily I know that the best revenge is to be happy and Iâ€™m trying hard to be happier. I want to cry to my parents, but weâ€™re no longer close and Iâ€™m a teenager now.

He destroyed my life, should I do the same and reveal what has happen. Although I kept the secret for so long. I probably wonâ€™t bc I kept it a secret ever since I was 6 1/2 when that happened.
When I was molested by a perverted lust crazed pedophile trash of an uncle. I donâ€™t want my mum to cry or my dad to go insane out of anger. So I protected my family by keeping quiet, but karma is so slow and heâ€™s still living a happy life with a wife and a child who touched me a couple times. Like dad like son dammit. Anyway should I destroy him like he did to me or bring this secret, his problem to my grave. Whatâ€™s worse Iâ€™d heâ€™s so thick faced, smile innocently while molesting the young innocent me, and still contacts my parents acting like someone innocent. That two faced assh*le.
