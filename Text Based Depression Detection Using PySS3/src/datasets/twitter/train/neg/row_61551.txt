I want to live my life and die contentI hate work. I hate school even more so I don't want to go back in order to find another job I don't like. I have nothing left here. No real friends except one, no family, no future. I don't plan to date or anything. I don't want to work. I want to just quit my job, travel the country, read some books, see a few shows, and kill myself when I run out of money. I will be happy and I will have lived my dream. But instead I waste my life away at work, miserable every single day. Why? Because my one friend in the world thinks I'd be selfish if I killed myself. Because apparently it's wrong and I'm just sick. And somehow I still care about what people think.
