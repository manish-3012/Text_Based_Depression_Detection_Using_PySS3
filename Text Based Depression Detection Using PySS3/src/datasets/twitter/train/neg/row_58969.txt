Well today went differentSo lately I have been thinking about life a lot more than usual. The suffering and so on. Well I get a call from my mom early this morning crying. And my little brother thatâ€™s a lot a lot younger than me has explained to my mom that he wants to wait till everyone is sleeping so he go and die. That he doesnâ€™t want to live any more. That broke my heart I live for my family only thing besides my wife that make me strong and a brother I love so much feels the same. Iâ€™m so confused with life I hate myself so much but I donâ€™t do it cause I live for them
