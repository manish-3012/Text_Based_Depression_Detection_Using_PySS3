Self harm.Iâ€™m just curious, I recently self harmed do the first time about a month ago and before I had done it myself I found it hard to understand why anyone else would do it. I Though it was to distract them from the mental pain though the psychical pain. Donâ€™t get me wrong thatâ€™s partly why I donâ€™t it but does anyone else do it as a way to pretend theyre ending it all? Because thatâ€™s what I do, it gives me a rush and makes me feel good especially with in thinking that thatâ€™s it over. Iâ€™m just curious if anyone else does this?
