I want to kill myself...I guess the beginning would be a good place to start, I am a 17 year old closeted bisexual high school dropout thinking about suicide.

**backstory**

I was a stright A student throuout elementary school, but when I got to middle school I lost all of my motivation, I missed more and more school every year,
In 8th grade I missed 71 and 1/2 days of school and still passed (It's because I listened and did my work) when I finally got to high school I just stopped going.
I feel I lack the motivation to get a job (and keep it), to go back to school or to get a GED, the only reason I haven't already commited suicide is because of the immense
pain it would cause my friends and family. But now, after my gay "friend with benefits" that I had feelings for and I aren't really speaking anymore, the future doesn't seem too bright

I want to end it all.


**TL;DR: I feel like I have no future and thinking about commiting suicide, I need some advice**
