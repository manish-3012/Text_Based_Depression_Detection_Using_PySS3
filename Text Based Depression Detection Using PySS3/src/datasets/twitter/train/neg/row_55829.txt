I'm losing my fucking mind 

I feel like my life is just spiralling out of control.

I feel like I'm on a brink of an eating disorder.

I feel like I'm going to SH or do something drastic very soon.

I feel like I can't get what I need to feel like I could calm down right now.

I feel like I'm surrounded by decay.

I feel like I'm constantly on edge for uni work.

I feel like COVID situation is just going to end what little left I have in my confidence or self-esteem.

And I feel like I can't call any major hotline because what are they going to do for me?
