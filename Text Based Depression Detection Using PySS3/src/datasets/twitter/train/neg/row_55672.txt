my crippling fear of the dark is a burdenhaving a fear of the dark is "childish" because "only children are scared of the dark". but i am sick and tired. ive always had a fear of the dark, as a child it was VERY bad but as i got older it settled down a bit but i couldnt be in a dark room without freaking out, but i could sleep in one. but not so recently the fear has come back and its worse. as a child i would keep the door open but now i sleep with all my lights on. i always feel like im being watched; being followed. ive never been stalked in my life, so its not related to a traumatic past. i always look behind me or see things in the light or dark that i think is going to kill me. it is unberable. i cannot live like this, i cannot live cooped up in my house with all the lights on 24/7. i also live with my parents because i simply cannot be left alone otherwise id have a major panic attack. but my parents call me childish,stupid and say "dont be an idiot". it hurts. i cannot live normally like this and they wont even help me. its driving me insane. i just want to die to end it all. just imagine having something always in the corner of your eye, taunting you. if i dont kill myself whatever is following me is. i dont believe in ghosts but i no longer sleep, i just stay up with my lights on. i cant do it anymore, i just cant. no one takes me seriously. when i told my friend she just laughed at me, realised i was being serious but still wasnt 100% genuine. all i think is ending mine or someone elses life. i need helo but id rather just die. i dont think what im going to do tomorrow, i just think if id finally have the balls to kill myself.
