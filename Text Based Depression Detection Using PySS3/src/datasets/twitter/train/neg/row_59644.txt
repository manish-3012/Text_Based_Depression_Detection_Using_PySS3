keeps me aliveEvery time when I feel like I'm on the line, like I'm going to do it right now, I open reddit and type in "suicidewatch". I start reading. I don't stop for hours. It's cathartic. I see that I'm not alone, not alone suffering all the time, and it makes me feel better, it gives me strength, enough strength to keep myself in this cruel world for a few more days.
