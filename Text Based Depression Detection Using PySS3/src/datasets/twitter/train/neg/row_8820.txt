People who joke about suicide are annoying but I have no say in itI guess it's hard to tell if someone is actually suicidal or is just joking cus they think its "so funny". My friend group is like this. One friend in particular is consistently saying stuff like "I want to fucking kill myself" and "haha it's so fun being suicidal". She says this in such a happy joking tone that I just want to strangle her (not literally of course). I've asked her if she actually means this and wanted to talk and this bitch started laughing her head saying "I'm so suicidal haha". My friends don't know about me so she probably didn't even care. But God it hurt so bad hearing that from her. One of my closest friends even. I want the best for her and tried to help but she just laughed like a maniac. It makes me scared if I told her how I felt mentally. Is she going to be supportive or is she going to saying something like "Me too!"
