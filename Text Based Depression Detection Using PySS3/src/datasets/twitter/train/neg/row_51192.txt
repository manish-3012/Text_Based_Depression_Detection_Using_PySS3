I don't know what it is anymore.I don't know what's bothering me right now, but it is not a good feeling. I don't know what went wrong with me. I could have sworn that I was doing fine... Or at least made it seem to look like everything was going fine.  I feel like I'm trapped and uncomfortable,  it is making me go mad. I just feel like ending my life,  I just find it too much for me to take in. But at the same time,  I don't want that for me.  I just want to be happy and healthy,  having a chance of living my life as I should be, but it's becoming too much for me,  I am not sure how I am going to handle the Spring semester back in college from my winter break. This uncomfortable depression is not letting me live my life to how I would want to improve.  I'm scared for my life,  I do self harm from time to time but it's not deep at all.  To say at the least that I don't think I can make it far this time.  I feel like my clock is ticking and the scary thing is that no one would have never suspect it if I was ever to have a problem at all. I'm anxious all the time, and I do get sad,  but I don't want to live this slow,  dark life anymore.  I want to be happy so bad and this time I ran out of ways of reaching out to anyone.  It's just me and God.  Only God knows what will happen to me.  Although all I can do is pray to God, but I am scared of what can happen to me as I wait for my prayers to be answered.  Yes,  I've tried talking to my family,  friends and mentors but they either say it is a phase,  or Just Seek God or I just have no reason to feel this way.  This feeling/thoughts of ending my life/hurting myself has become troubling,  I am not sure if I should consider seeking treatment,  or admit myself to the hospital for my own safety... I am just confused at this point.
