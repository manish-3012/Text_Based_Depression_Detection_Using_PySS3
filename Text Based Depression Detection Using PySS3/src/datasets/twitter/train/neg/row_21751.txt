Mental hospital makes me suicidalIm already 2 months in there and who knows how long i will stay there. It makes me very depressed and suicidal. I dont see it as help, no it actually makes things worse. So what should i so? What if i will be there for another 3 or 4 months, or even a year, or several years?
