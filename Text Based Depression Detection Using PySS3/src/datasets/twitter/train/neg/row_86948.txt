I donâ€™t know what to doI have never really reached out for help before because I always tell my self Iâ€™ll get over it but its gotten pretty bad as of now.Iâ€™m scared at how much I wanna die I wish this feeling would just go away. I have no one I trust enough to confide in, no friends and my parents and me arenâ€™t close and the loneliness is killing me. I have started self harming again as well and Iâ€™m scared my parents will be disgusted with me. I donâ€™t know what to do.
