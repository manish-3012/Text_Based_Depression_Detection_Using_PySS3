Tired.I've never been any good at writing down how I feel. It's been 5 years and it feels like a lifetime. A few days of this feeling has been too long, never mind the weeks/months and years that've passed me by. It's agonizing. I can't take it.

I don't even care about wanting to care anymore, I'm done. I've wrote my note I've planned it out. I guess I'm just waiting now while I get things together. What's a month when I've been doing this for as long as I have. It's going to happen regardless. Having to stay alive for the sake of other people is a joke, just let me go. People say that don't they "if you love someone let them go", why won't they let me go then? Why is it such a bad thing for me to want to die?

I'm just tired. Let me rest.
