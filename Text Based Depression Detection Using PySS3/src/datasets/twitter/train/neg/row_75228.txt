I Confronted My PastSo I made a post here, a little while ago where I was on the verge of death. But last night I had the conversation I never thought I could have. Without revealing too much detail, I had a traumatic event happen to me when I was quite young which I had never been able to talk about. But last night my mum and I had heart to heart. I cried harder than I had ever cried before in my life. I told her I was sorry and she said there was nothing to be sorry for. I feel like I have had a crushing weight lifted off my soul, I just hope I can move on now from the past. I am sick of being stuck reliving old events, I have been ready to let go for so long. I just want to forget about it and move on now. This time is different, I am cutting the cord from my past and starting a brand new life.

Not sure why I am sharing here, but I don't feel suicidal anymore and I am excited about what the future holds once more. I hope that you can have a similar breakthrough in your own life if that's what you need or you find some way to live at least a bit longer to see what life has waiting around the next bend for you. I love you all
