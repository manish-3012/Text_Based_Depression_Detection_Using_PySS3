I donâ€™t know what to doIâ€™ve been crying so hard for hours, I canâ€™t remember the last time Iâ€™ve cried so hard I bruised myself beneath my eyes. I feel so broken and alone and thereâ€™s nothing I can do. I tried calling the hotline but got so anxious I immediately hung up. I feel like I need to go to the hospital but my mom and sister are going away this weekend for my sisters birthday and I donâ€™t wanna ruin the trip and Christmas is so soon. I just wanna hurt myself but I donâ€™t wanna let people down and I just canâ€™t cope with this. I canâ€™t do this anymore
