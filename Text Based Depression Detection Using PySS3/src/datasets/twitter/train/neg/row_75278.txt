Nothing leftI'm not going today. I'll be going within the next couple months or so, i think. No point in explaining myself, I don't really need a reason or excuse.

Funny because for a short while I really did try to make things better. i guess that's not how the world works. The universe is cold and unforgiving. It'll take everything good and laugh.

Life is cruelty. Life is prison. 

Death is beauty. Death is escape. 

I think I'll go on my birthday. My birthday is in February. By then my affairs will be in order.

I have every reason to go. If you met me, you'd understand.

I'll post then. I don't care who's listening. I just want to pretend like someone is reading this and wishing me well.
