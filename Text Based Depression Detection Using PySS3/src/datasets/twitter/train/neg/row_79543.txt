fat, ugly, lonely, fuck, but not actually suicidalI just binged. It started with a quest bar, then buffalo chicken pizza, then a lot of cookies. When I think about it, it makes me feel sick. And what's disgusting is that I still want more. 

I'm probably depressed - like really fucking depressed. I'm at college, and I'm a freshman. And I have no friends because I'm socially awkward and fat and shy and stupid, so fucking stupid. 

I try so hard to fit in, but I can't, and I truly have nothing except the hunger. And I can't keep the hunger because I binge, and I feel like everything is falling apart, and I'm a failure. God, I hate myself so much - fat, pathetic, ugly, stupid. 

I tell myself that if I don't break any of the rules for the day, then everything will be ok, but I always break the rules. I have no self control. Fucking fat bitch. 

I don't have anyone, so I'm on the Internet. I miss my best friend from high school, and I miss talking to people. I think I could have loved her like that if I were lesbian, but I don't know if I am, so I don't know if I love her like that or just as a friend. I think I like girls though, and I want to kiss one more than I want to kiss a boy. 

I'm going to become like my mother. I'm going to become fat and undisciplined and pathetic like she is. I hate her and I'm fucking going to become her. I hate myself. 

And this college debt is so high that I can't even kill myself because it's not economically worth it. Fuck this school and it's 68k price tag and it's fucking preps. There's so many people everywhere, but I'm so unbelievably alone.
