Troubled to make a decisionThe only thing ensuring my life to go on is my girlfriend and my immediate family, but I feel it's fasing. I constantly fuck things up, make myself look bad and embarrass myself, even when I'm trying my best to be liked. I know I shouldn't have to rely on people liking me but I do, I really need it. Just started my new job and everyone is so critical (I can't find another job, I'm only 18 and need to have a proper start), I hate working here but if I'm going to live then it's the best place to get things started. I hate the people, and problem in general because of years of neglection/bullying, I even hate the world I live in (not surprising, a lot of people do) because of just how unfair it is to jump through hoops in order to be happy with the way you live. I'm just so over it, the only thing that helps it's the incredible love from my girlfriend and my parents and brother, they're the only reason I'm here, I can't hurt them. It's beyond me to hurt them to make myself feel better, but the thoughts are slowly creeping past that ideology, it's just getting so hard and I feel like making a decision. I know it doesn't mean a lot to anyone who's reading this, and I'm not looking to find answers, it's really just to vent to see if it helps, a conversation however, I wouldn't mind. I don't know.
