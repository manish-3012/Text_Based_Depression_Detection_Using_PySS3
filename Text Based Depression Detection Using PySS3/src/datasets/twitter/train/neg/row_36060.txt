Follow up from last night's postI just posted in /r/depression a poem I wrote will kind of didn't right it just flowed out of me a few years ago. 

But as for the continuation from last night. I still feel all the same things but at of right now i feel torn because I'm still having the suicidal thoughts but not really sure right now if I'm suicidal.  I'm not really sure how to tell anymore I'm kind of just emotionally numb especially since I found out I'm not going to be able to go to one of my best friends funeral. 

I really just want to cut and curl up in a ball somewhere. 

The mental, emotional, and physical pain is easy to much for me to handle anymore, my page is overflowing enough already as it is. 
I feel like I'm hanging from the eye of a cliff by a fingernail. 

Please somebody tell me how to get the pain to go away
