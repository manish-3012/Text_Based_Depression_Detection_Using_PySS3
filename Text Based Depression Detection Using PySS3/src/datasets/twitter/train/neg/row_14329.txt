Anyone ever use the Lifeline Chat?Just wondering. Came across it this morning [lifeline](https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/chat/) and wondered if it was helpful or felt safer than calling a hotline where they can trace your number.

Seems like a good alternate to emailing the Samaritans bc you get a counselor in real time. 

Side note: i go to switzerland in just over a month to die. It will be by injection. I donâ€™t have to drink any nasty concoction. Itâ€™s so strange to buy groceries with expiration dates past my own.
