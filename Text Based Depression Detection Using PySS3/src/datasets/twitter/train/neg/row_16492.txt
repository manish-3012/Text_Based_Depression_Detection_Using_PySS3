Finally have a planIâ€™ve been depressed for a while, I canâ€™t really pinpoint when but itâ€™s been a very long time. Iâ€™ve tried drowning it out, with art, humor, and girls. My uncle died 6 days into 2017, he killed himself. The whole summer I was fantasizing about how I would do it. I was working in the city so I kind of hoped someone would just push me onto the subway tracks. Thought about just going into a bad neighborhood with nothing and starting trouble, get killed that way. Jumping in front of traffic. Overdosing. You name it. Iâ€™ve made up my mind though.

I turn 21 soon so Iâ€™m going to buy a bottle of whatever alcohol. Take a train somewhere far from my home. Wait till itâ€™s dark out. Sit in an alley or any secluded area really. Drink the whole bottle on an empty stomach and slit my wrists. I donâ€™t want to be found by my family. I just want to go out alone.
