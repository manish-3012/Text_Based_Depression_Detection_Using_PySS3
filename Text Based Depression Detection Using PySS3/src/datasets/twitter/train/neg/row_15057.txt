No other optionA couple years ago I was happy. I was in love, I had a job that would lead to a rewarding career, I had money, friends. Now I don't have any of that. I've had to move back home at 25 which is not dope which means living in a mining town in the middle of Australia.   
I have a dead-end job, a little debt, haven't had sex in a year, haven't been on a date even longer and see very little potential in myself now.

Over the last few weeks I've had a lot to think about, and a lot of time to think about it.

The only conclusion I have been able to come to is that it's time to go. I've had what I thought would make me happy, I've had what I thought would make everyone proud but life doesn't work like that. I'm sure I'll never be truly happy now and I don't want to live the rest of my life unhappy. I'd rather let the lights go out.

I'm not sad about it, I'm not happy about it, it just feels right. It feels like I don't have another option.

The only thing stopping me is the pain it will cause others because they won't understand that this isn't done out of sadness or desperation or because I want something to stop causing pain. My experience has lead me here and I'm okay with it.

Not sure why I wanted to say all of this if I'm honest, but I wanted to get my thoughts down somewhere.

I don't have a plan yet but I think it's starting to develop.

Life is a nothing but a hilarious joke and nothing in our society makes sense. I'd rather leave it.

Thanks for listening, stay gold everyone &lt;3
