Parents kicked me out of the house, I have no money, and want to die.Hi guys,

I'm a 20 year old female who just got kicked out her parent's house because I quit my job as a CASHIER. I quit the job because I have severe depression and going to work was just too hard and I didn't need the extra money because my parents provided me with food and shelter. Well, now that I quit the job, they kicked me out of my house. I have my car, laptop, and $300. I don't know what to do. I didn't go to college this semester because I needed a mental break, and they don't know that. They also don't know that I have severe mental issues. I hate my mom as she abused me all my life, and my dad because of what he just did and how he never helped. I don't know how to get student loans and I can't because they all require a cosigner. I have no friends or family because I always isolated myself because of how much I wanted to die and be left alone. I live in Florida too, so it's hot and I don't know where to sleep or go. Can anyone help? Thank you...so much...
