What I can't say anywhere elseI feel like I'm just waiting to die. Like I'm just passing time in this pointless, unfair, cruel life, being constantly assaulted by my brain and its fucked up chemistry and the constant pain in my chest begging for death, always hurting even when I take my medicine and don't actively want to kill myself.


I don't care about anything anymore. I don't care if I die without "leaving my mark," I hate this world with a burning passion and just want to leave without tainting it further. 


I never asked to be here. My parents were so selfish to yank me into existence and force me to live the  lives they couldn't, not even caring about me.


Every time I say anything about how I want to be dead people instantly shut me down. I'm not valid. They want the drugged, medicated version of me who doesn't talk about dying and who doesn't cry all the time. At my best, I'm a bitter, sarcastic cynic. 


It's so cruel to be forced to live, and that everyone except me is encouraged to be themselves while I have to pretend to be ok just so I don't make everyone around me even 1/1,000,000,000th of my daily level of discomfort and pain...
