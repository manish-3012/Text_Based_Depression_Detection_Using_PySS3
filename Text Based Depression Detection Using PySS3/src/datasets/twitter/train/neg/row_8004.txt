Whatâ€™s a good suicide prevention service that WONâ€™T track your location? Iâ€™ve been curious about these services for personal use, and to offer to others in need. But Iâ€™m paranoid and have read stories about hotlines/chats that will send police to your home if they feel youâ€™re at risk. Thatâ€™s the LAST thing that anyone needs (in my opinion - Iâ€™m not here to argue).

What services are discreet and respect the privacy of its users?
