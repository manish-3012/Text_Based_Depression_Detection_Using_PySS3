Is it ok just to live for other people?Hamlet asked himself a question once. His conclusion was that suicide would be desirable if one could be assured there is no afterlife. His reasoning was that life is full of unpleasantness, and if there is indeed no afterlife to worry about, you could save yourself a lot of trouble by just ending it all.

Hamlet's logic seems pretty sound to me, and unlike him, I'm fairly certain that death is indeed the end. So what's the rub? Why have I been sitting in this hotel room for hours debating whether or not to go through with it?

Like Hamlet, my conscious is making a coward of me. His concern was that suicide is a sin, and the eternal punishment could be worse than the pain he would escape by baring his bodkin and punctuating his own life.

My hesitation arises from causing others pain. Is it right to escape my own suffering if the action that does so causes more suffering overall than I've avoided? My mind is filled with images of how the few people I genuinely care about in this world would react to my exit.

But if the situation were different, if we were talking about staying in a relationship, wouldn't the common advice be that staying in a relationship solely for the other person is unhealthy and to be avoided? Is it really ok to stay alive only for other people's sakes?

I feel like I've had my fill of life. But for trying to avoid causing pain in others my decision would be instant. I'd enjoy a final meal, perhaps take a walk, and I'd be dead before the day is over. I have every confidence that the method I have prepared will be painless, certainly less painless then most natural deaths. It isn't gruesome, and won't leave a mess behind me.

I've written all this down and I still feel undecided. Is it ethically permissable to kill yourself even though it will cause pain to others? Is it ethically permissable to expect somebody to continue existing just to avoid suffering in others?
