Persistent suicidal thoughtsI think about suicide every day.  The only thing stopping me from doing it  is my family.  I know it would devistate them.  My doctor keeps telling me that thinking about suicide every day is not normal.  Has anyone here stopped their suicidal thoughts either through medication or by some other means?  Thanks.
