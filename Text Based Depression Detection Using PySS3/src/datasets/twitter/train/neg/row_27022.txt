Feels like Iâ€™m dead inside. I canâ€™t enjoy the good things I have because of my issues. I just want to die so badly.I canâ€™t mentally get out of this. I have an issue in my life that has made everything else unbearable. Itâ€™s all I can think about. Nothing is right and Iâ€™m ready to die. Not emotionally, just rationally. Iâ€™m ready to go I just donâ€™t want to hurt my parents and GF. My parents just bought me a fucking car. Theyâ€™re amazing but I canâ€™t even be happy. I just want this nightmare to end honestly. If I could go back to normal I would but that long gone. Hope is a lie. I donâ€™t know how much longer I can hold out
