I will be 17 tomorrow. Childhood is so unfair.I think I became depressed when I was 7, and was clinically diagnosed with depression when I was 10. As Iâ€™ve grown older, I think my depression has worsened somewhat and (of course) my responsibilities have increased. When I was little (twelve and under) I had no responsibilities at all really. Now I have dishes, laundry, never-ending school work, learning an entire language (Spanish), oh, and sometimes taking a dog out thatâ€™s kind and old and blind and diabetic and likes to drag a shit ton of ass in the dead of mother fucking winter. Oh and also I even have to rush through showering because I used to use a lot of water and now I have a ten minute time limit. I know this sounds negative, but if Iâ€™d known how much my responsibilities and the weight of my life would increase, I wouldâ€™ve tried to commit suicide as a little twelve girl right before I turned thirteen. I still donâ€™t really understand how people cope with, let alone deal with life. Iâ€™m extremely easily stressed out and I donâ€™t know what to do now.
