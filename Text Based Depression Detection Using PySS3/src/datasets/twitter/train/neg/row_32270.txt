Ive been feeling really suicidal this whole monthI know i sound like a crybaby or an attention seeker and this will be a long post but hear me out

I never had a good relationship with my family, mostly because my dad was an alcoholic and used to beat my mom, school wasn't much fun either when half the school picked on me and bullied me.
Basically i wanted to die since when i was about 6 or 7. I don't really know what to do anymore i have tried to kms 7 times this month, and no imnot joking i was dumped and i felt really depressed, suicidal and just.. Not good in any way. Ive been feeling a bit better after i found a small goose statue, i have talked to my friends about my love for geese and the destruction they cause and nobody can do anything about it so they plan on giving me a goose plush on Christmas but i still feel suicidal. I haven't really been doing anything productive. All i did this weekend was cry when i was alone, stay in my room, isolate myself and look at youtube until late in the night. Ive been getting pretty desperate now because i want to die. Like seriously kms but i can't because my friends wouldn't let me do that. Even tho i told them about what i did and showed them my now all scarred and wounded leg i don't really feel any better.. I did talk to them about other stuff that i can't really mention here but this was... All of this felt surreal. I never had almost any friends and thats why i don't want to really bother any of them. Sorry for wasting ur time reading my nonsense. Have a great day tho
