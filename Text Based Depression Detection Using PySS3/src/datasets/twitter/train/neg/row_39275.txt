My teeth are driving towards wanting to commit suicide.I literally canâ€™t do this anymore. I canâ€™t

My teeth are horrible, theyâ€™re so unbelievably horrible. 

My gums have receeded leaving my entire mouth looking disgusting, long and out of proportion. 

I canâ€™t do this anymore, Iâ€™m literally panicking. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. I CANNOT COPE. 

My smile is ruined, I want to die. There is no hope, itâ€™s never going to get better and I cannot live with myself anymore. 

Covid has made everything so much worse, I canâ€™t see my dentist. I canâ€™t see anyone to help. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore.
