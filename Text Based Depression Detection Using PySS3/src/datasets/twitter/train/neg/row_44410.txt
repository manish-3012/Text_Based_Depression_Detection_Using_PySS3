i'm tired of not feeling like a human beingfhdjfhrhjehfjkbefhue // that's how i feel 

My depression has barged its way in my life, once again. I can't seem to run away.. the darkness surrounds me and then chokes me silently, but with all of its power. I let it triumph over me every single time. I can't call out to God, counselors, or psychiatrists anymore. Nothing seems to help this pain. I have contemplated suicide and it seems like the best option. I feel so stupid and like a complete failure. I have been dealing with these feelings that keep me in bondage for too long. I need a new state of mind.
