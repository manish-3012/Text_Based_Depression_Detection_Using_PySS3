Most suicide attempts and completions are impulsive and this terrifies meI can't even count the number of times I've gotten the strong sudden urge to kill myself. I'd always thought those sudden urges couldn't materialize into actual suicide. That I had to want to kill myself for months at a time to really be at risk. Sometimes I feel like I don't want to die, but I'm scared that the days that I do will win out.
