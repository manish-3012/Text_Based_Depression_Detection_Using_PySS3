Someone made a complaint about me at workMy self esteem just hit rock bottom. I don't know why they complained and I wont know until my 18th birthday, which is the date on which they have chosen to hold my 'review'. I work as a healthcare assistant in a hospital and i honestly cant think of anything i did wrong. I may have been a bit slow, but that was only because i'm so inexperienced in healthcare. I thought i was learning really fast for someone like me. What should i do? I feel so hopeless and helpless. How am i ever going to hold a job in the real world. How will i ever complete a degree is i'm so unlikabl e that this sort of thing can happen. I need to save up money for a degree. Sorry if this is in the wrong subreddit. I just need to talk to someone and get some advice
