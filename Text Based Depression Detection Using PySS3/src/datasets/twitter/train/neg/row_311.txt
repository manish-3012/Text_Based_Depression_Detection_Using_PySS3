Anyone in East Sussex help me?This is probably a  really stupid thing to do because anyone could reply but I'm desperate for some support. A friend. Someone to fucking cry too. Tonight is the closest I've ever come to killing myself. I just want to cry to someone. I have a shitty living situation and I can't fucking take this shit anymore.
