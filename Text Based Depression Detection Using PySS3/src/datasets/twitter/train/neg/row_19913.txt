iâ€™d really like to waste away
iâ€™m surrounded by lonely, angry places made up by my mind and i canâ€™t seem to get out of them. itâ€™s like iâ€™m trapped in my own head and canâ€™t get out. just stuck in this constant relapse of pain and struggle.
i  have  no desire left to achieve anything. iâ€™ve done some brief research on drugs, and i think lsd would work for me. iâ€™ve got nothing left to live for, so i may as well waste away and have fun doing it. i really have no will left to live â€œproperlyâ€ anymore.
i honestly just want to waste the rest of my life, and die forgotten by everyone.
