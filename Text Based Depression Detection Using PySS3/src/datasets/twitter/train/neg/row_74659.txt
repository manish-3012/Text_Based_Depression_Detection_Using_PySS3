For the first time ever, Iâ€™m genuinely considering suicide.Thatâ€™s basically all there is to it. Iâ€™ve been depressed for basically the last ten years of my life. Teenage years are hard and that depression was different. I look back now and wonder, why? Why was I depressed when everything was so easy? I had my reasons. But they are minuscule compared to the shit show I live out now. Iâ€™ve never felt so alone. Iâ€™ve never felt so distant from the world. Iâ€™ve never not been afraid to die. But here I am. Suicide was always something that I had in the back of my head. I thought about it, but the best way I could phrase the feeling of *wanting* to commit suicide was just that I didnâ€™t want to die, I just wanted things to be different. I needed change. But, that was the me who still had hope. Who still tried to find the light despite the shit around me. But at this point in my life, Iâ€™m tired. Iâ€™m worn out. Exhausted. I feel like I might actually be going crazy at times. Iâ€™m numb. Thereâ€™s a small thread holding me onto this life right now. But itâ€™s starting to break too. Iâ€™m so close to just saying fuck it. Fuck the stress and the anxiety and the sadness. Fuck the bills and the appointments and the 40+ hour work week. Fuck taking care of everyone else. Fuck it all. It never gets better. They lie. They always have and always will. They want us to stay alive to drain us of money. Because thatâ€™s all this world revolves around. Greed and selfishness. Iâ€™m so tired of it all. What comes after death no longer scares me. Because even if hell is real, Iâ€™d rather just burn and feel actual pain than the way Iâ€™ve felt for so long now. Iâ€™m tired.
