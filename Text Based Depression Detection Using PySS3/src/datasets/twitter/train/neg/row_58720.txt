Hit me out of nowhereNormally I'm depressed, have been for a long time. I've always been good at hiding it. Yesterday it hit me like a tank. I'm finding it hard to get out of bed. I can hardly go to work. For the past couple months it's been hard but I've used drugs to kind of push me through, and I'm still here so it seems successful. But now I don't don't have anything. 

I'm suppose to be leaving this messed up situation I'm in, in a week. And I'm not excited about it. I don't want to belong anywhere anymore. I don't know what to do and this slump is going to be the death of me.
