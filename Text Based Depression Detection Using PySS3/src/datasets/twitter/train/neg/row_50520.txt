Having dysfunctional thoughtsFirst of all, I'm a black girl living in a mostly white town. There are pretty much racist people here, people who don't know anything about the world around them. I'm in a relationship for almost 3 years, but my SO is on a vacation with his friends for 9 days. 
He makes me feel pretty and wanted, but he isn't here right now. I'm halfway my Social Work study so I know how to self reflect, but I just need someone to talk to. I've always been the strange kid, the people in my town can't see my beauty because they only like the stereotypical 'pale, blonde girl'. I'm actually quite happy with myself, but I'm having dysfunctional thoughts atm. I feel like no one likes me, loves me or truly cares about me. My SO is the only one who truly loves me, I actually don't have much friends.. just some acquitances (probably spelled wrong?). Normally my self esteem isn't this dependent on my SO, but right now it is.. Dunno why

Long story short, I feel fucking worthless right now. Don't understand me wrong: normally I'm happy with myself, but not today. I miss my boyfriend, and I'm tired of always being the ugly kid. I feel the need to cut myself, although I haven't hurt myself since 2 years. 

Sorry for my horrible English, it's not my first language.. :(
