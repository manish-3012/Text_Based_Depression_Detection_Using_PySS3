Blades and scars.I enjoy my knife collection. I have already accidentally cut my palms and  fingers enough times to have gained a few scars since I like to play around with them. No one cares of course. Normal thing to see, small cuts on your hands. No big deal. But recently, I have been wanting to do it on purpose. The sting of the metal going below my skin. I don't exactly enjoy it, but it's something I don't want to stop feeling. But I don't want any more scars on my hands. I want to move it to my stomach and wrists. No one would even notice anyway. Would the rush of finishing my damn near useless body and carving myself like a chess board be enough? I don't have any reason to continue anyway. Why not finish with a bit of "style"
No one seems to care until the person is dead and gone anyways. 
No one even talks to me anymore. Hmmmm. I wonder why. (Sarcasm if you can't tell)
Not the way I wanted to die but whatever.
