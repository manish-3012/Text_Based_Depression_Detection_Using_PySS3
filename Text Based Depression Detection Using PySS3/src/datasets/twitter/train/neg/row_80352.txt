I really cannot see a pointI am a very unique individual. I could be described as ambitious. I would like to do many things in life- study, go into research, etc. But sometimes when I look past it all, I really don't see a point. I definitely don't want children. I want to research but sometimes I end up losing sight of why I want to. It makes life seem pointless.

I guess one factor of this is the boomerang effect from when I recovered from my suicidal self 5 years ago, a much different suicidal self who that time, did not have ambitions and felt useless as hell. I guess I have seen both sides of the worst part of myself and life.
