She sighed and smiled at the same time.  The look on his face wasn't something she wasn't used to but through each episode of mania her face, in this state, was always new to him.  He had no specific way to react.  "You're going to be okay."

"What the fuck do you mean I'm going to be-"

She interrupted him by putting her index finger to his lips.  "It's not always about how you feel.  It's about who you are, remember?"  She asked him, almost pleading but knew that would push him to a further point simply due to his mental disability.

"Well..."  He tried to consider it as if it were new, having flashbacks of the previous times given the reminder.  "I'm... I'm going to be okay?" His question was genuine.  He was unsure of how he felt and who he was at that moment.

"Yes, you'll be okay.  I'm here for you."

He woke to his own reflection.  No one but himself was ever truly going to be there for him, and a new day started.  Just as he always hoped for.  "Maybe things can be alright."
