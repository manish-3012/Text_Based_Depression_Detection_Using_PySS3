I'm a fucking messI'm just fucking depressed. I don't understand why the fuck I can't wake up in the morning. Everything I do to help leads me back to the same place. I hate my job, I hate living at home, and I feel trapped. I don't know what to do.

EDIT: Seeing all the unanswered posts under "new" is really depressing in itself.
