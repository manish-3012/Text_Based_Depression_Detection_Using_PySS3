Staying out lateToday I went out and I plan to stay out as late as I can to avoid being alone at home, even though Iâ€™m alone while Iâ€™m out. 

Being home reminds me of how lonely I am. It reminds me of how Iâ€™ve accomplished nothing and will never do anything with my life. It reminds me Iâ€™m a failure. It reminds me Iâ€™ll only ever live in this place where Iâ€™ve suffered and where thereâ€™s no opportunity. I know Iâ€™ll die here alone and afraid like Iâ€™ve always been.
