donâ€™t depend on motivational speakers to give you a reason to live.iâ€™ve spent months now following instructions from different fucking speakers, hearing them say things that apply to my life such as being miserable and stuck in place really hit home. 

i was at one point working out twice a day, eating healthy, practicing guitar, and writing poetry. but i never truly felt satisfied with where i was. even though i was following the advice these dudes were giving me, life was just not going anywhere. 

itâ€™s like being stuck in a hole and thinking you had finally grasped the edge of it almost able to lift yourself up, but coming to the realization that this whole time you have been curled up in a ball dreaming of a better life. 

following your dreams was something that kept being brought up with these guys, and my dream is to one day make music (hopefully) but i canâ€™t do it, i canâ€™t fucking make it. iâ€™m too scared about pointless shit and overthinking about things that truly mean nothing and itâ€™s really fucking sucks knowing that if you just tried maybe you could make it somewhere but not having the motivation to actually do it. 

at the end of the day i know nothing and learned nothing
