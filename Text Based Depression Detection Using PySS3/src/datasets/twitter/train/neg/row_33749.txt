I'm just tired of thisI'm stuck in a life without any kind of satisfaction or joy. I'm not smart, I'm not attractive, I'm not good in anything, especially in school: the only thing that keep me alive is eating. My parents hate me, even if they don't admit it, I lost my alredy few friends after failing school twice and now it has been decided that I will go to university in the future, probably to keep the illusion that my parents haven't completly failed with me. I can't even end it because I'm a fucking coward that doesn't want to suffer
