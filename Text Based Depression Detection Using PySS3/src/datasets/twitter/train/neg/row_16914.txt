I canâ€™t take itI donâ€™t know whats going on. Ever since i started high school, iâ€™ve had a really hard time getting myself to do the work. This term i think i just broke. I havenâ€™t done a single assignment, and Im also skipping classes. I just donâ€™t see the point. I know i need to be concerned about my future, but i just want to enjoy my life without having to spend most of the day working. I know thatâ€™s incredibly unrealistic, but i cant help it. Iâ€™ve seen a psychiatrist, and she gave me some anti-anxiety and depression medication, but it completely took away my motivation. My family care about me but they just dont seem to understand. They just push me, which makes it worse. I dont even get it myself, because i do care, but i dont want to work for it. Sorry for the confusing or possibly contradicting post, but i reslly dont know whats going on. I just feel like im digging myself into a hole, and its too late to get out.
