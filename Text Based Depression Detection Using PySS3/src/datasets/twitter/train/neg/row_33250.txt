Brother got in a wreckI was already suicidal but now my brother got in a car wreck. I don't know anything aside from that he's "fine" and the car that is shared between him my mom and I is totaled. I am afraid to ask for more info because it'll just hurt more. I just can't take it anymore. I can't take anymore shitty news. I just can't keep doing this. What is it all for? It isn't making me stronger it's made me weaker. I am so goddamn tempted to just walk into the noose there is nothing I would want more than that. But then that would make things worse for my family. Fuck this. I just wanna die with no consequences. I'm not the kind of person to think I'm above it all but goddamn I think for all the bullshit i've gone through for the past nearly 22 years of my horrible shitty life I at least deserve an escape with no strings attached. Hell I can't even seem to find a therapist even when I want to get better. Not like the material conditions of my existence will get any better and ALLOW for me to heal. I'm fucking doomed. And we come full circle back to my desire for death. Like a perverted ouroboros eats it's tail. What if I can't actually die and this is hell and I'm just doomed to living in torment forever and eternity?
