Feeling worse and also a question.I've heard that people feel better after their attempt. I feel worse, like on the verge of attempting again. I just feel so worthless. It's so weird, thinking back to when I was younger and couldn't feel anything but happiness, and now, just wanting to die. Of course though, since I hide it everyone thinks I'm still just as happy. Sometimes I do have real happy times. Rarely. I only have happy times with the few people I care about. And my dog. They just make me feel like I have worth. Sometimes I forget that. For example, a few days ago. My attempt. I doubt I'd be alive if they weren't always here. I wonder if any of them know. Like if they can just tell. Sometimes they act like it. The only one that actually does know is my dog, but I doubt he really understands what suicidal thoughts are. I also wonder if any of them feel the same. If they have suicidal thoughts and feel worthless. Now, here's the question, what is it like seeing the people you care about find out about your suicide attempt, whether it's in the hospital or just you telling them? What is it like?
