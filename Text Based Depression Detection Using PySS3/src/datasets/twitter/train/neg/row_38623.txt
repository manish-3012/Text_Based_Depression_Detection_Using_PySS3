I'm overdosing as I'm typing thisToday is the day! I'm finally gonna end it all for good. I'm taking 150 depression pills and a whole lot of sleeping pills after I send this. Just wanted to say goodbye and I appreciate all of the support I've got in this subreddit! So I should hopefully be on my way to the afterlife very shortly now. 


I love you all who have supported me and helped me get this far in life, but this is goodbye.


Goodbye everyone!
