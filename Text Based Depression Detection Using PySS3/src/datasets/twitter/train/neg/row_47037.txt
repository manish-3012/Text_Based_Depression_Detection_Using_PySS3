I think I'm going to do in tonightI have a bottle of period pills (about 23 and about 5 migraine pills) and some belts. I honestly think I may go thru. You are supposed to throw away trash, right? My family doesn't accept me for me, divorce battles, little siblings who make fun of me wanting to die, bulling about my gender/sexuality at school, lost my best be friend, druggie parents, alcoholic dad, angry step dad, my life is a mess. My school is the worst in my area. I'm the oldest of 5 and babysit so much, I don't even feel like a bigger sibling, I feel like a full time babysitter who just happens to stay in the same house as the kids I'm sitting. I think everyone will be better off without me. Nobody in the real world cares. Life is supposed to suck, I know, but it seems to shitty for a 14 year old like me. I'll do it tonight at midnight, if not, well then, sometime soon.
