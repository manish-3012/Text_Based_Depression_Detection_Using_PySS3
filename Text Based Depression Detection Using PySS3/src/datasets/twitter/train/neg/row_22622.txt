Death WishSo, I think about suicide every day. I have thought of the different ways I could effectively do it. Hot bath and a knife, gun barrel in the mouth. The thing is, I don't really want to do it. I work in the medical field on the emergency side, and have seen how damaging suicide is to families. I do not want to go out like an asshole. So, I think it's more of a death wish. I want to die, I am not happy here. I just don't want to be the one to do it.

Last year, I lost my job, my place in school, and my home due to an injury all in 4 days. Then 10 months ago, I found out I have cancer. I had thoughts prior to all of that, but every morning and every night for thirteen months thinking of a way out has been my thoughts as I lay in my bed, in my parents basement.

Anyway, I was told to come here by another redditor, not sure what to expect.
