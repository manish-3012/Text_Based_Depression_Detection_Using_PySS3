Donâ€™t know what to do?Iâ€™ve been dealing with depression since January of 2017. Thatâ€™s when my best friend of years passed away due to a sudden heart infection. I was devastated and still am two years later. My first suicide attempt was November 30,2017. I was placed in a mental heath facility for about a week or so. Between then and May of this year, Iâ€™ve been in and out of those facilities multiple times. Itâ€™s been almost 5 months since Iâ€™ve been out of the hospital, which is the longest time Iâ€™ve been out in two years! Great, right? Well i think so! But starting at the beginning of September, i started to get depressed again. Donâ€™t know why. Just came on randomly. Then the suicidal thoughts, plans, and intent came along. Why? I was doing so good! I would think about suicide maybe once or so a week. And currently, for the past couple weeks Iâ€™ve been having those thoughts every single day all day. And i feel so close to the edge more than i ever have before. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. These thoughts donâ€™t bother me but i know they probably should. Ugh. Struggling so much right now.
