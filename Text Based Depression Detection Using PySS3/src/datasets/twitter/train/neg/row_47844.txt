Everything is falling apartSo today Ive destroyed my pc when i know that i cant afford a new one, that means that i wont be able to play with my long distance best friend who is easier to talk to about anything while playing together, ive made my sister insecure about a hump on her neck ,,,,, plus made her cry bevause of it, we are moving but dont have a new house yet while we need to be out of here by 12.08 and my father is having trouble with money/alcohol. I really wish I could harm myself to cope but i HATE pain and that would just make me feel worse. Why is the world being mean to me?
