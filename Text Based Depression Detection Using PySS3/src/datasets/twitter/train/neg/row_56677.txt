Nobody takes me seriously. Tired of cutting myself daily, just want to slice a vein and bleed out. I'm done with life.I post on Facebook pictures of me cutting myself and I post depressing poetry about killing myself but nobody cares. My posts end up getting reported and removed. Nobody goes out of their way to talk to me about whatever I'm feeling and that makes me feel more isolated.

I lost custody of my daughter a year ago for going to court high off weed and even though I was able to stay clean and complete my court menu, I got tested again and failed so they took my rights back away. She's only 2. Im used to her waking me up in the morning and me putting her back to bed but I haven't done it in a long time. I only get to see her an hour a day. Sometimes less because I can't bring myself to see her after cutting  myself. I cut daily. Or every other day. I cut when I can't smoke weed or when I can't drink cuz it's my last resort coping mechanism. Nobody seems to get that. Even my boyfriend doesn't know what to say to me anymore. I keep telling him he needs to educate himself on how to talk to people dealing with a mental health crisis but he brushes it off. 

I'm really at my breaking point. I tried to kill myself in the past while I was younger but failed. What the hell is stopping me from trying again? I think I might jump in front of a car this time and hopefully at least end up in a coma if I don't die instantly. I can't do this anymore. I'm tired of living on auto pilot and not feeling anything from living. I just want to die. I hope to obtain a firearm  soon from a friend just to take my life.
