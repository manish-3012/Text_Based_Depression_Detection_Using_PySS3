it's difficult not being a people person.idk why but I don't connect with others at all. around others the life goes out of me, no energy. conversation is difficult. rarely ever lasts longer than a minute and it's never interesting. around other is ironically when I feel most lonely. being in a crowd of people talking and me standing there looking stupid is unbearable. it sucks being like this, I have no one
