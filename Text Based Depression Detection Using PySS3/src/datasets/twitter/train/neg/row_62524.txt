My mother makes me want to die, and not at the same time.I've been self-isolating in my room, so there's been a lot of time to think. My relationship has been rocky with her, to say the least. She's told me she wouldn't care if I died at least 3 times and said she wished me and my siblings were never born a bunch more times. She says her life would've been so much better if she didn't have children. She calls my therapist sessions 'annoying', and says it's "just a phase". She came to visit me in the psych ward once to tell me she wanted me to apologize for telling my therapist I wanted to die. She blames me and talks about it openly like saying "You have such a perfect life yet you want to kill yourself"

Yet, she guilt trips me, like saying how my birth was the most painful and lengthy one, since I had to be taken out by c-section. Someone with Sars was in that hospital so she couldn't see my dad. She says that she raised me for 17 years, just for me to want to kill myself. Or what a nice child I was when I was younger. In some ways, I guess she's right, because, despite all the hurtful things she's said to me, she isn't a bad mother. She takes care of me, feeds me, and all that other stuff, which I know is more than alot of parents do. 

I guess I won't try it for now.
