I'm 15 and need help killing myselfI've seen plenty of suicides online, and a gun looks like the best option to me. Fast and efficient.
The only problem is, I'm in Australia where guns are illegal without a license and being under 18, I can't apply for one.

Please don't try and talk me out of it. I'm not here to share my story. I just want some suggestions.
Thank you
