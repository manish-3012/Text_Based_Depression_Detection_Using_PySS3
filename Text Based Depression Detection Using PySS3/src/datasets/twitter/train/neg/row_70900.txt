I'm doing it and I don't care.I've told him for a week ive been getting worse. I told him every day how lonely ive been. apparently that makes me too dependant because we walk together to our morning classes one class a day and sometimes he sits next to me on the bus after school. So fuck it, I dont care. No ones cared how worse I've been feeling, so no ones gonna miss me. No matter how directly or bluntly I say how im feeling, its brushed off or ignored.
