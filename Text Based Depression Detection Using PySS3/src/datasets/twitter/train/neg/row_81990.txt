How did you get better?I have been suicidal for a lot of years now. Iâ€™m very exhausted. I have come to realize that I either need to make significant changes in my life, or else I am sure I will finally kill myself. 

To anyone on this sub that has experienced being suicidal for a long period of time, and have recovered from that. How did you get better?
