I wonder if I had killed myself (Rant)Once, a friend made a post asking this: Had you succeeded in killing yourself, how many years of being death would you have now?

I was about to answer: Six and a half years.

I won't lie, in that time, I had really good memories and moments, made awesome friends and so on but... I also had to endure great pain.

Had I killed myself in the past, maybe I would've reincarnated into someone with better chances at living, someone who wouldn't have fucked up his/her entire existence just because he/she wanted to be understood by others.

I got that misdiagnosis because I thought people would understand me better, and also as a way to justify my childish attitude, but I fucked up, and now I'll have to deal with the stigma of having Asperger's (while I don't really have it) for at least a few years at best, or for the rest of my life at worst.

For trying to be a narc who wanted attention, I got it, but now... I truly understand what it means having a closed heart.

I became a social misfit, I can't make friends, I can't text most people because I'm afraid of rejection, I waste my vacations away and spend my classes depressed and procrastinating... I became a toxic, selfish and egocentric person, who is unable to understand most people... How the hell am I going to be a psychologist if I have been unable to understand most people in my life?

I wonder why my family or remaining friends still love me... I know that I can't be that bad if they're with me, but sometimes... I feel like I don't deserve it.

And know I'll have to bear this pain, because I don't want my loved ones to suffer...
