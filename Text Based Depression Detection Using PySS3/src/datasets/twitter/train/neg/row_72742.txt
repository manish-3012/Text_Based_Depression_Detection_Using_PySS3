Suicidal AF.My life has come to a crashing hault, I've lost the love of my family and lost all my friends, I will never make anymore, will never have another love, I can't go outside without and enormous weight of anxiety bearing down on me. I will never be able to hold down a job and cannot cope with this life anymore. If only I would've learnt from my first mistake, I had so much to live for...and now it's all dust in the wind. I want to end this shit. I've already attempted by slicing my wrist, but my family friend got me to the hospital before I bled out. I think I'm going to end this pretty soon, and go burn in hell as I always was.
