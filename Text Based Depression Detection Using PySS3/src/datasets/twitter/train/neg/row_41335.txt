I just tried to suicide and failedI tried to suffocate by using plastic bag over head but it totally didn't work because the method is rather shit (unfortunately I have no better option, even hanging isn't possible), not sure if it's a good thing but I no longer want to kill myself. I haven't been to school for 6 weeks but yesterday I talked to the school's registrar and tomorrow I will start returning to school, I may have to spend an extra year in high school but it doesn't matter much since I already spent an extra year in 8th grade (I moved across Pacific Ocean to US and then stuffs happened). I already feel a rapid change in my mind and I hope it won't vanish soon, tomorrow I will talk to a counselor and I hope it will help me.
