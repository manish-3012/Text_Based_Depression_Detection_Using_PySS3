I'm getting better but I still hate myselfI have been getting a bit better but I still hate myself. I am constantly criticising myself whenever I write something or do a simple action. I am trying my hardest to not write any lies or anything manipulative but its so fucking hard and I want it to stop. I  know that some of the things that I do are wrong but I can't help myself. I need help because its so hard. I keep writing out sentences for this but I delete them because I don't want to lie. I'm ending this post here before I write something manipulative.
