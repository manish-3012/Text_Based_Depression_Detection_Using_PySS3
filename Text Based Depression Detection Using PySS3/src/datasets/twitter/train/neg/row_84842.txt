the world fucking sucks.hi, iâ€™m robin. i donâ€™t really have any friends, which im kinda okay with. the loneliness bothers me from time to time but i know itâ€™s for the best. iâ€™m extremely outspoken, angry and depressed. i write, read and study cinematography, also psychology is pretty cool. i havenâ€™t seem many therapist for months because iâ€™m afraid that they wonâ€™t fucking listen, since iâ€™m just a client and thatâ€™s their job. thereâ€™s no actual outcome or point to it in my mind. iâ€™ve been in and out of psych wards since i was 11 for my self destructive behaviour, and iâ€™m only worsening. the doctors donâ€™t do shit, and they seem to be unsure of whatâ€™s actually wrong with me. iâ€™ve had all sorts of diagnosisâ€™s, from borderline personality disorder to narcissistic personality disorder. i hate leaving the house because everyoneâ€™s just so fucking boring and judgemental, i donâ€™t like looking anybody in the eye because iâ€™m afraid of them. iâ€™m rambling here because i really donâ€™t know what to say anymore. iâ€™m tired of this constant fighting for nothing, thereâ€™s literally no point in me going to therapy anymore since i canâ€™t get better. writing sometimes helps, i like poetry. oscar wilde and edgar allen poe are my favourites. also film is a passion of mine. i like david lynch a lot, his mind seems to work similar to mine in a way. iâ€™m still waiting to find somebody who understands me, who will listen with no judgement.
