I don't want to exist anymoreI have been suffering from depression for a really long time. Although I am taking medications, trying to be more spiritually inclined, and going to therapy I feel like nothing is working. My therapist and doctor who prescribe my medication think I am doing great, are proud of me, and showing great progress. Lately, I have lost my drive to do anything and it's stressing me out. There is also a lack of support for me at home. My family doesn't really know how to deal with my depression. A family member in our home is making things difficult for all of us and I cannot escape her. I also feel like I can barely keep up at university and it's hard to complete tasks. I really feel like I want to end it all as dramatic as that sounds. I really need some encouragement but can't find it from the people around me. Do things ever really get better?
