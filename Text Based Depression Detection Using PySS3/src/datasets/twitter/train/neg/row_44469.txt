Just my current thoughtsSo this is my first time opening up,because it's getting worse and I'm anonymous.

Phrases like  "don't give up" or "live has so much to offer" are quite common,but for me it's really just a numbers game. If I give up and commit suicide I will lose only one more time,but if I keep living I will lose everyday and people will realize what an embarrassing failure I am. I will just humiliate myself everyday. At least if I kill myself I won't notice how my family and friends think what a failure I am.

I don't want to live any longer knowing I will fail. I feel like I am trapped .For me both options aren't possible.I can't fail,I am  supposed to be the person who people can rely on.

Honestly it's pathetic that I feel this way, I'm just an  average 18 years old guy who is has fun with his friends and the only big problem is that I'm terrified on just the thought of failing. I feel guilty for not having a better reason to think about suicide other than being a failure.

That was just a short text on how I feel right now(I know it's not good written) and I don't really know what I am hoping to achieve by doing this. I am sorry if I bothered anyone with my self pity.
