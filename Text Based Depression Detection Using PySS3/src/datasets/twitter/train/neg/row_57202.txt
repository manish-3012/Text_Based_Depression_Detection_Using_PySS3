I think I need to do it tonightI'm Aleks. I'm a 17 year old high school senior from a somewhat big city in my home state. This time last year, things were great, but now I think I need to go through with it.
My girlfriend of over a year and a half broke up with me a couple of months ago. That was the first nail in the coffin. We're still "friends", but she treats me poorly and I feel like a nuisance to her all the time. It hurts because I feel so unloved. My friends don't like me anymore; in fact, today I got ditched even though hanging out with them was what was getting me through the week. I have deep feelings for a friend of mine, but he's straight, and it kind of breaks my heart. To really add onto this bullshit, I have many very strong symptoms of bipolar disorder, and I feel unstable all of the time.
Senior year has put me through the ringer. I can't really do this anymore. I've gone back to self harming and going back to my eating disorder behaviors that I dropped over a year ago. I used to see a future for myself, but now I don't. I don't see myself going to prom, or graduating, or starting college. 
I have a plan. I'll ask a friend of mine (the guy I happen to like) if he can take me to a park nearby and just leave me there. I plan on jumping into the river, maybe with weights around me. I don't know how to swim anyways. I wrote a "will" of some sorts that I can leave behind, I just need to write letters for certain people in my life. I just feel legitimately hopeless now. I honestly don't believe life is for me, and that's okay. I've come to terms with it. I feel as though me committing suicide was just written into my "life story" beforehand, you know?
If you're still reading this, thank you. My time on this app has been short lived, but that's okay. I guess I'll keep whoever cares posted if I happen to not do it. Have a nice day, everyone. Goodbye.
