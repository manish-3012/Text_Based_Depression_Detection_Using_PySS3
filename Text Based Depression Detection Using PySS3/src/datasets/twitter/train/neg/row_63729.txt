I have to kill myselfI don't really have a choice. My anxiety won't let me fix my problems and even if it did I couldn't afford it. I will never get out of poverty. My dreams will never be realized. No one knows me, no one gives a shit. I'm just some dumb trans woman. I'll never be what I want to be. I will never be okay. I'm meant to kill myself and the longer I wait the worse things will get. God forbid I end up in a psych ward.
