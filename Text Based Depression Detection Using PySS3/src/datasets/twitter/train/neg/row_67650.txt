A friend of mine tried to commit suicide yesterday.And I need your advice. A little more background info: Yesterday, my ex-girlfriend, which I'm still very close to, called me. She told me that our friend, let's call him Leon, just tried to kill himself. But he failed.
Leon has been my friend for about 12 years now, he is my best friend. We can talk to each other about love, sex and stuff (We're both 18), but instead of talking to me about his suicidal thoughts, he talked to my ex-gf. She has been the supportive person that is mentioned in the guideline of /r/swrecources He did not want to worry me.
But whatever. I instantly called Leon on Skype after hearing about this, and talked to him. Tried to make him stop. But I had no chance. Litterally Zero. It seems like there is nothing I can do. Leon doesn't want me to tell other people about his suicide attempt. 

But I can't sit around waiting for him to kill himself. And at this point, I don't care anymore about what he thinks about me. I want to save him. I love him too much. But should I respect him and not tell anyone about it, or should I make the first move to inform people, who can probably stop him from killing himself? (Like his brother?)

I arranged a meeting with Leon today, to get him busy so he can't try it another time. 
I hope Leon shows up, it is a shitty feeling to wake up and not to know whether your best friend is still alive or not.
