I'm just sick of thisI've just left my only friend today because she can't be there for me too much. I mean, we can only talk once a week (even then not so much) because of her work and because she spends the rest of her time with her boyfriend. She even said that she's sorry for neglecting our friendship and her other connections (I guess it's not just me, but her other friend too). We used to talk a lot more. She's my best friend and I'm her best friend (at least she said that). And I feel so freaking lonely without her. I don't feel like she thinks me as important as once. It's killing me. She's not the same person anymore. And I don't have any other friend other than her. I have my mom she loves me of course but it's not like I can get things off my chest or anything like that. She doesn't know me at all. I don't trust her. She's a perfect mom but not really a "good friend", someone you can talk to and stuff like that.

It's not my first time thinking about suicide, but I'm too weak to do anything, unless it's painless. And I don't have any firearm.
It's just annoying. The feeling of not being able to do anything.
I did find another "relatively" painless method, but I can't do it either, because I don't live alone. It's just sad.
