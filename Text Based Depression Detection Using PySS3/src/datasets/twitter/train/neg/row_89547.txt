I'm surviving each day of my life, want the pain to endI'm 23 Living in pakistan with my parents and one brother. Past few months have been mixed with emotions. Ive realized that there is no place for a fool like me here. I used to hang out with friends drink, party but now i rarely see any of them. Basically i make everyone uncomfortable around me, my social skills are disaster and I'm doing major in business administration. I've no real contacts but I used to act like I've had everything figured out. But now the bitter reality is that i don't know shit. I just want to die before my father dies. I cant take any responsibility of my family. I'm socially isolated. Uptill now I've passed my exams using unfair means. I haven't learned anything. 
My parents think that ill achieve something but I'm a failure.  Suicidal thoughts are on my mind 24/7 But that will be dreadful for my parents. Today a blast occured in my city I was watching on TV and wishing that i was there at the blast site and died with them. I just want to sleep and never wake up. Sometimes I'm afraid of myself.
Sorry for my bad vocabulary.
