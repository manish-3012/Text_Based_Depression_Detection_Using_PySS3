the most reasonable thing that i have decidedi set a date,and when it will arrive i will kill myself.
thats it i cant take it any more am a failure i have no future and i dont have any good memories from the past i'm a pathetic person. i always try to convice myself that it will be good but it wont 10 years ago i was in the same situation and with the same mental heath that i am now, a depressed loser.
so in this time i will try my best to change and afer every day i will make a check in one of two columns i draw in a paper good and bad, if i had a good memory it go in the good column and if i had a bad one it go to the bad column and i already started.
and i thinked  of the way i will kill myself and the place.
