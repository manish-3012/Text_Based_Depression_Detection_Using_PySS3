Every day suicidal thoughtsEvery day I think about killing myself. I'll be going about my every day life and walk over a bridge and imagine jumping off, I'll be waiting for a train and imagine being in front of it as it hurtles past. I sit at home and I think about all the ways i could do it and it frustrates me that I can't choose when to die because my loved ones would view it so badly. 
So, every day I'm alone with my thoughts, my fantasies. I have no plan to actually do it and it has become so normal to think of death that it's weird to think of not killing myself.
