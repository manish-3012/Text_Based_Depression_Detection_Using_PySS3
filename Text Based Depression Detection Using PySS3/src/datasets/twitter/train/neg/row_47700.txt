Nervous and ProcrastinatingI already procrastinated all evening. I fear both failure and success. I've already failed once earlier this week. I am procrastinating by writing this post and will probably put it off for another few hours after I submit this one. 

I am almost certain that I will be convicted. It is highly unlikely that I'll show up. Dying is my end game. Either I die this week or I die as as a fugitive. I don't intend to risk having the trouble of trying to die while in prison. 

Last time I tried was emotional. This time will be logical, and it is much harder to make the decision without strong emotions. But I recall the peace I felt after realizing I will actually die only to wake up to the disappointment that I will not. 

Last time, the pills and the water made me vomit too soon. I threw up 4 hours after I took them. I am afraid something similar will happen this time, and then I will not have enough to try again since I am unwilling to order anymore or wait that long. If that happens, I will have to try alternatives and the thought of any of them makes me sick. I am not violent by nature. I don't want to die violently. 

I have no reason to live and stand trial. Any career I had in Computer Science is mostly over. It will not matter how talented I am, how much experience I have, or where I went to school. No one hires a felon or wants to work for one. And even if I get out, the industry will have changed making my knowledge irrelevant. For sure, I have no future.
