I want to die but I'm afraidMy whole life sucks I wanted to end it and tired overdosing before but survived I'm too afraid to kill myself and thinking about how it would leave my girlfriend is the only thing stopping me when I talk to anyone all they say is that you will eventually get out you'll eventually be okay but dealing with this for 20+ years is too much already I have no way out and I see a bright future that will never happen because of what I'm going through idk what to do but I've become useless I don't eat drink watch or read anything now I've even started searching ways to kill myself
