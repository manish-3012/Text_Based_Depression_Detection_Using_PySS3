I don't know what to do anymore.I've been having these dreams lately where I'm crying. Like my heart is breaking. Have you ever heard of the death wail? That's what it feels like. I cry like I can't bear to live without whatever it is. The dreams have varying themes. Usually when something dear to me is destroyed.

Now I feel like that all of the time. Like at any time I will fall down and start sobbing and crying out harder than I can breathe in.

I feel like I'm dying from the inside out. Like my heart will fail me at any time. The things I love surrounding me, and there is nothing I can do anymore. I can barely get out of bed, can barely breathe. I have no motivation for anything anymore. Not to cook, not to clean, not to work. 

I'm newly married, and my husband doesn't want me to go to therapy. He says it's because it only ruins marriages. But I still need someone, anyone to talk to. Have you ever cried for help so loud, but no one wants to listen? I've told people that I've called suicide hotlines, told my husband I might kill myself, and called my mom for help. The only one who seems to care is my mom. 

I feel like I can't breathe. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm trying, so hard. But I just don't know. I've tried to call therapists but none have gotten back. 

I really don't know why I'm typing this but, here we are.
