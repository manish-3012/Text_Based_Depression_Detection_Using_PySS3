Just can't deal with it anymoreThis week has been the worst experience of my life. My wife of 5 years left me and took our 4 and 2 year old children while I was at work. She filed for custody and child support and I'm all alone. 

She was my everything. My heart and soul. My life. She was my best friend and my only friend except my brother. I don't talk to other people often. She was the only person I confided in and now I can't talk to her. 

We bought this house together and everything here has my kids and her sewn into every memory. I'm feeling more pain than I've ever felt and have no one to talk to. No friends and my whole life's been turned around. 

I own multiple rifles and guns and sit here with my .45 loaded ready to do it but can't. I held it to my head for 10 minutes before breaking down. I can't do it but I don't want to live here. Im so lost and have no clue how to handle this.
