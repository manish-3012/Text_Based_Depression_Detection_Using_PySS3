I consider myself a failure and have decided this is the end of my life, how can I quickly and painlessly kill myself?I got so angry at myself that I started slamming my hand against my head and my parents just told me that they'd have me locked up, they don't care and never ever try to comfort me. Everyone else just pretends to care and doesn't help. 

I am 17 and I have missed all of middle school and high school and failed college, I am so fucking lonely and the few people who know me don't even care and just make excuses, including my parents. There's so much wrong with me, I'm such a fucking failure I can't even do anything properly. I have autism diabetes epilepsy hypermobility, I'm sick of it, it fucks me over so hard when I try to befriend people. I hit myself in the head and bite my hand and arms and cut myself to punish myself for being so useless, people say it calms them down when they self harm but it doesn't, I only do it out of the burning hatred I feel for myself. Every time I do something wrong I want to scream and bleed and punish myself with pain.

My mother has this stupid teddy bear which she almost sort of puppeteers and my father shows that more genuine love than he does to me

I've felt depressed since I was 6 and it's gotten worse since then, I don't remember what happiness feels like anymore and I need to die to escape this but I'm afraid

I know it seems like I'm ranting but I'm just explaining my situation. I need to die, I'm so afraid of being trapped in this stupid box they call life

How can I kill myself quickly and painlessly so I don't end up holding back? Please help me, don't try and stop me
