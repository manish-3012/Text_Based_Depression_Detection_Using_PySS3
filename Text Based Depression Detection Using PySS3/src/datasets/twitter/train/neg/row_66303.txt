Suicide is always an option; and itâ€™s a genuinely comforting thought.I started a new job this week at an industrial warehouse. Iâ€™m a 24 year old male (who looks 19-20) among a large group of 30-50 year old blue-collar trailer-trash tattooed man-children who spread rumors and cause drama for no fucking reason other than being bored and disappointed with their lives and wanting to take it out on â€œpunksâ€ (their words, not mine) like me who are just minding their own business and trying to get through the day.

Iâ€™m supremely disappointed with the caliber of people I am working with, and within a few short days, I have lost my faith in humanity entirely. One of the few reasonably polite men (who has been working there for 20 years) has been bullied into submission by his coworkers. They belittle and emasculate him at every turn, and he takes it all with this sheepish grin on his face and a â€œboys will be boysâ€ attitude.

I lie here awake tonight in my bed knowing that I have to get early to go back there for another 10 hour shift in the morning, and the only thought comforting me is that I could kill myself if things get really bad there. I would gladly take my own life if it meant avoiding a traumatizing confrontation with these bitter men, who I am forced to spend time with in order to make money.
