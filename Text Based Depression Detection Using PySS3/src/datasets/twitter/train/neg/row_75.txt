effective suicide plan?So I've finally decided to take a turn to find peace.

To be honest my plan isn't well thought out and I'm scared it's going to fail, which means I'll have to face being found out and sent somewhere.

My current plan is to take enough melatonin and sedatives to knock myself out, then go outside in the snow during the night wearing shorts and a t-shirt and sleep there, and hopefully the subzero cold kills me before I wake up in the morning. Would this be effective?
