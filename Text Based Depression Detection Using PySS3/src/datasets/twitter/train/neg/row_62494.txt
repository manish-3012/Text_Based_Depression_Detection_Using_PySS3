Iâ€™m A Pastor Struggling With Suicidal ThoughtsNot trying to cause fights about religion, just looking for help. I am a pastor and have had depression and suicidal thoughts for many years. Iâ€™m currently 25, and my girlfriend doesnâ€™t understand how someone (especially someone who works for the church) can have these struggles. I donâ€™t know who to talk to about this; I have all the answers in my head to help someone who is contemplating taking their life but I canâ€™t seem to do that for myself.  I push things down and try to make it seem like I have everything together for the sake of those in my congregation, but Iâ€™m a wreck on the inside. I constantly have negative thoughts about myself, my abilities to lead, and about not being good enough for my girlfriend. Just posting here to see if anyone can relate and be a reminder that pastors are humans with flaws just like anyone else.
