"Listen to music" ...makes me hate everything moreWell after the wonderful comments by all of you on my thank you post, here is my first real posting. When people talk about listening to music when depressed I don't think they have my likings in mind. Here are a few examples (Boston Hardcore) Two songs from my favorite band Blood For Blood.

&gt; Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you and fuck society too
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you and fuck the world because
my kind, my kind, my kind belong nowhere
My kind, my kind, my kind are hated and feared
We all started as someone with a chance to make our way
Sometimes the world was cold but we waited for the better days
We watched the years go by and nothing seemed to change
We waited, hoped and prayed as the hard times felt like stinging rain
Well now that hope is gone, somewhere it turned to rage
Hatred, violence, booze and crime,
sometimes it seemed the only way (to get by)
I always knew I'd never make it cause I'm twisted in the brain
But I swear to you all right now that I'll never live like the ones that made me hate
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you and fuck society too
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you and fuck the world because
my kind, my kind, my kind belong nowhere
My kind, my kind, my kind are hated and feared
I know I'm going nowhere and I been on a losin' streak
and a scumbag, zero and anti-hero are all you think of me (and you're right)
I know I'm going nowhere and I been on a losin streak
and lowlife, loser and dead-end cruiser are all you think of me (but I say)
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you and fuck society too
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you and fuck the world because
my kind, my kind, my kind belong nowhere
My kind, my kind, my kind are hated and feared
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you and fuck mankind
My kind, my kind, my kind are hated and feared
Wasted youth, I never had all the chances
Wasted youth, I never had no savin' grace
Wasted youth, yeah I've made a few mistakes
Wasted youth, but how long will I have to pay?
So, some of you were born into happiness and wealth
While some of us were born to a life of hell
And some of us were lost and some of us were found
but most of us were beaten by life to the ground
And maybe I'll never see the day that I win
but I'll always have time for a beer with my friends
We'll fight everybody and the world 'till the end
and if you fuck around with us you'll get your head kicked in!
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you and fuck society too
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you and fuck the world because
my kind, my kind, my kind belong nowhere
My kind, my kind, my kind are hated and feared



Waiting for the Moment
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYt5Ovo5Gkg
&gt; Long lonely nights
My thoughts are a mess
I know what I want but what I want I can't get
Can't tell what day it is sometimes sometimes I sit alone and I cry
And I think off all the things that have gone wrong with me in this life
Grim loneliness and sorrow thrives in me
The seeds of hate have matured at an accelerated rate causing doom to loom
Waiting for the moment I decide it's time to die
Grim loneliness and sorrow thrives in me
The seeds of hate have matured at an accelerated rate causing doom to loom
Waiting for the moment I decide it's time to die
My childhood memories are a pain ingrained in me
To reminisce is to open up old wounds I tried to leave and bury behind
I've lost I've lost too many times
I've failed I've failed in society's eyes
Fuck them fuck them I'll show them as much mercy as this life has shown me
Long lonely nights
My thoughts are a mess
I've known what I want but what I want I couldn't get
Can't tell what day it is sometimes sometimes I sit alone and I cry
And I think of all the things that have gone wrong with me in this life
Grim loneliness and sorrow thrives in me
The seeds of hate have matured at an accelerated rate causing doom to loom
Waiting for the moment I decide it's time to die
Grim loneliness and sorrow thrives in me
The seeds of hate have matured at an accelerated rate causing doom to loom
Waiting for the moment I decide it's time to die
To reminisce is to open up old wounds I tried to leave and bury behind
I try to better myself but the rush and stress of life
seems to have pushed everyone ahead and left me behind
I've lost I've lost too many times
I've failed I've failed in society's eyes
Fuck them fuck them I'll show them as much mercy as this life has shown me
Long painful nights
My thoughts are a mess
My thoughts have become one
I want to end it now
I want to take all those I hate with me on a journey of pain tonight
There won't be any thing you can do about it
cause when I decide it's time it'll be time for all to pay
It's the only way the only way for my conscience and soul to rest at ease
I belong nowhere
Outcast
I belong nowhere
Outsiders



It's songs like that which I listen to. Now you could say it's good to get anger out or knowing people feel like you (to bad 90% of bands like this are drunks or drug users.) but no, it sends me in another direction.
   It usually makes me think something along the lines of "These guys are 30+ and they still feel this way? 19 years without a single break and I have more and more years like this coming, fucking great." and that just starts the whole downward spiral.

I start thinking about High School, how I've been screwed over by both parents countless times, how all the scumbags who sent me to the hospital now are far better than me in life (and don't give me the "what comes around goes around" argument, if that was true Paris Hilton would be dead.) 
It makes me think about how the future will be shit, and since my school pretty much did not teach me basic "future plan structure" (also it's a pretty big sign they let you just slide through when you can only do short division. I never really learned how to do long equations.)

It just feels like some people are born to lose and that's the way it will be.
