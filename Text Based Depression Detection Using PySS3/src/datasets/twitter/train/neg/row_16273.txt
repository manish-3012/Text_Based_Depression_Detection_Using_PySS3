I'm not there yet, but almostI'm almost 30. I've worked really hard on being someone that people want to have around in this world, in their community, at their job, etc. I know I have to work as hard as I can to contribute and to be someone that people want to have around. I've made some progress, but I'm not there yet.

I'm still so alone. I've seen so many other people who have someone to care for them and that they can care for. Someone that they can hold and tell them how much they mean to them. They have the chance to either be there in that person's life or waste that chance and treat their someone like shit. And I've seen plenty of both, but it still seems like I'm never going to have anyone that I can hold or love. I'm never going to have a chance. 

If anyone can help me, please help me.
