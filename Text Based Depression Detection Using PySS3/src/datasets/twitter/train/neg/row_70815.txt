Killing myselfI don't even know why I'm putting it off. Maybe hoping that someone will step in or maybe my brain will decide to help me out, maybe I'm just a coward. But I dont want help, I don't want people to feel bad that they can't help me, I don't want people to feel bad over me in general. I just want to kill myself because I see no point in me being here. All I do is smoke weed and drink alcohol applying for jobs that never even reply to me. I'm tired of being a failure, I'm tired of being useless. I want friends, I want a better life, I want to make my girlfriend happier but what's even the point all I do is make everyone sad and disappointed. Fuck it.
