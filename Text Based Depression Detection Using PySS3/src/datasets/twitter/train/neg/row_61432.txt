I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m doing hereHere I am drunk as a skunk, Iâ€™ve been thinking about hanging myself probably everyday for as long as I can remember. My friends keep trying to help me be happy again but it doesnâ€™t really help. Iâ€™ve been trying to do new things and get some inspiration on life again but nothing ever works. I think the only thing that keeps me going is that I donâ€™t want to hurt anyone when I end it but I just donâ€™t know anymore.

I came across this sub figured I might as well leave my first post. So howâ€™s it going friends. Hope you guys are doing better than me :/
