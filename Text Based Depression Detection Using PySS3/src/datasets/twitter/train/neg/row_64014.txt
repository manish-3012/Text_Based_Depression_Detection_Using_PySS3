I just got out the psych ward and still want to kill myself and I found a fool proof method. But I don't want to go back to the psych ward.I just don't want to go back. And I probably should have stayed because the doctor kinda said it was important to stay and I kinda just lied to get out faster and signed myself out against medical advice. 

I'm worried that I will do it and that it may not be what I actually want to do and there's nothing I can do to reverse being dead once your dead. 

But I don't want to go back to the hospital. 

Is there any alternative that I can say I'm suicidal and not be put in a inpatient psych ward?
