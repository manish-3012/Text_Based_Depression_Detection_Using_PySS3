Happy new year, got to silently cry through this one.I sit here trying to numb the pain while my best friends and girlfriend party while Iâ€™m stuck with a group of strangers Iâ€™ve happened to know my whole life who Iâ€™ve never felt more disconnected.
Iâ€™m not saying Iâ€™m Sucidal but if a drunk where coming straight at me I donâ€™t think I could bring myself to move. Iâ€™m just so fucjing tired of all the shit.
Iâ€™m running away with my best friend after high school but I donâ€™t know if I can make it till then
I feel empty and stuck In the past.
