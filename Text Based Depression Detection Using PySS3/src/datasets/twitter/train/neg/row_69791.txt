Iâ€™m pretty young but donâ€™t see a point in being hereI hate myself, a lot Iâ€™ve failed at killing myself 3 times and no one has found out, I went through counselling and now Iâ€™m just here I donâ€™t know my place Iâ€™m 15m and no one makes my life easy Iâ€™m not put under pressure by anyone but myself and I donâ€™t see a point in life I donâ€™t see the point in being here anymore I want help but I donâ€™t want my problems being put upon someone else, I like to think myself as strong but inside Iâ€™m nothing Iâ€™m weak and I pushed everyone in my life away all I have is one person left and Iâ€™m slowly pushing her away too

No one but her can tell when Iâ€™m depressed everyone thinks Iâ€™m happy Iâ€™m funny and my jokes about death donâ€™t mean anything but  Iâ€™m wanting help without asking but at the same time the professional help did nothing for me I feel lost in the world
