I'm a slaveDistant parents
Lost my fucking 3 year fiance
Lost/became distant with friends
Slave to the military
Introvert, antisocial and impulsive behaviors no one wants to deal with.
Debating taking a rope to my neck and hanging myself in my walk in closet.
Trying to talk to other women but I'm just getting ghosted by everyone when trying to have a casual conversation on dating sites.

Would appreciate if anyone could give me any advice on how to get through this situation because right now my mind is blank and my emotions just feel blank too.
