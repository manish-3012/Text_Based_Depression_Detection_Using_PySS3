I'm feeling really sad. My girlfriend left me and can't get over her.In short, I'm still very much in love with her, and I just need someone to tell me something to help cheer me up by telling me something like a story of how they overcame a heartbreak, or show me a cute picture or video or something. Anything will work. I just need something to keep my mind off of her. Thank you.

Edit: I posted in /r/SuicideWatch rather than /r/Depression because I have considered suicide to end my suffering. But just the sheer thought of that makes me scared.
