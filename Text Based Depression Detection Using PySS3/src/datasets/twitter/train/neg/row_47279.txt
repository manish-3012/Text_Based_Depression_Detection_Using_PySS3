A friend of mine has been having dark thoughts since losing his job some time ago.A friend that I've met through World of Warcraft back in 2005 has been struggling ever since losing his job a few months ago.

He was a shoe sales rep for 10 years (he's 32 now) and suddenly lost his job due to downsizing. It was a great paying job that he was good at. Now, he's in a position where he's trying to find a new sales job, but there's nothing that pays enough to make ends meet. He has been forced to live with his parents as a result and is telling me that he thinks about suicide almost every day because he feels like he has no purpose. He wants to get out sales but it's all he knows. It sounds like he has lost the drive to go back to school to learn something new, or life itself.

I'm very concerned for him. Any suggestions on what I could tell him?
