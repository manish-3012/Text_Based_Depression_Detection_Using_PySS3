i'm glad it didn't go through.i impulsively swallowed my whole full bottle of ativan (40 pills 0.5mg) in hopes to kill myself. i slept for 17 and the small moments I were awake are completely blackouted from my memory but I'm glad it didn't go through.

i don't care about the downvotes for saying this, but if you're suicidal, please reconsider. once you go through with it you realize how big of a mistake you may have made.
