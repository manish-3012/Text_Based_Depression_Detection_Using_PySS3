I honestly believe putting a bullet in my head will kill off evilIâ€™m more than sure everyone left that says they care about me will get over it. Itâ€™s everyone says, things will get better as long as you stay positive. What if the positive thing is to kill myself, considering what Iâ€™ve done and what has gone through my thoughts. I truly do believe I inherited evil from my fathers bloodline. Having a good understanding how my grandfather treated my grandmother and his kids, how my father and his siblings treat each other and even how he treated my mom, my sister and I. Did I overcome it? No, I continued the cycle of abuse on the woman I love, and when I realized I couldnâ€™t undo it, I made myself look like a pathetic worm. My parents will have my sister, who is a much better child, my friends will find new friends and the woman I love will probably be thrilled I got what I deserved for betraying her. Maybe Iâ€™ll finally get to live out my childhood dream of defeating evil. Itâ€™s not like I could keep myself from being corrupted and draw power from it. Iâ€™ve already crossed the line of betrayal, thereâ€™s no coming back from that. I already showed with how much I cried and was terrified of myself that I canâ€™t be strong. So maybe this is strength, showing Iâ€™m willing to defeat evil no matter what. My father couldnâ€™t do it, after cutting up his arms like a damn child to manipulate my mom after betraying her trust again. Iâ€™ve already done it once, so I donâ€™t know how the hell he lived with himself to do it again. So Iâ€™ll be stronger, showing Iâ€™m willing to do what he wonâ€™t, to eliminate the evil from this world. He gave my sister and I a curse, but she overcame it, I didnâ€™t. The only way to honor what I hold dear to my true beliefs that I thank my mom for is to eliminate that evil, so that it canâ€™t continue. Maybe this time heâ€™ll learn what it means to really do what necessary.
