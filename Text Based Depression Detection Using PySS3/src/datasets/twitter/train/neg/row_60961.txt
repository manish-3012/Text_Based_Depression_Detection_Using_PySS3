Iâ€™m never going to get a job and I feel completely miserableIâ€™ve applied to so many jobs and gotten nowhere. I currently have Â£6 in my bank account and canâ€™t pay for anything. I feel so worthless and pointless. I hate these walls, these curtains, my surroundings. I want to die or get out, and i canâ€™t afford to get out so itâ€™s like suicide is my only option. 
I donâ€™t know how to go about it but Iâ€™ll figure it out. Life was never meant for me.
