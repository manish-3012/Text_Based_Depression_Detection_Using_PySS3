Losses donâ€™t waitThe irony of my best friend dying two days after my post of feeling like things were looking up and I was actually happy for once but that for whatever reason I was slipping into a depressive episode. Itâ€™s almost like the universe was preparing me, or trying to warn me, for the fucking devastating loss I was about to endure. I sit here trying to comprehend how the fuck this could happen less then a year after my mom died. What the fuck have I done wrong? I have obviously done something so dreadful, something worthy of the amount of pain, sadness, anger, all these emotions I feel. There is no way that itâ€™s a coincidence that I was finally starting to get better, finally starting to feel happy, and then they decided to rip another thing that was fucking ingrained in my heart. I had to have done something wrong. I donâ€™t know what, but I had to have been deserving of this in some way because itâ€™s just not fair otherwise. 

I canâ€™t take it anymore. I canâ€™t take everything that I love and cherish fucking dying in my life. I have tried to comprehend how tf this could happen, but he was completely healthy 10 minutes before. He was still young. Nothing fucking makes sense. When I was wallowing in despair and secluding myself after my mom died, he was the only one there for me. He would curl up in bed with me, and he experienced and shared that pain along with me because he missed my mom too. How the fuck could this happen? What did he do to deserve to die? What did I do to deserve to lose the two of them? Why was this gapping hole finally starting to heal and now itâ€™s blown open again?!

This has to be the universeâ€™s way of telling me Iâ€™m not deserving of happiness. Call me paranoid, call me being overdramatic, but I literally must be destined for perpetual misery. I just donâ€™t know how much longer I can go on like this, and Iâ€™m terrified of whose going to be ripped away from me next. Iâ€™m so tired.
