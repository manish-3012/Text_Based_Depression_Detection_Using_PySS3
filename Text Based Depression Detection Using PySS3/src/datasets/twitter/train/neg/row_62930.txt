I just keep making it worseIâ€™ve reached out to family and friends, but itâ€™s just pushed them away. Nobody wants anything to do with me. Iâ€™ve been trying to be a better person, but whatâ€™s the point? Iâ€™m never going to be happy. I will never be able to afford to transition. I donâ€™t even make enough money to move out of my parents house. I have pushed away everyone who ever thought I was worth a shit.why would anyone ever love anybody who is such a miserable pile of wasted misanthropic flesh? I wish I could be loved but Iâ€™m wholly undeserving of it. Why would you ever love somebody who makes you miserable? Who only ever complains and bitches and moans? Some people have tried to help me, but Iâ€™ve dashed them upon the broken rocks of my unhappiness and misery. They have all abandoned me. They never reach out any more. They never respond anymore. Iâ€™ve become such a broken person I canâ€™t even make new friends to suck the life out of. They can sense it. I deserve to die alone. My birthday is next month. Nobody is going to celebrate it with me. I need to end it all that day.
And so it goes
