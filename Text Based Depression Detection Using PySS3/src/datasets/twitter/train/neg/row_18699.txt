Suicidal.Thinking about killing myself, especially since I cant afford the medicine or the treatment for my Crohns. Mom wont let me move back to my dad's house a state away. I'm 19 and I know I can leave whenever I want but as I said before I'm chronically ill. Also I cant afford hormones and surgery because I'm FTM and my family is transphobic. I work at mcdonalds and every day is living hell. When I'm not on the toilet with diarrhea I'm in my bed in pain. I only work because I need the money. I feel like a burden. I feel like I have been dead for a while now.
