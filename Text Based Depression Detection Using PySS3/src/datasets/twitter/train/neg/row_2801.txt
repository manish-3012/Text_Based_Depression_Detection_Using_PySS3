I just want it all to end.I cant recall how long it has been like this and I think I have just been giving myself bullshit reasons not to do it. I know that my family loves me and I have no real reason to be sad but It's just to much. I just want to fade away. I cant think of the last time I really appreciated life. I keep telling myself that my family will be sad if I ended my life and I dont want to hurt them so I think thats whats keeping me from dying at the moment. I really have nothing to live for. Im just as useless as that one shirt I never wear. Is it really worth fighting for?
