I'm tiredI'm really, really freaking tired. I'm so sick of living. It's been 4? 5 months? Since I was dumped, out of the blue. He's the one that got me start d going to college, and he told me he was going to help pay for it. And that was really the only promise that he's kept. He basically gave me a bit of money so I could rent a room while I finish my AA. So I go to school. I do workstudy at the college, this pays for others bills. I should be fine right?

Literally what the fuck is wrong with me? I want to run my car off the road or drown in the ocean is something. I've TRIED getting a therapist to talk to, but it'd just be easier to off myself. I've contacted 5 different therapists, 2 responded. 1 didn't take my insurance and the other didn't have an open time slot that would work for me. She literally only had an open time slot the minute I got off of work, and I need to work so I can pay my car insurance and my phone bill. 

I keep thinking that I'll just drive out of state tonight and not come back. Or just finally up and kill myself. Those suicide hotlines don't work either. They always ask about friends and family, and if there's anyone I can talk to, it anything that I can do to cope/distract myself. I don't have nice family, I'm sick of them. I don't have friends, unless you count my ex, and it really doesn't freaking count. I don't have anything that helps me cope, and I'm sick and tired of being distracted. 

I'm sick of all this crap. So why the hell haven't I offed myself already.
