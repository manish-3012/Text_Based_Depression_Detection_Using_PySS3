The girl left me for a guy I used to hang out with and I just can't take. I have no reason not to just end it now.I don't understand...i've been there for her in her darkest times. She gave me a reason to live. But suddenly, when I'm diagnosed with depression and put on Zoloft,  she "can't handle it anymore" i've already written a note and plan on doing it feb. 13th. I just don't know what I can do anymore
