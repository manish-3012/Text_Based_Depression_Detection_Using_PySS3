I want to get off my own rideCan't keep a job. Always start well, then daily crying in the bathroom, then crying in front of customers. For no reason. Then mental break down and never showing up again.

No friends. People are nice to me, but never willing to get close.

Relationships are rollercoasters. I get paranoid. Lash out constantly. Look for evidence that they hate me and are just using me. Who the fuck would love me. 

Financial and emotional leech on parents.

Years of therapy. So many fucking medications. Three hospitalizations. Feeling normal for a few hours before lapsing doesn't seem worth how much time and effort and money it takes to get there. 

I think my brain is just broken. Maybe it could be fixed eventually, but why? I'll still die in the end. Why struggle so much just to delay the inevitable? Why keep hurting people? Why keep wasting resources? Why give people hope that I'll get better, just to dissappoint them again? Why not just make it final? Why not let them grieve and move on instead of this back and forth? Just rip the scab off.
