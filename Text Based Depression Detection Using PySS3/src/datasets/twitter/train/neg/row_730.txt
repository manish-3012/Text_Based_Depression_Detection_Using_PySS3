Iâ€™m tiredIâ€™m really tired of mental illness and struggle and not knowing who I am. Iâ€™m tired of living for everyone else. Iâ€™m tired of being depressed. Iâ€™m tired of being pushed aside. Iâ€™m tired of being invisible. Iâ€™m tired of laying here and wondering when it will get better. Iâ€™m tired of knowing that I canâ€™t be positive no matter how hard I try. The meds only help somewhat. I wanna sleep forever as cliche as that is, I donâ€™t want there to be a heaven or hell. I just want there to be peace in death. I just wanna give up and be in peace.
