i just need to tell this to someonei don't know whom to talk to, i feel so lonely, so i write this here. i thought my suicidal thoughts were over, i knew they would come back, but not so strongly, not so badly. i thought that i finally found a way to live my life in peace, without worrying whether i would survive for another month or not, without worrying about what my family and my friends would  miss me if i took my life, feeling even guiltier. today they came back though, i should have expected it. i can't find a reason to keep living, i feel like everything i do is meaningless. why do we keep living, how is possible that people live so happily, not thinking about death all the time? am i different? do i really belong here? i thought so, but I'm not sure, because if everyone thought like i do, there would not be so many people around.
maybe i'm just saying a bunch of bullshit, maybe. i don't know, i just know that i need help, but maybe i don't want it. i can't even understand what i want.
