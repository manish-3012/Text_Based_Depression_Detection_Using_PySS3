The suffering I have to go through is probably far more than the suffering around suicideI am a new high school freshman who lives in a poor communist country... I don't find pleasure in anything and probably will never be happy in my life at all, going to high school is psychological torture for me and looking back at elementary school it was horrible but it was far, far better... there are too many complications and things that cause misery and me to worry all day, I should probably dropout or suicide

I never feel like getting out of bed in the morning and have extreme anxiety about sleep 

I would do anything rather than have to go to this school for a year, every day I have came back from school I have had to try my HARDEST to not cry my eyes out or self harm to the point where I bleed all over the place

I don't feel like I am mentally capable of understanding math to a high enough level required of me

Every single professor that I have to deal with seems or really deranged or like they are a disgusting monster

I don't even understand what "group" I belong to, it ignorantly hasn't been told to me so I don't know which rooms to go to at the times that I should

There is no hope... it is absolutely absurd, unreasonable and just plain INSANE to think that I can do something as obscenely, unbelievably and unbearably difficult as go through one year of this high school properly

I can't even FATHOM the suffering I will have to go through when it gets harder

I don't even know what to say anymore or how to describe what I have to go through
