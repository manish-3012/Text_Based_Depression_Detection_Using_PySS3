Not suicidal, but I need help from someoneI'm basically having a panic attack right now.  I'm 2 weeks into freshman year of college, and I can totally see why college suicide rates are as they are.  My grandpa died a week before I started, so the last month of my summer was spent driving back and forth to his house (3 hours each way), going to the hospital to see him, dealing with family, and generally being stressed as fuck.  His funeral was on a Tuesday, and I moved in that Thursday.  I'm not making any real friends, I feel almost entirely alone (I have the volleyball team, but I'm still making friends there, and we're a club team, so we only practice 3 days a week.  I don't know where else to turn.  I'm gonna call the counseling office in the morning, but they're probably closed until Tuesday, and I'm not sure I'll be able to sleep in the meantime.  I'm supposed to be figuring out what the hell to do with my life.  I have these grand thoughts about society, and what I can do to help people, and how I can make my life about various things, but none of this shit fits into what society wants me to do, and I just don't know what I'm going to do for the rest of my life.  Society as it is is an unnatural concept.  

What the hell do I do in the meantime before I can manage to talk to a person with a psychology degree or 5?
