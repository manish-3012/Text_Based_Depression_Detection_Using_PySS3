I am contemplating killing myself right now.I donâ€™t know. I donâ€™t want to, yet I do. I donâ€™t understand it. I do not feel loved - I have no real friends anymore. I begged my boyfriend to stay tonight but he didnâ€™t care, he was too tired to stay. When he left I said I was suicidal and he didnâ€™t care. I used to have several friends who loved me, theyâ€™re gone. I used to picture a future to live for but I canâ€™t anymore, how can I have a happy family when I am unlovable? How can I be successful when Iâ€™ve been losing my physical health and cognitive abilities. I tried to get health for both my physical health as well as mental health but have repeatedly been turned away. I feel nearing the end and donâ€™t know what to do. I am confused and very alone.
