Help...I feel that I'm too young to want to die, and yet, here I am; considering the "easy way out" of my troubles. I'm a young mother. And the life that I have given my son isn't good enough for him.. I wonder if ridding myself from his life would be best. He is too happy of a child to have the crappy life that I'm giving him. I need help financially, but I have to jump through so many holes with state assistance that it makes me feel like scum of the earth. I need more than talk.. I need someone to cry to that isn't paid to tell me that everything is okay. It's not.. I'm not.. It's not me that needs it, it's my son that needs me to have help... I just don't want to lose him because of this..
