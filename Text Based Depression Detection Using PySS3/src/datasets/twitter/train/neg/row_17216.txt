So I'm going to be homeless as of Feb 1stUnless I get hired by somebody soon. I've applied to 30 places, all minimum wage no experience required jobs and not a single one has called me back. If I don't get a job I'm fucked.

And my relationship with my girlfriend is completely fucked. She's the only person who has ever given a fuck about me and I've ruined that. I have no friends. I have no family.

I fucked up and threw out my gun. I was going to start killing people but I calmed myself out of it. But now I don't know how I'm gonna kill myself. I wish someone would just fucking kill me and end my miserable life.
