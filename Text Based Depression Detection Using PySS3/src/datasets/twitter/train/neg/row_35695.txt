Out of things to cling upon.I'm 25, male. I'm done for it. I mean I've thought about suicide for a long time already, even tried when I was younger. But as I look at it now, it was just for mere attention. Now I'm serious about it. I want to hear some arguments either it's plausible to commit suicide to "help oneself" or it's better to struggle with life in an attempt to fight for your ideals.
