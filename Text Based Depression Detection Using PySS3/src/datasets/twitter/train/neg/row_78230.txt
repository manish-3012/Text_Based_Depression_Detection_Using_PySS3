I donâ€™t know if I want to dieI guess what Iâ€™m trying to say is that I donâ€™t know if I should kill myself or not. If I had the choice Iâ€™d rather just get away from everything for a month or so and just be alone with myself and no one else. That way I wonâ€™t disappoint anyone anymore and I can finally get some peace in my life. Maybe one day something along these lines will happen.
