Iâ€™m not saying Iâ€™m planning on doing it but Iâ€™m pretty close?It just seems like everyone in my life is leaving or changing? Iâ€™m getting excluded more and more, all I really care about rn are drugs but Iâ€™ve been sober for a while cause I donâ€™t care. I just think things would be better without me. Iâ€™m not even bothered by anything tbh, Iâ€™m just disassociating more and more which leaves me feeling weird? My rational is that if Iâ€™m not doing anything productive might as well dip? Life has been purgatory since May and Iâ€™m getting bored. I donâ€™t even have any friends to do drugs with anymore. I have my cat though and heâ€™s really good. I love him a lot. Very good boy.
