Do some people actually kill themselves on here?I was going about my normal lurking when I came across a redditor called prozac_is_crap. He spent a lot of time on SW and now hasn't posted for two months, his last post being about ending it all. I wonder if it was a throw away account or if some people really go through with it on here. Either way... depressing.
