I could use some advice on how to avoid these thoughts!I have been having suicidal thoughts more often lately, such as "If I walk in front of that truck things will go away!". I don't act on them it has been becoming harder and harder to not listen to the voice in my mind that tells me to do these things or suggests them to me any way. Any advice on how to stop those thoughts? I really dont want to have them any more and I am not sure how to stop them. Please Help!
