HelpPlease I just need someone to talk to... I dont know what to do anymore. 

My parents dont think I'll make it when I leave the house they think I'm a failure that cant support itself. They're desperate, they dont know what to do. How do I tell them that that's not true, when I know that once I live on my own I'll killmysef? How can I lie like that in their faces? 

I've been planning to kill myself when I leave home for 5 years. I just turned 17. I dont want to make them sad, or upset them. They keep telling me that all I do is just lay in bed, I dont help with the house work at all. How can I tell I'm just too focused on being alive, for THEM? You cant tell a parent that. 

I've told my doctor that the antidepressants dont work, he doesn't really seem to care. I mean I didn't even talk that much on the first appointment and he prescribed me antidepressants right away. How did he know I actually had depression? I could be faking it for drugs. I've told him that the antidepressants only make me worse multiple times. He told me that I have to give it some time, but I've given it a LOT of time. 

I asked my parents to change doctors, and after a while they said yes, but they havent made any move towards taking me to a new psychiatrist. I dont know why but I'm afraid to tell them again. I just want to end this but I keep trying, for them. And they dont even appreciate the effort I'm making. It's just too hard. I dont wanna do this anymore. I'll never be happy, I can't even remember what happiness feels like. Was I even happy?
