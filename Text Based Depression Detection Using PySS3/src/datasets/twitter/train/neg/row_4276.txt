Ideation becoming more frequent.The last 12 months have been real shitshow. I got out of a long term relationship(5years) and attempted suicide twice, lost my friends because of things I said to my ex in anger and pain and moved out of state on a whim and partially because I lost my job. In said new state I had trouble finding a job. The feeling of emptiness and loneliness comes and goes but every time it comes back it comes back worse. The person I used to talk to about these feelings is no longer there assuaging my dark thoughts she more or less admitted she agreed with how I saw myself and thats what caused the relationship to crumble she couldnt take the black cloud that I was on her life. I finally got a job my depression has been weak but it hit me hard today and ive been going through suicidal ideation nonstop. I dont like feeling like this I just dont want to anymore. Im alone running this life into the ground now and i feel helpless but at least im 2500 miles from my family so it wont hurt them that bad if I do decide to act.
