I found out my wife has a lover and wants to leave me. Now she won't talk to me, but she's not leaving either.I can't even start to at how fucked up this is. I knew she was seeing him, but I didn't know how she felt until I checked her texts the other day and found a lot of things I wish she never said. I wish she would just make up her mind. It's maddening torture.
