Deep thoughts ðŸ’­How come my parents donâ€™t care about me and want me kicked out of the house because I came off my PC 20 minutes late? I had gone for 5 hours once and they didnâ€™t call the police or try to find me. Are they really my parents or are they just random people? Do people really care if I die? I have no social skills and Iâ€™ve lost most of my friends. Do I exist in peopleâ€™s minds? If I do die how do I do it? They say it will make people sad if I died? But how will they know that I died if I donâ€™t exist? What is the meaning of humanity? Who am I? Why was I born? My hair is already going white at the age of 15.
