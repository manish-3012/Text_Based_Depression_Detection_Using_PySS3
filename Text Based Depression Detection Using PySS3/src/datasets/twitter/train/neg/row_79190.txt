need someone to talk toi've been thinking about suicide for a long time (since i was grade 5 and i'm now a freshie at the state university) i never understood if it was because of emotions or if there was something wrong with me. now, ive been going through a lot of stress and these thoughts that used to come up every once in a while have been coming up every week. i wanna know if theres anyone here i can talk to. im starting to run out of reasons to keep on going
