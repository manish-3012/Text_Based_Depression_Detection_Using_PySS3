Life is a messMy family seems happy, parents still married and in love after 40 years, little brother and sister bother happily married with families of their own and they all have good jobs, a comfortable life etc.

My life on the other hand, is a complete mess, depression and bpd crippled me for years. At 14 I remember asking my mom why i felt sad all the time and felt like dying. I think of suicide often since then (im in my 30s now). I dont have a job at the moment or hard to hold on jobs because some days i just cannot function. I hurt my friends with my erratic behavior. I look at my siblings and wonder if i would be in a good place just like them if i didnt have depression. Im so glad my family dont show any signs of mental illness unlike me.

Im giving my 8 year old dog to the shelter in 2 weeks, because i cant afford my rent anymore and have to move to my parents, my boyfriend will probably leave me because he wants to travel around the world and i cannot afford to follow him.

After i give my dog to the shelter i plan to kill myself but make it look like an accident so i dont hurt my family too much. Im an organ donor so some other people who really do want to live will benefit from my death.

I hate myself. I hate that i didnt know about my mental illness until too late and how i let it destroy me. I hate that i cant give the people i love the best and make them happy. I hate that i have to give my dog away but he deserves a better life than having to deal with a shit owner who cant get her life together.
