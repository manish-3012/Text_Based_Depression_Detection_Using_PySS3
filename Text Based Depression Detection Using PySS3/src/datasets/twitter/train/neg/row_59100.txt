Why do I feel like thisIâ€™m so fuck tired of feeling numb Iâ€™m tired of having no emotions Iâ€™m tired of fighting for the will to live when all I do is fuck up every single fucking day. I was just told told by someone very close to me that they should have let me kill my self. And I starting to think they are right. I feel empty but I have thing to be happy about but Iâ€™m to empty to be happy. I feel like no amount of meds or therapy could help.
