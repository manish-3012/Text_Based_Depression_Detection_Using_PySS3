I tried my bestI really did. I did everything that I could. It's too much to bear, you know? I just feel like it's my time. My turn to give up all hope and go through with it. I've tried a couple times, but stopped by some random chance, some unwanted miracle. But here, in this room on this date, I think it's time for me to pass. I know I'll be hurting others, but I can't take the pain anymore. I'm sorry
