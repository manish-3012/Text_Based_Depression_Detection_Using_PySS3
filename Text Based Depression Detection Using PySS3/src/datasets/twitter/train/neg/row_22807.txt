extremely guilty after mentioning suicide attempt?I've had problems on and off with suicidal idealizations. I went to the hospital this week and they tried to keep me, and honestly, I should've let them, but I didn't! now I'm getting off prozac, which made things way worse

I've had a friend who has helped me through a lot. he and I have a support system for each other - I keep him from doing something stupid, he keeps me from doing something stupid.

I had a cord and I choked myself with it a few times, just to see how it felt. it scared me, but drew me in even more. I didn't go very far because I called someone to distract myself. I wanted to hang myself, and in the moment, nothing else made sense. for some reason, that's my ideal way to go. I was planning for it but wussed out.

next day while talking to him, I told him, "last night I came closer to killing myself than I ever have." 

so fucking stupid, I don't know why I said it, and it obviously fucked him up. 

now I feel so guilty and I never should've said anything. I can't apologize enough to him, ever. I'm so ridiculously selfish. I want to stay away from him now because I do nothing but worry him and hurt him. 

maybe all of this is just for attention.

I don't know how I can ever forgive myself. I guess I need advice, and that's why I'm posting this.
