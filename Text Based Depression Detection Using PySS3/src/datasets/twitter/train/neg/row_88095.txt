Im a failure.Im a failure. I cant do anything right, im obese, unemployed, i got no friends or family and no end in sight. Im failing life since my birth, almost 31 years, and i just cant stand it anymore. There is no good thing in this world and i want to end my life and my suffering but i cant even do that. People got it way worse than me i dont know why im so weak. I want to end it so bad but im afraid that i fail that too like i failed everything else and just end up being more of a burden than i already am.
