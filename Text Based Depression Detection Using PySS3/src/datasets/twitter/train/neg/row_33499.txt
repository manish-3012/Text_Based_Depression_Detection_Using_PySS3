About suicideI have been looking for texts on reddit, hoping people here would be more liberal and give advices that could help me too.

I had it right until I made a bad decision. The price was very high for me and it broke me, it changed me.

Everything after that felt like... Have you ever finished a open world game? After beating all the main missions youâ€™re left wandering the world, doing stupid side quests. Sorry for the reference, iâ€™m 21. But thatâ€™s the feeling.

I already know how to do it. 
I just need the courage.
