A little positivitySo many people posting lately but I get it. This world is fucked and the holiday season doesnâ€™t make it any easier but STOP and realize you can be the positivity in it. Make the effort, pull yourself out of this, talk to a friend, talk a professional or share your thoughts and personal experiences here, it can help someone else and truly make a difference. All it takes is one positive thought. You were brought into this world for a reason. I have been on this sub for the past few weeks feeling the same way but one comment turned it around for me. There is something in all of our lives that is positive, even if itâ€™s a small thing. We will be ok, our lives mean something. We stand together.
