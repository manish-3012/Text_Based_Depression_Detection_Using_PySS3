Iâ€™m tired of being ok with things Iâ€™m not ok with
Itâ€™s almost been 2 years since Iâ€™ve realized that people who are around me are only there when they need me and after I helped them they will throw me in the scraps. Iâ€™ve always been the type of person who wholeheartedly help people when they need something but everyday no one made me feel like Iâ€™m relevant. Everyday is a survival game that I play. I play by their rules and Iâ€™m their disposable character. Each day is a challenge to get by and Iâ€™m always by myself. No one made me feel important or even give me a single sense of compassion. Iâ€™ve always wonder how did I survived all these years. 

The only control that I have in my life is my own death and yes, everyday I always think of how I can kill myself quietly and not in a painful way because thatâ€™s maybe the only time that Iâ€™m not gonna feel any pain.

Iâ€™m exhausted of loving, caring ang giving too much to the world that only gives me misery and agony. My mind is being tortured everyday and I ask myself why me? Why do I have to experience these things at the age of 17? For every single day of my life I was hoping that things will get better in time that soon Iâ€™ll be happy but thatâ€™s just a false hope, nothings changed even if I try harder. 

I gave up everything for the happiness of my parents, friends(?), and everyone. My dreams were always decided by my parents, in an instant it was decided that Iâ€™m gonna be an engineer, all those  plans and dreams melted away. These people had never been kind to me and have always invalidated what I feel because they selfishly use me as their investment in life. Why do I have to do thibgs for other people? When can i do a single thing that will make me happy?

Nothing keeps me sane anymore. I just want my suffering to end. One of these days, Iâ€™m gonna snapped and kill myself hahahha.

I hope that everyone who is reading this is ok :).
