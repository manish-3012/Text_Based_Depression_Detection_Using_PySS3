Iâ€™m scaredIâ€™m sorry I donâ€™t know what this I got so drunk in hopes it would make me feel better but instead itâ€™s made me too brave.

Iâ€™m so scared Iâ€™ve been putting it off for months and months. Iâ€™ve lost 2 pregnancies  and my relationship didnâ€™t survive  that and Iâ€™m so upset and so lonely. The one person I thought would be there isnâ€™t. I feel like I failure as a Mum and Iâ€™ve lost everything in such a short amount of time.Iâ€™ve nearly given so many times but I keep getting too afraid because I want to think itâ€™s going to get better but itâ€™s worse. The medication and the therapy hasnâ€™t been successful. I donâ€™t know what this is going to achieve but I want someone to know how hard itâ€™s been. Itâ€™s so difficult  grieving over people youâ€™ll never get to meet and my ex partner is seemingly fine with it makes me feel like thereâ€™s something wrong with me.
