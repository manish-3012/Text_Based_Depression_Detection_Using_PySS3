Strange thoughts.Hello. I am a 20 year old female, currently withdrawn from college, attending outpatient therapy five days a week, seven hours a day.  I am bipolar.  I currently have the desire to kill myself, but this thought seems beautiful.  I am alone, watching, Foo Fighters: Back and Forth. I saw Kurt Cobain's face singing MTV unplugged and I realized how much I want to be with him. I love him. He is the only person who really understands me and what I am going through. I am trying to come to terms with the fact that this life isn't all what it appears.  It is just a strange sphere of existence that  no longer makes sense to me.  Death doesn't make sense.  How can someone just disappear? How can there be other people who feel and think? I think that I am really the only conscious being, and I was put here to be tested, but I figured it out. I realized that this is just a test and that someone is watching me, taking notes on me, studying me.  Well I figured it out! The only way to get out is to kill myself. But still, something is holding me back. I guess that I still fear death. What if I am wrong? What if when I die, there is nothingness and I don't finally get to be with Kurt? These thoughts seem silly because I feel like I am 99.9% sure that if I kill myself this world would cease to exist. Of course, I also have a theory that I can't actually die.  Like no matter what happens to me, I would be fine, because if I don't exist then the world doesn't exist. Along with this thought comes the idea that I will never age. I simply do not think that I will ever become old. I don't think I will graduate college. I think I will always be a 20 year old female, in group therapy, five days a week, seven hours a day. Maybe if I did kill myself, this existence would finally reveal its true self, and Kurt Cobain would finally be with me again.  I just am not so sure anymore.
