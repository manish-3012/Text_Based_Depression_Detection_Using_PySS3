I just feel trapped.Iâ€™ve got nothing going for me. No goals, no aspirations, no interests other than playing video games like a degenerate. Even thatâ€™s not the same anymore. 

All my friends are going to college and doing something with their lives and Iâ€™m stuck sitting here. I donâ€™t know what I want to do. Even if I did I canâ€™t afford it. 

I think about ending it all the time but I just canâ€™t.  My mom and sisters would be devastated. My friends would be devastated as well. And I canâ€™t in good conscience put the people I care about through that sort of pain. So here I am. Trapped. 

Even if, god forbid, I outlive them all, I still donâ€™t think I would be able to end it. The fear of failing and being stuck in a vegetative state is enough for me to continue on. 

I canâ€™t see a therapist because thereâ€™s no way in hell Iâ€™d trust one. Thanks high school English class for making us read â€œOne Flew Over the Cuckoos Nestâ€ and making me develop a crippling fear of involuntary hospitalization! I also canâ€™t afford a therapist so thereâ€™s that too lmao. 

So Iâ€™m trapped here waiting for the inevitable, hoping that some space debris will come and fly through my head and kill me instantly. Thatâ€™d be the day. 

I donâ€™t know if this is the right sub to post this on because Iâ€™m not on the verge of suicide, Iâ€™m just ranting. Maybe r/depression but I donâ€™t know. I surprisingly feel a bit better after writing this so I may start a journal or something to keep my mind occupied at least for a few minutes.
