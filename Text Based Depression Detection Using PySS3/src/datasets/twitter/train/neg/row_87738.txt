There's this overpass I drive by on my way home from work and I want to drive over itFriday when I was driving home, I physically felt my arms turn the wheel to the right towards the ledge of the overpass and took my foot off the brakes. All weekend, I've been thinking about that overpass and imagining in great detail what it would feel like to fly over the guardrail and I've got to say, it feels invigorating. I feel adrenaline coursing through me even now, it feels like I'm at a point where my gas tank for life is finally on E and whatever inhibitions I've held onto, any reservations I've entertained for the last 4 years, are finally dying out and it's just me and impulse that are in the arena. 

It's crazy, I can envision my car flying and I don't feel sad for the family I'd be leaving behind, or my friends. The future that I won't get to live to see, nor for any influences I could possibly have on the world, none of that matters to me enough. Some people are NOT MEANT TO LIVE A FULL LIFE and I believe I am one of them. I'm tired of fighting to care or give a shit about experiencing this world and this life. It offers me nothing useful yet takes everything and I'm tired of playing by someone else's rules. 

If I don't post after tomorrow, or the next day even, I guess that's it. I already have my letters written, another "fuck you" letter that I wrote specifically to the world I'll never meet....and the rest, I couldn't give less of a shit for. And to all those who provide false hopes to those in distress, fuck you the most. You know nothing more than the rest of us and are as in denial as everyone is.
