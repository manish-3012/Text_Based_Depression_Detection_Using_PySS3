I'm just waiting.Waiting for my best friend to come and dogsit for her dad. I was supposed to, I panicked and freaked out. I've lost trust, I've pissed people off, I've disrupted schedules. But when I get back to my house, I'm going to do it. I'm finally going to do the one thing I've fantasized about for years. Something I've attempted, but not succeeded at. 


I'm choosing a death by overdose. I have spare sertraline (100mg) and I'm going to wash that down with a bottle of wine that's been living in my house longer than I have. 

This is it. My Reddit suicide note.

If anyone recognises my username from other places, please don't try to help me. I don't want to be helped. I just want to slip away from this mortal coil.

Goodbye, Reddit. Learn from my mistakes.
