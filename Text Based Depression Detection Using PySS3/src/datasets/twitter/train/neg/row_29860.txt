Help controlling intrusive thoughtsI've been having interrupting thoughts about suicide and they're ruining my day-to-day functioning, by a lot.Before I felt like I could manage it. I could go into autopilot and put these thoughts at the back of my mind. Self-harm usually helped with controlling them.

 Now, it feels like they won't go away. Sh hasn't been helping. I've stopped feeling any release from it. I've tried self care, getting a nice shower, eating a good meal, spending time with family, watching wholesome videos, try to be nice to people, etc. Anything that is recommended. Anything positive that would jerk me awake that I don't to think this way. Nothing's been helping. I feel alone as ever. The hollowing feeling of being utterly alone and having no one who would care is eating me up from the inside. I don't know what to do to help with this.

And it's so constant. I would be doing something normal and these thoughts would take over me and I'd be left thinking of my death in the worst ways. I want to get these thoughts under control. I don't want anyone to know that there's anything wrong. It would create drama that I don;t want. I also want to put these thoughts on the backburner for a while. Because they take away any motivation or any physical strength that I have left. I feel emotionally and physically drained. 

I know it's pathetic. I'm sorry for the person who has to read through this pitiful post. I'm sorry that you had to put up with this.
