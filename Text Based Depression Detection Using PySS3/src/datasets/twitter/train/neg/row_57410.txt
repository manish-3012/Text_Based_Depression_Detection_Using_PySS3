Comforted by the thought of suicide?I saw another post about this by another user, and I related so much to it. Whenever shit hits the fan in my life, I always remind myself that I can commit suicide, and that comforts me. Wtf is wrong with me? Like if I do even the smallest thing wrong, I'll be like "It's okay, you can die if you want to" like wtf?
