I really want to kill myself but I don't have the courage to do it.My life is fucking meaningless. I have no real relationship with anyone and nobody to open up to. Nobody cares enough to help me and any time I try to open up people shrug me off because of course it's impossible for a kid like me to have depression or suicidal thoughts

I was just in a zoom call for school (mic and camera off) and then I had a mental breakdown and that's when I realized how shitty my life really is and that there's no hope. I go to bed empty and meaningless and I wake up with no motivation for the day, feeling empty and meaningless, and nothing is changing. I really wanna kill myself but I don't have the guts. 

God I just wanna die.
