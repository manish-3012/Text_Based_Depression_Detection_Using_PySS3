Lost everything, stuck in a dump, constant nagging thoughts of suicide.Hi, i'm a 23 year old and I really need to reach out before I do something stupid and hurt my family. This time last year I was so on top, felt so good about myself. Since then i've lost my girlfriend after a really horrible breakup, lost my job as a result of the depression from the breakup and drug use, and now I'm stuck mid lease with no money, no motivation and a bunch of people using my house as a weed smoking/dealing chill shack (let my mate/dealer move in to pay the rent, i've since gotten off the drugs to try and improve things, but still watch others take them every day)... I feel so stuck and can't see any light at the end of the tunnel. I live in a small town and work is scarce, especially in telecommunications apart from the telco I was fired from. I've spent a month hoping these feelings are just part of the comedown from smoking weed every day, but I think it's more than that. I don't even really have a question I just needed to tell someone how i'm feeling.. every night I fall asleep hoping not to wake up the next day (i'm sure alot of you know this feeling) and today i sat in bed playing with a razor blade and the idea of suicide. I see no future in myself and feel like i've lost my manhood, the girl i loved (even though it was never going to work out), and i sit here bored every day on the internet doing fuck all.. with no motivation.. watching my data usage bill go up and up but it's the only thing keeping me kind of sane. tldr lost girlfriend, lost job, let dealer move into house, completely headfucked. anyone that can relate? had a similar situation? i dont know.. thx for reading
