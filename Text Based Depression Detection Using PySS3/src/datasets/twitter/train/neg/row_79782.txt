I never really got how "you are not alone" was meant to make anyone feel betterThere are 126k people in this subreddit, a small city's worth of suicidal people suffering from a billion different things. 

How is the fact that so many people are living in a constant state of emotional and/or physical pain supposed to make me feel any better, it just makes the entire world seem like a pointless hell that exist only so we can suffer then die.

That isn't motivational that's fucking hprrifying.
