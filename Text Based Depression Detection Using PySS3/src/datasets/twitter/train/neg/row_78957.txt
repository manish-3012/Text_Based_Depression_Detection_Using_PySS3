I'm so tiredLife's so terrible. Why must it be this way? Everytime I'm succeeding at anything that matters to me it all falls apart. I fuck everything up. I fucked up my marriage, I fucked up my other relationshils, I fuck up my friendships, I fuck everything up. I'm worthless. I'm a worthless piece of shit, is what I am.

I'm tired of living like this. I want to end everything so bad. I hate myself. I hate being me. I hate doing the shit I do and I wish I could just put a bullet to my head already. I can't get anything right, nobody will ever love me and I deserve to die alone.
