I want to kill myself because of my eating disorderIâ€™m bulimic and every day is misery. Iâ€™ve been dealing with this illness for 10 years. It has especially gotten bad this past year. I binge and purge up to 5 times a day. My body is weak and sore all the time. I just want to be at peace. I donâ€™t want to be ruled by this disorder anymore.
