Why is it that I want to die, and I'm in no rush to do it?I'm divorced and hanging on by a thread. I lack motivation in nearly every aspect of my life, and I don't feel like fixing it. Simple things seem to set me off the deep end, most times it's just anger and I can't get a hold on it. I'm holding on to two things.. I have a dog that needs me, and an ex that I want the best for. I don't feel a need to continue my struggle when those factors have taken care of themselves. It's sad and I know it, but I can't find the will. I just don't want to be in this world. I would slip off like a sick cat and no one would be any wiser to where I've gone, and that sounds really good to me.
