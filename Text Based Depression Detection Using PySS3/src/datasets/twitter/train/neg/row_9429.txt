My dark passengerI just want to be ok. I wake up every morning disappointed I woke up. I spend most days in bed knowing that to continue on my day with a fake smile is a lie and it hurts. Within the past week I've heard numerous times how people love my optimism yet I can never tell them I don't mean it. I just say the things that need to be said so people leave me alone. I find comfort in solitude, yet it's also when I'm the saddest. I just want a break or for something to show me to keep going it'll pay off real soon. I just want to be alone, to be forgotten so I can disappear without hurting anyone's feelings. I just want to cry. I just want a hug telling me I'll be ok. I just want my friend to comeback from heaven to give me advice like he use to. I just want my story to end.
