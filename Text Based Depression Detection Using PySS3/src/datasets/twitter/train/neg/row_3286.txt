Not really sure what to do.I just feel tired all the time now. I don't feel like talking to any of my friends anymore. And deep down, I know I don't want to die, and I don't want anyone to be hurt by my death, but life hasn't gotten better, and it never has, and I don't know if it ever will. I don't have enough motivation to do anything or really get out of bed. I'm fine with that, personally, because it's the most comfortable ways to spend my last days, but it feels like every day is wasted until I finally work up the nerve to end it, and that's it.
