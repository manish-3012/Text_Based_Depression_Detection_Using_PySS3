If you have a major depression, and your family and friends talk and act like nothing is going on?Hii, I am 27 and I have  major depressions. My family always acts like they don't see anything, and nothing is wrong. Problems  do not exist. When I am with my parents and certainly when we visit my grandparents, I always have a really akward feeling.  Like I am not suppose to be there. They always look through me, and even if I am quiet or I look sad, they don't say anything, they don't even ask how I am or what I am doing, they don't know anything about me. Always talking about things or people that I don't know anything about.  Feels like I am invisible, as if I am not a part of them, a stranger.  From the inside, I am dying  
Does anyone have the same experience and feelings?
