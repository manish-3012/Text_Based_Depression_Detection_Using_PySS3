Contemplating driving to buy a gun tomorrowI've had suicidal thoughts since I was 13 but now I'm done. I just got back from 5 months in a different country, had a baby with my girlfriend before I left. She's wanted nothing to do with me since I've been down here with her. Completely cold and doesn't speak to me unless spoken to. On top of all this I have lymphoma, $15,000 in medical bills that I can't pay because I'm in college and can't work, and really want a bullet in my fucking brain. I don't want my daughter to grow up without a father but I can't do this anymore.
