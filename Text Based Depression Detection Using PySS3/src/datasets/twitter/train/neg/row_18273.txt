Always being ignoredI've been told that it's my fault my life is like this because I don't "involve myself in anything" or "I never try" or "I'm young and things will get better". But i HAVE involved myself in things, I was never a social person and I've been like that my whole life so I never fit in anywhere. Ive tried multiple meds, didn't have any highs, just side effects. I asked my old therapist if i could get pain meds and she said no, she just wanted to give me generic meds like zoloft. So yes i have actually tried, nobody listens or wants to give me what i want. Its always the same fucking responses over and over. Ive reached out to sooo many people and even on here i have been ignored. Nobody values me and nobody cares about me at all. I'm almost 100% sure I could walk out to a pier or something and sit there all day and nobody would ask me what i was doing or talk to me at all. Literally.. whats even stopping me from tying something heavy to my ankles and drowning myself?


If people on here found out i ended my life they'd just say the same shit like "oh she was so young thats so sad" or some generic ass responses like that. Ive gone out of my way many times before to try and help people (mostly suicidal/depressed people) but nobody ever shows that back. I get left on read or I get told "Thats rough good luck". This is my life, a lot of people on here cant even relate cause y'all have family members and friends that care about you and would miss you if you were gone. That must be really nice, too bad i'll never know what that's like. I had highly considered buying fentanyl online and i posted about this in a different suicide forum thats more "pro suicide" then this one, and they basically told what i already thought. Im completely on my own and it sucks.
