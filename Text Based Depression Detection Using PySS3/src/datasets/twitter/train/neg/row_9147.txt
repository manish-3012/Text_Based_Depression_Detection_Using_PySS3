Here we go again.So...a while ago I was planning to do away with myself but realised at the last moment that my plan was not particularly certain to succeed and could potentially hurt other people.

Now I have a better plan and a perfect opportunity to put it in to action will present itself next week. It will look like an accident and my family will be saved from ruin. 

I don't know why I'm posting here. Just scared and sad, I guess, need to vent.  

Anyway. That was all.
