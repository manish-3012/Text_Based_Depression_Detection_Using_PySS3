[Short] Don't wanna commit suicide but wish to die? (e.g. accident)Has anybody else got this feeling?
Like I don't want to commit suicide, too many people depending on me so I'm afraid.
The people I love care about me (my SO, my little brother who looks up to me and my family which is proud of me)...but I feel empty inside.

Everyday I commute to work I wish I would die in an car accident, or maybe I can save someone from a burning house and die in the process. There also will be grief, but it's diffrent If I die that way.

Maybe my day finally comes and I can leave this already empty shell and can stop faking smiles and fake interest at these hypocritical happy-BBQ-parties.
