After the Act...My corpse will be taken to the morgue for autopsy but then It should go straight to the crematorium and be cremated as quickly as possible then I want my ashes to be flushed down the toilet.

I donâ€™t want a casket, I donâ€™t want to be embalmed, waked or viewed, I donâ€™t want a religious service, I donâ€™t want to be buried or my ashes interred. I refuse to permit you a chance to mourn, grieve or receive sympathies. i refuse you all the opportunity to pretend you actually knew me, to blame drugs (toxicology will be clear), to blame mental illness / you never believed me anyway. That is my choice as this is. My ex will cover the minimal costs involved in return for having half the mortgage cleared. Our last barter as it were.

You all played your role to get me this far but now Iâ€™m taking control.
