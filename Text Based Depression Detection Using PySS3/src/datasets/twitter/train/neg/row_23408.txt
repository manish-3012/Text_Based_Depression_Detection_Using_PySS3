kinda just rantinghonestly, i'm not even sure where i should start with this post because my feelings are all tangled and a giant mess right now. a bit ago, i was totally sent off the edge; i pulled a lot of my hair out, cut, and hit myself until i got bruises. it's taking a lot out of me to not just go get a belt or something and hang myself.

it's just like everything has been building up and exploded all at once. i haven't been paying attention in class, haven't been doing homework (which i now can't do because i cant understand anything of it), haven't been taking care of myself or my guinea pigs (7). it's all been way too much for me. especially the seven guinea pigs are a lot of work and i feel like i'm losing grasp of what little control i have, it's never ending responsibilities that i can't keep up with. it's gotten to the point where i'm not safe and i don't feel they're safe either. i dug a hole i cant get myself out of for school, if i don't kill the pigs i'll kill myself, and if i don't kill myself i'll end up insane. i outright told my mom we had to rehome them, it's too much for me and if they stay here, i will end up killing them even though i don't want to. but no matter how much i say it she doesn't want to accept the fact that something's wrong with her last daughter

i guess i just wanted to rant because i don't have anyone to talk to. i don't think i'll last more than a few more days.
