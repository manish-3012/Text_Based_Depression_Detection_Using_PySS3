BlehThings feel as bad as they ever have. The days just melt into each other and theyâ€™re wasted over and over again. I canâ€™t do anything productive to save my life and the motions I go through every day weigh heavier and heavier. I donâ€™t want to go yet, but this isnâ€™t the life I want to live. This isnâ€™t where I ever saw myself. Living hurts right now.
