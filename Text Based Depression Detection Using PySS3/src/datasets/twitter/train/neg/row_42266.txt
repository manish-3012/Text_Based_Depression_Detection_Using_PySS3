It won't stopCan't get her out of my head the lies and deciet are just too much to take and like a dumb ass I still love her. She was my world I bet EVERYTHING on her and I just get nothing in return. And I've posted on here and I've cried out for help from anyone and yes there have been responses from people and I appreciate that. But it's not that easy for me to just be ok there's to much still in my heart. And fuck it's killing me too and I can only see one way to end this shit I call life.
