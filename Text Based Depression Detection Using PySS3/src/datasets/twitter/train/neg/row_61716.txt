I'm too sensitive. And i can't do anything right and I want to dieI already wasn't happy. My life took a turn for the worse in the may e year or so following my last failed suicide attempt. Amd I'd finally gotten a little better and into enjoying things again. Anyway my pet parrots had some babies and I sold one of them today. She went home to her new owner and I feel like garbage for selling her.
My mother said that I shouldn't have sold that one and that "i jope she takes care of her" in this tone that implied she didn't think the new owner would(she picked this human out without even asking me soooo.) And just I feel so guilty for it. And i got upset and decided to put an end to people making me feel bad(i know its wrong and i should have just kept quiet.) "Fine, if yku're going to make me feel bad for doing what you asked me to do just leave me alone" and retreated to my room. And apparently they everyone was just joking but it didn't feel like joking and I feel like crap. And I need to learn how to not take things so seriously but honestly I'm ready to just off myself but am scared it won't work. 


So just gonna curl up in my blankets and see if it's humanly possible to wish myself out of existence
