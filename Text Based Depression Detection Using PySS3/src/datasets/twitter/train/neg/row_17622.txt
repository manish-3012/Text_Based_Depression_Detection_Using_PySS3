Any way how to get hospitalized for a few weeks without telling them about suicide thoughts?There is some job which i'm supposed to do over next three weeks in my work. But the thing is that I know that it is going to be a failure and will lead to me being miserable for the rest of my life. The only way for me to avoid it is to get hospitalized for a few weeks... Is there any possible ways to do that? I just can't sleep at nights right now, my head hurts and I keep on searching suicide ways even though I was probably never this suicidal. I even start cry randomly...
