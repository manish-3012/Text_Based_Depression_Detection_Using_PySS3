the antipsychotics workedwhile i had them. they numbed me. stopped me from thinking. removed my emotions. i slept 12+ hours a day, stopped going to classes or caring about my future, lost contact with all of my friends because i didn't care about anything, but i did it. i graduated from college somehow and got a good job. cool.

then my insurance ran out. my meds cost 1300/month.

i don't know what version of me is worse. the one where i hardly have a personality or life (on meds), or the one where i feel everything too strongly.

my work is fun, but i end up working 10 hour days with 30 min commute. salaried so no overtime. i'm tired.

i don't really know what i'm saying. just wanted a place to vent. i thought about speeding into a wall while driving home today, and drove kinda recklessly. i also thought about jumping off my patio on the 4th floor, but i know that's not how i want to die.

i can't die anyway. my dad needs me. he's 69. i want him to have a good life while he's still around.
