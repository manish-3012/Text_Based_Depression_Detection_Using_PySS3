Move on, serious problems can be found if you keep scrolling.Sorry if this ends up just being a meaningless rant or whatever it is in English. I just wanted to share anywhere even if it was to some random stranger on the internet. There are other  people with various other, actually serious problems below, if you don't have time to burn, help them first.

 Anyone else just sometimes wish that they got hit by a bus or their brain just randomly decides to clock out or die in a shooting  so that you can be freed from this pain  while not being an utter dissapointment in your last few moments like you have been for your whole life. I have been wishing for something or someone to kill me everyday so I can die knowing that my parents won't think it's their fault that I died.

 I dont have any friend that I could share my feelings with. I don't have any talents. I have never won anything in my life. I used to get good marks and make my parents happy but after 6th  grade something happened, idk what. But my grades just started to nosedive. Now in 10th grade which is a crucial year because of my country, and I sucked throughout the year. I don't know what I am going to do about this or my life. Since the last few years, I have been a constant disappointment to everything and everyone in my life. My parents provided me with everything I could have needed but I somehow still royally fucked everything up.i just want to make them feel proud. But I can't. I have failed at everything I have tried. 

I'm very fat, I have an eating problem and I am extremely socially awkward and anxious.i also have no self confidence and I  constantly feel like people stare at me with disgust. I am done with this shit  and I want to kill myself but I just can't gather up strength to do it myself.

Sorry if this was a rant, just needed to write it somewhere where anyone real could see and not just talk to my cat like an idiot. If I wasted your time, I'm sorry.
