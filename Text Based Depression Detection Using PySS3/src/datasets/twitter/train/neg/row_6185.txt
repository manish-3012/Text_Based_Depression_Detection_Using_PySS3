Heâ€™s bled me dry and wonâ€™t stopTo keep this succinct, I am partway through a divorce from my husband and every step of the way, heâ€™s taking more and more from me financially to the point that Iâ€™d have been better off on benefits for my entire working life than having worked so fucking hard for 22 years - since I was 14.

On a personal level heâ€™s taken me to the cleaners because I earned more than him. Oh, we had exactly the same day rate (as both self employed contractors) but throughout our marriage he chose to not actually work and therefore not earn anything - but had no problem spending literally hundreds of pounds of my money in a single night getting pissed and trying to fuck strippers.

And now the company we shared - that he put no money into - and I left a year ago - still needs taxes paying and I genuinely will be in court and lose my career because he canâ€™t pay his share even though Iâ€™ve paid my own...because the tax man doesnâ€™t give a shit who paid what...company still fucking owes!!

I genuinely donâ€™t think that itâ€™s worth even trying any more. I may as well just pay my wages directly to him and be done with it. And still potentially end up on the wrong side of the law. After trying so hard in life. Whatâ€™s the point. Iâ€™ll lose my house over it this time no doubt. I donâ€™t even want to fucking try any more.
