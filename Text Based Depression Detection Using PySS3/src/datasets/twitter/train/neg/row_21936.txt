Hope is a lieHey all, I've been suffering depression for almost 2 years now. These past few weeks have taken a turn for the worst though. Almost all of my friends have drifted away from me and my life has become complete shit, even by my very low standards.

Yesterday, I got back my exam results. It was terrible and I'd been banking on those results to at least give my life some semblance of hope or reason to live. I told myself I would definitely kill myself that day, but after a talk with the suicide hotline, I decided to hang on for another day, for today I had an appointment with my psychiatrist. I had no one to talk to besides her.

The past ~5 times I visited her she was fine. I felt better or at least not as suicidal after my visits during those times. Today however, she had a very aggressive and irritated stance towards me, and kept forcing me to say things that I was clearly uncomfortable with, plus claimed I was lying about 90% of the time. I told her I couldnt perfectly recall specific details due to my very addled state of mind at that time, but she didnt seem to listen.

I realised every time I had a slight bit of hope it always turns out wrong. Friends I used to confide in ignore me more and more when I tell them my problems or try to hang out with them, but I thought my results could make up for it. That didnt work out, and I thought maybe my psychiatrist could help me. That didnt work out as well.

Fuck it, I should kill myself by the end of the week.

EDIT: I talked with my mother. I'm fine now, I think.
