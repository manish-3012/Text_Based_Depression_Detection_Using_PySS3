Update: I no longer have anything to look forward to. I'm done.Okay, so I posted here about a week ago, with little attention.

 But things are different. Now, I'm damn serious. I'm gonna fucking kill myself. I no longer have anything to look forward to in life, because I've recently lost what means the most to me. I have nothing. I'm going to kill myself. Soon.

EDIT: Damn. I can barely keep up with all the support you've given me. Thank you.
