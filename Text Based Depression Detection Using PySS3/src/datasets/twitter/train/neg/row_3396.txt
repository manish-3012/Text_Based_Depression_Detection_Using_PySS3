Haven't Spoken To Him In Days...I have a penpal who I met through reddit. We have been friends for just about a month now, and we basically talked every single day on Skype. He was gone through a lot in his life, dealing with depression, anxiety and Asperger's. About a week ago, he was messaging me tell me that he had overdosed on some medications he had, and his messages were getting weirder as time progressed, and they made less sense. He deleted me off Skype, and I haven't talked to him in over a week. 

A day or two after the incident, I had looked at his user profile and he had made a comment on a post he had made, three hours prior to when I had checked. I sent him a message on Skype, but he never responded, and soon after deleted the comments. 

He had told me he had very strong feelings for me as well, saying he believed he was in love with me.

I tried my hardest to always be there for him, and we had gotten into a couple arguments during our friendship, but nothing major.

He also lives in the UK ( I live in the US) so I have really no way of knowing if he's alive or not.

I didn't know where else to post, and I'm worried.

I know I shouldn't have waited a week to post, but I was hoping he was just busy with work or something.
