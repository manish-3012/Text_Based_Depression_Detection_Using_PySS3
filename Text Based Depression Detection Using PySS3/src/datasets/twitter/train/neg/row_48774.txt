FiancÃ© might dump meSo my fiance and I were in ldr but we loved each other a lot and taked every day on phone, texts etc..We even had great plans for kids and the future
I love him.
Anyway our first attempt for us to marry and live together failed so he created second one but it seems it will fail too.
He wants to come in my country, marry me and we would leave together (i need visa) 
He told me before 2 days (on 4th that if the plan fails) he would break up be7he doesn't like distance relationships and he thinks to create amother 3rd plan will be Herculean task in the future. 
Anyway the plan we will most likely fail because we are both broke as fuck and he was irresponsible with his finances.  
I don't know what to do i am devastated.  I love him and I don't want break up. He still calls me love/honey/bunny but I am scared.
