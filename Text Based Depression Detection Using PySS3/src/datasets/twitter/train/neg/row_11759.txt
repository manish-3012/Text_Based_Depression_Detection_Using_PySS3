No reason not to nowEveryone has left me and I dont blame them. I'm not good at being a good person. Everyone leaves cause I'm fucked in the head and it needs to end. I've tried countless things, counselors, therapists, psychiatrists, so many kinds of meds and still now. I dont want to be in pain anymore. I want to leave a note but the only peole who would read it would be who ever finds my body so what's the point. I give up I'm too weak
