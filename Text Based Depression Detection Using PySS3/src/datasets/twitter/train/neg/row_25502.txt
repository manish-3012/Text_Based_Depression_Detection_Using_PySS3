derision nothing trying hereI can stop the voices inside of my head from screaming. I went out with my kids to day and I broke down crying in the middle of the mall.Eveyone stops and looks at my funny pointing and laughing. I can't stop the screams at night knowing what i have done. All i think about is darkness. I can't breath when this happens. I can't work because I can't deal with the stress of work and the people who look down upon me for not being able to sit in a meeting. I want help. The va will not give me more than 80% disability and it isn't enough to live on.what can i do?
edit one: I can't even look at my self in the mirror...
