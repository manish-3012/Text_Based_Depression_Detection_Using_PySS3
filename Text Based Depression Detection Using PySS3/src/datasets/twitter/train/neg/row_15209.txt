Life 'ache'. Hi, I'm a 20-year-old student. Second year of uni and never failed yet. Bf. Family is ok. I don't really understand why I feel like shit every single day. I wanna fix it, I would like to realize I'm behaving like a 15-year-old teen. I cannot forget my past. It's true I suffered bullying when I was young --from 9 to 17, I have to say. I had some bad experiences with bfs. Now I'm 'ok' despite the fact that I don't have friends --honestly, I've never had friends in my life, I mean, only people betraying me and things like that, you know it's typical stuff but perhaps I'm too sensitive. It's a kind of... childhood trauma. 

At the age of 16 I began crossing the line. By crossing the line I mean planning how to kill myself, cutting my arms a little bit, anorexic behaviour, that sort of things. I still don't know why I began doing that, and of course I think it's very childish --and probably you will agree. 

I'm now 20 and I don't want to ruin my career. I went to two psycologists and this is basically what I learned from them: 'it's anxiety' and then 'go to the psychiatrist and take pills'. I think I don't really need pills for fixing my life. It has to be me...
