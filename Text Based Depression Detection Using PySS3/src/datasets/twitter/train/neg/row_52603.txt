Hello this is just a rant don't botherI just feel worthless and useless I'll be 20 in November and I have been pretty much the same person for the past 4 years I've just grown more withdrawn more scared and fearful and way more lazy.I promised myself I'll change last year and tried but couldn't really do much since my academic commitment leaves me exhausted and bored.
I don't enjoy talking to anyone, I don't like to workout anymore and haven't in months, I have deleted all of my socials because I just feel so exhausted and angry on people being pretentious and insensitive (including me) I've tried to start reading again but can't because I get distracted so easily and I'm very restless the only positive thing which has happened with me is that I've grown more humane and understanding that's it but the whole point of writing this stupid huge ass essay is that I just don't want to live a life full of mediocrity or I don't want to be so useless I want to get so better but I continue to be in a bind with my other commitments mainly school.


I just feel so stupid for being sad,insecure and melancholic when people have problems way worse than me like fuck off you useless cunt take your life already and don't be the reason why someone more deserving reason for not getting an opportunity or that girl you love so much who loves you back don't be the reason for making her life bad and sad because of you.

I just want to live,grow stronger have new experiences be the fucking nonchalant dude I was but feel I'll never get the opportunity to do so again it's just work hard in college&gt;get degrees&gt;get job.
While not finding your actual purpose.

Finally to end this stupid rant I've made a decision I'll take my life in November 2022 if I'm still the same dude I should have 0 reason for live and just take it already because by then I would have successfully disappointed everyone around me and no one would care about me.

I'll just leave this up for a day I'm sorry you even had to read 5 words of this.I hope you all get what you really want or deserve
