I'm sore inside and I'm tiredI fell in love again. Stupid right? Same thing that happens every time I over share and I fall too quickly and it's not even just that. I suffered abuse with my ex and I'm broken after that. Things have never been the same inside me. Normally I can shake it off and carry on but this time I can't seem to get it right. I just want to be loved and needed and I can't even get that right. My career is fucked because of Covid and no real events happening at the moment. I want to finish my album as a goodbye, as a suicide note and once that's done I want to go and be with the stars again.
