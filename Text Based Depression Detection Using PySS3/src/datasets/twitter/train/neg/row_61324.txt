In need of advice.Wanna make this as short as possible, dont even know if this is the proper place, sorry in advance.

My mother tried to kill herself today, cut her arm almost until that things that move your fingers, she told me some time ago "please help me do it" because she doesnt want to live.

 I dont know for sure if its because she was drunk as fuck or because its true that she doesnt want to live, but I wasnt aware this was going to happen, she lost her pet 3 months ago and I was quitting smoke with her, my father is also alive in case sounds that he's not.

I need help because she feels guilty, looks like she doesnt wanna try that again but Im worried next time she will just eat a bunch of pills just to end the shame, we went to the hospital and she's fixed, but I feel like the worst is coming.

I dont know what I look forward to read here but reddit is a place I found myself able to talk about most things, and Im not gonna ask for advice with facebook.

So yeah, Im 24 and more shocked than I think, I guess.

I dont want to google what to do, but I really need  some advice about what to do next, how to deal with this, I dont wanna make her guilty by removing knifes or pills, but Im scared asfuck, if anyone can help... idk, Ill be as gratefull as I can be.
