Give me one reason why I shouldn't off myself?I lack skills in absolutely everything; I am currently going for a degree in computer sciences yet I can barely remember anything about the languages I've learned about making me feel like I am wasting my time with school, I am a lazy piece of shit, I am not even good at video games or constructing nice structures in Minecraft for crying out loud, I am currently seeing a therapist for gender dysphoria which is something I want to see through to the end but eventually I might end up quitting like everything else I do not to mention financial barriers due to my lack of skill to earn me a decent living if not fortune as well as my family being poor with everybody appearing to accept this, I also should note that I am essentially like Finbarr Calamitous in that I never seem to finish anything and a little bit like [George Costanza](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0kx_Mo9OX8) in that quitting seems to be the one thing I am good at, I am socially-inept most likely due to my upbringing because my mother either A) has emotional issues or B) was just a terrible parent, I never had any friends, I am still a virgin, I never kissed a girl or a boy, and in a post-apocalyptic scenario where I am among a colony of survivors the most logical course of action for us to be is to take me in the back and shoot me in the brain so I do not take up space and waste resources.

They saying everyone has a place in this world yet they complain about overpopulation so how is this not a plus for me killing myself and getting rid of one less human with nothing to offer the world?

I've thought about doing this in a few ways like pills or just slitting my throat with a knife from the kitchen.

Seriously, what reason is there for me to live?

p.s. If I made any grammatical or spelling errors or if my writing just doesn't make sense then I guess this is just one more thing I suck at and people say I'm a good writer or storycrafter.

p.s.s. Male pattern baldness has also hit me early in my twenties and possibly due to stress.
