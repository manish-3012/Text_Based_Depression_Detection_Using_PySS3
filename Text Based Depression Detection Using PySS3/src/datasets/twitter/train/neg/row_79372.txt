School troubles.I graduated high school early July. I was accepted into the architecture program at private college I've had my eye on for awhile. But, it's expensive and out of state. I've been waiting to hear back from them because I reached out for a scholarship.

 When I first started highschool, (Mexico's HS system is from the tenth grade to the ninth) I was dealing with very big mental health issues. I had moved from the USA to Mexico and it took a large toll on me, I had depression for two years. This of course, did show up on my grades. I didn't feel like I would ever graduate, I always thought I'd have the courage to kill myself before then. Until my last year of HS I was seeing some light and felt motivated.  For that year, my grades were average.
 
I was told that the results of my application would be up online yesterday. They weren't. I sent an email this morning and was told it would be pushed until the 30th. My first day of classes would be the 7th of August. 

This whole situation is making me go back to my old state. I didn't sleep well last night because of other situations that are making my mental health worse. I keep going back to my suicidal thoughts. I don't know what to do. If I can't make it now, I'll never will. I'm not worth any help.
