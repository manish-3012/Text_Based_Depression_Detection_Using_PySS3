I feel so broken, idk what to do.Im not the same person I used to be. I feel broken, and i know why, but im to afraid to admit it. My life is slowly tearing me apart bit by bit. When i first started feeling this way suicide would never have been a fix for all  this but as i feel myself getting weaker i find myself become more accepting of it, its becoming more and more viable and soon it'll be the only way out.
