Question related to cuttingThis probably isnâ€™t allowed hence the throwaway account but couldnâ€™t find a better place to ask. If youâ€™re triggered easily just press the back button.

When it comes to the structure of the wrist, I have one vein close to the surface of my skin thatâ€™s always visible, closer to my thumb side of my forearm. I know if you cut some veins they will just clot, is this one of those? Message me through PM, wonâ€™t respond to comments. 

Simply asking a question, thereâ€™s nothing more to it so unless you can help answer then Iâ€™ll ignore you.
