Functioning on the edge of physical exhaustion for a long timeI'm going to keep it short, nobody likes to read long-ass whiny posts.


-30 years old, skinny body

-desk job (8h of sitting/day)

-constant back pain in loin area (increases with sitting duration)

-constant pain of coccyx (can't sit in normal position as it's too painful)

-constant neck pain (strong) and extreme neck weakness (can't keep my head in the normal position without some support)

-constant legs pain (decreases when not sitting for a few days)

-I'm working in a poorly-lit open-space, my eyes are dry and very tired all the time; I'm also sure that constant lack of light affects my mood negatively; it also causes my vision impairment to increase

-extreme tiredness

-depression (I think) caused mainly by above problems


You'll probably consider these problems as minor, but I cannot deal with them anymore, it's been too long - 3-4 years of everyday torture.

I'm too pussy to end it. Too tired to think straight.
