I'm terrified of working for the rest of my lifeI sort of consider myself a smart person. But I'm not. Every aspiration I have is beyond my reach. I'm most likely going to end up doing some manual labour job for the rest of my life or be homeless and the prospect of spending the Majority of the remainder of the next 50 years doing some I really, really don't want to do absolutely terrifies me. If life is just going to be the same menial terrible shit every day why even bother living?
