Regret surviving suicide attemptI know I'm supposed to be grateful; I'm supposed to be relieved but the only thing I feel is a deep regret. Life is hell; even making it through the day is a Herculean task. I'm a low-IQ, 20-year-old, brain damaged, mentally ill (severe OCD) degenerate. I look wierd; I shaved my head in order to be able to clean it faster. I've got a high school diploma and no other credentials; I wasted 3 years on college to just drop out ... 

The last of mine abusers is about to die; without them I'll be on my own. I decided to take drastic measures; to abandon life ... I've contemplated the meaning of life; the purpose or role I'm supposed to play out and sadly the only role is that of the social parasite that lives in misery and self-pity. I tried to improve. I've read the Hakagure, I followed Yukio Mishima's teachings and opinions, I pondered as deep as I possible could. It's futile ... 

I'm going to try again; I failed because they managed to revive me. I was put on suicide watch; it's been a while but I can't keep going. There's no future; I'm a disgrace. I felt relief once I was losing consciousness despite the pain and panic. I was confused once I woke up. I felt dread and deep despair once I realised I am still ... 

Stoic principles brought me occasional relief; I especially love this quote. 

â€œRemember that the door is open. Donâ€™t be more cowardly than children, but just as they say, when the game is no longer fun for them, â€˜I wonâ€™t play any more,â€™ you too, when things seem that way to you, say, â€˜I wonâ€™t play any more,â€™ and leave, but if you remain, donâ€™t complain.â€ - Epictetus

I'm going to leave; won't be more cowardly than a child. Let that be the end, please ... : (
