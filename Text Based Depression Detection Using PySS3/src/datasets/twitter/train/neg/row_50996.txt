I am done telling myself that it will get better. I have been living with the secret and shame of being molested for nearly 10 years now. It was my the brother of my best friend. How he could have touched an 8 year old boy is beyond me. I have had to deal with the shame of hiding it from everyone around me. Everyday I am tormented by the pictures of what happened and why I did not stop it. 

I have tried to commit suicide by over-dosing on NyQuil and Benadryl and all that gave me was a week in a mental hospital where everyone said that it would get better. Well it has been 3 years since the flash backs started and it has not gotten better. I am done. I am about to do it again and say goodbye to my friends. I don't know what to do, I just want to escape and get away forever.
