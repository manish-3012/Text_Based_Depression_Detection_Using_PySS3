Iâ€™m giving upIâ€™ve posted here before. And honestly I was expecting last time to be the last. But here I am again right where I started. Iâ€™ve lost every friend Iâ€™ve wanted in the past 8 months due to my toxic actions and personality. As of now I just go to my classes everyday and go home and shelter myself in my room with YouTube as my only companion. Every time Iâ€™ve tried to be happy Iâ€™ve been shot right back down here and honestly Iâ€™m done trying and just want to gain the courage to end all of this. Or at least if not try to pursue Euthanasia since Iâ€™m just tired of living and donâ€™t care what my death would do to those around me. Hell those people Iâ€™ve lost would probably be glad to hear Iâ€™m dead. After all the emotional abuse and disrespect theyâ€™d probably just say I had it coming. Back to the trying to be happy point. I tried new friends and they either hated me or we didnâ€™t click right off the bat and stopped talking. I got a new car and a week later it got totaled leaving me in hell with no car so no way to get out. Honestly I like feeling like this sometimes. It feels like I deserve this punishment for what I did to those people and itâ€™s a way for me to hurt myself. I constantly want them back and believe if I get them Iâ€™ll finally be back to having a bit of joy but after everything itâ€™s just not possible. I want to just end this. I donâ€™t see a future for me and I never have. I feel like I was just born to die like this. I donâ€™t want to go to college or live beyond this point. I want it to end now. I feel like itâ€™ll actually be good for me if I do this.
