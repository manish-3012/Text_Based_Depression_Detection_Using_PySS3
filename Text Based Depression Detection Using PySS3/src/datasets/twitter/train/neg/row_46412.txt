Don't want to burden my friends and family with the thoughts I haveI feel like I have this lump that extends from the back of my head down to the middle of my back. It feels like a numbed pain, like when you go to the dentist, or when you've broken a bone and on pain killers.
The voices in my head constantly telling me to end it are gibberish, I couldn't translate it into words but I know what it means. This is from the moment I wake up, to the moment I can eventually fall asleep after laying in my bed in darkness for hours.
I don't know what the rules are here but I needed to let someone know, and I spend a lot of time on Reddit looking at dumb shit to try and cheer myself up.
I just spent 4 days with my best friends partying in Copenhagen, and I won't say I didn't enjoy myself, but I'm mentally exhausted from trying not to appear as if I want to top myself every 5 seconds.
If anyone has read anything here that they can relate to, please tell me how you pushed through it. I really don't want to feel like this anymore, it's killing me.
Thanks for reading.
