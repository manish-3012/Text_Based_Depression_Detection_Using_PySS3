I feel like there's no point in living at all.I hate this. I hate myself so much. 

I feel like if I have to be myself one more day, I might explode. Nothing I do is ever right. I am not good at games. I'm not good at being useful to others. I'm not good at being a good daughter, sister or partner (I don't even have friends, but you can figure I'm not the best either). I'm a sore loser. I often feel jealous of others who do/are better than me. Hell, I'm not even that good with the languages I study and that's what I want to eventually do for a living. I'm bad even at trying to kill myself (have a bunch of failed attempts under my belt). I'm just a huge disappointment. 

Living like this is so exhausting. I want out, like right now. I feel so tempted to pop up some pills and finally sleep in peace.
