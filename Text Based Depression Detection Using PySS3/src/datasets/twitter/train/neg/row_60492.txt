I feel like I never even had a chance (possible tw)Iâ€™ve been feeling incredibly depressed the past few years, and itâ€™s started to become unbearable. I thought Iâ€™d just share the story of my life because Iâ€™ve never told anyone before. I feel like I was a vulnerable person but nobody ever did anything to try and help me. (Tw sexual assault)

So from a young age I was diagnosed with autism (high functioning) which has made most things in life incredibly hard. Iâ€™ve never really felt close to anyone, which is one of the things Iâ€™m most upset about in my life.

Around the first year of school I was a victim of child on child sexual abuse, which I kept to myself until a few months ago.

At around age 9-10 I started to develop tics, and was later diagnosed with tourettes. I was not able to receive any treatment for this because my mother distrusted medical professionals.

Around Highschool my mother, a schizophrenic, stopped taking her medications and went completely off the rails. She attempted to kidnap me and my brother on one occasion, and attacked me on another. My parents divorced and I now live with my father. 

All throughout Highschool I had many friends, but never any meaningful connections and due to my autism, and just going to school was so draining I couldnâ€™t do anything I enjoyed outside of school. I eventually stopped going for awhile until I got in trouble and started going again. My grades have always been around a B level, but as time goes on I am less and less motivated.

In Highschool i had my first relationship, and I wanted to end it but the other person would continually threaten suicide every time I brought it up. It took a long time to escape.

I have been in therapy for over two years now, and tried many different therapists and truly tried to implement the techniques they say but nothing has ever worked.

I am now in the final year of Highschool, and it feels like every thing is truly falling apart now. Hereâ€™s a list of everything:

- my father who I live with is quite poor, so we cannot afford a lot of medication or treatments which would be useful for me (I also have endometriosis but had to stop taking the pain killers which were helping because they cost a lot). Even though I live in Australia Medicare doesnâ€™t cover enough and my father makes just enough to not qualify for a healthcare card.

- I am feeling the pressure of needing to choose a university. I was heartbroken the other day when my careers advisor told me the one thing I wanted to do had practically no job opportunities. My one passion in life (special interest) is history and art curatorship. Hearing that I probably canâ€™t spend my life doing that has broken me.

- I have tried to have jobs to help pay for things but the first I couldnâ€™t handle because of the sensory issues, and the second I really enjoyed but couldnâ€™t continue because the store shut down. Holding a job and going to school at the same time is incredibly difficult for me. 

- I have been trying to learn to drive but havenâ€™t been able to get my license yet. I have spent around $1,000 of my wages on lessons (in my state there is a logbook system where you have to complete all the competencies to get your license) and despite being able to pass all the driving skills I cannot get my license because I canâ€™t parallel park without my instructor giving me a few pointers. I have no money left so I feel like I wasted my time to not even get my license. I wouldnâ€™t even be able to afford a car anyway.

- I feel a lot of guilt around my mother, I am the only person in her whole life who still contacts her and she is completely alone. I dont know if she takes care of herself and I donâ€™t know what will happen to her if I move away. Sometimes I wish she were dead so that I wouldnâ€™t have to stress about her ):

- I can tell the one friend Iâ€™ve ever been close to is getting tired of me. And most of my other friends have drifted away. I am about to have an 18th birthday soon and had trouble thinking of anyone to invite. I donâ€™t feel like Iâ€™m close to anyone in my life, even though outwardly it appears I have a lot of friends. Iâ€™ve tried extra curricular things but I canâ€™t get around my social barriers.

- I love to create and post art, but I usually get almost no interaction on anything I post. Itâ€™s sort of heartbreaking to spend hours working on a piece and then getting 0 likes. This is one of my passions and although Iâ€™m not amazing I still put a lot of effort in.



Thank you so much if youâ€™ve read this far, it may sound very wild but this is what Iâ€™ve had to put up with for a long time and Iâ€™m getting very tired. I feel so isolated, and I donâ€™t see any way out of the place Iâ€™m in now. I donâ€™t qualify for any government assistance because Iâ€™m too â€˜high functioningâ€™ and my father makes just too much to receive any benefits. I have been thinking of killing myself for awhile now and have even thought of a nice spot to do it, but I still have a tiny bit of hope that it could get better. 
If you read all of this thank you so much, it really means a lot to me and it feels good to get it all out. I donâ€™t really know what my Intent was with this, Iâ€™m just upset and want to vent. But it truly feels like I was failed by a lot of people in my life and I was never even given a chance ):
