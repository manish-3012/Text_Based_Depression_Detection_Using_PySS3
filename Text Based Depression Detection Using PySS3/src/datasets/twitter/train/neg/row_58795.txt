Don't know how to help my friend at the end of his ropeMy dear friend was already suicidal and depressed and moved to my state as a 2nd chance at life, which is something I convinced him to do as he has a lot of supportive family and friends here. 

He has been here since June, has struggled to find a job he likes and wants to stick with. Is staying with his grandparents, so he doesn't feel independent anymore, or that his friends ort family care about him, but I know we love him deeply. 

He texted me last night saying he had given it a shot, but isn't convinces that suicide isn't the answer and that his life is meaningless.  I begged him to meet me today, I was just desperate to keep him alive for at least one more night, hoping that there was some way I could find to help him or get him help.  

I love my friend deeply, I know he is in so much darkness and dispair. I would do anything to save his life. I don't know what I can do, who I can call or what resources I can give him. I know my words don't mean much to him when he is hurting so much and wants to give up. 

I am prepared to call an ambulance to his house if he does attempt suicide, but I really don't want it to go so far. What can I do to help him? I am so thankful that he agreed to meet me, which gives me some hope. 

I will take any advice. Thank you for reading.
