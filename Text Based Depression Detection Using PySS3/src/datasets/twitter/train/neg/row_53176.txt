Moving on with your lifeI contemplate suicide daily. Some days, like today, itâ€™s the only thing I can think about. One of my biggest triggers is thinking of my old girlfriend. we dated for 5 years and I never pictured myself with anyone else. She went to college, liked the attention she got from other guys, and dumped me. Long story short I still have so much love for her but my heart aches and Iâ€™m filled with so much hate (mostly toward myself) whenever I think of her. When trying to keep contact after the breakup, she pushed me away and made me feel worthless. I often think â€œif I kms then sheâ€™ll feel the pain I doâ€ or â€œmaybe then sheâ€™ll regret itâ€. I know these thoughts are so fucking selfish and I hate myself for even having them, but I canâ€™t stop them. I know she isnâ€™t the only trigger for me, as Iâ€™ve had depression for a long time, but if I canâ€™t move on from her I donâ€™t know how I can live my life. Im only 21 and I have a loving family and good friends, but I still have no self worth or confidence. The worst part is, I want to be happy for her. I want her to live her life and me live mine. How can I learn to move on
