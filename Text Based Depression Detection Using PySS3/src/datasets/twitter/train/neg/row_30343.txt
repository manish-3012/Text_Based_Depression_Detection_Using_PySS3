Suicide noteNOTE: Iâ€™m not committing suicide yet this is just a draft.

Dear mum and sad,
Iâ€™m so sorry for the pain I caused you, I know you have to go through a lot because of me, I made you go through so much, going from hospital to another. 
I know Iâ€™m not as strong as you mum, you have been through so much, you lost your brother in war now you are going to lose your daughter but not to a brave death like your brother but a shameful one. Mum you have always being caring and kind even when you used to beat me I knew it was out of love and care, please stay strong.
Dad, you have always been smart, you lost your brother too, so I know the pain is going to hard, but stay strong please and think Iâ€™m in a much better place now. 


I love you so much And Iâ€™m so sorry but the thoughts are too much I feel so guilty, the sadness, the pain is too much to handle.
Please be happy as Iâ€™m in a much better state of mind now, Iâ€™m in deep sleep.


Please help me correct anything I wrote wrong.
