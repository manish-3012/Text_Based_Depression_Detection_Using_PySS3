To my baby brother... You took your life on Thursday, September 24th, 2020... At work... The pain is unbearable. You were 21 years old. You were so young. You had your whole life ahead of you... I have so many questions that I will never get answers to. You didn't hesitate. You didn't reach out for help. You didn't call any of your 10 sisters. You didn't call your only brother. You didn't call dad, your bestfriend. I didn't know you were suffering like you were. You never showed it. You were always so strong. You were the man of the house. You were 8 hours away from your family when you did it. I'm so sorry I couldn't be there to help you, James. The house is empty and quiet without you. My life will never be the same...

Mental Illness is serious. And I wish I was more aware of it. I wish I could tell my baby brother I love him one last time... So, if you're reading this, please tell your family, siblings, friends that you love them. Cause I wish I did.

I'm open to chatting. Advice from strangers can be helpful.
