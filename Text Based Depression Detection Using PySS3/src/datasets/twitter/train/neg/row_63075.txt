I think I'm finally ready..Not really sure what to start with.. I've been thinking about this for over 10 years.. it used to make me feel sad, angry, hurt, and scared when I thought about it.. it kinda wierd but I don't feel it anymore just empty.. I don't see any way of things changing how I feel.. money a relationship it doesn't matter i just don't want anything anymore.. it doesn't matter.. Everytime I smoke I hope it's the one that will give me cancer.. it was the closest I thought I could ever get to doing it.. but I just feel empty now.. not scared not sad not angry.. I feel like it's time.. I've started making my plans.. sadly it will be two weeks before I can.. but I won't fail..
