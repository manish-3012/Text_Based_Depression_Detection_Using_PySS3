Gimmie a reason not toFailed school, failed college, have zero skills, can't even do basic fucking math right. Suffer from all sorts of shit like Depression, ADHD, Anxiety etc etc. My life's a huge disaster and my problems feel like a black hole that suck me in with no way out, except from obviously killing myself. What's the fucking point in living when i can't do even the most basic of shit?
I'm a such a fucking moron it's unreal. Actually i think i'm safe enough to label myself a spastic even. I've tried everything in the book to improve myself only to be met with failure and disappointment. Failure is the motto of my life, i'll never improve, i'll always be dumb as shit, there's no fucking point to anything anymore. Nobody even gives a fuck about me, i never asked for this horrible mess of a life so why the fuck can't i end it? Maths has destroyed me.
 Fuck life and fuck me for being such a fucking retard
