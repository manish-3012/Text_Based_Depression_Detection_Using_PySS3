Wanting to do die all the time? I feel some type of way when I think suicide.Title says it all, from the time I wake up Iâ€™m thinking about suicide. I can be doing anything and still have it on my brain. Itâ€™s never off my brain. When Iâ€™m thinking about suicide itâ€™s feels good Iâ€™m away, I know thereâ€™s a solution to be gone from feeling like this.

Iâ€™m 20 years old no job, no grade 12, no car, no money, no enjoyment in living.. I got nothing going for me in life, I donâ€™t enjoy nothing and I hate working I canâ€™t see myself doing this the rest of my life.. 

Just the thought of suicide, seems to be the only answer witch I plan on doing I think..
