Update: My girlfriend died in a car accident and all I want to do is follow herOriginal post here: http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/2ufyn5/my_girlfriend_died_in_a_car_accident_and_all_i/

Thank you. Everyone who read and responded to my post, thank you. It's been a little over a month and the nights are still hell, but I've read over the comments on my first post more times than I can count. I'm seeing a therapist. I joined a grief support group and a meditation group. I told my best friend with absolute honesty that I felt like I had nothing to live for, and he hugged me, cried, and told me "You've been there for me every time I needed you, no questions asked. I will do the same for you." He's called me every night since then, even if it's just to check in for a few minutes. 

I still think about dying often. I still have flashbacks that nearly double me over in pain and make me reach for the strongest drink I can find. I'm irritable, angry, and generally shitty company. But I am alive. And I intend to stay that way for as long as I can. For her. For me.

Thank you all. I'm so grateful to this community.
