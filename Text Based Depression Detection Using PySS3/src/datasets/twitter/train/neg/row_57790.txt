what's wrong with me?i hate myself so much. i'm not even insecure about the way i look, i just literally have a terrible personality. i have been told that my "only redeeming feature" is my face,
and no one has ever loved me. people crush on me because they think i'm cute, then get bored because there's literally nothing good about my brain. i have major self-esteem issues because it seems like i'm not good at anything, and i genuinely believe no one will ever love me. i mean screw it, if i couldn't even get my own dad to love me, how could i get anybody else? i only have one aspiration for the future, but if i don't get a good gpa when i finish highschool, i might as well kill myself because i have literally nothing. i have no talents, hobbies, friends, and will probably never get married. i've had self-esteem issues for awhile, but everyone brushes it off because i'm not insecure about the way i look. well screw looks. we're all just walking brains anyways, who cares about that stuff? it seems like i'm the only one who has self-esteem issues with just... who i am as a person. i don't know. i hate myself so much. i sometimes think it's my dad's fault for physically and verbally abusing me when all i wanted was for him to love me. i tried. so. hard. but it's not even just him. everyone i interact with seems to eventually hate me. if it's a recurring problem i figure i must be the issue. no one has ever loved me and i'm entirely isolated. not that my happiness relies on constantly being around people anyways, i just can't quite seem to handle always wondering what's wrong with me. it always comes down to this.
