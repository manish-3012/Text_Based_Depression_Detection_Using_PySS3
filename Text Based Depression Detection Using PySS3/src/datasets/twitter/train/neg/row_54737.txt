Only reason I'm alive is because of my kidsI feel sad less and empty more as time goes on. I don't want to exist anymore. I don't even want to talk to people I know about it because it's just the same bullshit. If I were to kill myself tonight the people that barely cared to even go out of their way to text me back would cry like I was their best friend. The few people I am close to would say "I had no idea she was this bad" when I've been nothing but obvious about everything. My 2 year old son and the fact that I'm currently pregnant are the only things that are keeping me here and I almost feel frustrated because of it. I didn't have anywhere else to turn or anyone else to talk to so I figured in case something happened I had this.
