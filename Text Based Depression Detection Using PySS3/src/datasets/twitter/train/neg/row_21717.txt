Can someone just... sit with me or talk to me while I go away? Don't wanna die alone.I dont mean to guilt anyone into this. I understand watching someone die would be scarring.

But if there's one person out there who has enough of a heart to do me one last favor, human to human, please let me know... I'm not allowed to talk about methods but it won't be visually traumatic, bloody, etc. it will be more or less peaceful. I just please please want to hear somebody's voice before the end. Maybe just over Skype phone, we don't even have to video chat.

Im just very scared of dying alone. At least take me to the gates of death and I'll take it from there.

**EDIT:** Just got a PM saying kill yourself and you're worthless. The funny thing is he's right, I'm am fucking worthless. Thanks for your honesty and yes I mean that genuinely. Someone finally spoke to me without any bullshit and I appreciate that.
