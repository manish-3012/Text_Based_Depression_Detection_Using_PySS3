I hate myselfI hate myself so much, I nearly can't take it anymore. Every day I suffer, not being able to speak to anybody, not being able to touch anybody. Always being alone. I have no friends, and my family doesn't care about me, and even if they did they are too far away. I miss feeling human, I miss having a hug. Therapy doesn't help me and I just hate myself for being such an ugly, antisocial, anxious piece of shit. I have no idea what to do anymore.
