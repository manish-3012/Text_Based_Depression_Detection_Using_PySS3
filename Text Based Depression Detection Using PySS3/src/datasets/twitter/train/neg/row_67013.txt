Is it suicide for an "it" to kill itself?If society doesn't see me as human and I'm not even sure I see myself as one either anymore.. Would it be suicide if I a "thing" were to kill itself. Most of society would cheer my death anyways. The pain my family will face will be dwarfed by the sheer joy my celebratory death will generate for most everyone else.
