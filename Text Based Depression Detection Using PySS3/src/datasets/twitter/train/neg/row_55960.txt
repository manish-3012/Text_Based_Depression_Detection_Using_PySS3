While I Was In the Car (I Had Headphones On, So They Didnâ€™t Know I Was Listening), My Mom Said, â€œI Hope He (Me) Blows His Fucking Face Off.â€ My Dad Then Said, â€œAhhh Itâ€™ll (Depression) Blow Overâ€ Fuck Them.Iâ€™m not even mad, just disappointed in myself. They donâ€™t fucking care about me and itâ€™s my fault. I could ask to go to therapy, but they wonâ€™t let me take pills because, â€œIâ€™ll end up living in the basement on welfare.â€ Conservatism is one hell of a drug. Maybe dad should stop fucking drinking every night!
