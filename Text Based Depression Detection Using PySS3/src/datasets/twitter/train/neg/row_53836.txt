maybe some people shouldn't liveI get these things called retinal migraines. They're the rarest form of migraine, and I get them around 4-5 times a week. They're so bad that I've had them since birth and I still vomit from the pain. Another side effect of these migraines is every time I have one I go blind for around 30 minutes. Eventually, one of the times I have a migraine I won't regain my sight, and I'll be permanently blind in my eye. I was also born with an enlarged heart that murmurs too many times a day to count, and doctors say I'll need a new heart by the time I'm 40. All of my family is dead and I have too many headaches to maintain a social life. Even while my mother was still alive I only made her sad, no matter how hard I tried to hide how miserable I was it never worked, she always said how sorry she was and how it was her fault.

Maybe I should just leave this life.
