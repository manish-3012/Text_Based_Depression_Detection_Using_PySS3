ThoughtsWhy shouldnâ€™t I hang myself?

Who would care if I killed myself?

Wouldnâ€™t the world be a better place for everyone if I did it? 

Iâ€™m just a burden, I should help everyone by killing myself.

I should shoot my head off with a shotgun. Too bad I havenâ€™t got a gun...

Maybe I should step in front of a train.

Maybe I should travel as far away as I can and either starve myself or hang myself deep in some unknown forest.

These kinds of thoughts (translated to English) are daily thoughts for me. It feels like these thoughts are completely normal, like doesnâ€™t everyone hate themselves as much as I do? Not one minute goes by in my life during which I donâ€™t think about suicide. 

Itâ€™s the first thing I think about when I wake up, and throughout the day I think about it every couple of seconds. The thought is almost as automatic as breathing. Oftentimes when I go to the toilet, I look in the mirror and tell myself to kill myself.
