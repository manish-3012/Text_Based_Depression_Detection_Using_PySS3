Iâ€™m addicted to sadness and I want it to end. | 8months &amp; 6daysWhere do I begin? 

I guess with limited info: Iâ€™m bipolar depressive and I havenâ€™t been taking my medication as often as I should. It doesnâ€™t work like it used to. I know I should talk with a therapist or pharmacist, but with all the chaos in hospitals right now, I find excuses not to. 

Iâ€™m in the down-slump again. The mania is so freeing, but only lasts a while. The lows are horrid, so I often avoid the medication and indulge in my escapes to not be reminded of it (porn and sometimes weed). 

I know they bring up my tolerance and make the meds less effective, I know I should at least schedule an appointment and try to work out the craze between my ears. I swear I sometimes hear voices that are not there, I know there not there. Iâ€™m losing my-self; yet Iâ€™m afraid to tell my mom so she doesnâ€™t have to worry. Thereâ€™s already enough going on as it is, I would feel like a terrible person to add on to it. 

Which is why I have a date settled, January 4th 2021 at 11pm-12am. Loosely settled, cause my emotions ebbs and flows. That day is my birthday, and Iâ€™ll be 24. 

Iâ€™m losing hope. It always feels promising when I do have it, and always crushing when its absent. Iâ€™m tired of the cycle. Iâ€™m tired of myself, and Iâ€™m tired of letting my family down. My friends down, my self down. 

Iâ€™ve reminisced about my life so far and have noted some positives (going to Australia, having fun at concerts, seeing the movies I wanted to see, traveling 1/8th of the world) but I know it fails in comparasion. I mean, it always does, the-whole-grass-is-greener-on-the-other-side deal.  

What do I have to live for? My parents are aging, I donâ€™t like the career path Iâ€™m on because I found a way to cheat thru school. Iâ€™m unemployed and worthless most days. I try and ride the high mania brings, but it gets shot down prematurely. I never had a lover, or lost my virginity. 

I canâ€™t stop. Sadness is the only emotion to have a profound effect on me. Happiness is fleeting, determination needs to be worked on and Iâ€™m not giving myself the chance. I know when I did (and I have tried) I wouldnâ€™t be able to remember the chances and methods to try a different way. If only everything was easier said than done, I might have a chance to live and hopefully thrive with this condition engrained in my DNA. 

So, Iâ€™m giving myself one last attempt at life. To see where it goes. Jan 4, 2021 is the dead line. Once I graduate, maybe if I find a job and really learn how to live with myself in a positive way, will I postpone the deadline. 

I just want to stop the nagging feeling of, â€œI want to die. I want to die. I donâ€™t want to live anymore and suffer.â€ 

I appreciate you reading this far. It means a lot to get this off my chest as temporary comfort. 
Please stop me. I want some intervention because a part of me wants to live and see my best self. But that part is getting slowly ignited and engulfed. Will I have the willpower to turn my life around and see the garden of Eden? Or will I wallow in my pity, long enough to build the strength to carryout the deadline? I hope itâ€™s the first but my words mean nothing. Its the action that determines my fate.
