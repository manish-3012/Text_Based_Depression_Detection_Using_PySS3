I cant do itI'm sat here with the knot around my neck, ready to kill myself... I've written out my notes and everything, but I cant work up the fucking courage to actually do it. I keep thinking to myself what if I'm found too soon and wake up but with debilitating issues, or what if my family sees me in some horrific state... but at this point I feel that my choices are either this, or a life of being an alcoholic or drug abuser, and I dont want to live like that...
