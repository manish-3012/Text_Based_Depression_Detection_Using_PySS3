My efforts in asking for help are worthlessI just called the national suicide help hotline

They are worthless 

I called back to let them know how worthless they are. Even though I feel guilty. They are people will good intentions that are just completely worthless. 

I called for help and then was ushered off after a questionnaire for funding.  This is the first time Iâ€™ve reached out for help and they failed me. 

I know now that I am alone. Itâ€™s been confirmed. I canâ€™t rely on anyone to help make me me feel better especially when Iâ€™m at my worst. 

Fuck you. Iâ€™m going to go kill myself now thatâ€™s itâ€™s confirmed that I am completely on my own and reaching out is worthless
