Mommi issues turn suicidalIm  turning 22 soon. I canâ€™t tell you how much everyone and everything gets on my nerves. I can barely focus and study. And Thatâ€™s the only important thing in my mothers life, and She haunts me and bullies me. Then i blow up and tell her that shes bothering me and has never been a Real mother to me, then She Plays the victim and She gets migrenes, She vomits her head hurts as if its gonna explode. I canâ€™t . I Just fucking canâ€™t live like this. I Dont want to fkn exist.
