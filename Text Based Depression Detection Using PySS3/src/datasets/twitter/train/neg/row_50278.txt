Before you decide anything. Listen to meI donâ€™t think any of you should go through with your personal suicide pact. I had always dreamt of my aspirations with such passion I cannot bare to live with out them, and I was about to wipe those all away with the brilliant idea of taking my own life. Thanks to a few of you on here who still speak to me daily to keep check and keep me hopeful, and better. I ask all of you go do something different today that you wouldnâ€™t usually, be unique, try something new, something you wouldnâ€™t usually. Express yourself but not through violence, death is not kind when you do it to yourself, no matter your age just enjoy what you have and if you canâ€™t, tryâ€”anything!
