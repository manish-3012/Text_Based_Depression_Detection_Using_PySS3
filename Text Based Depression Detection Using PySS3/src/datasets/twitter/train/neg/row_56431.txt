I feel like I'm drowningNot a kind of gasping for air fighting to hang on kind of moment. More of a finding myself at the bottom of a lake stuck in the mud and giving up.

This year has been absolutely awful. 
I've lost friends, work, people...
I don't have a grasp on who I am or what I want. 
Everyone keeps asking me how I'm doing and about my future plans. 
I don't even want to be alive. 
But I nod and say I'm fine. 
I keep putting myself out there for other people.
I can listen, give advice, be your rock.
But I don't want to be a burden. 

It's so much effort to wake up and be productive. 
I just want to stop being a disappointment. 
I just want to stop being.
