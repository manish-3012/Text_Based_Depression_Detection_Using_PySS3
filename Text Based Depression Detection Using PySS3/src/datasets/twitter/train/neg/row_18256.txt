the worst part about wanting to dieIs knowing that no one would notice until it no longer benefited them. Like my original plan was to hang myself in my room tonight because I know no one would come check on me unless they need something from me. I made the mistake of mentioning my plan while drunk at a wedding a few days ago to someone I don't know and he tried to follow up by asking a mutual friend of ours for my phone number but I didn't respond because I doubt he actually cared, just wanted to feel self important about stopping me. But you know what stopped me? It was the idea that I shouldn't have said anything to anyone, not him, not even while drunk as a skunk. And now I've double failed because my 1.5 year old niece is asleep on my bed, my dogs are next to us on their beds on the floor, and my original plan is nonexistent. I'm left here, still wanting to die, but thinking of my ex, whom I was with for almost nine years, pretty sure for most of those nine year s we were going to get married because I threw myself into the relationship and received next to nothing in return. I still want to die, but she let me apologize to her, which fucked up my plans. I never thought she'd talk to me again. And now I'm still here, and I wish I wasn't.
