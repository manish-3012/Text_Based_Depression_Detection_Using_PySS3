A kid I go to school with is contemplating suicide, not sure what to do in my positionI'm not really friends with this kid, he's a freshman and I'm a senior. I used to talk to him in a class we shared we would talk about his favorite superheroes, sports, and video games. But we haven't had that class together for a while. All year people have picked on him, which I always try to stop, but recently he's finally fed up with it and has mentioned in tweets and in person to a few others that he wants to end his life and it seems pretty serious. Judging by his tweets I think he's a serious threat to himself and maybe others. I would talk to him about it but less then a week ago a girl told him my girlfriend had a crush on him because she thought it would be funny (fucked up I know) she asked me to deal with it and I tried to be as nice as possible but, with good reason, he was pretty mad and took it out on me. So I'm pretty sure he doesn't like me anymore. I would rather not take any of it to the principals or another authority figure in the school because I'm afraid of it getting out and I'm sure the bullying will just intensify. Sorry about the length I just want to make sure this guy is ok.
