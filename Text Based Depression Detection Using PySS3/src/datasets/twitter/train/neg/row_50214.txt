Just lost the last thing keeping me hereIt might sound really, really pathetic, but I just "lost" my only friend. We played video games together, never met in real life. I have no true friends in my real life, no prospects or talents, an abusive family, no SO, pretty much everything that makes someone have a shred of meaning, I don't have it. Logging on every night and hearing a familiar voice kept me grounded and gave me a reason to play the game again. We got into a fight (about the game, funnily enough) and the guy blocked me on EVERYTHING, even kicked me out of our discord server. He forgot to block me on the game's platform, and I pathetically tried saving the one positive social relationship in my life. The guy claimed he was high, and that he'd add me back later after I issued the most pathetic apology ever. I know he's not gonna add me back. I know I just lost, permanently, my only friend in the world. Now let's see how many nights I spend in a dark dorm room alone, with absolutely no one, before I finally get the stones to kill myself
