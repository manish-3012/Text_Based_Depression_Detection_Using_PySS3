Feeling Suicidal AgainGod. Fucking. Dammit. Why am I such a goddamn piece of shit? You know what my problem is? I overthink everything, and take myself too seriously. I try to be happy, to make changes in my life to cultivate happiness, but when it really comes to tackling my personal flaws, I just cannot fucking do it. This is why I'm socially awkward. This is why I can't laugh. This is why I lost my sense of humor. But the very notion of changing for the better scares my brain for some reason. It resists the personal change I have to make at every turn. I read recently that if you overthink everything and take yourself too seriously, unable to truly be in the moment, you are in effect wasting your life. God. Fucking. Dammit. My life is wasting away being stuck in my fucking head and this thought completely destroys me. It makes me decend back into suicidal thought. Nothing I did today matters because it didn't get me anywhere, and the worst part is all that shit was meant to bring me to a better place, where my goals are being accomplished. But I can't set fucking goals. I never fucking finish anything. I'm never focused in the now enough to learn, adapt, grow as a person, and make the most of my life. Fuck anxiety. Fuck low self esteem. I just want to fucking kill myself already. I have no real drive, no clear thoughts. Fucking nothing.
