I'm emotionally dead due to soul rape from psychotic voices of psychics, I feel like suicide might be the only way out but I want to try, to feel my heart again and have a soul... Can you help me?I won't go into detail regarding all the things I've done wrong but I'll [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/4je3vx/i_used_to_have_a_heart_now_ive_lost_myself_and/) a post of mine I made the other day...

Basically, I went from a warm and loving kid that dreamed of love and friendship whenever possible to what the post I just [linked](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/4je3vx/i_used_to_have_a_heart_now_ive_lost_myself_and/) said... 

I actually had a heart, a big heart, and I was genuinely good and it was all natural to me.

I remember once in high school I complimented this girl I liked and she said I was one of the sweetest guys she knew and she hugged me.

Complimenting people was natural for me and it was never to serve an ulterior motive... I felt love for people and because I was in pain, I always tried my hardest to make people happy... (I'll admit, I picked on some people in the past but it was mainly due to ignorance and social acceptance... I've apologized to the people I bullied and despite feeling emotionally dead, I did and do mean those apologies...)

I remember when that girl hugged me I felt love but I also felt depressed, like being sweet never gets a guy anywhere... I wish I could go back and tell myself how lucky I was to have the heart I once had...

I keep thinking back to these memories and dreams of love and hope and it's helping me in a way, I feel like maybe I'll make it back there and return to my true self...

I didn't write much about my current state because it just hinders my progress but read this [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/4je3vx/i_used_to_have_a_heart_now_ive_lost_myself_and/) and you'll see what happened...

My friend told me a couple days ago that I have to remember the beauty of my old dreams and after I started doing that, I began to feel a bit of improvement...

What advice do you guys have for me? I desperately want a heart like the past me, back when I was 13 - 17...

I know it's in me, I just need to feel it again... If you read that link you'll see that I went psychotic and experienced soul rape from the voices. That left me an empty, broken shell and while it happened I was convinced they were going to brutally murder me...

Thankfully I realized they're symptoms of psychosis but the damage has been done and now I need to recover...

Why is this on suicide watch? Because I almost want to kill myself if I can't feel that heart again... I know I won't do it, I have a 2 and a half year old brother and the thought of him seeing me dead and destroyed in a casket stops me... I also know my dad would be destroyed and my mom would be, too... But I think about suicide and it almost seems like the answer... I go through Hell every fucking day and it's driving me insane. I'd rather die than live like this forever so I need help, I can't let my family down and I can't let that kid from the past die, having lost the only thing he ever had...

What should I do? All I want is to feel again, to love and dream and be genuinely good... 

Half way through my 17th year I became suicidally depressed due to body dysmorphic disorder and the beginning of psychosis... A few months after I turned 18 I decided to kill myself but then changed my mind, thinking I'd give myself a few years, work to save money for my family, then kill myself in my twenties...

A couple months after this the horrible psychotic soul rape happened and my psychosis went into full gear... I bought a rope after being in the psyche ward for a month... A week after I got out of the psyche ward I bought twenty feet of the thickest rope I could find, went home, tied the hangman's noose and prepared my last meal... Just before going downstairs to wait out my dad going to sleep, my dad confronted me about the receipt to the rope he found and he saved my life by calling the cops and having me go back to the psyche ward for another month...

I was so terrified of being murdered that I was going to hang myself in the garage until my dad stopped me and I eventually began to realize the voices weren't real people...

So I do have it in me to kill myself but I won't unless I spend decades trying to feel my heart and fail, then I'd kill myself (my parents would probably be dead and my brother would be old enough to understand and not be as traumatized)...

What can I do to fix my murdered heart and feel again, feel the good emotions and love I used to feel naturally?
 
Any advice/help is really appreciated, thanks in advance...
