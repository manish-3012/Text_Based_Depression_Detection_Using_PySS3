i lost my only reason to livein october i met this boy and we quickly became best friends and i ended up falling in love with him. he's my first love. before i met him i was really depressed. i felt like a ghost, i felt like a worthless piece of shit and i constantly fantasized about suicide.

i decided that i was going to stay here for him. for months he told me that i was special, that i was the only one he trusted, that i helped with his depression and anxiety. he convinced me not to kill myself. he made me so happy and for the first time in ages i actually started thinking about my future. i wanted to live and i started to love my life.

but around the end of january we drifted apart. he found new friends and i guess i just became less important to him. we went from talking for 5 hours almost everyday to talking for 5 minutes once a week. i feel like i've lost him and i feel like he hates me now.

i feel like he's finally realized how worthless and fucking horrible i really am. without him, i've lost my reason to live.

i have nothing stopping me from killing myself now and i've never wanted to die so badly in my entire life. all i do is think about death. my grades are dropping worse than they ever have. i've dropped from the top of my class and i feel like i've fucked up my chances at the career i want. my mind keeps telling me that everyone i ever love will leave me. 

i've set a date a few months from now. i've decided that if i still have nothing to live for by then, i'll kill myself. i feel so hopeless.
