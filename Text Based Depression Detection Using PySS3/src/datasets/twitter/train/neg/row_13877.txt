Guys I ripped apart a suicidal person, how do I deal with the guilt?[https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jhuf26/my\_parents\_called\_a\_parasite\_and\_said\_im\_lazy/ga2akk3/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jhuf26/my_parents_called_a_parasite_and_said_im_lazy/ga2akk3/?context=3)

I shouldn't have written this, I should not have written this. My purpose wasn't to trivialize his struggles at all. I wrote at the end of my post that he has problems and he deserves help. Maybe it came off as wrong because I used the work "fucking", maybe it sounded condescending? If that person is reading this can you please tell me if you're alive or not??
