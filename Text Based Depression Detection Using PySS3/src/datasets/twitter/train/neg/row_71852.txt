I really want to do it but if I go so does my girlfriendI really wanna kill myself and lately I have been really close to doing it but I just can't leave my girlfriend alone, she is struggling with depression and she is getting better. I can't just let myself go and ruin her progress, not only would it ruin her progress she would kill herself as well in the act. This motivates me to go on but lately it's becoming harder and harder, I can't fail her and I am so afraid I will. I don't know what to do anymore.
