When the person you love the most and who you thought loved you back just as much, gets mad at you when youâ€™re not feeling good. This is like my 4th post today and I deleted them all because honestly I want someone to talk with me but no one is. I need advice so badly.My partner is mad at me for being depressed. He says itâ€™s not the depression itself but he hates the lack of motivation. Iâ€™m sure if I had the mild cute symptoms like crying all the time, heâ€™d be happier. But a suicidal and unmotivated partner? Huge turn off. I want to kill myself and just escape everything. Nothing in my life has worked properly and now loving someone has gone wrong. Wtf should I do now. I just need advice. Please help.
