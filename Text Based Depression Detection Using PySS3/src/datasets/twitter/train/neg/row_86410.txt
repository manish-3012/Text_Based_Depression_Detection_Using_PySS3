I've got everything planned. I'm going to kill myself on my birthday,  March 27 is my last day to suffer. A bottle of Tylenol, vodka and a razor have my name written on it. I don't care anymore. I can't do this. I can't keep pretending. I can't keep plastering a smile on my face. I can't keep lying. I can't. 

Until then, farewell.
