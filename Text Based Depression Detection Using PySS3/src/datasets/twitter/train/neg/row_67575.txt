Life isn't meant for everyoneWhy can't I die already..? What did I do wrong...?  I could have a body that doesn't torture me as much, but doctors chose that I didn't deserve that. Nobody gave a shit when there was a chance to stop this stupid condition from progressing, and nobody gives a shit of this living hell now. This physical fucking agony never ends. I'm expected to just keep suffering. I'm expected to somehow be brain-dead enough to be happy with this misery. People who get to live with a perfectly fine body all around me are constantly reminding me of the basic fucking thing I didn't even get a say in. I wasn't even told why my body was going downhill that badly. I never had a freaking chance. I already wasn't born with money or a family, so why couldn't I at least get this basic stupid thing? These people born with bodies that never failed...telling me to keep suffering...
