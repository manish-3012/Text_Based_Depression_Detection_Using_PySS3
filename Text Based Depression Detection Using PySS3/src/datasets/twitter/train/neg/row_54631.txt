My life is pointlessI'm going to be homeless in 48 hours because my mom stop paying rent and moved to do IHSS suddenly and left everything up to my brother and me and my brother doesn't do shit.

She took the car I've been paying on that she cornered me to even buy and never taught me how to drive. Now they want to put a house in my fucking name. I won't. But now since she only told us a week ago we need to find a new place since evictions... Idk what to do. I'm not stable. I just started seeing my therapist last week but she hasn't texted me about my new schedule. Nobody cares anymore I feel like I'm just being used ill never be happy I've tried so hard and everything I touch crumbles. I even miss my ex Yuki T. But I fucked it up by holding his cheating on him even after we tried to be friends I had a dream about him last night and I can't shake it. 

Right now we are packing apartment and we have no electricity. I just I know I'm not making sense at all. I just I just ifk broken I'm done in tired of this world this has constantly been my life and I'm tired of living I really am I know I say this before but nobody is home and I'm going too do it I rather be dead than continue in this shit world
