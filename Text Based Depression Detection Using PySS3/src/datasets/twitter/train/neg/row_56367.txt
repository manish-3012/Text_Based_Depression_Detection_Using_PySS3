She keeps cryingI had a decent day for the first time in a while. Should have known it couldnâ€™t last long.

My mother has already begun crying and yelling. I used to feel sympathy when I was younger but itâ€™s been going for years. Sheâ€™ll get drunk and sob about how much she hates her life and doesnâ€™t want to be here. Ironic huh?

And yet all I can think is at least I cry silently and keep it to myself. Does that make me a bad person? I dunno.
