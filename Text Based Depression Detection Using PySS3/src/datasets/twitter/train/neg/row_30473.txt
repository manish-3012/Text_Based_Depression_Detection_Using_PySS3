Please help me.I feel bad all the time.  I am trying hard not to and I still feel bad.  I'm such a burden on everyone and everyone who knows me is worse off for it.  I know everyone says that is not true but it is because I make everyone feel sad even though I try to be happy because sometimes I can't control myself and become emotional in public.  It's so pathetic.  Yesterday I started almost crying because someone said something and it was so embarrassing and I know it annoyed everyone.  I know I'm overreacting but I'm just incapable of being a normal person.  I'm trying everything to be better and I'm on medication and go to therapy and all of that but it doesn't help because nothing helps because I'm a pathetic waste of space.  Yesterday I tried finding a knife but I couldn't find anything and once I find something I can do it.  I just don't want anything that I could mess up and just be alive but worse off and make everyone hate me even more.  No one likes me and no one who has ever known me well likes me because I am so pathetic and useless.  Not any of my friends or family or anyone.  Even if they like me at first they start to realize how pathetic I am and start to get annoyed.  I had one friend whom I thought liked me alright but I realized yesterday I annoy him too.  I annoy EVERYONE.  I can't do anything right.  I'm trying to study for my exams and I'm having so much trouble because I can't concentrate because it's pointless.  It's just so scary to do it because it might hurt or I might mess up and I'm so pathetic that I'm scared of that.  I just don't want to be a burden on anyone.
