Amazing grades but still want to kill myselfToday I got my final university assignment result through and I got an A4. This means Iâ€™ll be receiving a BSc Ordinary with Distinction. However all Iâ€™ve ever known throughout my life is being abandoned by people I love which has also happened again recently and led me to ostracising myself (as well as being ostracised by others). Now Iâ€™m in too much emotional pain and I just want to kill myself but Iâ€™m stuck with my survival instinct and itâ€™s torture. Iâ€™d initially set my date for today (because of it being my final results day) but now I canâ€™t go through with it. I hate life.
