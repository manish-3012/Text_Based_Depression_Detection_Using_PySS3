Iâ€™m homeless and aloneEveryday I live is torture. I have no friends, my boyfriend is beyond tired of me and Iâ€™m homeless because my family doesnâ€™t love me. Whatâ€™s the point of living like this, I got dealt a shitty hand in life but why put up with it. Iâ€™m only 19 but I think my time is up. I have no one else to say this to but Iâ€™m sorry for being such an unbearable fuck up. God help me.
