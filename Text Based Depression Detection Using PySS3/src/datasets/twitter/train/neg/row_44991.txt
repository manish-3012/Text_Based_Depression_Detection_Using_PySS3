I want to die, but I just don't know when to.For the past 3 years, I've been thinking of ending my life. However, I always think that these little problems aren't enough to be the reason for ending my life.
I'm really confused now, do I have to wait for a bigger problem to come? And now I just feel that I'm not ready for this at all.
