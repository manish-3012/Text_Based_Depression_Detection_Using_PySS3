Goddamn itFucking kill me or let me die. Please one of the two. Iâ€™m so tired of being alone and Iâ€™m so tired of fucking living. Every day drones on. What day is it? What time is it? I donâ€™t know because everyday is the same. The only reason Iâ€™m alive still is because I donâ€™t want my cats going to the humane society and being separated. Itâ€™s a stupid reason to keep living I know but god their the only ones who like me. I wanna just die. Itâ€™s all just one long day with nothing to end it. I close my eyes one day and open them the same day. Frozen in time.
