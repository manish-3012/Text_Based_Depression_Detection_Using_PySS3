Just looking for some advice!So i'm in college. It's fun and I enjoy it but this year i've taken on a lot more responsibility than I've had in the past. I have a job and I'm an officer for a club sports team which is quite a big time commitment, in addition to being a student. I've just felt really overwhelmed lately, almost crushingly so. I've called my parents and talked to them, and all they seem to be saying is that it's part of growing up and that this is how life is. 

I'm not suicidal, but it's something i've consistently had thoughts about  since probably middle school. I don't think i would ever do it but sometimes i just wonder why more people don't? it seems pretty hopeless. You go to school to get a job that will make you enough money to send your kids to college so they can get jobs to make enough money to send their kids to college...sometimes i think maybe having a family or something would be rewarding but at the same time I would feel bad bringing someone into this world who would have to suffer through this same bullshit. 

Anyone have some advice on why life isn't just a huge suckfest?
