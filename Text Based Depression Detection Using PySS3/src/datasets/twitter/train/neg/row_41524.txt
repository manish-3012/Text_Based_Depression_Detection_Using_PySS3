I'm sure I'll kill myself some dayAs the title suggests, I'm pretty sure that I am going to commit suicide one day. I don't know when but I'm pretty sure it will happen. Not sure how, but I'll figure something out. There are enough bridges and cliffs here anyways. 
I have felt like this almost every day since my girlfriend of 2 years left me. I still love her. She one day decided that she didn't anymore. So here I am. I still see her sometimes but I always try to avert my eyes so that she doesn't see me. I don't want to go back to her, I don't want to talk to her. She probably doesn't care anyways. I want to go back in time when everything was good. When she still loved me. She saved me, pulled me up and showed me what happiness is. Now that's all gone. She was all I ever cared for. The love of my life. I have literally nothing I care about anymore. Nothing. I don't care about myself. I think I don't really have any place in this world, I am literally useless. I am absolutely replaceable. 
All that I know is it's going to happen some day.
