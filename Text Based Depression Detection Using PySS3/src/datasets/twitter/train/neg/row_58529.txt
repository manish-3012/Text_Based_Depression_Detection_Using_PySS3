I may have evolved to quicklyMusic and people speak for me and my mind won't let it go I just can't seem to lower my conscienness in my brain ugh like I need to get fucked up just to lower it back to normal when people stare at me and I'm not looking my body reacts and I start breaking out instantly and when crowds are around me I get an anxiety attack and I feel my heart racing and then I space out and reflect on my needs to be here then I just get numb and my mind's dull  I just gotta cope with these thoughts for a sec and quicky do something but I just wanna fuckin go already ugh im actually jealous of old people and I'm only 21 years old I feel fucked in the head I really do.
