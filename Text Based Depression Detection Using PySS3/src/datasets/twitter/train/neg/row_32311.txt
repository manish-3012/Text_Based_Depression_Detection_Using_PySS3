I feel as though life is meaningless and suicide is painlessThe only thing preventing me from snuffing it is my deep love of my family and how they love me dearly and couldn't bear to see me dead. I'm 21 and male if that helps. 

I'm upper class white and have loving parents and go to college. The fuck is wrong with me? I have friends. I have girls I could ask out. Fuck. 

I'm miserable because I feel women will reject me because of my height. I'm 5 foot 7. But for some reason or another I can't ask a girl out because of it. Or maybe that's a red herring, I don't know. In any case I have no romantic/sex life and that may be the source of my present sorrow.
Or it could be I have no idea what my future will bring. I'm frightened of it. I'm frightened. I'm scared. 

Thanks for reading.
