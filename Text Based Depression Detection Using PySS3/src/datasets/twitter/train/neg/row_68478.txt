It's BackHey everyone,

So, I'm going through a tough time emotionally and I'm really pretty fragile. The TL;DR version is that I lost control of myself and now I'm feeling pretty unlovable, monstrous and self-loathing. I've been in this place before (the last time resulted in some pretty severe self-harm) and since the last "incident" I've been able to keep a tighter control on myself. Anyway, things are slipping now and while I'm not feeling suicidal at present, I'm beginning to have pervasive thoughts. Disturbing mental imagery and when I let my mind wander or allow my thoughts to just drift without direction I find myself beginning to make a plan. I guess I'm here because I don't want to fall back to the bottom or reach a point where I feel hopeless. Does any of this make sense to anyone? Is there anyone who can offer some comforting words right now?
