I'm an amputee and don't see the point of this anymoreI was told they had to amputate my toe yesterday because of a bone infection. When I woke up from surgery I was told that they had found more infection in the foot and had to remove my big toe the knuckle behind it and the bone that ran from my knuckle to my ankle. I am having an extremely hard time accepting it and seeing any kind of food outcome that my life can have after this was done. I feel worthless, I have to re learn how to walk and get around again and learn how to manage the pain. With the amount of pain and the treatment that I have received in the hospital and will probably receive the entire time I'm here I dont see a point in carrying on (here is a list of what has happened while in the hospital 
Natalie 3rd floor act as if she was going to assault me ( felt physical threat, rude and condescending)
Ashley 5th floor act as if she was going to assault me ( felt physical threat, rude and condescending)
Jaclyn 5th floor charge nurse (rude and condescending threatened me)
Francis 5th floor (condescending attitude)
Katia charge nurse 3800 floor ( rude and rolled her eyes twice while talking about complaints, condescending attitude)
Have been laying here naked since 4 pm yesterday( no gown offered. Until I complained to x ray teck)
When admitted to fifth floor room had no top sheet, no blanket, no towels, no toilet paper, no essentials (deodorant, toothpaste or toothbrush, mouth wash, or tub that contains all of that) 
No iv pole in room was stuck to bed pressed call button to use restroom and no one showed up and almost pissed myself ( I waited 20 mins to the point I couldn't wait anymore and had to piss in sink because I couldn't physically get to the toilet. On top of all this I feel like I will only be a burden on my family and dont see a point in living any longer. I'm at my wits end and believe that I will try and end it once I am released from here.
