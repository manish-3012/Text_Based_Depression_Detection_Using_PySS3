I need some advise.I pray to God every night to take my life instead of someone who really wants to live. But I guess I am not good enough because I am still here. I guess I will have to answer my own prayer. I almost lost my battle last few days because I committed suicide for the 3rd time. I am tired really. And I don't know how to get rid of this suicidal thoughts in me.
