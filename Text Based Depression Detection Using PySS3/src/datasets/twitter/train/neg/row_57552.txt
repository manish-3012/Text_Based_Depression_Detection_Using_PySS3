I donâ€™t actually want to kill myself, but I canâ€™t stop thinking about it...I have suicidal thoughts daily. Sometimes itâ€™s all I can think about. I donâ€™t think I actually want to kill myself, but I just canâ€™t stop thinking about it. But heaven forbid I tell a doctor or other professional that. Theyâ€™d be required to put me in 72 hour lockup. 


I know Iâ€™m depressed. And Iâ€™ve asked for help. Iâ€™ve tried to share what Iâ€™m feeling with my spouse, but he either says â€œKnock the sh*t offâ€ or â€œShut the f### upâ€. 


I was on meds for a little while, after I had my last child, but the doctor told me that postpartum depression â€œonly lasts three monthsâ€ and â€œthese medications were never meant to be used long term.â€ He also told me that everyone thinks about suicide from time to time. But what if Iâ€™m depressed long term? And what if all I can do is cry until my tear ducts are raw? Some days it feels like ending it is literally the only cure for the pain I feel. But then, I realize I donâ€™t want that either.
