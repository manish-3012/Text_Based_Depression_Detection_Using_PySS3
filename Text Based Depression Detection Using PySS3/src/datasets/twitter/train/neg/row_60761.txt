Please I need help. I think I will try to commit suicide soon.There are so many things happening in my life right now and none of them are good things. I'm not a good person. I complain, I'm very negative, I'm bad at my job, and I get into bad situations by impulse. No one likes me at my job, and I annoy everyone. I know some people may say these things as result of cognitive distortions, but I KNOW these things are true. I'm not sure I should hospitalize myself because I would have to leave my job, and I'm not sure they would be understanding about that. Plus inpatient is really expensive, so I'm at a lost at the moment.
