Things are just getting worse and worse.I've always been so against suicide. Always thought it so selfish, and so weak.

I've never understood the pain a person can go through like I do nowadays. I'm not specifically suicidal yet, as in no actual intend yet. But so often I have suicidal thoughts. Thinking about how I would do it. What letters I would leave to my mom and other loved ones. I'm quite scared it's getting to the point that I'll have the intend. Not because I'm scared of dying. I no longer am. I long for being dead. I just don't want to do this to the people that love me. But I really have no idea how I'm ever going to survive this.

Those that had similar thoughts to mine, did it get to the point of intend for you? How long did that take?
