I attempted suicide almost 4 months ago &amp; I wish I hadnâ€™t failed.I donâ€™t want to go on but Im to afraid to do it myself after last time. I drove around just hoping to be hit by a drunk reckless person. I know Iâ€™m not supposed to feel this way my life is going so â€œwellâ€ I just canâ€™t do it. Iâ€™m just so tired of myself. For now Iâ€™m alive because Iâ€™m a coward
