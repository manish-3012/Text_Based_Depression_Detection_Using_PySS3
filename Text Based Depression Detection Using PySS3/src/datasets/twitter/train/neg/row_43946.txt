I have nothing my dad didn't even love me enough to stayI was actually happy the other day. My older sister came in town. She's the only reason I haven't killed myself yet. I felt like maybe I could make it work for her. But it's not true, Nothing is gonna come of my life. If I try to tell my mom I want to get medication, she will just tell me she had it worse or I have nothing to be sad about. I tried to substitute it with alcohol but I just got caught and grounded.  I'm never allowed to even go anywhere. (pre corona) I don't even have that many friends to begin with, as I haven't been in school since 6th grade. (4 years ago) I have 1 actual good friend the rest are not real friends. These so called "friends" never invite me to party's unless they need me to help them rank up in R6. They never initiate conversations I always do I don't have the energy to study to try to try to finish night school to go to college. I'm just gonna work a minimum wage job until I can get a gun and shoot myself. I can't cut myself because my mom will notice and ground me or take my stuff, and PS4 is the only thing that helps me not be alone with my thoughts. PS4 is the only thing I have, I have no skills other than video games. No social skills at all. I have social anxiety, but the thing I want most in the world is a girl to hold and call my girlfriend, but guess what. I'm not even allowed to date. I'm fucking 16 and not allowed to do jack shit. I can't take it anymore someday soon I'm just gonna od on anything I can find
