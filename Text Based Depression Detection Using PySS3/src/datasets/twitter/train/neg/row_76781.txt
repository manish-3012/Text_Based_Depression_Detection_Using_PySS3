Fuck the pandemicWanted to kill myself but the pandemic ruined my plans. My parents (a doctor and a government worker) work overtime every fucking day and me killing myself right now would make their lives even worse like c'mon... They've got enough going on as is. Don't want them to be bothered with a funeral.

At the same time I have no choice. My time is running out and I'm not willing to postpone it yet again. It's been too long. Who knows how long this is gonna go on for anyways so why not get my work done with.

I'll be at peace.
