Update on meWell after about a week in the psychiatric unit I got out and ife sucks even more after my failed attempt, parents no longer trust me, girlfriend thinks I'm crazy and her best friend's mother (who is a nurse at the hospital I was at) found out I was at the Psychiatric Unit and the mother told her daughter and she spread that shit like wildfire. So no I don't think I like being alive much more than I would love to be dead.
tl;dr I wish I was sucessful
