About the noteHi! I just wrote my suicide note, but I don't know where to put it. 
Right now, I'm thinking of asphyxiation, but I'm also thinking of walking to the bridge near a university.

The thing is, it's easy to find a place if I die through asphyxiation. But if I choose to go all the way to the bridge, it'll be hard. Should I just keep the note in my coat pocket?
