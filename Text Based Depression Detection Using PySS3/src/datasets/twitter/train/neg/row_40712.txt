Suicide seems okayI don't have any real problems, but I can't bring myself to care about anything. the thought of finishing college is painful, getting a job is just a chore to live, and I don't see myself being in a relationship anytime. I also have become uninterested in the things that I used to enjoy and have no aspirations. is it worth living if nothing interests me?
