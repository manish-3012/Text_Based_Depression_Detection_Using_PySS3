57 hours, I decided to stop.I don't know, I don't even know what to say. my best friend came over and stopped me, she wouldn't leave until I drank water so I ran past her after an hour or two of standing in the kitchen with her blocking the exit to go back to bed. She quietly left a few minutes after that and I just... laid in bed and realized that I'm really going to hurt her, another friend, and my parents at the absolute least. So I drank water. I read a post here about how we think people love us out of obligation, but in reality they know perfectly well they aren't forced to stay here yet they do anyway, waiting for us to grow back into a healthy person. I really hate how good of a friend she is, and I hurt because I know not everyone has that person in their life. I don't know what I will do but I've never gotten professional help, so I should probably check off seeing a therapist before killing myself.

I thought I was certain about dying and I was ready to deny myself water and food until I became unconcious. If my family found me and took me to the hospital I was prepared, because I was wearing a shirt that read "No water, food, fluids, or oxygen. Do not remove shirt." But after the distress of losing my job (for the 3rd time....) yesterday passed I started questioning myself, and I'm glad I did and I'm really, really glad my friend found out something was wrong because I didn't tell anyone I knew.
