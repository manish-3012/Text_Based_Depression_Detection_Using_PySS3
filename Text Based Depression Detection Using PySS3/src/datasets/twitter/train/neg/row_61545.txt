Help, pleaseI am a 24 year old grad student - just went through a nasty breakup and have been, for the past couple of weeks, uninterested in eating, working, thinking ...

To graduate, I have to submit a thesis on Friday but I am so down, and so low, that I literally cannot motivate myself to write. 

I've been trying hard to be positive - anytime I get angry or sad, I think about how, in a few weeks, I'll be graduated and out of the state and away from this place that holds a lot of memories. After the breakup, I called a therapist in the city where I am moving to and she is ready to start working with me as soon as I get there; all of these things I am excited for. 

However, my ability to "just push through" these last few weeks has absolutely disappeared. I feel like such a failure for not being able to compartmentalize, and for letting this breakup so deeply influence my life at this moment - I just want to pretend I am OK long enough to make it out of school. 

Additionally, I have been dealing with this depression and hopelessness the entire year - writing and working and whatnot has been challenging this entire time but the breakup has pushed me so far into this place where I really don't recognize myself. 

Currently, thoughts of suicide have been floating around - I don't have a plan, and I don't want to do it. I just feel that trying to fight through the next few weeks is a lot harder than I have been telling myself it will be and I feel very lost as to what to do.

If anyone has had a similar situation or can think of advice, please let me know. I really appreciate it.
