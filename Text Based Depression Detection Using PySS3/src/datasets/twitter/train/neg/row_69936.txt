ConflictedFor years now not a day has gone by where I have not thought about suicide. I just feel like an animal living in an artificial environment, ultimately no different from the animals we eat. To me, life has no purpose. You can give it your own purpose, but I personally don't want to. 

Are all these feelings pointless though? Are they even valid or do I just need medication? Will the person I am now just disappear and leave a more or less happy one? What should I do if I don't want to abandon my old ideas, replace them with optimism, and begin loving the aspects of life that I dislike now?
