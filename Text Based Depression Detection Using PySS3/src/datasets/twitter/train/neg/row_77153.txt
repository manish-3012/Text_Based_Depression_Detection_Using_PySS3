I just tried to kill myselfFirst I tried to tightening my belt around my neck. This just made it hard to breathe. So then I put a plastic bag on my head and then tightening my belt around the bag. I started ruining out of air very quickly. I realised I was going to die. I ripped the bag off my head, I was like a reflex. That is the only way I can explain it.

I'm scared. I don't know what to do.
