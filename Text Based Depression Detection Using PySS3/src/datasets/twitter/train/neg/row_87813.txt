I'm really stressed out.For about a year I've been an atheist living with extremely religious parents. I don't feel safe telling my dad that I'm not a christian anymore because of how he talks about atheists as "stupid and hateful" and his reaction when he found out one of my friends is an atheist, so I've been faking christianity, but I can't take the stress of living a lie anymore. I've been having suicidal thoughts lately and I don't know what to do. Please help.
