Time passes, I inch slowly forward into the abyss. My goal.It's hard to do this alone,  but it's for they best. Talking to the void in here is the only place I can safely vent. 

I don't really have friends anymore.  The weighty of what I needed to get myself back on track was too heavy for those around me.  I need too much.   People shouldn't have to carry me.  

I guess they don't need too, I'm quite functional.  I show up to work every day.   I actually just bought a TV, though I don't know why.  Credit cards are weird.  I've been looking at buying one for two years now. An open box deal.  YOLO.  Now I'm lost as to what to do with it.  The box sits in the middle of my single room living space.  I have too much junk.  Furniture stacked upon each other from when I had a completely funrnished apartment. Down sizing is annoying. 

I miss having people in my life.  I miss the person I once was.  But it's better to be alone.  at this point,  it's been long enough. the pepole who once knew me are so far removed, they won't shed a teAR when I pass. Odds are they will never find out.  I'll just be mysterious memory.  People will wonder what happened over a cup of tea. Imagining a crazy future for me that will never be. But they will never find out I didn't make it. And when they do... just a simple thought of "Oh, that's a shame. I thought this person was going to be someone" 

I'm old now. Not really. Just old enough to not be young. I never matched people in my age group. Too far ahead... at least that's what everyone thought. Noone ever realized how far behind I was, and always will be. There's no point in trying to catch up.  Quite frankly there's not really anything to catch up to. An imaginary race. But it still hurts.  

I don't want to be alone when I finally kill myself. But, I can't afford to hurt anyone.  I must be alone.
