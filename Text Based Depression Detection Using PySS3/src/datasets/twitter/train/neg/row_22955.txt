cognitive dysfunctionAnyone else struggling with cognitive issues? I'm at a point in my life where I feel I can no longer take care of myself as the basic skills needed to be successful are not present in my range of cognitive abilities. 

As I've gotten older I feel my cognitive strengths have weakened and I can no longer process new information like I was able to even ten years ago. I find myself stressed out and anxious over decision making. I have been told by employers that I am easily distracted and have made mistakes on the job and been called out on them.

In addition to losing my basic ability to make decisions, I suffer from anxiety which is making over coming obstacles almost impossible. Trying to find new work spirals me into a anxious and depressed state where I question my ability to perform. Hindering my success at securing new work.

I feel like I am failing at life and that things are only going to get worse for me. I can handle the depression and the anxiety, but to feel stupid and incapable is encouraging my exit. 

I can't seem to win at life so what is the point in continuing it? I am suffering daily, everything I had is now lost.

Other than the act of suicide itself, and it's complications, the only thing I seem to be holding on for is the fact that my parents would be devastated. I'm trying to live for them, but it is becoming almost impossible to do so as I seem less capable of doing the basics to just survive. I won't go homeless for them.
