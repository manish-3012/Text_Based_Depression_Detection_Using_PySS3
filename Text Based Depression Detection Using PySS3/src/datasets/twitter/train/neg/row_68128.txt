Deep spiraling down slowly. Cant see the end.  But I want it to end. My two little one are hard to leave. I don't see a better day coming. Husband to a good wife for 15yrs. High school sweet hearts. To great kids 8 and 5. Have a great job. I don't understand why I what to end it but I'm more depressed everyday. I don't have friends because I'm kind of a hermit. Any advice?
