This is it for me.In high school, I dated a girl online for three years. We were passionately in love, and she was going to move to America so we could get married after high school. I had a mental breakdown some time around age 17 and I broke things off. I was paranoid that she would abandon me, so I left her first. 

Weâ€™ve had absolutely zero contact in the last four years, but Iâ€™ve never moved on. Iâ€™ve never loved anyone else. In the last few months, Iâ€™ve been able to track down a lot of her social media and Iâ€™ve been sending her messages begging for her to take me back, that Iâ€™m sorry and that I love her, but to no response. 

A few days ago, she posted on her Twitter a drawing she did for her girlfriend. She moved on.

Thereâ€™s no point in living without her in my life. Iâ€™ve made up my mind. Iâ€™m going to purge my belongings, tie up any loose ends, write a note, and take some pills. I know exactly how Iâ€™m going to do it so I wonâ€™t fail. Iâ€™ve struggled with my mental health for a long time, but Iâ€™ve never attempted before. 

I know I probably sound like an obsessive freak, but... I am an obsessive freak. Weâ€™re soulmates. Star-crossed. Destined. If she doesnâ€™t see that, thereâ€™s nothing I can do but die.
