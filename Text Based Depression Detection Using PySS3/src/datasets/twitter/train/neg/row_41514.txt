What the fuck is wrong with me?Why can't I be normal? Why can't I talk to people? Why do I keep everyone I love in the dark about my current state?

More importantly why can't I just kill myself? I've been thinking about it constantly for years and I just can't seem to do it. Am I a failure even at something so dumb? Can't work, can't eat, can't even die? lol

At this point I'm just ruining my life for no good reason. The worst part is that I know I'll be around to deal with the consequences because I can't kill myself which just fucking sucks.


No need to reply. Just needed to put this meltdown into words and get it out of my head.
