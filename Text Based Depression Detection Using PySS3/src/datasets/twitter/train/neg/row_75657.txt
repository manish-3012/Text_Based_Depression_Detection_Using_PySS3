someone on reddit told me they're going to kill themselvesI commented on someone's post about how badly they took a picture.

He responded a few days later he deleted the post and he hates his life and wants to kill himself. He said therapy hasn't worked in the past and was just a waste of time for his family.

There is no personal info anywhere on his account and his username is of an anime character. 

Please help
