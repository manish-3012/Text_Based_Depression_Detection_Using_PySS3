nowhere to turnNot even in my own fucking community am I able to get decency. Everyone just screams at me and berates me and doesn't realize how fucking much I'm struggling. I'm being ripped apart inside and no one will ever, ever understand. It hurts so fucking much. There's no way out of here. I'm a monster, there's no way to save me and I don't know why I'm writing this. I never got to be a fucking kid, of course I'm going to act out like this. I've been abused all of my life and for what, to die at 16 by my own hands? That's probably what everyone wants. Even if they don't, it's too late. laters
