Im braking apart goodbyeIm fucking braking down. Everyday is the same old shit over and over. To day is what setted me off. I was having a nice day With my family, we had to got to my nans house (We have a good relation shit but once and a while she'll become retardedly angry.) to drop off her Groceries. We went inside and i went to the living room to see my sick/dying cat ''moe''. I made the mistake of siting down on the couch were moe's cat dish is. My nan walks in annoyed and noticed the dish was gone. She had a fit blaming me for loosing it. Saying i took it some wheres. I said ''i didn't take why would i'' she replys ''YOU DID!''   i replyed sarcastically ''yep i totally took the cats dish'' she had a tempter and started yelling at me i argued back. My uncle said to her you left the cats dish out here (kitchen) instead of her apologizing to me she continues to blame me ''you took the fucking dish out here'' i said ''why the fuck would i take it, man up and take the blame'' she told me '' go fuck your self you cunt'' i said ''fuck you im leaving'' i walked out she would let drive me home so i was pissed off walked home. (angers me my pussy family Wouldn't even help me out) i went home. Not taking it easy i smashed a desk and 2 holes in my wall. I walked out went skateboarding got back home and asked my mom why nan wont fess up. That made it worse? My family is so FUCKING FAR US NANS ASS THEY ARE BLAMING ME EVEN THO THEY SAW HER TAKE THE DISH IN mom started calling my an asshole, fucker, bastard ect...
