Lost motivation and all hopeHonestly my life is shit.

I've wasted all my money on weed. I haven't had a job in a year. I have no Medical/Dental benefits that cover me.

Thing is, you need a job to survive in this world. I have no motivation to hold onto one.

edit: Also, my family is pretty much the reason I haven't gone through with it. I couldn't even begin to understand how they'd cope with it.
