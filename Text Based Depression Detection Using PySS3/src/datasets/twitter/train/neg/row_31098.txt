I'm 18, I get urges to hurt people and I want to be dead. (LONG)Hi this isnt going to be very well laid out and there will be errors throughout as my current mindstate is very bad and ive had to type/talk about stuff like this more times than i can count, i realise now it is very long so I have bolded different sections to make navigating easier and less boring.



**Career issues** : Would rather die than work, as any possible job available to me is essentially the same as suicide but drawn out over 60 years and even less fun. Made much worse by anxiety and depression



**Relationship** : I don't trust anybody, *especially* so with significant others. I constantly think they hate me, want to leave me and want to cheat at first opportunity, also anxiety sometimes makes sex impossible which only adds embarrassment and more anxiety into the mix. I get thats not the case, thats why theyre with me but nonetheless i cant control it.


**Anger**: Usually a very calm facade protects me and everyone pictures me as a very chilled, lighthearted and joking person, but fuck is that a hard act to keep up.  i have a very short temper and frequently hit or stab walls/ objects over little to nothing. on a weekly basis i get urges to physically hurt or even kill people, and not even *bad* people, but instead random people who have done nothing, or something irrational like them repeating themselves, when on SSRI's this increases to almost constantly, and the meds also bring out intense paranoia. When i was younger (12-14) I had a morbid curiosity for death and have seen hundreds of videos/ gifs of people losing their life/ being tortured in horrible ways. Whilst in a 'good' mental state i have affection for my loved ones but every couple days something else takes over and i wish for horrible things like my parents dying in a car crash or my friends getting stabbed for no reason; which is very contradictory to my old self and very worrying.


**The REAL Me** : All of this is weird as I have always been open minded, well meaning and pacifistic. When I see people with mental issues I'm the first to message them offering help and i care so much about so much, my friends, my family, every human on this earth i feel strongly for and i have a deep love for the beauty of this planet. i love art, self expression, i find it amazing as considering what we came from. My grades were in the top 5% nationally before i left college. I have  unique, caring and open minded friends and a very loving family. If you just read this paragraph alone (which is all people in real life see) you would assume everything is fine and i have nothing to worry about right?



I dont get how all of this can be true and yet im SO FUCKED UP. I have held it together as long as I can, there are mounting pressures from the people around me to get a job or restart college and i would rather kill myself than do either and i cant just do nothing forever either as I will starve to death and everyone will denounce me as a failure.  



**A Fix?** : I have tried just about every form of help you could suggest over the last 5-6 years with no avail (except for some marginal help from infrequent psychadelic use, mindfulness and meditation), and these issues have been around since i was old enough to remember. Years and years of this dark painful emptiness and the urges to hurt myself and others have only gotten stronger. I cant focus, my brain is a war zone with multiple factions battling, screaming inside my mind trying to be louder than eachother and through the noise there is only one thing i can focus on, and thats how much i want to be dead.



**Psychology** : I have always been deeply interested by the human brain and I understand why so much of this happens and where it comes from and how irrational many of these thought patterns are but its like there are multiple people in my head and this current rational and clear-ish thinking one is only at the podium because it screamed louder than its competitors and dragged its feeble body to the top of the mountain of cacophonous voices and viewpoints that curse almost every waking moment, and it gets weaker by the day whereas the others only get louder.

I'm a dreamer, a creator, I love so much and the fact I want to die so breaks my heart, i've barely had a chance to live, however it is the lesser of two evils compared to sacrifcing everything that makes me, me and also potentially hurting the humans around me that I care so much about.



I feel like i genuinely could have gone so far without these demons plaguing me, and it saddens me so much, especially as all of my peers progress with life so very easily. I dont know why im saying all this, im not expecting any of you to fix me with a paragraph, i just want someone to listen, someone to even *slightly* understand me, but due to the stupid length of this i realise thats a tall ask, whats worse is I have already shortened it by half. This really is a botched job boys, gg no re.
