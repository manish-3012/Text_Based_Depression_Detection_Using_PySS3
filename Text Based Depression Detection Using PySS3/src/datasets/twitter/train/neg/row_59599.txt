i dont really knowi think i posted here a couple of times but im so exhausted and sad and numb. i can't concentrate on anything, i lose focus all the time, i can't do basic tasks, i feel like im losing myself. like i'm trying so so hard to hold on to me but i cant get her back up. there's not even a particular reason, uni's doing super great, i have great friends, im not in any difficulty whatsoever. it just feels like my sadness is really really deep and is eating me. tonight i drank a lot for no reason other than to numb my numbness. i never ever do that and the fact that i did scared me. i don't know who to talk to and i just want to get better.
