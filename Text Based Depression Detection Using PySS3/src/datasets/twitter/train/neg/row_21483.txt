You own your lifeI dont get why choosing to die is viewed as such a terrible thing. A person should be entitled to take his own life as his own life is his and his alone. I been suicidal for over 4 months and the more i think about it the more sense it makes. I dont fear death anymore, i fear the pain of death but not death. 
Thinking about quitting the rollercoaster of life gives me peace. The thought of dying helps me sleep and calms me down. I want to die so bad. But im not yet ready to slice my arteries as that would hurt or jump off a building as it scares me. We'll see what happens but i hope to find a good method
