I'm just existingI'm not one of the sad stories that i've read. I had promise, vision, good friends. People say i look honest. Some said i look good. But life has broken me and I just find it difficult to do the simple things anymore. I tried fixing my life but everytime it crumbles after a week or more. I'm desperately sad. I know i want to see the world for something good and i don't know how. Expectations pull me down. Competition makes me really upset. It's getting harder and harder each day.. and i feel i'm just a ticking timebomb
