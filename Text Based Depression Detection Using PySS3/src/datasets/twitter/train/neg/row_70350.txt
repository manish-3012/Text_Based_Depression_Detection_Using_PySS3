Even the people who abuse me donâ€™t want me anymore. Iâ€™ve already been lonely before. So Iâ€™m going to live the best life I can with the time I have left.I was taught to â€œbe niceâ€ by a woman who canâ€™t take criticism without blowing her top and having a meltdown. I was told to â€œrelaxâ€ by a transgender man who lied to me and gave me herpes and literally fucked me in the ass. You want to die? So do I. But what better revenge is there in life than leaving your abusers behind and living the best life you can? So Iâ€™m going to do that. Iâ€™m done being someone who just gets fucked over. I did what other people told me to do, even at my own expense. So what better way to go out than in a blaze of glory rather than a whimpering mess?
