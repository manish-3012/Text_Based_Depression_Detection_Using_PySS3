Why is life becoming so hard. For no reason people fight me ,beat me,abuse me ,destroy my things, It is really hard for me but no one cares not even you who is reading this , I know that but why did I write this in the first place , keep feeling like to go somewhere alone without no one knowingI want to become a strong person 
I want to end this abuse it is killing me inside 
What the hell is happening 
I'm only living in Loss 
By my loved ones 

Isn't life really bitch to do this
