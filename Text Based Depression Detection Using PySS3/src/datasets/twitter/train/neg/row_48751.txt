Iâ€™m doneIâ€™m 14 and way to fucking mature for my age. Iâ€™ve got an amazing well of knowledge I get great grades and heâ€™ll Iâ€™m graduating a year early AND with my associates degree. But what does that matter? Iâ€™ve got like 3 real friends and my phones constantly dry. People say Iâ€™m attractive both physically and personality wise but I just donâ€™t see it. Iâ€™m an insensitive emotionless asshole with and ugly face and acne. Iâ€™ve had a pretty shit life and could spend a while explaining it all but Iâ€™d rather not bother anyone any further. It boils down to I donâ€™t have a dad have always lived in a poor area that was predominantly Hispanic and black. Iâ€™ve always been bullied for being smart and white. So I decided to stop giving a fuck about life and apparently thatâ€™s what people think is cool. I meant it when I said Iâ€™m an emotionless asshole. I literally canâ€™t cry no matter how many times I barley pull myself away from suicide. I havenâ€™t had a hug from someone thatâ€™s not mom in a few month and when I did get one it was from a toxic relationship I rushed into because I was suicidal and turns out she was crazy and burned my hoodie. Iâ€™ve started doing weed and thatâ€™s literally the only time Iâ€™m not depressed or empty instead Iâ€™m calm. Within the past month Iâ€™d say around 25/30 days I was contemplating killing myself and how to do it. I donâ€™t know what to do or where to go anymore.
