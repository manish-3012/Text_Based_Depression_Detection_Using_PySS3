I feel so done with everything. I need some way out of this soon.I have been struggling with generalized anxiety disorder and depression since I was in 6th grade. I am a sophomore in college. About a month ago I had FINALLY gotten to a great place in my life, had accepted myself, started on medication and got a therapist, and was HAPPY and completely sure of myself for the first time in forever. Then my first serious boyfriend of 2.5 years took everything away two weeks ago when he broke up with me, after I gave him a chance to think about what he wanted and he assured me he would stay with me. MY WHOLE WORLD came crashing down. He said he would marry me over and over. 

I self harmed for the first time a few days ago. I called a crisis line yesterday because I was sure I was going to kill myself. A dispatch team came and talked to me and I felt better. But I cannot shake this feeling of dread and wanting things to be over. I am SO. TIRED. of not being motivated and focused, anxious all the time, feeling worthless, and wanting to kill myself all the time. Most women my age should not feel like this. I should not feel like this because of how fortunate I am. I am so angry because of what he took from me. I feel like everything was a lie. I have friends and family who are helping me, but I NEED SOMETHING MORE. Anything. I am at my lowest I have ever been. I keep hoping and even whispering for help, and trying the hardest I can to help myself. I need help.
