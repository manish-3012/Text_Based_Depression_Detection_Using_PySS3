Job Search SuicideI canâ€™t find a job. Iâ€™m stuck at a job I hate. Everyone is friends with the boss, but me. I canâ€™t get any decent kind of hours or money. I have to work 3rd shift. Iâ€™m bipolar and canâ€™t even begin to manage my meds.

I live in Gso, NC. I have no family, I canâ€™t afford to move. I have no car. I have no drivers license.

I had a decent job a few years ago but left because I was getting bullied (black guy in a majority Hispanic factory)

I graduated from university with a 3.5 but I canâ€™t get a job remotely in my field.

Since then Iâ€™ve been homeless, I have a place now but all my little money goes to bills. Iâ€™m in several programs that say theyâ€™ll help but Iâ€™ve been unable to find a better job.

I really want to just kill myself. I canâ€™t handle feeling isolated. I canâ€™t handle failing at everything in life. I JUST DONT HAVE A SOCIAL NETWORK TO GET MY FOOT IN THE DOOR.

Iâ€™ve survived 3+ suicide attempts AND Iâ€™m always back in this position. I DONT WANT TO HEAR ANY BULLSHIT JOB ADVICE. 

I DONT HAVE ANYONE THAT WILL MISS ME OR BE IMPACTED BY MY SUICIDE. I spent my childhood poor. I thought education would change my life - but it only made me more self conscious.

Hopefully Iâ€™ll be dead soon. I definitely have a plan.
