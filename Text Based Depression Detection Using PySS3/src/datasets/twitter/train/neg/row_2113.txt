In a pointless downward spiral - no clue how to crawl out.I'll try to keep this as brief as possible - despite having wonderful friends, an even more wonderful girlfriend, and a complete inability to panic, I am stuck in a default state of horrendous depression and only escape it by distracting myself with things like video games, drinking, or sex. I was in college for a year, dropped out to take an amazing job halfway across the country, and then was justifiably let go after only three months due to being generally incompetent at my unbelievably simple retail-oriented. It took me nearly half a year to find another job, only to be let go once more after just one month for what I can only assume was general incompetence ("you're just not the right fit for our company" was the most detail they gave, and I felt I was doing a great job until then). I was hired at a place that gives very sporadic work not long after, and am only making enough money to pay for food/bus fare while my increasingly fed-up father has been paying my rent and bills. I keep searching for work, albeit without much heart, because my problem is that things just feel utterly hopeless on a cold, impossible-to-ignore logical level. I feel stupid and incapable of pulling off even the most basic of adult functions, which leads to depression, which leads to me moping around and not doing anything, which leads to proving the point (and angry room mates screaming about the messes I don't clean up), and on and on and on and on. Suicide, in my convoluted logic, isn't so much a one-way ticket to a pain-free state of being as it is a logical step to remove myself as a burden to everyone around me. The only thing keeping me from going through with it is the very laziness and lack of motivation that brings about the feeling in the first place - I'd have to push myself pretty hard to buy something to do the deed with, or crawl up an abandoned building somewhere.

TL;DR no matter how much work I do to try and free myself, I am completely stuck in life, so i'm left with no motivation to keep on trying.
