I just want to odSo I really donâ€™t know what to do with my life, Iâ€™ve been depressed since my early teens but then I moved out at 17 I decided to change it and have as much fun as I can, 3 and a half years later Iâ€™m in my hole off depression again. Now Iâ€™m surrounded by drug addicts and struggle with opium addiction myself, I have to take pills every few hours to keep me from having seizures and sweat attacks due to withdrawal and I also feel guilty for all the relationships Iâ€™ve ruined but the one thing i hate myself for is that I really hurt the only person that truly loved me and wanted to help me.
