Coming to the realization that I will never amount to anything.Lately Iâ€™ve been contemplating life, why is it worth being here if Iâ€™ll never be enough/good at anything. I was barely starting to get out of this shithole when some more bullshit hit me head on. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore, thereâ€™s only one other person I can talk to about this without being judged but even he has shit going on himself. Lately everything has been pissing me off, the only â€œ peace â€œ I get is when Iâ€™m high.
