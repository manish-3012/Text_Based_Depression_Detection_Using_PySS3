Thinking about ending it soonI want to overdose on Benadryl on my 19th birthday. Iâ€™ll have a nice last day of my life at least. Eating, gambling, and spending time with family. But I have no friends, no job, and math is holding me back from graduating college and being successful. I feel hopeless and I feel like a failure. I put all of my effort into school and I always feel drained and exhausted. Itâ€™s a miserable way to live. I feel like my options are running out. I canâ€™t keep living with my parents for the rest of my life.  I want my life to be over. And I have no one to talk to.
