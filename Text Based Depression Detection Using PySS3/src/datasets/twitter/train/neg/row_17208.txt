Lost the willJeez.. I feel like a regular on this subreddit.. 

backstory - http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ta4t7/tired/

I've been feeling a distinct lack of motivation for the past week but its turning into something else, that familiar feeling, that voice in the back of your head telling you "You should just give up". I've lost all motivation to talk to people, all I do is wake up go to work, come back and go to bed. Just hiding in my bedroom out of fear of the outside.

My anxiety is getting worse and its preventing me from thinking about anything other than "I want to be at home". I think I'm so hung up on the fact that I currently only have 1 friend that its just making my depression go into overdrive, it seems pointless to carry on. I'm a very social person at heart (even though I'm shy and socially awkward) but I have no opportunities to socialize with anyone as it stands, and its eating at me. I can't keep spending my nights in my room by myself but I have no one I can meet up with, or do stuff with.. I feel so trapped by my situation I just want to get away from it.. any way possible...
