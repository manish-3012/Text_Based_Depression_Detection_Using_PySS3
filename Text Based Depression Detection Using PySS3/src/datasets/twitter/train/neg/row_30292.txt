Damn peopleYou talk about killing yourself, you wont be taken seriously. They would embarass you and tell you what the fuck are you thinking. They try to force their ideals to you. In the end you would only look bad and they wont even ask you what your problems are. Just my everyday life with my family. I guess suicide is just taken lightly here in the Philippines.
