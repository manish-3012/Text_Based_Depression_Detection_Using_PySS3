Free hugsSo I've seen several posts over the last few days about people wanting hugs. 


Well, if you're in the SoCal area (SD/IE/LA) and you want a hug, let me know. I have several available and am willing to share. No strings attached. I'll come meet you somewhere of your choosing, give you a big ol' hug, and listen to you talk for a while, if you want. 


Just trying to help out in some way!
