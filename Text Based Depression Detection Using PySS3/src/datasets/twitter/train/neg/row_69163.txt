I think Iâ€™m just going to hang myself now.Iâ€™ve been wrestling with this for a while. Iâ€™m M25. People either tell me I canâ€™t be depressed because Iâ€™m attractive, or they tell me to not to kill myself because thereâ€™s so much to live for, and that it can get better.

So maybe it can get better, but Iâ€™ve been cheated on and used and lied to so badly that I canâ€™t honestly see a version of myself living happy or safe in this world anymore.

I would so much rather be dead at this point, after seeing what people are capable of.

Iâ€™m thinking of getting a rope, and just stepping down from this life tonight.
