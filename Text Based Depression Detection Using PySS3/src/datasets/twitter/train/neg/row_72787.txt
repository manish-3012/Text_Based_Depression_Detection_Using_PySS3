I'm 17 and i'm anxiousI'm 17, in 11th grade, and i am so afraid of being in the real world in a couple of years because i believe i'm unable to make it, i know that life is only going to go downhill the moment i leave high school, ( i literally just saw a group of 12th grade graduates celebrating thinking " what are they so happy about? This is not a holiday, this is a tragedy"), i have been thinking about this for a whole year and thinking of ending it all, i don't think i have depression, not because i feel hapiness, i don't, it's because i can get out of bed, shower, eat, sleep normally, but i can't even study well because all i can think of is "what's the point of all of this?" to get a job basically being a slave to the rich until i die?, i don't really get the point of it all, and knowing that i might not have a mental illness because i function partially normally makes me think i am being dramatic, but i still suffer from this and want to end my life, the only thing that's stopping me is that i need a reliable way in which i can die 100% with no return and no chances of faliure, and no high amount of pain that makes my biological instincts try to keep me alive against my will, and because i'd suffer more if my family knew, it would be really hard to live normally or die when everybody around you knew that secret, leaving only misery.
Unfun fact: i am a gay agnostic male living in an arab muslim community in israel, the suffering that comes from  this fact probably doesn't need much explaining.
Thanks for taking the time to read through the whole thing.
