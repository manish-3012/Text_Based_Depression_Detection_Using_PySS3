Dysphoria and 0 help availableFirst of all, let me introduce myself.
I am Atomo/Lunaria, a 14 years old transfeminine

I've been extremely dysphoric about my assigned sex at birth for years. I've been thinking about transition but there is 0 help for transgender in my city, the 2nd biggest city in Indonesia (Bandung).  There is 0 gender therapist, nor any information about finding one on my city. And yup, i am underage, which means i can't find any help by myself. I tried googling about HRT in my city, but there is no information about it. And no, there is no suicide hotline in my country, mental health is considered a trivial problem here.

Moral support? Don't even think about it. My country is an anti-lgbt country and so are its people. I tried talking about it with my father, but he doesn't even understand what I'm talking about. I don't wanna try talking about it with my mother, she is anti-lgbt.

I think its time to end it all, once and for all. Thanks, for everything.
