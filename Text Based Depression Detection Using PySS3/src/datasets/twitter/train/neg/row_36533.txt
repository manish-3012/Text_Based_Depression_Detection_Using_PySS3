LosesHey, over the past few months Iâ€™ve lost things that made me who I am and now my identity and will to live is gone. I had to leave school over financial reasons, move back home, me and my best friend/ girlfriend of 2 years  separated and it was completely my fault. I wanted to marry her. Now  Iâ€™m not allowed any where near her. I canâ€™t even drive by myself for the time being my license is suspended over some bullshit law. Iâ€™ve been having flashbacks of sexual abuse from when I was a kid, me and my mothers relationship isnâ€™t the best, I feel completely alone. Even tho I should feel closer to everyone I love at this point in my life I still feel really fuckin alone ya know.  The focal point and the light of my life has been taken one by one and now itâ€™s just empty.  I battle with self harm on a daily basis. I canâ€™t even wear short sleeves outside or at work because of the scars itâ€™s left. Iâ€™ve never been this depressed in my entire life. It hurts more because the light at the end of the tunnel turned out to be a giant Forrest fire. I have serious problems thatâ€™s effect myself and my relationships and now Iâ€™m paying the price of being alone. 2 months ago I never saw it like this. I never saw myself with no license no school no studio no friends no girlfriend. Iâ€™ve attempted before by slitting my wrist but it didnâ€™t work. So now idk. I donâ€™t trust myself being this alone and the support I had is now gone for a very very long time if not forever. And Iâ€™m at that point of giving up on life and trying to kill myself again. I feel like a burden and a pain to everyone around me. I never do enough or I do the wrong things or I stress people. I have good intentions but the darker sides of my psyche get in the way. Being abused and emotionally neglected for most of my childhood I feel like I have to constantly fight these demons in my adult life. Iâ€™ve lost everything due to the fact that Iâ€™ve abused others the way Iâ€™ve been abused. It isnâ€™t fair to anyone. Iâ€™ve tried so hard to change and to stop being this shitty person but I always have and always will be an insecure ass loser. So Iâ€™m not really interested in living anymore due to the fact that everyone and everything has left my life and itâ€™s my fault. Itâ€™s all my fault. But I understand I need help. Serious help not just a positive YouTube video or to numb the pain with drugs and sex, but some years of professional therapy. I want my happiness back. My confidence my self esteem my will to live my creativity my girlfriend my best friend(s) my money my license my freedom my sense of self. I attempted to hang myself but it wasnâ€™t with a strong leather belt so after a few seconds it just broke and I fell to the floor. So now that Iâ€™m alive Iâ€™m not sure what else to do. I want to get better. I need to get better. Iâ€™ve been depressed and suicidal for almost a decade and I just want to breathe for once. From childhood to now itâ€™s just been a crushing weight and Iâ€™m gasping for air any breathe of â€œ itâ€™ll be okay youâ€™ll be fineâ€ cuz every time I think itâ€™ll be okay Iâ€™m severely disappointed... I wish I wasnâ€™t who I am. Iâ€™m no good to the people in my life and a lot of people were no good to me. I wish I didnâ€™t let this bad events manifest itself inside of me so deeply but here they are. Yes this is vague I didnâ€™t want to go into to much detail. I just feel relief writing about it a little since itâ€™s been bottled up. So since Iâ€™m alive Iâ€™ll try my best to remain healthy mentally even tho itâ€™s so easy to do the wrong thing and ignore my problems. But if I want anything I care about back I canâ€™t keep letting my demons control me. Thanks r/suicideWatch for existing.
