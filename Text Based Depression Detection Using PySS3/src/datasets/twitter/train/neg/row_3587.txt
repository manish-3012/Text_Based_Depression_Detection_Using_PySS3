This world isn't realAllow me to explain, For the last 6ish years I have had the sneaking suspicion that this is all just a bad dream that I can't wake up from and have recently come to the conclusion that the only way to wake myself up is to kill myself and then I'll be a child again hopefully and even if I'm wrong I don't belong in this world I can't even make friends, I have only ever had 2 girlfriends both broke up with me within a month because of my depression I can't hold a job, to be completely honest I dread working I was supposed to start a really simple 18 hour per week job yesterday at 8am I didn't even show up because I couldn't sleep because I was having a ridiculous amount of anxiety about meeting and talking to people. 

Sorry for the depressing rant back to the topic at hand I came to the conclusion the other day that I might actually be 10 and sleeping maybe even in a coma of some sort I can't remember or just don't know for sure but I just remembered the other day that when I was 10 I really wanted to be a grown-up and now here I am 19 with a lot of missing memories between now and then and sometimes I can't even remember waking up like today and I really want to wake up from this nightmare and go back to being a happy 10 year old again I keep trying to wake myself up but nothing is working so I guess the last option would be to  shoot myself 

I tried explaining this to my dad last night but he couldn't understand and probably thinks I'm crazy  so I won't be telling anyone else
