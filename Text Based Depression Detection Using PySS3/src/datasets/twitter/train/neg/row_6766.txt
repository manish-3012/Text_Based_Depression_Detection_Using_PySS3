Suicidal everydayI keep trying to attempt suicide every single day at night when people are asleep. Only thing is I donâ€™t do substance abuse so it wonâ€™t end up with me being hospitalized. I have mdd, bpd and did. Mental illness cocktail. If possible I would like to talk to a like minded person whoâ€™s also considering suicide.
