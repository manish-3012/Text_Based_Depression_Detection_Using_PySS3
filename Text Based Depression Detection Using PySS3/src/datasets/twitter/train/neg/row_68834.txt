I Deserve To DieIâ€™ve been struggling for years. 
Iâ€™ve tried everything. 

But Iâ€™m just destined to die.
I donâ€™t know who I am.

I donâ€™t know what I am.
And I cannot speak because I am terrified of judgement.

Yet here I am..
Telling the world. 

I hate myself severely.
Iâ€™m an outcast. 
A therian. 

Therians make the world cringe. 

I get laughed at. 
Judged. 
Mocked and bullied. 

All I want is to fit in. 
I donâ€™t know how.
I have no sense of self. 
I donâ€™t feel right. 
My mind feels wolf like. 

But how is that possible? 
Itâ€™s just stupid and pathetic they all say. 

So here I am. 
My life decaying as I spiral into endless darkness. 

I see no future. 
All my life Iâ€™ve been abused. 

I have this chasm in my chest. 
The pain can be unbearable. 

The mixture of psychotic depression, PTSD and social anxiety is torturous. 

No one understands. 
They all laugh. 

So I cry myself to sleep at night. 
I canâ€™t help but hurt myself and crave to die. 

Iâ€™m tired of being told how wrong I am.
That I should just kill myself.
That I am pathetic.. 

The list goes on. 
Iâ€™ve done nothing but give to this world. 
And in return of trying to feel free and happy, I get crushed. 
Because Iâ€™m different. 

In this world.
You have to be perfect.
If you are slightest bit different to the majority, you get targeted and cast out. 

This is no life for me.
I cannot fit in.
I can never find my peace.
I can never be free of this pain. 


My only way out is death. 

Iâ€™m sorry for being different. 
Iâ€™m sorry for not being normal. 
Iâ€™m sorry Iâ€™m not good enough. 

Iâ€™ll make it right. 
I wonâ€™t be a burden much longer.
