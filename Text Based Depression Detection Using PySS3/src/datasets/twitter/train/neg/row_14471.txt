I barely care about anything anymore.
I thought a lot today about how I just want to push everyone away so I can just fucking end it. 

I had goals once but I dont really think it would be worth it to accomplish them. Becoming successful just means handling even more shit. Why? Why do anything? There's no point. There's no point for life to exist, no reason that it should survive, no supreme being protecting us and guiding us into whatever greater complexity is next... we're all just trapped in our sad, pre-determined fates. If anyone could dispute determinism, maybe I would believe again... but no one can. 

I can hardly care about other people now. Everyone is so selfish, only out for themselves. Whatevr.
