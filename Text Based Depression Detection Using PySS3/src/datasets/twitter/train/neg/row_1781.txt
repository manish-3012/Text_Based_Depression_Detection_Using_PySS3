ScaredI donâ€™t want to be alive. But I donâ€™t want to die. Does that make sense? I want to try and overdose again but Tylenol didnâ€™t do the trick last time and I took A LOT. I thought about just falling asleep behind the wheel when I drove home tonight but I couldnâ€™t let myself. Iâ€™m scared of dying. I donâ€™t want to leave him behind. But I have nothing going for me. Everything has fallen apart in my life.
