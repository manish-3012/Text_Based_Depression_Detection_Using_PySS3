I can't even kill myself.You know what really pisses me off? People who say:
"it gets better" (no it fucking doesn't, Sharon. Some of us don't use alcohol to wipe all our problems away)
"If you kill yourself, it would be traumatic for your friends and family" (people who say this are terrible. If someone is driven to suicide it's probably because nobody gives a shit about them at all. Sure I can kill myself, but nobody would care for longer than a week or so)

you know what? I had an entire list of these things but I'm just gonna give up and go hurt myself. What am I even doing, asking people on the internet for them to tell me to not kill myself? Begging internet strangers for the generic "noooooo pls don't" even though I know for a fact that I'm just going to end up killing myself anyway? Yeah fuck this, bye
