I have made my decision...I have a cruse in June with my grandma. I am very excited about it, but with all the companyâ€™s canceling their cruses Iâ€™m not sure if I will get to go. I have decided that if something awful happens to me, I really want to for some reason, or the trip is cancelled I will end it. I have attempted many times. I was in a physc ward at the age of 12.
