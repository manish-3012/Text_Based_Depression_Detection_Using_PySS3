This community has been really helpful for me.If i die by my own hands, i just wanted to post that i really did try my best to keep going but just got too tired. I know i post here all of the time, forgive me. But I have good qualities that I want my loved ones to know about me if they are reading this and I'm dead. I'm funny, outgoing, flirty, adventurous, kind, active, spiritual, well-dressed now. I might seem lazy but I'm just interested in so many things. Well, I'm happy for this community, and if you don't hear from me I hope it's because I found a better life not because I killed myself.
