How to deal?Context, I'm soon 20, incel as fuck, no pussy, no makeouts, no relationship, none of that. The only relationships I've had with girls has been purely platonic which I've now decided isn't worth my time.

I know I'm probably not going to get laid anytime soon, but I just want to feel like a human being. I think most of y'all in here giving advice can't even relate to the shit I'm saying, but look, you don't realize how this situation wears a person down to the point of barely functioning.

I know I'm not attractive, I know I'm a beta, I know that I shouldn't care, but I don't have a choice, it's biological. I already promised myself years ago that I would commit suicide at age 20 if I haven't had sex by then, I might buy a hooker just to know what it's like but it's not going to make me feel more wanted or appreciated, which is what I want.

I'm debating what method I"ll go with right now, lraning towards taking a bunch of xanax and maxing my car into a building. I need the xanax to go through with it I think. Might fuck a hooket before just so that I won't die a pathetiv loser incel virgin, or well, I'll still die a pathetic loser.
