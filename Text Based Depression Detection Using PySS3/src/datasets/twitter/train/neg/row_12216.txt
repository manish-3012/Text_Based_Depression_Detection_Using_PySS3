How to ask for help?I am a danger to myself. Not that I'm going to do anything to myself right now, but I am making plans. 

How do I ask for help? I've tried therapy, it made things worse as I felt like they weren't listening and kept missing the point. I've seen my gp, tried different antidepressants, but they either do more harm or seem to do nothing. I don't want to reach out to my family, they've got enough going on themselves, and previous attempts at talking to them haven't gone well as they've never been depressed and can't understand it. I've tried to reach out to friends, but if I don't say I'm suicidal I get ignored, if I'm honest about how bad things are I get accused of being manipulative. 

I don't know where to turn.
