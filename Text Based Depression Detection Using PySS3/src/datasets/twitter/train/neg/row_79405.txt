I've seen the mental health industry's failings, and it's making my first ideations terrifying.When it rains, it pours.

I've never really *planned* before, or thought about this until recently. I've been getting involuntary thoughts about doing it, and every time I do it just terrifies me and I try to think of something else. I keep thinking of scenarios in which I would go through with it, and recently my actual life has been flirting with these variables to the point where I fear I'm close to acting on impulse.

Our family owns a care home for the mentally ill. As such, I've been rather close to the industry myself, and have seen where it succeeds and where it fails. The industry itself is practically in a free fall, and the quality of care for the mentally ill is slipping dramatically in this country. **I've seen situations where things were made far worse by attempted intervention. I've seen clearly dangerous, desperate, and suicide prone people RELEASED and sent away simply because there's nowhere for them to be. I've seen dangerous or suicide prone people released into facilities obviously not meant to handle them simply because there's no room elsewhere. I've even seen a murder perpetrated by somebody close to me because he was released for these reasons.** Ironically, not many people are blaming the doctor who released him simply because there were no beds left, but I digress. Point is I have little faith in these systems now.

I don't like to be the guy who makes a list of my problems, but I guess it's partly the point of this post. So, heres a short list of things I'm struggling with.

-I'm 29 years old. I've been struggling with pain caused by a benign tumor that's grown on the interior of my spine. Frequent pain, even with medication. Surgery would be dangerous, and will ONLY be carried out if it continues to grow, since at one point it would ultimately **paralyze** me.

-Pain management has helped, but as you can imagine the tradeoff is physical dependency, which has it's own unique set of problems.

-My mother had, until recently, been a major form of support for myself and others in my life. Three years ago, she survived cancer. Last year, she survived a stroke. I feel there's not much time left for her.

-My abusive stepfather is 71 years old. The guy had done everything he could to ruin us financially before my mother divorced him. He smokes like a volcano and drinks like a fish, and yet it's my younger mother who is closer to death for it.

-As mentioned before, I'm close to somebody whose son committed an atrocious murder. I don't want to give details, but this person lives with me and it's made both our lives difficult...although his far worse for being related to the killer.

-As mentioned, we own a care home. Shortly after my mother had a stroke, our administrator- the guy who practically ran the place for years, a man we all loved to death, actually died of a stroke himself. The current, new administrator isn't cutting it. Worse, licensing has been all over our asses since his death. The care home doesn't make much money, and working with mental patients is hazardous even for a non-lockup facility. We may not have a business six months from now.

-I may soon be forced to move. Not too big of an issue, except for the fact I'll have to leave my birds behind. I adopted a cockatiel and a blue and gold macaw years ago, and they've been one of the few things out there to put a smile on my face. They were rescued birds, and the idea of having to put them right back into the system troubles me.

-I'm having troubles with my writing. I'm about 300 pages into a novel I am writing, but this becomes harder every time I sit down because of my back.

There's quite a bit more, but I already think I risk losing the attention of readers with the current length here. I've never thought about suicide before, and I don't want to. I'm just not sure what to do if these thoughts become more frequent, and I don't know where to look for help aside from venting my frustrations here.
