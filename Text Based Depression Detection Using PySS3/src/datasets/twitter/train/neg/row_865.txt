Pity doesnâ€™t helpIâ€™m about to be admitted to the very hospital I currently work at (though obviously not for much longer). A lady there during orientation said her â€œheart goes out to suicide ideation patients because yâ€™all there are some people that donâ€™t think their life is worth living and that just hurts my heart for themâ€ and my (internal) reaction being such a person without her realizing was â€œbâ€” no one said your life was worth living either. I could have literally any life and I would still want to die.â€ Basically my point is pity is not helpful because we are not less than you. 
Aside from that it really sucks but itâ€™s true even though my specific life is extremely difficult and hard to deal with I cannot imagine any possible life where I would be okay apart from maybe just inheriting a couple million dollars. (Not going to happen any time soon.) 
I canâ€™t think of any job where I would be okay or any way of life where I would be okay. 
I had a meltdown at work Tuesday from severe anxiety and the sent me home for two weeks to sort it out. I have been home a week with no improvement. Tried to find a doctor but they said it will be at least a week and a half for my first app with a therapist and two weeks after that to see a psychiatrist. I donâ€™t have a regular doctor and all the local doctors charge a $120 new patient fee on top of the appointment itself.   My husband says he will take me to commit myself tomorrow but my hospital triggers the anxiety and itâ€™s the only good hospital there is so everything just suck and knowing from the backside they are just pitying me doesnâ€™t help. Because what makes them think their life is so special compared to mine? Maybe some of us are just tired of suffering and not having any resources to help ease that.
