I keep cyclingThe same things keep occurring over and over and Iâ€™m tired. 1) meet some great people 2) great people turn out to not be so great 3) someone hurts me 4) no friends for a long time 5) feeling lonely again but this time iâ€™m actually alone 6) start working out eating good 7) gain some confidence 8) meet some â€œgreatâ€ people 9) go back to number â€˜2â€™ 
All the mean while I worry about money and being a burden on my family and thereâ€™s no way i can think of a future because i canâ€™t imagine one that includes me still alive. I know no one cares about me so itâ€™s hard to find a purpose and itâ€™s hard to care for myself.
