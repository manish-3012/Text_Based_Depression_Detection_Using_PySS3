In 2 years, or in 20 yearsI don't really feel like suicide is a matter of if, for me. More like a matter of when. I have a cut off point in mind. It might take 2 years or 20 to get to that point. Maybe more, or maybe less. But I will kill myself eventually. I think about methods I will use, how I will get things in order, and what I want to do before I go. I think about these things a lot.

I want to die most days of the week. I have for a while now. I think I have wanted to stop living from a young age. I've been in therapy, I'm taking antidepressants, I'm exercising and working and trying to eat healthy. All the things they say to do. And, it does help to an extent--not to help me feel better about life, but to get me doing more in the meantime. 

Normally, I have a big list of goals I want to accomplish before killing myself. That's my compromise, I guess. It's what I came up with in therapy as a lifeline to stop me from going through with a plan. That's why I haven't killed myself yet. But, the thing is: life is unbearable enough now as an able bodied working adult. I don't want to stick around through old age, the loss of my mental faculties, or the loss of freedom and agency. I don't want to stick around through painful or debilitating illnesses. I don't want to stick around til I get to the point where my life is hanging by a thread and I rely on family who resents the burden and waits for me to die to ease their burden. I don't want to live to get committed to a hospice where I can do nothing but sit in bed and wait to die.

So, I will kill myself, eventually. Unless a freak accident mercifully gets me first. Normally I try to convince myself to stick it out longer to pursue the goals... but a lot of times, I don't even want to see the end of the week. I kind of feel like I am holding on out of sheer spite.

Does anyone else feel this way?
