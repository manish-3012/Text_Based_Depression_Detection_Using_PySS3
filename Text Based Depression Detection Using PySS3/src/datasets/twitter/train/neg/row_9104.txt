is this normal?I'm not scared to die, I feel as though I have no purpose in life, so why should we even live it? I'm somewhat depressed, but do not make it apparent. Im 13 with divorced parents and I loose every one I care about in my life. I don't believe in god so I have no one to turn to for guidance. My dad is constantly screaming at me for getting B's instead of A's and my mom just doesn't care. I'm not trying to die, but death does not scare me. So now I ask you, browsers of reddit, is this normal? Is my curiosity of death safe?
