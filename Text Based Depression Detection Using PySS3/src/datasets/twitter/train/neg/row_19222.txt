I'm finally ridding the world of an evil person like me.I've honestly got no redeeming qualities. I take advantage of people and say cruel things to those closest to me. I ruined their lives. They don't deserve that and I don't deserve to live. I'm not asking for anyone to tell me that I'm "not a bad guy." Because it's simply not true. And please don't tell me that I can change, because I really tried and I can't change. I just can't.

 Anyway, I'm not going to even try to make any excuses, because there's nothing that can justify my words and actions. I'm only posting this because I know my family will find it once they search my phone after I'm gone and I want them to know that I'm sorry and that I love them so very much.

And sorry to drag you into this too, people of Reddit. Just disregard this post please and thanks.
