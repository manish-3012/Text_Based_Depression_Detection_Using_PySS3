Extreme lolinessI am all alone. I have no friends anymore, they all left my life. I don't have any deep relationships with anyone, I can't take it anymore. I just want to die, being alive is so alienating. There is nobody here for me. In this deep pit of loneliness I just want to commit suicide. I don't have a girlfriend either. I literally have no one.
