I did everything I was told to do. For years. It doesn't workAnyone who looks at my post history can probably tell this is a venting account, and as people can see,I have been like this for a very long time. Ever since I stopped being a Christian back in the mid 2010s

I have done everything. I have a 40 hour a week job. I exercise no less than 3 times a week. I had sex. I did meditation, even trying to join a new religion. I have gone to 3 different therapists. I have played tabletop games.

I've did everything people told me that I just needed to try out. Guess what: I still want to die. It has gotten worse. I can't stop thinking about dying. I constantly am daydreaming about people being beaten to death. There is no morality. I don't even know what's right or wrong anymore. Any moral system that I try gets "UHM ACKTUALLY" 'd by some psudo philosophical idiot nihilist redditor that rules the modern world now. Worst part is that I have no good argument against them. It really is meaningless.

I am just here for no reason and I hate it. It isn't fun. It's scary and I just want to stop getting out of bed anymore. I just get up because I don't know what else to do. I want to jump off a building already.

I don't have much more to say. I'm sorry. This is so dumb. Everyone says to find a purpose. But that doesn't matter when rape, viruses, and murder surround us. Everyone alive now is gonna die in 100 years anyways
