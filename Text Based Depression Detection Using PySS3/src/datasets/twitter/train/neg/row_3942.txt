Countdown to the end journal: night three.Hello to anyone who might take the time to read this, I know this is a cloudy little corner we're in. Not many come here, it's not the most social place, and that's ok. I've only got three (technichally two) days to go, and i'm not going to let the lack of human contact dampen my spirits. I figured for tonights entry I would share a little history about myself. Its far from complete but it's a start. If anyone should feel inclined to, they are free to message me and ask whatever the fuck they want, i'm an open book now. I'm a 23 year old, ex college kid. I live in a tough town, not many people ever make it out or go to college. I studied psychology and theology, and I always wrote a lot. My parents had high expectations for me growing up, but inherited my mothers susceptibility to mental illness, and my fathers addictive personality. (I have been very prone to depression and extremely prone to anxiety issues for as long as I can remember.) When I was a kid, before the depression took hold, I had extreme anger fits. I would get so mad I would scratch myself with my fingernails underneath my shirt until I drew blood. Then my parents caught me and punished me, so I switched to destroying things, which led to more punishment, which led to internalizing these feelings completely, which led to this overwhelming all encompassing blanket of dread and depression. In my teens I was thin and good looking, I ran a lot and lifted nearly every day. The feelings never left though. I used a lot of adderall in high school, it made it feel good to be alone, read, study, write and do my school work. I graduated. I did some college. Work Work Work. Im skimming over things but you get the jist.
