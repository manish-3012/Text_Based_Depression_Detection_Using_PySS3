Suicidal thoughts but too cowardly to go through with it...This is just me ranting, 

I lived a very introverted fucked high school life, by which I mean that I carried a lot of child abuse onto my university life. 

Now I decided that I'll try to get my shit together and not let my past define me.

And so my new chapter as an international 
Student in the UK starts. With the drive of wanting to build a career, I'm more determined than ever to work my problems away.


3 years later, I finished my bachelor's degree and developed severe substance abuse and intense procrastination induced depression.

Now that I'm at the end of my Masters programme, I no longer can muster up the will to continue working because I have wasted most of time not working on my dissertation and spiralling out of control because I will be wasting my parents money.

Alas I've been given an extension to submit my dissertation,I had given up on working but now that a chance presented itself I fell into my old habits.

Initially I believed that I could overcome my unwillingness to work once a chance presented itself. 

But now I'm convinced that my weak personality got the better of me and that if I willingly chose to fuck my future at an important cornerstone of my life, then I'm allowing myself to be a loser that doesn't need to be a burden to my closed ones.

I'm burnt out and dunno what to do anymore.

I figured might as well to bitch to random people online.

tl;dr : using mental health to justify loser attitude and suicidal thoughts.
