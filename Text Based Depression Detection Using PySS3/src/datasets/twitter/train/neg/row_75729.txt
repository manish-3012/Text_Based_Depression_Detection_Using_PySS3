I am jealous of my hourglass shaped super stylish sisterMy sister is a UK size 4-6 and has measurements of around 34-23-36.  Today I saw her in a pair of leggings that rise higher than her natural waist and that is the most stylish you can possibly get.  She has thrown out all mid and low rise clothing from 2015-2018 that she can still fit into. She does no exercise whatsoever.

When I was her weight, I had a 34-29-34 figure.  I had a BMI of 20 but still looked obese.  I had no thigh gap.  My internal organs still thought I was obese due to my high waist to hip ratio.  My stomach was still large.  I was also a UK size 12, which is considered the start of fat for someone my height (5'5").  On top of that, my legs are incredibly short.  My mother is my height and has legs 6 inches longer than mine.  My body fat was at least 35%.

I cannot believe that I am doomed to permanent obesity unless I do extreme exercises while my sister can just lay in bed 24/7 and still have the ideal body.

Even my mother, who is starting menopause, has had 3 children above average birth weight, and has deflated breasts from breastfeeding, has a healthier shaped body than me.

I am now a UK size 20 and my mother said I don't eat a lot of food.  My sister has stopped complimenting me on my body (she got up to a size 14 back when I was a size 12).  I was always the thinner sister for all my life.  Back in 2013 we were both a size 10 but she was a whole foot shorter than me.  She had a growth spurt and reached her full height in 2015, which is about an inch shorter than me.  Nothing hurts more than not only being the fatter sister after developing an identity of being the skinny sister, but having a deformed body to go with it.
