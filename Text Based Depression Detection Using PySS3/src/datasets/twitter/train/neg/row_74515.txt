i'm not strong enoughi'm not strong enough to kill myself, but i'm not strong enough to live either. i feel like i'm in purgatory. i'm a burden to everyone i love. i'm not even sure why my few friends still stick by my since i'm too chickenshit to answer their messages half the time. i almost wish they wouldn't. i don't deserve them. i don't deserve anyone. a few weeks ago, my girlfriend told me she forgives me for the bpd outburst i had, but asked me if i think it's okay for her to deal with. if i'm being fair to her. if i should be with her. i don't know. i still don't know. i don't think so. i'm toxic. i'm not good for anybody. i love her and i want what's best for her. 

i've never been 'happy.' my first time on psych meds was in elementary school. i was weird and angry and had the attachment issues you'd expect in a little girl who was adopted. in a little girl who was abused. i've never moved past my traumas. i know i won't. i'm suffocating. life is too hard and i've come to accept i'm not meant for it. if i'd been alive a few centuries ago, i'm sure i'd be dead. i should be now. i'm incapable. useless. i'm poor and i'm pretty sure i'm gonna end up homeless sooner rather than later. i can't name one redeeming characteristic i have. i've tried. i don't know why i'm still here but i wish i wasn't
