Why?Why am I having these thoughts? Why am I depressed? Got a great job, beautiful wife and the most beautiful kids. I feel like Iâ€™m a stereotype of what people dream of. But inside Iâ€™m dying. I donâ€™t want this anymore. Do I want to actually want to end my life? No. If I died from accidental overdose or died in a crash Iâ€™d be ok. Why am I wishing death on myself? Why canâ€™t I shake these feelings?
