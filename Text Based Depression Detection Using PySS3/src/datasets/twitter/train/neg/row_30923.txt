Dev/Online Preparations?I've decided to die within the next week or so here.. but one of my loose ends is.. what to do with my passwords/keystores?  I'm a software developer, and I would be taking these secrets to my grave unless I told someone.. What have other software devs done in the past? One of my apps has tens of thousands of daily users.. I guess I could throw everything up on a repo, and just make it public at some point before I die?
