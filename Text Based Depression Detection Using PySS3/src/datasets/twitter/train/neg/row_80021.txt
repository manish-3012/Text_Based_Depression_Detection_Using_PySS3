Countdown to then end, night two.Well, It looks like i'm allowed to be here so far. I'm glad. I had a relatively "normal" day at work; I kept my mouth shut and my head down, trying to outpace everyone else. Nobody openly acknowledges extra effort here but if my dad taught me one thing, it's that nothing matters more than work ethic. It was a relatively slow night, which means my boss had less of demeaning tone than normal, which is nice I suppose. Anyway I guess this following part is the meat of tonights' entry. I had a very good talk with my grandmother tonight, the only person in my life i could ever be honest to. It was almost surreal, honestly it was like an un-interrupted stream of thought from somewhere deep in my subconscience, that's just been suppressed, on the verge of bursting out. It was a very calm and collected talk, but it was like taking a shower after a long day at work. I can hardly even remember what I said. She doesn't know about my plans exactly, she has an Idea, but I made her promise to tell my mother what I had told her should anything happen to me, and that'll help me sleep tonight.
