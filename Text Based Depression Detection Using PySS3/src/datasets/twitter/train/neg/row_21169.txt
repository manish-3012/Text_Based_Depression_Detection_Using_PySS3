I'm just done.I just want to be done living. I can't take all the letdowns anymore. I'm drifting away from my friends, my best friend doesn't care about me, my grades are going downhill, my family is disfunctional. I'm gaining weight from just laying around and never doing anything. I hate myself. I'm ugly and socially awkward. I know deep down that no one cares about me except maybe five family members. And I think it's so unfair that people's lives are so much better than mine. My family is having a really rough time with money. And the one thing I truly hoped for, which was that the guy I practically love feels the same way, was taken away from me. I'm not even friends with him anymore. I think my mom is mentally abusive towards me.

I'm sorry thi is so scattered but I just have no where to turn. I hate living. I don't hate living, but I hate my life. I want to kill myself. If I had a gun, I would not hesitate to blow my brains out. The only thing that's stopping me is fear of the pain.
