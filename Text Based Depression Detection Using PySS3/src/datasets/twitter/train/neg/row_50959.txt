If the doctor says no on Tuesday to my mom, I think I might kill myself.My mom is sick with an autoimmune disease and has been since I was 3 (I'm 17 now). My whole life, I've known the disease would kill her. But a few months ago, a new hope formed. A stem cell transplant that would CURE her disease. This is moms last option. She can't have any more ports. Her disease is in the final stages. She'll die in the next year without the transplant.

We took her up to Chicago this week for some testing. She passed all the tests but one of the doctors insisted there are "other options" (the options he offered won't work). he may influence the main doctor to not accept my mom. If she isn't accepted, then she will have her final treatment and be FORCED onto a shittier treatment option. Her disease will spread. she will die.

I got so hopeful, that this would all end. that I could know my mom would be there for my life. I got rid of my pessimistic view of her dying. Now that I know there's a good chance the doctor may say no, I'm crushed. I can't stand this pain anymore. I might just actually do it this time.
