Abuse, Guilt and AnxietyHello. I'm a 23 year old male. I grew up getting abused by my grandfather; everything that I do, like playing or doing kid things made him angry and I get beat all the time. He always insulted me, cussing me out and calling me names. Now as an adult, I'm always anxious around people and I struggle to maintain relationships. 

I feel guilty being alive honestly. I feel like I'm wasting my family's time and efforts on making me happy. I have things I want to do but the anxiety and fear just gets to me. I always turn into that helpless boy that couldn't defend himself. 

I always fantasized about meeting a woman that can save me from myself. Someone that will push me to be better and not be like this. Of course it will never happen because I suck at social things and I'm not highly sought after. 

I just hope one day I get the courage to end my life. I personally believe in God and I hope He will give me eternal peace. I'm tired of suffering. Forgive me.
