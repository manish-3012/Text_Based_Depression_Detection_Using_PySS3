Just canâ€™t feel wantedIâ€™m straight but apparently no girls are into more feminine guys and itâ€™s really starting to hurt bc no one wants me. Iâ€™m young and fit and cute and I canâ€™t find what I want and Iâ€™ve looked everywhere. Iâ€™ve been alone for so long and I really just donâ€™t know what I can do anymore, I want to just end it
