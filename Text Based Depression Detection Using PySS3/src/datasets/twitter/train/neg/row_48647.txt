I hate myself for what I've doneSmoked way and way too much for a decade. Both weed and cigarettes. After I quit I spiraled with my mental health. Became convinced I'm going to die of lung cancer and I think I'm a loser.

So I contact my ex about that. Was whining to her. Just pathetic behavior. She destroys me in an extremely angry message that completely fucked me up, she said she would never reply again and after that I kept harassing her with making new accounts to explain why I was acting like that. I feel like such a loser for doing that after I snapped out of it.. For weeks I just kept contacting her and deleting the messages again because her last message was repeating in my head 24/7.  

Her last message has destroyed me. It was so mean that I can't enjoy my life anymore. I embarrassed myself so much and feel like such a failure now. I'm so suicidal because I wake up and think about what she has said and know she's right. She somehow managed to be even more negative about myself than my own mind is and that's impressive. How to continue from here? How to forgive myself? I'm such a loser :(
