Fed-Up and Afraid (Probably Invalid too)Frankly, I feel like I can't do this anymore.

Hello, I just joined this subreddit. I go under the nickname Reign, nice to meet you, fellow survivor.

If you saw me, I'd honestly look like a normal person - has a handful of friends, a good family, a good school, a great boyfriend, heck, I have a dog that's turning two in two weeks - the only things that seems a little off are my deep, dark circles under my eyes.

Why would I be here on r/SuicideWatch? Why would I want to die?

*I HAVE A NORMAL FREAKING LIFE! I SHOULDN'T BE LIKE THIS! I SHOULDN'T HAVE CUTS ON MY FOREARM. THIS IS PROBABLY AN INSULT TO THOSE WHO HAVE ACTUAL MENTAL ILLNESSES.*

*Why... Why am I still crying...?*

*I just wanted everything to be okay... I wanted everyone to be happy... I still do...*

I remember being the apple of the crowd's eyes, the attention was on me and my speeches, my voice, my influence. The parents of my friends and younger kids told their sons and daughters: "Hey, I want you to be like her." as I walked up the stage to claim the award for my works.

Little did I know that that walk would change my life.

My friends began to fight a lot, I would be the sort-of "referee" for these arguments, helping them make up. Eventually, they would drift apart, and eventually cut ties with one another.   
*I'm torn, where do my loyalties lie? Am I even a true friend to any?*

As the months passed by, people began shunning me for being myself, both older and younger people. They would laugh and mimic me as I passed through the corridors, whilst my classmates would blame me whenever we failed on a group project, they would then push me towards the stairs all because I called them out for something. I had friends, but they wouldn't really defend me like I would for them.  
*I don't wanna go to school, they're just gonna throw sh\*\* at me.*

I tried to tell the teachers, they either said things alike to: "Just let them be, you're all too young." or "You must be overreacting! There's no such thing as bullying here in our school!". Eventually, I was allowed to make an article against bullying. However, they stated that the reason for this is because they allowed me to "write my feelings.".  
*That's great, but, I'm writing to stop the bullying in this school. They won't stop until they found out that they got caught. Stop denying the existence of the problem.*

Due to the ignorance of the school and the continuous shunning, I left the school.

This was a new chapter, it was bright. *Was.*

I met new people, a lot of them became my friends. I even got a boyfriend that loves me so. I was in the top, which was surprising for a new student, in their opinion. Teachers applauded me for my arguments and works, putting them in exhibits. It was an idealistic life, it really was.

But then, somehow, my position deteriorated. I began getting tired easily, skipping some school works and putting them out in a late and mediocre fashion. Soon, my quizzes began spiraling down. I didn't get the same opportunities that I had in my last school, because they saw me as a mere transferee.

My fellow honor students were my enemies, we were fighting against each other, on opposite sides. They clustered up together, forming a giant. I was then squashed.  
*Gosh, I wish that I had died in that moment. I could've just rested easy.*

Then, our teacher found out about my relationship and threatened to tell my parents. It happened on my mom's birthday. I was scared, I was crying.   
*It was all so heavy, it felt like I was carrying the world.*

Then, this pandemic began. 

I was only allowed to chat and call my friends and boyfriend (whom was known as my friend when the pandemic started.). We planned sleepovers once the lockdown was over, yet they never happened.

I felt... lonely, a lot of times. As much as I loved my parents, I didn't have anyone of my age to talk to. Our generations' differences sort-of put off some topics that I would love to talk about, so yeah.

I was getting used to this new normal, little by little. It began to be a chill routine for me.

I was also getting used to chatting instead of talking to my peers.

A turn happened, however. My parents found out about my relationship, along with my boyfriend's dad.

My boyfriend's dad beat him up for loving me and called me ugly; whilst my parents cursed at him. 

It was all too heavy... And I knew:

*If I hadn't existed, they wouldn't be fighting.*

*If I hadn't existed, my friends would've worked out their friendship.*

*If I hadn't existed, my groupmates' grades wouldn't have suffered.*

***If I hadn't existed, the world would be a better place.***
