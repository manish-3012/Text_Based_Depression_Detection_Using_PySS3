Wanting to make amends vs. knowing I should kill myself - TW: #metooI have been feeling debilitating levels of shame over the #metoo coverage recently. I am fixated on what a creepy fucking loser and â€œnice guyâ€ I was and the ways in which I selfishly hurt those around me. My psychiatrist (male) basically tells me that Iâ€™m being too hard on myself, that the men in the news have done far worse, and points out that I am lacking both experience and perspective. But I know what I did was wrong, I just want someone to take me seriously and tell me what I can do without minimizing things.

I am a 25 y/o man who has dealt with major depression since I was 15. I didnâ€™t lose my virginity technically until I was 23. I just mention that because I am inexperienced, socially awkward and as I mentioned before somewhat of a â€œnice guy.â€ During that time I was good friends with a woman my freshman year of college who Iâ€™ll call H. When H started showing interest in me it was exciting because I didnâ€™t get out too much and she lived in my same dorm. H would get into my bed to cuddle and watch movies. She was a virgin too and was also depressed, albeit higher functioning.

Eventually I asked her if she liked me and she said yes. She also told me that she did not want to be in a relationship. I told her OK, but soon after began pestering her/asking her to reconsider... for months. We were still friends, and still cuddled, but it became clear that she was becoming less comfortable with me. I kept asking her to reconsider. I was basically treating her like my boyfriend for months despite her feelings because I felt entitled to it, because she told me she liked me. I was an entitled â€œnice guy.â€ Eventually she told me she could no longer be friends with me, told me not to contact her, recommended I see a shrink and blocked me on facebook. Justice served.

Since graduating I have spent most of my time alone. I have had a lot of time to reflect and try to be a better person. I have stayed away from dating to work on my entitlement issues and my anxiety. Around a year ago is when I started thinking about H again. I am still blocked, I wonder if I have been the subject of a #metoo. I wonder if one of the reasons my psychiatrist isnâ€™t taking me seriously is if heâ€™s done something â€˜worse.â€™ I feel like any progress Iâ€™ve made is a sham, and that whatever good I manage to do will never undo my self\-identity as an abuser and the pain Iâ€™ve caused women and the few people who were kind enough to care about me. I am back to thinking that the only justice left for me is suicide.

Shamefully, it is my selfish worry that if I even bother to put in the effort into being a better person with hobbies and interests and a career that H will reappear into my life to let everyone know what a manipulative creep I was and in many ways still am.
