Am I the only one?I often wish I was dead, and Iâ€™m not at the stage Iâ€™ll act on it but I think about it a lot.
Iâ€™ve told friends Iâ€™m at a low point and they say the usual â€œI hope youâ€™re doing ok, yadda gaffsâ€ when they know full well Iâ€™m not.
If I killed myself theyâ€™d be all â€œI wish I did moreâ€ so why donâ€™t they? Why donâ€™t people, itâ€™s like they dont actually care.
I know itâ€™s messed up but if I do act on my feelings I want them to be guilty, I feel really let down they donâ€™t actually seem to care as much as they say they do.
Actions speak louder than words and thereâ€™s no actions from them at all.
