I feel like I'm gonna die no matter what I doI'm already pretty suicidal, and my life seems to just be slowly getting less and less optimistic. I can't picture any kind of future where I'd be even remotely happy. I feel like I'm just waiting for the day where I'll finally find the courage to end it all.

I hate the world. I hate everybody. I hate the Karens and Trumps of the world. I hate simps and whiteknights. I hate bigots and racists and hypocrites. I hate anybody that can achieve things that for me are so out of reach, and not give a thought about it. I hate how there's so little that gives me happiness of any kind. And I hate that I think that way. I don't think there's anything you could do or say that would make me change my mind. I'll always hate everything.

I'd mention it to my psychiatrists, but I don't even care about it anymore. I don't care about getting help for anything. There's nothing I want in this world other than happiness and contentment, and realistically there's nothing that can give that to me. Every day of my life for the past year, I've done nothing except procrastinate and dwell on my thoughts, just waiting for the day where I have the courage to end it all. I don't know when that day will come, but I hope it's soon. I'm so tired.
