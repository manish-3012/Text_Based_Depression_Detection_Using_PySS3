How do I get past survival instinct?It's so strong. I've been right there, teetering on the edge. I put a rope around my neck and my physical response was something I don't want to recall and describe. It wasn't terror. It was something else. I've never felt anything like that before. It was like something very cold like dry ice main lined in to my chest and all of a sudden everything went away. All complex thought was gone and the only objective was survival. 

I hadn't bothered to tie a proper noose, and I didn't use the drop method. I kicked a stool (chair, technically). There was a space between my neck and the knot. I just reached up and pulled my head out. I was surprised by how easy it was. I let myself fall and I stayed there for a while. 

I learned about the "lizard brain" in school. I've experienced enough adrenaline for one lifetime. This wasn't adrenaline. I'm sure adrenaline was involved but there was something else as well. My brain shut off and my body took over. As if it didn't belong to me. I think that's kind of amazing. 

My arms hurt. My fingers hurt. I ripped my nail beds but none of the nails came off. I won't even start on the state of my neck.

Anyway, I still need it to work. Does anybody have any tips on getting past this "lizard brain" thing that my body is apparently so fond of? I'm thinking if I zip tie my hands together, I won't have as much trouble. And I obviously need to tie a proper noose. I know how. I'm just lazy.

It's a war with myself. Funny that those who had to fight to stay alive for so long, struggle to leave the world when they want to. Makes sense I guess.
