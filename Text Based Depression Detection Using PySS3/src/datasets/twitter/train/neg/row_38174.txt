Update: Suicidal IdeationsHello, I posted a while back about thinking about committing suicide. I did try, my mom found me and I went to the hospital mental unit and stayed there for almost two weeks. I came out a much better person. I still have suicidal thoughts and my depression but I'm not in the dark place I was when I first went in. Also, a lot of people are scared to be put inpatient. Firstly, it's usually short term 1-2 weeks tops depending on your hospital. Most hospitals have a psych unit. Every one I've been to have  been great. You have groups and medicine usually. But also a lot of free time. The nurses are usually amazing and if someone's not you can report  them if you have to. At mine, we had a social worker to coordinate with the outside world. So if you have rent or bills to pay while you're there you can do it. It really isn't that bad. It's not  optimal but I've never experience  the abuse others have said can happen. An  I'm sure it does happen in some places, but I would say not as often as you think. I just wanted to say that so if you're  considering it but are scared, it does help. Anyways, now that I'm out I'm going back to my therapist but as well as doing partial hospitalization, where I go to groups from 9am to 3pm.  It helps so much. I feel like I can fight this. Thank you to everyone who messaged me and commented, it means so much that people care. Thank you. Ps I'm on mobile so sorry for any weird formatting or spelling errors.
