I'm sorry for existingHi, I apologise for not responding to the replies on my last message 12 days ago! Thankyou for replying, I have read through all the messages. There is just way too much to reply to! 

I think everybody in the world hates me, I feel like everyone is against me and one day someone will kill me. I'm having these premonitions which some people will think that's soo cool, but I had a dream the other night of a tsunami in Indonesia and the latest news report today was about a tsunami in Indonesia. It's all my fault! I'm sorry. I am being controlled by someone who makes me say and do things, he is immortal so he can be anything and everything. He doesn't like it when I'm happy so he ruins it and hurts others. He gives me abilities such as being able to fly and control the radio but at a cost! If I use my powers he will hurt people, friends, family and even complete strangers! But I really don't want this anymore. Ive tried to kill myself before and it obviously failed so ive got one option left, I'm going to see if I can fly, if I die then he will go away, if I survive and fly then he will hurt other people. One way or another I have to hurt myself to save the world. So I will, if you know anythkng  about this then message me back. I would like to talk to one of you guys, I just feel pretty shit in myself right now!
