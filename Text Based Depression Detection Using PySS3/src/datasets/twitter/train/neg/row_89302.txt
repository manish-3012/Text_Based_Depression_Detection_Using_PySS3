I really just want to die. I'm not going anywhere in my life and it's my faultI really don't care about living anymore, I really wish I could just kill myself right now. I want the strength to actually do it, to just end my life but for some reason I don't have it in me right now. I feel like I'm slowly getting there and I hope that day is soon. It's 1:53 in the morning and my brain feels foggy, I should be asleep right now I've got fucking school tomorrow but I really don't want to go. I just want to die in my sleep or something. I'm just so fucking lazy and stupid and awkward and dopey looking, it just kills me. I've got a huge fucking bald spot right on the side of my head from pulling my hair out. I'm supposedly going to see a therapist in 2 weeks but I can not wait any longer. I think about killing myself or wanting to die literally every day. I'm lazy and bad at studying and  literally anything else when it comes to learning. I wanted to go to college but the way I am now I doubt I'll ever make it so why bother. I had homework to do but I wasted my fucking time like always and procrastinated because I'm just dumb. I hope this time I die in my sleep. I swear, if I had a method of killing myself that was guaranteed to kill me I'd do it in a fucking heartbeat because why bother living anymore, I'm wasting my time doing nothing and everyone else's. I can't even cry about what I'm typing, I just feel dead.
