I need help.Throwaway account. I'm a sophomore engineering major at a university in the northeastern united states. I've been granted scholarships, loans, all with the contractual agreement to maintain a 3.0 average, something I fucked up bigtime but promised myself I would avenge this and next term. Well, that did not happen. I am currently experiencing the worst term so far, my grades are all at failing level. I have no chance at scraping higher than Cs in fucking everything. If I continue after the next term, I will lose a significant portion of my school finances and will most likely need to drop out. Due to the price of this school, I will then be almost $180,000 dollars in debt. My family has very little money, and I have lost all motivation to pull myself out of this shithole that I have dug for myself. I used to be a great student, albeit an ent, but not irresponsibly. I received 3s on AP exams, As in every high school class. College kicked my ass and I have nowhere else to turn. I have been depressed since I was 15 years old and only recently this year told anyone. I am currently seeking therapy but the magnitude of this situation is not settling on any of their attempts to help. To top it off, this past summer I was arrested and charged with a crime I did not commit. I am now in ARD for said crime, once again costing my family multiple thousands of dollars while they struggle and scrape to get by. In short, I'm a worthless fuck who isn't a fraction in return value for what they are paying, emotionally and fiscally. I can't keep living in a world where I know I have dashed every option and squandered my last chance to ever have an impact. I have lost every motivating factor to the point that I am unable to concentrate on work whatsoever. I see others (Americans) in my major who cannot write a coherent paragraph on a lab report, whilst getting As and Bs in a class that I am failing. I fucked myself, and I don't know where else to turn but to ending it.
