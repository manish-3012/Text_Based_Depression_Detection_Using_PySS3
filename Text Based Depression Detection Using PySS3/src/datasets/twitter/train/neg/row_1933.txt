My viewSo I got married at 17, expected to be with that woman for the rest of my life.  After about 25 yrs, she decided to finally lose some weight and started with 200 lbs of ugly husband - no abuse, no infidelity, just boredom.  I lost everything - no house, no family, no job.

So after about 5 years I got my life pulled back together.  At this point I'm in my late 40's, meet another woman, get married, buy a house, etc.  Now a little backstory here - pretty much all my life I've had health problems.  My first heart attack was in 1990, I weighed 180, non smoker, social drinker, no family history, active in sports, etc.  No way I deserved it.  I think my depression started then.  I know that I have been afraid every day for the past 27 years.  Just for the record, there have been three heart attacks, several "cardiac incidents" and a stroke.  I take pills for diabetes, depression, heart issues.  There may be lung issues involved.  I left my job in October, 1/2 step ahead of being fired for missing so much time.  So I'm not in a good place physically or emotionally.

So, on Thanksgiving weekend I left the house angry, depressed, unhappy, etc and ended up buying a pistol.  On Sunday, my loving, understanding wife had the police take me to the hospital.  While I was in there she filed a temporary restraining order which just became permanent - police at the house on Christmas eve during a family party.  While we were in court for the restraining order, her lawyer mentioned that she has filed for divorce.

Now I'm 58, no job, finances a wreck, bad health, marriage over, no social life, leaching off my daughter's family.  I just can't see ANY way to pretend there's a reason for going on.
