Are poor students supposed to be deadMoving in with some people in my university really was a mistake when everyone here is rich and pretends to be a broke college student, when I'm actually in fucking poverty and have no support from anyone. My broke parents cut me off when I told them I was gay and now I'm living off money I made over my gap year alongside money I get pleasing guys with foot kinks and doing cam work because it's the only way I could manage to make consistent income.

 I literally want to fucking die and my flatmates have sat me down twice to say "I know you have the shittiest room but it's also the biggest, so pay more rent or let us use your room as a social space," so I can't even have a space to myself just to sit and cry LOL. It sounds so pathetic but I really am at the end of my rope.  I tried to kill myself multiple times last year only to be met with failure, and I told myself this year I was going to stay alive just to see the end of it, but I can't fucking do it. I have so many things lined up, so many clubs and committees I've joined or I'm running just to try to give myself shit to do, and I'm trying to be a social butterfly and make more friends with the same interests I have, but nothing works out in my favour.

I really don't know where to go from here. Every job I try to get rejects me or doesn't even open my application. I keep signing up for university studies to get Â£20 vouchers for Amazon that I use for toothpaste and other basic crap everyone should have.  All my socks and underwear have holes in them, and I'm trying to figure out a way to sew back together a pair of trousers that ripped without having to buy a sewing needle. I barely have the money together to buy rice and eggs, and that's WITH student loan, but I really don't want to apply for extra funding just for being poor.... one, because I don't think I'll get it because 'technically' my family has money over the threshold (even though that money never materialises and I am literally cut off from them for life), and two, because the idea of being openly the Poor student in this hellhole makes me want to knife myself even more.

I'm on an SSRI but it literally does nothing except give me awful nightmares, and I have the worst side affects when I don't take it for even 24 hours, so I don't know how to ween myself off of it. I keep trying to tell my doctor that it's not working out for me too, but he'll just say to keep on going with it - and also that SSRIs are the cheapest medication, and I'm scared to go on something I can't afford.

Every night I fall asleep hugging my pillow pretending it's some fictional person who will never exist, whose only personality trait is that they love me. I am just so fucking tired of pretending and hoping some reason to live or some energy will pump into my body with hard work, when every day just gets longer and harder.

Thanks for reading. I know it's a busy time for this board, and there's a lot of other people asking for the same sort of verbal comforting I am. Sorry.
