I have Asperger's, Bipolar 2, and OCD, etc. I'm completely burnt out. It also appears that I'm starting to have auditory hallucinations. I've bounced in and out of many psych hospitals. I have all the psych help one can have, and I still need help.If you would humor me, I listed some of my posts below. I'm too exhausted to write an OP tonight. 

I have a psychiatry appointment tomorrow, but nothing will change. I saw my first psychiatrist at age 12. Meds are ineffective or I'm highly sensitive to the side effects--oftentimes both. Please don't give me the "find the right med" spiel. I did the med game for 13 years. Groups/IOPs, intensive one-on-one, hospitalization for a month: I've done those too. I'm an ECT candidate, but I'll pass on that.

I'm very depressed and I may be having some auditory hallucinations or something such as that. Psychiatrist tomorrow.

I'm 25. I have yet to be able to manage my life well. Suicide is on my mind and in my heart everyday. It has been so for a very long time. I'm tired from life and I don't think I can bear it much longer.

[US] I was denied SS Disability and they didn't pull the records from the 15 psychiatric hospitalizations (since I turned 18) that I listed OR contact my psychiatrist. I'm 25 and have not had a job since I was 18 and that was part-time for less than 3 months. They didn't talk with my doctor.   https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/5nf6bq/us_i_was_denied_ss_disability_and_they_didnt_pull/


[USA] I assume some of you are or were unable to work due to ASD. I need advice about Social Security Disability. My claim was denied without review because I am ineligible on the grounds that I have never held a job for long. How can I apply for help?   https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/5pd9k4/usa_i_assume_some_of_you_are_or_were_unable_to/
