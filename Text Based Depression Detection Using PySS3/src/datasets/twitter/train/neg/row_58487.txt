Telling a depressed person "I promise you it will get better" is inaccurate and patronizing.My childhood and teens were spent being beaten and horribly abused by narcissistic parents. As a result, I've developed C-PTSD, I'm very traumatized and introverted, have no idea how to make friends, have never had a SO that lasted longer than 2 months. I'm completely isolated to the point that if I died only the stink would alert the neighbours. This is the just the tip of the iceberg.

I've been suicidal since the age of about 10 and really wish I had jumped out of that window. In my 20s and 30s I travelled a lot to stave off the numbness and depression plaguing my life. The worst thing is that people who don't suffer from depression don't understand and shit out meaningless platitudes. 

The most inaccurate and bullshit platitude is the meaningless line: "I PROMISE you it'll get better." This is usually spouted by dumbasses who don't have a clue about depression or about being abused and suffering from a deep loneliness and isolation.

First of all, you can't PROMISE anyone anything. Secondly, while the body ages and often gets sick things get worse. Now that I've been diagnosed with Stage 4 cancer, I dare any dipshit on SW to tell me "things get better."

I survived an emergency op in 2011 when I nearly died. Surviving has done nothing for me but made things WORSE. I didn't "meet the man of my dreams", "find a wonderful job" or suddenly "had loads of good fortune and fixed my life". No, I developed incurable cancer instead. So fuck the assholes with their meaningless platitudes.

This summer I'm finally done and have my plans in place.
