So when you're older it really does seem like there's nothing leftIt's weird being in my shoes right now. I don't even know whose shoes they are lately. 

  I used to love life. I used to be crazy in a GOOD way. I didn't have it all. I had good things though. Great girl. Great kid. Good brain. Good friends. 

  When you get sick, and you don't get better, people kind of drop off. The happiness kind of drops off. Eventually, it all goes away if you don't cling to the ones you love. Clinging will make you feel like shit though. So there's a good chance you get shameful and prideful. And combative. And if the disease in question is in your brain, there's a very good chance you will become all of those things. 
  I lost myself. I lost the people who loved me. I lost almost everything in my quest to feel better. I'm sick, but it was still me who did those things. 
  I look back on 5 years of dysfunction and I see myself to blame for the hell that got put on the folks that loved me. I know that person wasn't me. It really wasn't. But what difference does that make to them?

  So now I'm 40. This is when shit gets bad for me. This is where I wind up. Why? I thought I was a good person. I thought I was gonna make it. I'd never have imagined I'd be ready to commit suicide EVER. 
  When you're younger, you DO have your life ahead of you. It feels right when you're through a dark patch.  It doesn't take long for it to be too late. Now I'm 40. It feels over.
I took a lot of chances. I tried to push myself forward. I got nowhere. I got shit. I thought hard work and a positive attitude was enough. Sometimes it is. It wasn't for me. 
I was better off 10 years ago. Before I tried to change things. Before I tried to change my life. 
I fucked up. My love is gone. My life is sad. I'm ill. I have a job but I'm underpaid. I have a kid that wants to be away from me. I have no options. I can't start over. No one will hire a sick 40 year old. I had skills, but those skills look better on a young kid. 

  I don't drink. That seems to be a common ground. It helps to socialize. All I have is my illness. And a lifetime of belongings and identity that I don't recognize anymore. Depersonalized. Derealized. Depressed. Bipolar. What the fuck? I can't even play games. It all makes me sad, and twitchy, and weird. No music, no movies, no games, no sex... no me.
   So why stay? For the kid? She keeps me from it. But I'm not making her life good. I'm ruining it. I was the best dad in the world. And I crumbled. She doesn't remember me. She remembers this... whatever I am now.

  I hate myself. I want to die. I never got that. I never understood why someone would do it. This is my punishment for being young and ignorant. For not trying harder to understand depression. Because it was always there in the background. Maybe it is for all of us. I was just really good at telling it to fuck off because I had some shit to do. Now it's telling me what to do. 
  I don't want to. I really don't. But More than wanting to live I want to believe that things will get better. Things will be fun again. My brain will wake up. I'll sleep again. I'll beat my disease. I don't believe it anymore. 
  I'm only alive because I love my kid right now. But that's starting to wear thin. She doesn't like me. She wants to be away from me. She doesn't want to be a family. She wants me out of her life. And I want to stop hurting the people who love me. So I do one big hurt, and then everyone can say "he's at peace now" Or whatever they say. And they'll be sad for a while but they'll get by. Because they have other things to live for. Their lives are good. 
  She's across the hall right now. I love her so much. And all my brain can do is scream at me to end it. This is the worst pain I've ever felt. I keep coming back to these forums because it is all I have keeping me alive. But why do I want to live? I'm not making the world any good. Why do I keep going?
