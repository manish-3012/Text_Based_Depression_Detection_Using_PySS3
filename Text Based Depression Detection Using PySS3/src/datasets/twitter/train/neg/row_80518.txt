[DAY 4] Binge-watching videos about people losing someone from suicide.I'm binge-watching Suicide Prevention videos just for me to stop myself from doing it. Nothing happened bizarrely happened today just had an argument over some Political Correct Karens who got offended over a dumb meme on a shitpost Facebook group that was fun to be in XD. But overall Still in that dark place.
