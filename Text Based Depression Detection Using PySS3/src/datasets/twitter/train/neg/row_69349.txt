My mother is the only thing keeping me alive.I had a conversation tonight with the girl I like. Sheâ€™s going on a date Friday. Iâ€™m jealous and I ruined any opportunity for us to be together. This is common in my life. I canâ€™t never be happy. Everyday I feel my chance at happiness get smaller and smaller. Everyday I realize how misunderstood and insignificant I am.

My mother is the only reason I am here. I canâ€™t break her heart. I canâ€™t imagine making her cry. So I stay alive for her sake but I would rather be dead and not suffer any longer.
