I expected i'd come back to normalI'm gonna try to keep it short, i'm not exactly depressed but very close to it. Recently i lost my virginity (21) after going out with a few friends , got high on weed pills alcohol n shit and we went at a brothel after, they had arranged it for me in a secret way otherwise they thought i'd say no.
(they were right)

After all was done i felt awesome, no anxiety or bad vibes during it or after it, it was awesome we spent the night joking on it smoking some more joints.

Woke up the next day feeling that everything is pointless, i was getting better buy now things are worse and i can't understand why, i smoke more, i hate my job more and i think that now maybe i AM depressed for real and not just "sad".
