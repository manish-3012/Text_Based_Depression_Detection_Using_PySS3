Impossible to survive in todays world.It seems no matter how hard I try or do things right its like your meant to fail and give up.

Not sure where to even start. 
Working a shitty job motivated me to aquire training for a better  postion and pay took forever but got it. Now this aca crap kicked in and I am back to square one well thanks to everything going up I have been running at a deficit for well over 6 months. I sold everything I could but now the well has run dry.
no family to go to nor can I even support my own. After a string of bad luck that has depleted my savings like nothing im at my last wits.

I am unable to get a second job as no one will ever call for a interview hell I would love a rejection notice at this point.

when ever I get  ahead something seems to pop up. How can anyone live like this? I want to work hard save enjoy life but it seems impossible.

Its so bad I cant even afford to walk down to the gun range to rent a gun and finish the job. 


So does anyone have any advice?
