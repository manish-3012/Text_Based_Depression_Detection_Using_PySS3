lying here awake with my husband next to me asleep, almost 30, lost 18 years to depression.I'm barely functional and unemployed, can't seem to hold down a job without falling apart. I've attempted suicide 5 times, been in the ICU twice, mental hospital I think 5 times. Life is unpleasant for me. I only endure it because of my loved ones, who are wonderful. But living for others only is hard and desperate.  I want to die, but I'm scared. My last suicide attempt, I believe I saw something like hell. I was trapped in a nightmare for what felt like years due to med overdose. Afraid of that happening again. But also can't stand living.
