Today's the dayI asked my bestmate if we can meet up soon, she said she wasnt free till summer, which is 10 weeks away. We lost the heart you get on snapchat after being no.1 bestfriends for 2 months, it hurt to think she prefers talking to someone else over me 

It may not seem like much, but in a life where my dads could leave and my mum could die at any moment, she was the only stability i had in my life, and now that that's gone, i believe its time for me to go to.

College is too much to handle without my bestfriend messaging me through class to get me through the day. I just cam't do it.
