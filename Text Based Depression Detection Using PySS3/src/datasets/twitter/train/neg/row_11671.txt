Not Who I Used to BeI used to be a star student. I was a hardworking, ambitious girl. But now Iâ€™m in college, I figured out I was trans, and have never been worse off than I have now. Iâ€™ve been hospitalized twice for suicidal thoughts and an attempt, and now everything exhausts me. Iâ€™m lazier than I ever have been. I sleep so much. I make excuses that I never would have made before. 

I just miss who I used to be... I wish I was dead.
