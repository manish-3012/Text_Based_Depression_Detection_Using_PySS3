I don't know what to doI feel like i have no right to be depressed. I have a loving family, friends, enough money, opportunities,... When i think about people being happy in worse situations than mine, i feel even shittier. The hardest thing is to hide this "part" of me for my friends, because they wouldn't understand. Tbh i don't think anyone would understand from all the people i know and can talk to. I feel like all the things i live/lived for are slowly fading away, everytime i lose something in my life i search for something else and rely on that until it's gone. I'm scared of the moment that i will have nothing left.
