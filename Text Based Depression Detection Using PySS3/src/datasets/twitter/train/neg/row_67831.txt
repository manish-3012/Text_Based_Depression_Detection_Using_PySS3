(Had to put a title here but dont know what to say)Sometimes i just dont feel it worth for living anymore. Te thoughts of that nobody would remeber me or would care about me if i would die just makes it worse. When i have these thoughts im also just thinking about dissapearing, starting a new life in a country far away were nobody knows what kind of shit i am what lies have been told where i can find people to care for and people who care for me. Its just those days where i havent even said a word to anyone and where i realise how lonely im actually are.
