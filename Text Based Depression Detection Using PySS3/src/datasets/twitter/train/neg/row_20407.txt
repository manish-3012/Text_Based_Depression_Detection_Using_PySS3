I just tried to hang myselfI woke up after 15 minutes of unconsciousness, my grandma walked in and opened the door and the know was made lighter around my neck. My face is all pale and purple. My heart is rushing. I have one question, when will my face go back to normal? I have ni intention of hurting myself again, I just want to know when I will look normal again. Please tell me.
