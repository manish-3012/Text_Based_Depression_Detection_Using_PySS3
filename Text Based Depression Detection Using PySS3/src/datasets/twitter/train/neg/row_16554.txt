Everytime.Anytime I drink the shit thoughts come like waves. I know, I've been told to stop drinking but it makes me numb. I only drink to excess when I am alone and safe. Fuck, I'm so sick of explaining myself and bringing more and more people into my shit. I just want to be fixed and the hardest part about my disease or whatever it is, is that they say I will never be fixed. It will just be treated.. 

I think why am I here? why do I stay? I stay for everyone else. I endure this fuckin pain so that everyone else feels better. Why the fuck is considered suicide the most selfish thing? when the reason I am here is for everyone else, to make sure they don't end up sad at my departure. 
I dont want to make a physical or emotional mess. Yet I will endure this internal pain, for as long as you fuckin need me to. 

Who is really the selfish one?
