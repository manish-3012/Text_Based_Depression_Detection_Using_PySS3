Think Iâ€™m going to do it.Took Celexa for 3 weeks for anxiety. Iâ€™ve been off of it 2 months now. Ever since, Iâ€™ve had low libido and messed up orgasms. Iâ€™m a young male and never have had any issues. One of the few things I still enjoyed in life was masturbation and sex, and now itâ€™s gone. I think itâ€™s permanent even though I only took it for 3 weeks. I think Iâ€™m going to end my life, this is absolutely devastating
