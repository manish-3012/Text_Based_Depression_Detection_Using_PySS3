why am i herewhy am i alive?

hi. i am not religious. iâ€™m not exactly atheist either but... why am i alive? there are people that deserve the life i have more than me and i just donâ€™t understand why i have it. there are children w cancer wanting life so bad and then thereâ€™s me , a 19 yr old girl w a life that she feels she doesnâ€™t deserve. i donâ€™t get why iâ€™m even alive at this point. i donâ€™t deserve it more than anyone else and i have a loving boyfriend but i hate my parents and my family is really fucked up and just filled w horrible ppl, w some in jail and others that should be and iâ€™m just wondering why i am still alive. iâ€™ve cut before but never had the balls to actually take my life. why am i still alive ?
