Losing my willI just don't want to suffer alone in silence anymore. My pcp left, then my therapist left. My friends have all left me. My family is non-involved. I am sick of feeling guilty for wishing I was dead. I don't want to be here anymore, I don't want to "tolerate" all this pain. I just wish there was an easy way out.
