Running on a treadmill.I've been dealing with depression for years. It gets better and worse, in cycles.... but it's always there.

Recently has been one of my lowest lows. And I'm actively *trying*. I'm *tyring*, God *DAMN* it, to make myself happier-- to "get better".
I just keep running in place.

That's what it feels like.

And, honestly? The one reason that has kept me alive is that I have dogs.  I love people, and I care for them.... but God damn it.... I can't just leave my dogs.

(What a silly reason, I know.... but it has been saving me for years....)

**I just want to get better.**
