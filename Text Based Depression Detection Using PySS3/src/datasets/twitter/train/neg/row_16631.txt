Think I wanna hurt myself tonightI canâ€™t do this anymore. Even if I donâ€™t... make it official... I just want to hurt myself. Iâ€™m so tired of everything. Iâ€™m tired of people. Iâ€™m tired of myself. I have this insane apathy for the world around me and how fucked it is right now. Even without my suicidal thoughts, i donâ€™t want to be apart of what the world is right now. Everything is disappointing.
