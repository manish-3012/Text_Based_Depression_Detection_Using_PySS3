I've had this tab open for a while now. Hi.I guess I'm making a post, but it's not going to be anything long-winded or poetic. I guess I'll write out my situation, but it's really not anything special or important. It probably just sounds like some stupid problems that everyone else can handle. I don't know anything like what normal people go through.

I have GAD and what's probably bipolar (the next time I can talk to a professional is going to be several months from now, and I've had the appointment scheduled for several months already). I haven't been outside in about a week. There's not really any point, even if I could make it to the door. I never was normal, and I never developed any kind of social skills. When I try to talk at all I get a very violent physical stammer. I wasn't able to stay in school, and I never had any reason to practice any sort of logical reasoning, so I'm pretty stupid.

That's basically it. I probably won't even end up doing anything. I never do.

That was longer than it was supposed to be.
