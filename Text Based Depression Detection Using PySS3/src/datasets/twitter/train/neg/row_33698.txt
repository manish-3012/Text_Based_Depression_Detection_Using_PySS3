What does this say? I just don't feel a thing anymore. It's so cliche but I do feel no way.I look at the moon and I see light fighting to surface
Fading in and out of purpose
I feel I am the moon

Floating above the surface
Where all the fun is
Unknown

Query to the unknown

Who are you? 

And reboo-reboot.

Babe I wanna fight you
I don't wanna night-night
Just craving every second alive

Sleep is death
Land of hateful lies
Just to escape 

I masturbate

What do they dream of?
Those farther above and below me
I'm just so prole, I don't even know me

I don't know where I stand

But I'm alive

Keep moving 

Broke white

Dusty gnoll
See me aiming?
I just wanna shoot game

Once you're in with the equipment
You've gotta worry about who ya target
Blasting wildly makes a lotta false prophets

Martyrs in mayhem
Find a pretty cry

Out comes your strawman

With a new coat of skin
Sand-blasted
Hateful bastard

Emptied of vessel so
Colors simply in glass
Stained, all my reasons

In the design
Desperate sign
"Escape is?"

A lofty cry
Never knowing why
The aftermath leaves

Dancing
Drifting
Dropping

Until wind decides carry
Make dance and play
Always a smiling face

Oh, I pray I'll die today
