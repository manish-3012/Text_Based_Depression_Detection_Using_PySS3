Depression/suicide survivors with relationshipsNot sure the subject was the best to sum this up, but as someone who is chronically (and to me reality-based) depressed and considers suicide frequently (have not attempted) I am shocked at how often I read about others and the relationships they have. It seems rare to read about someone like myself that has no real friends (some online I say a few things to weeks a part), no dates/gf/wife since I have began to sink into this (7 years ago or so), and a family that seems to know but probably has no idea how to deal with it or show much support.

I guess I am only writing this after reading a Rolling Stone article on suicide rates in the midwest where every example was people actively social but secretly depressed. Who out there has not connected to anyone since becoming depressed/suicidal? Not necessarily for lack of trying either. My views on the world/people seem to be impossible to hide when I make attempts because people seem to, probably wisely, avoid me. And yet, I see so many people with dire outlooks that still attract people to want to be around them. It blows my mind.
