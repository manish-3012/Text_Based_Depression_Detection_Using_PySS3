Just need to know someone can hear me.I'm sitting in a public space trying to feel safe around people, keeping myself accountability by the company of strangers, but I'm struggling. I'm grieving the loss of my marriage, the loss of my wife, and the loss of my future with her. I was  verbally, emotionally, and twice physically abusive. That she left is for her own good, and I'm not asking for sympathy. I deserve whatever happens to me. But I don't think that this is the way to go. I can still do good. And hopefully make amends to the world. Please, anyone.
