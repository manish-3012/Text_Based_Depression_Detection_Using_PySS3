Iâ€™m gonna fucking kill myselfIâ€™m an idiot. I donâ€™t think and I rush through everything, Iâ€™m stressed all the time, Iâ€™m a terrible person and I have no future. I somehow managed to fuck up an assignment in my chem class today where everyone got a 100 besides me who got a fucking B-. I fucked this quiz in math where literally everyone again got a 100 and I got a 75. I can barely understand the topics in my other classes and I just wanna fucking die. Iâ€™ve attempted 3 times now and I legitimately think Iâ€™m gonna go through this time. Iâ€™ve realized that Iâ€™m not smart in any way and that Iâ€™m a piece of shit person who has no place in anyoneâ€™s life. And last year I fucked up all my classes as well and almost failed all of them. I just want to kill myself. My parents also forgot my 16th birthday 2 weeks ago and just yesterday my mom told me she just 50$ in my bank account. Not even a â€œIâ€™m sorryâ€ or â€œwe can celebrate now sorryâ€. God Iâ€™m just so fucking pissed. Iâ€™ve realized that none of â€œfriendsâ€ actually care about me and that I suck at running compared to all of them (cross country). Iâ€™m so fucking useless I just want to shoot my self but I donâ€™t have a way to get my hands on a gun.
