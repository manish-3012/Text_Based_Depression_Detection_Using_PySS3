Heartbroken and given upThe title says it all. Anyone been to psychics with good reviews been told that their Parnell is someone else soulmate and will be with that person forever. Cause I have been told that he is in a relationship with that person by that girl so I went to psychics and thatâ€™s what they told me or yeah many of them thatâ€™s good. He denies and denies but the psychic and fortune tellers are so spot on with all the things. Now I am so fucking heartbroken cause that guy is all I love. I am on medication and stuff but still heartbroken. Anyone have been going to psychics and fortune tellers that got many good reviews and followers and been told something like this and they have been wrong? Please donâ€™t lie to make me calm just tell me the truth. I am honestly so shattered
