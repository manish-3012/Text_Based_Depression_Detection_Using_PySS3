Just looking for some support.I've attempted suicide once, unsuccessfully, and actually for a bit afterwords felt like I made the wrong choice and deserved to stay alive. These days I just feel empty though, and I feel like I'm sleepwalking through my life. It's kind of funny that today is the cake day of this account, I guess it really must be something about this time of year. Fuck spring I guess.

I've been really terribly depressed and I don't feel like I'm going to be able to claw my way out of this for a while. I don't know if I'm going to even graduate anymore as my second semester grades have reached a rock bottom. I used to be an A and B, very occasional C student, but currently I have two F's, one D, and C's across the board elsewhere. Even if I do pull things up I don't think that the college I was admitted to will still allow me to enroll, as I'm fairly certain this big of a plummet in grades will result in a rescinding of my admission. I had my senior recital last Tuesday, a show I spent months practicing for, but got so anxious once I got on stage that I had to stop halfway through my set because I was butchering every song and walked off stage in tears. I've started having behavioral problems because I just feel angry and want to act on it which led to me getting my first behavioral referral due to me calling out a teacher on Facebook and being reported for it, my friends use me for my car and my money and stop hanging out with me when I cut them off but I'm so desperate for interaction that I keep them around. My parents are disappointed and worried, I can't find success in any of things I want to be good at and I'm really not sure what I'm doing anymore. I think I'm going to kill myself soon, I just don't know how. I really wish my life wasn't a perpetual cycle of shitty days.
