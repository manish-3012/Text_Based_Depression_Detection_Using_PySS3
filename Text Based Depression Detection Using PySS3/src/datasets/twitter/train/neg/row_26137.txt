The voices wonâ€™t shut upThe voices are weird. I can tell they are my own thoughts but they still seem alien to me. I catch myself sometimes screaming out loud for them to shut up. They tell me Iâ€™m useless, to hurt myself, and to kill myself. I go out and buy utility blades and rope. Soak 23 tissues in blood. I just want them to shut up for 2 seconds. Itâ€™s unbearable and I canâ€™t deal with it. Iâ€™ve almost done it three times this week. Itâ€™s the voices. Theyâ€™re making me stop. Theyâ€™re tormenting me. I just want to drift off into a deep sleep. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll let myself fail again.
