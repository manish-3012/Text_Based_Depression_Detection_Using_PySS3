I am socially retarded, anxious, gay, ugly, annoying, unlikeable, and my best (and only) friend jumped off a cliff because I didn't stop him.I cannot remember the last close relationship I had to another person in real life, while online anyone I talk to only responds out of obligation. Ever since he died the guilt has destroyed me, I knew he was going to do it but didn't tell anyone, I was confused and had no clue what do to, I know people here will say it wasn't my fault, but if I posted here before he killed himself asking for help on what to do I'm sure everyone would tell me to tell someone. I'll never find someone and die alone should I live out my life, and even if I didn't look like a monkey with the personality of a coaconut people are impossible to approach and talk to anyway. I spend 18 hours a day in my bed with my dog. If I died literally no one would care, my family would see it as a burden off their shoulders, and everyone else would get to stop being bothered by me. I know anyone who posts to this will be doing it out of obligation, but I needed to at least type out everything I can't tell anyone, even if no one sees. If I had a quick and painless way to do it right now I probably would, but I'm scared of dying even though I'm more scared of living.
