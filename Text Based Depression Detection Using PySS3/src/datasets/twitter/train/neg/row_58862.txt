It never endsI have chronic pain, Iâ€™ve been trying everything I can. Iâ€™ve been to so many doctors and pain Clinics but nothing ever sticks. Iâ€™m tried of hurting, Iâ€™m only 21 I just wanna live a normal life. Iâ€™m stuck in this body for the rest of my life. I just wanna end it but Iâ€™m scared If I fail, I donâ€™t wanna live with more suffering. I wish all the abuse I had went though had just killed me instead just this. Why did I have to be born, just to go though all this pain. Iâ€™m so tired of fighting.
