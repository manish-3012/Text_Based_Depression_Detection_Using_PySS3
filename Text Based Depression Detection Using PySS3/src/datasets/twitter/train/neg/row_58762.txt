No one can make it better...No one can make it better, even I've tried. All I wanted was to see my best friend today but theres a very very low chance he can come out today. I dont blame him. I still have these pills. I dont care about the risk anymore. I've said my last "I love you" to him. I want to do it. I think I'm really going to do it this time. No more putting it off.
