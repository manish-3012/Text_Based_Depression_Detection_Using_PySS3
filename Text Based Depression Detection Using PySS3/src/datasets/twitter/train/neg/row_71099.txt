I donâ€™t know what to do anymoreI been having suicidal thoughts for a while I donâ€™t know what to do. Iâ€™m 17.. I havenâ€™t even hit adulthood yet at this rate Iâ€™m pretty sure Iâ€™ll barely hit my 30s. My minds distorted, itâ€™s like I donâ€™t know what I want, I donâ€™t know who I am as a person ðŸ˜¦ 


As of now Iâ€™m attending community college, I start class September 10th and Iâ€™m not mentally prepared at all. Iâ€™m pretty much an only child at the moment. Most my relatives and people I grew up with are much older and are on the process of getting their lifeâ€™s together so I rarely see them. I have friends but most of the time they wanna hang out I sadly decline ðŸ˜” my anxiety is too much to handle, I overthink to many scenarios in my head and it all goes to shit. Iâ€™m even on meds, theyâ€™ve helped immensely but my anxiety is still there. I also have this uncomplying fear of women.. I pretty much donâ€™t understand what love is. This is pretty embarrassing for me to bring this up but itâ€™s messing up my life experiences. Iâ€™m just extremely socially awkward when speaking to women, especially if itâ€™s women Iâ€™ve never speak with before. I also forgot to mention that my self esteem has crumbled over the years. Growing up I was an outgoing child who could talk to anyone but as I grew older people changed. Now Iâ€™m just a hermit who avoids social interaction because Iâ€™m afraid of opening up and being myself to people. I donâ€™t know how to have conversation.. shit I canâ€™t even socialize with my own family without creating scenarios that will never happen, but my crippling mind perceives them as bad. I just hate myself and wish I could be the best person of my ability to others I love.


Iâ€™m sorry if I overwhelm you with my bullshit:( but Iâ€™m just lost idk what to do with my life, Iâ€™ve been depressed for over 5 years now
