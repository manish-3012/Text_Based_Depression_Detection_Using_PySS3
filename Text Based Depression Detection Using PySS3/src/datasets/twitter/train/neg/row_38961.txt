Im going to try tonight. Ive never been more clear.My whole life Ive always thought I would be the one who ended my life. Death dosent scare me. And Ive tried way too long to try not think this way. But i cant anymore. 

I pushed away everyone so that this point would be easier. Im so tired. Im so tired of being tired. Nobody understands. And I dont want anyone to. Im me. I make my own choices. And this is my choice. My mind tortures me every fucking day. Im miserable but not allowed to show an inch of sadness. 

There is such much hate in my life. I hate myself. I hate every single aspect. I was accidental waste of space at birth and I still am. Why should I want to live my dull shitty life. Why cant I give up? I cant make the noise stop and nobody else can. So im taking control. Of my life. My worthless fucking life and finally making this decision. For myself and nobody else. I truly believe not a single person will morn for me longer than a month. I feel horrible making them go through this. But i hope they see it will help. Me and them. They dont have to worry or be disapointed anymore.
