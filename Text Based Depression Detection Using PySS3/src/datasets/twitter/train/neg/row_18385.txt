My life is confusing..I'm 21, I have to pay my rent, and I quit my job.

I quit it because it wasn't being fair to me.. but most importantly I quit it because I felt like I couldn't stand another minute at it.. I told myself that i'll just find a different job, and I scheduled an interview for a position as a waiter, but today an hour before work I had an intense emotional episode and I canceled it.. 

Why can't I just enjoy life? Why can't I just chill? Why must I WASTE MY LIFE EVERY SINGLE DAY TO WORK 8 HOURS A DAY. Just so half my paycheck goes to paying rent, and another half paying bills..

I almost wish to be homeless, but how could I be homeless?
Why must I come from a family with nothing to give me but financial burden, while my friends get financial security from family savings\furtune...

Working part-time might be my salvation, but..

1. I need money right now to pay bills and things that have pilled up because of not working for a long time..

2.  What's the point, of working part-time at all then if I can't save almost anything


I honestly don't know what to do. I'm confused, scared.. I don't think I have the mental capacity to keep going. I swear some days it just feels like it'll be so much easier for me to just end it all..
