I don't know if this is the right place for this, but I'm tired of being in so much pain...I've been dealt a series of personal setbacks over the past few months, I have a diagnosed history of major clinical depression, I have attempted in the past, and I feel like I'm coming close again. I'm just tired of living: the personal rejections, the personal disaster after disaster with no end in sight... 

I'm...*afraid* isn't the word, because at this point I would honestly welcome Death as a friend and as a release from this seemingly never-ending cycle of mental anguish, physical pain and living in an emotional vacuum. My health insurance will not cover mental health services, and I make too much money for charitable care programs; I've tried to get help that way, and it hurts to hear those words, "I'm sorry Mr.  Fuzzybeard, but you don't qualify..." 

Is there a reason that I **shouldn't** go this route?
