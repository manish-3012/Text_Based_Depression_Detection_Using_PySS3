Don't try and help me..I want to die.
Don't redirect me to 1-800-SUICIDE or 1-800-237-TALK or what et the number is.

I just want an easy way to do it. I don't wanna hurt.. I've been depressed for a few months, and I just seek to end it. There's really no point in living, and I'd rather do it... Now, while I have no commitments..
Oh wait.. This subreddit is full of people with moral value.. They would never help me!
