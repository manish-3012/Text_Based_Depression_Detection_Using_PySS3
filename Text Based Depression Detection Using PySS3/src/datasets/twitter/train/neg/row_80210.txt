All I can take is no more.All I could hope for is for things to get better cause all I can take is no more. 


Im losing the will to live slowly but surely. My strength fades as the dreams of lover and best friend grows more vividly.
She needed more than me. Im suicidal, despressed and have low self esteem so she needed more than me.
Truth be told if I had the means id kill myself right now.
Maybe then people will realize i wasnt just seeking attention or manipulating. You'll all see.
