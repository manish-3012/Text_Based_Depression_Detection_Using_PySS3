Ive been on this sub before. With all this time at home, I find myself contemplating suicide more and more.You can look into my account history to get the back story of my situation. With the quarantined here in California I find myself slipping deeper and deeper into that pit of depression and loneliness. I have a roommate and his three dogs but they donâ€™t help as much as I thought they would. I also didnâ€™t expect to be quarantined with no job and no income. Canâ€™t even apply for unemployment. Iâ€™m seeing Suicide as the most viable option now after all thatâ€™s happened to me since the beginning of the year.
