convince me. why shouldnt i kill myself?some opening points:

1. i never wanted to be born. i never got the choice. but now i do have the choice to reverse that mistake. i should be allowed to kill myself cause that way at least im choosing for myself what i want.
2. everyone has the "right" to live, right? but why dont i get the right to die also? if i dont have a choice thats not much of a right, thats being forced. why is it basically illegal to kill yourself? why does everyone try so hard to stop me from getting what i want?
3. i literally dont want anything other than to die. i dont want to get better. i dont want to acheive any goals. im good. all i want is to stop existing.
4. suicide isnt selfish, what is selfish is forcing someone who hates being alive to continue to do so just so that you can feel good about yourself. im sick of it

tell my why i shouldnt kill myself
