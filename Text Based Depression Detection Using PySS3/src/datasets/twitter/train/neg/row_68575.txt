I think i might kill myself after allI can't shake it anymore. I don't want to live. I'm unemployed, single and chronically lonely, no friends, and no purpose or direction in life. In short, I'm hopeless.

I write this in the dead of night, as all the world has seemed to forgotten me. Or at least my facebook "friends" have, not that I go on there anymore or talk to people. I'm treated like a child in job interviews, because apparently you have to be an adult to be hired and I'm 26. I can't get a girlfriend because I don't have confidence, and I think relationships are just another problem to be honest.

I ruminate over everything, trying to fix myself, googling things like "how to cope with loneliness" or "how do i become confident when i hate myself" and I just end up reading a ton of petty advice that may works on any normal person, but not me.

I'm at rock bottom, and, honestly, that's where I want to end up--at the bottom of some bridge. I have no reservations, and no responsibilities to hold me back (my student debt will be forgiven for my death because it's a government loan)

It's 2:02am, and and the only hope i can see is through the barrel of a 9mm. I'm supposed to see my therapist tomorrow, after months, but now I'm thinking of just applying for a gun permit instead. 

I am voracious about ending my own life because it will be the benefit of all, and I will take actionable steps to achieve this end.
