suicidal after close one did itI started talking to this girl I met online, I hung around her for months until we finally decided to talk seriously. We shared secrets, talked about life, and depression, philosophy, all kinds of stuff, she made me feel understood and she was a very unique person, and the more we talked, the more quickly the attachment grew. It was quite an emotional roller-coaster as she kept talking about suicides, but I started to not take it very seriously, because she kept threatening it over and over, and each time it did not happen, until it became dull, however, just 2 days ago, I think she really did it, she gave me one last message "you were very kind {name} &lt;3" and from then on I have not seen her reply to any of my messages since, and has been completely inactive. She did told me her previous attempt was pills, but she survived, I have a bad feeling about this time. Yesterday I cried for hours on end, it's this loneliness, empty, hopeless feeling, that she no longer exists in the current world, complete dread and despair, she seemed so unique that I feel like I will never meet another person like this ever again. I have genuinely never experienced such tremendous amount of mental pain in my life, I felt completely suicidal, and claustrophobic, and there's a high chance that this time is real, and not simple threats.
