going to the ERi'm not sure if i should. i think i'm planning to go tomorrow, if possible. i'm thinking of telling my mom tomorrow morning but god if i'm not absolutely terrified. the nearest ER to me is 45 minutes away and i'm still debating on whether i should or not 

i'm suicidal. the thoughts are there almost everyday, i've got a plan, and i've got the resources. all i really need is the actual fucking courage to do it. i've come close more than several times, one of those times just being this afternoon. i'm terrified of saying something. but i'm sure i need to go before it's too late. 

god im so goddamn scared 

sorry if this is all over the place i was never the best at describing things
