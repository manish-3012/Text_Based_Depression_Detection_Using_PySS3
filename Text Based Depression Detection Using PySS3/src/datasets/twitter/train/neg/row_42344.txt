4am. Being alive hurtsHi...

If I had the right meds to do it beside me... I don't know if I could resist... I don't know if the others inside this body could stop me...  
but I don't have an easy secure way... I know I'll be alive next morning... next week... month...  
No matter how unbearable that thought is... next year maybe...  
It has become a pattern... Kashi living, happy if I am not around... fighting if I am... to the point when she can't... then I am here... like right know, she could not go on and decided that this is one of the safest placed for me... at night in bed, hopefully asleep soon... but I can't really fall asleep... she is right that it is safe for her... I wont get up to do anything to the body....

But it hurts. I want to cry but can't. There is nothing I can do to change what happened... and I cannot deal with it... I just want to be dead....  
I usually tend to end up writing about how I feel or watching some comedies, a movie or chat... (or like last week call the suicide hotline...) wait and hope it helps... but... then I just wait for someone else to take over... or until I fall asleep and hope that someone else wakes up...

I don't want to exist, I should not... no one wants me to...
I am afraid that I'll get scared if I am awake for longer... 

Now I can only wait... until someone takes over and the pattern starts again...

I just want to disappear.
