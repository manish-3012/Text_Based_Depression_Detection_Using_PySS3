The only thing stopping me is how to do itThere is this story about a poet who shot himself in the head but only managed to blind himself. So he lost his sight on top of everything else. This story repeats in my head every time I think about leaving. I am so afraid of attempting and not succeeding and just crippling mysef for life. If a gun to the head couldn't do it, what is a surefire way. 
I am just so tired and I just want to go. I just want to not be in pain but I'm afraid I might bring mysef more of it.
