I fucking hate statisticsI feel so lost, depressed and confused. I am doing my dissertation and there is just so much data I don't know how to process it or understand and write about ktI was able to get an extension but I'm not going to be able to get it done in time. It's been a week since I got out of a breakup. My home life has fallen apart and I know fucking jackshit about stats.
