I have no family except my dogNo siblings, no parents.  Dad passed away when I was little and mom is severely terminally ill.  The rest of my family donâ€™t want anything to do with me. I am 31 years old this year - no family of my own.  Not even an SO.  I am really jealous of my peers who are close with their families - mother daughter brunches, family trips etc.  I have no one.  Nothing to live for.  No one to share my joys and tears with.  Only thing keeping me going is my dog.  I fantasize about giving her up for adoption (I know a family who really wants her) and just kill myself finally.  I canâ€™t work out the details though. Do I go peacefully in my own bed (but who would find my dead body? Literally no one would look for me.  Out in the woods in my car sounds pretty ideal..  I wish guns were legal in my country. Maybe I should finally take that trip to Europe Iâ€™ve always wanted before I kill myself.  I was waiting and saving up to go on that trip with special someone but thatâ€™s clearly never going to happen.  Itâ€™s absolutely terrifying to be alone in this world.  I just want my mind to shut down permanently.
