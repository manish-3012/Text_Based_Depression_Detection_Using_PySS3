Stupid thoughtsI am struggling to feel like I belong in this world. I am 26 years old, I have a boyfriend who is mentally and sometimes physically abusive. It is easy to say JUST LEAVE, but I have two children, no job and nowhere else to go. I am currently learning a trade, but even when I am at school my classmates seem to cringe at me no matter how friendly I am. **I try to people please and it ends up with people annoyed by my presence. I just want to feel like I belong, or like people want me around.** I feel like if I was no longer here, everything might even be better. My kids have great dads so they would go with them and be well off. I find myself crying at night wondering why nobody, including my own boyfriend of 6 years does not want me around. Now im sitting here thinking of suicide methods, because I feel like I have no place in this world. I feel so lonely. I have had a long life of drug addictive parents, to stripping and prostitution, to trying to better my life. I still have nothing to offer this world. I wish these bad thoughts would just go away.
