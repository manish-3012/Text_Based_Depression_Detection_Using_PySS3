Feel like I'm stuck in a rut..Hi all, I'm 16 years old and I live in the United Kingdom near Dover. 

For the past 24 hours or so I've just been feeling low and unhappy with my life. Right now I'm doing my final GCSE exams and I'm not going to get any good grades. I'll probably be getting D's or E's or worse because I try my hardest and it just isn't enough. I'm an overweight loser who's best isn't enough and I can never seem to lose weight I've tried several times in the past and unfortunately it always seems to fail. If I was skinny perhaps I'd have some more confidence but I feel like I'll probably commit suicide before I'm 30. 

I'm stuck at home pretty much everyday once school is finished with only friends on Teamspeak (VOIP) to talk to. I have a couple of friends at school, no social life or girlfriend (heh. me? a girfriend.. won't be happening.) 


I'd like a nice job, a wife and a daughter and to move to canada but I think I've damaged myself too much as a young child especially with my weight. Why couldn't I just be a normal happy healthy weight teenager instead of a fat one. 

I have these goals in life but I feel like I'll never be able to achieve any of them. I feel like crying. 

I don't know what to do.
