DoneI'm so tired of this. I need to just take as many of whatever pills I can and burn this house down with myself in it. I'm 35 and it's just never going to change. Not my brain. Not my circumstances. Not my overall quality of life.

I tried of fail . I am tired. And now seroquel withdrawl again because of insurance companies and costs and my house is such a dump i cant keep it warm when its WINDY out .

No more mo more no more
