I have no will to live and I feel like a burden on my family, should I end my life?backstory: I'm autistic and have severe depression. I've tried probably dozens of antidepressants and they don't work. I feel like this massive burden on my family. I frequently lash out and attack them verbally, and when I get agitated I cannot control it. I don't have the money to move out, and to be quite honest I don't think I can handle the responsibility of it anyway. I dropped out of high school, and I have failed the GED test 7 times. The only jobs I have been able to hold down were moving lawns and stocking shelves at a grocery store witch I absolutely hate. It's too loud and there are too many people to interact with on a daily basis. From the minute I walk in the door it's a constant state of sensory overload. I think suicide is a rational choice in this situation. I will be leaving a note with the following information:

-Why I think this was a rational choice.

-No, there wasn't anything you could have done to help me. You've helped me more then I can thank you for

-this was not your fault in any way.

-I will be in a better place now, even if it's just no longer existing.

-I love all of you.

I will hanging myself in the woods far away from home. I think it's important that they don't find my body in the house, and are not the ones to find it. First responders encounter this sort of thing all the time, it will be less traumatic for them.
I will be taking all the money out of my bank account and leaving it in an envelope next to the note. Plus my disability cheque should still keep coming for a few months after I'm gone. Maybe they can go on a cruise or something. In almost any other situation, I think it would be a selfish choice, but I legitimately think they will be better off. Not in the days and months afterwards, but in the long term.
