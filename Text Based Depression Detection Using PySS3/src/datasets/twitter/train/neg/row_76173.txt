I'm so at my limit and I'm really not far from just ending it allWhat's the fucking point of it all? I've pissed half my friends off, cant even tell if the other half like me. I cant speak to my parents about anything.

My grades used to be good? I have prospects? I'm applying for some of the best universities in the world but only because I know I'll be dead before I sit and fail any exams.

I have my plan, I have my location and I'm so close to just following through. The mental health services in the UK are a joke. My parents could be alerted and all for fucking nothing because I'm too old for CAMHS and too young for regular ass help.

I really dont care anymore and if I dont kill myself tonight I'll be very surprised. I've been eaten inside by my disorders for too long and I just want a moments rest. I'm tired.
