Fuck itMy life is going in a wrong direction, I'm a 16 year old boy from Austria that wakes up every day for school and just don't wants to do anything , I don't understand shit in school, argue with my parents a lot, my girlfriend tried to kill herself, I help all my friends all the time and protect them from sadness and all that fucked up shit, everyday i see myself in front of the train I'm taking to school, I don't have the strength to do it anymore, I just want to end it because I will never be anything that my parents could be proud of.
Fuck I can't do it anymore
