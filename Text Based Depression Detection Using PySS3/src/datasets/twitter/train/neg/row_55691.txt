I'm a miserable mess. Don't feel like I'm relevant in this world.I have completed campus but can't get a job in a country where your skin color matters. My driving test was a guaranteed fail because I did not bribe the inspector despite driving well throughout the test. I have had no friends at school and was bullied for 13 years  because I was shy (both in primary and high school). I have had no girlfriends in my life. And also, my parents think I'm immature and must act my age. The question is, how?!

Because of these reasons and my life is 21 years of hell, I don't want to suffer anymore. Just like my dog when he got put down last week, at the moment I feel like dying like this.

Please I'm desperate for advice for how to turn my life around, if I can.
