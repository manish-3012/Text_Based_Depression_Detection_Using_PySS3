To all those who feel like giving up:You have survived every single bad day you've had thrown at you so far. You are much stronger than the self defeating thoughts in your head give you credit for. There is so much more than the pain you feel today. You have so much in store for you ahead. Life, love, happiness. It is all attainable I promise you. Do not bottle up your feelings. Talk to someone, anyone. Let the negative energy out and release it from yourself out into the universe. Hang in there. Life is good if you let it be. Take charge of your life. Only you can change your point of view and circumstances. You are special. There is literally nobody who shares the level of special value you bring to the world. Dont give those defeating thoughts or outside negative influences the satisfaction of winning. You are strong. You are a survivor. Keep it up. ðŸ‘
