I don't care if it sounds stupidI'm awful at everything I ever try. Been drawing for years and my friends who barely picked up a pencil three months ago are already better than me. I'll never be able to make money off my art or be happy with how it looks so what's the fucking point. I also want to die because I'm bad at video games. Over 3 months worth of hours put into competitive games over the course of multiple years and still the worst of the worst and always told I'm the worst person my team has ever played with. And I don't have any close friends online or in real life, so it's not like anyone will miss me.

I've had underlying issues for years and a history of addiction that no therapy or medication has been able to touch. I'll go out as a fucking loser and be mocked on here and in real life for such a stupid death, but fuck it.

It's a stupid reason to die but I've got a bottle of ativan next to me. I'm just sick of being so inadequate. Maybe I'll come back as someone whose efforts actually mean a damn.
