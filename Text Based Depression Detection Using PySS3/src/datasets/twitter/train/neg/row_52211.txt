What happens now?Sunday was the day. I have tried and tried to end my suffering. I failed. I have friends or loved ones call for help.

I tried again middle of December. I was going to OD. Not pills, a substance that would go in a needle and directly injected. I missed the vein so I fell out for about 12 hours, only to wake in heartbreaking misery. I knew what I did wrong so I could get it next time.

That next time was this past Sunday. I purchased enough that I was sure to get it this time, and I made sure I hit the mark.  Only my supplier gave me stuff that was cut so bad. I woke 5 hours later. All the markings of an OD, just not enough to get the job done. I woke instantly the out of control sobs started, I failed again. I spent the day crying in disbelief. 

I spoke to several friends. Only one knows what I did. I am trying to figure out what to do now. I don't know if I should go to the hospital, or check myself in somewhere for a few days to get my head straight.  I think I may be done trying. There is always some sort of intervention, or reason I don't succeed. But I am so tired of the pain. Physical, emotional, abuse. I can't do that again. I think it's really hard on my already broken body. 

What do I do now? I feel so lost, I am confused, I am scared, I am resentful, I am angry. I am alone. 

I didn't know where else to post this. Maybe someone here has tried and failed too. I just want to pain to end. Once and for all.
