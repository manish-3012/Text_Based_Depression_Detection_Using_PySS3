Wrote my noteI've settled on a date and method. Should be the final (13th) attempt. Finally wrote my note. I never thought I'd make it this far. Thought I'd be dead before I turned 15, and now I'm 22. I can't say that it's been worth staying around, but it hasn't been the worst. Current plan is to finish out the next couple of weeks and call it an existence.
