I'm going to suicide, nothing specialI'm a 15 years old boy, currently studying in California as an international student. Unlike most people posting in this sub, I'm not really depressed. I have a terrible life, many bad things had happened to me. There were good things too, but they aren't enough for me to stay alive. My future seems to be bad, and I have no reason to live. May be I'm alone, but I like to be alone, I don't need any friend. I'm smiling, I don't know why, I thought I should cry, but I'm smiling right now. Despite everything, I can still smile, probably because I know my life will end soon. I'm enjoying the last days before I suicide because when I die, I won't be able to enjoy my life anymore, but I won't suffer more. I'm a lazy and may be selfish person so giving up is the best choice for me. I hope tomorrow will be a cloudy day since I like clouds, a cloudy day will be good to end my life. I'm going to die, but with a big smile.

Edit: It's Saturday and I'm still alive, but I will suicide tomorrow for sure. Thank you all for your words, it really made me feel better.

Edit 2: My landlords are staying home for a few days so I guess I won't die tomorrow.
