I can't do this. This is the end.I truly can't keep living. There is NOTHING for me to live for anymore. All I ever wanted was a bundle of friends, people I could care for, an honest job, and an overall peaceful life. I not only have no friends, but the very few friends I DO have most likely despise me, I am doing terrible in school, and my family members also despise. Even when I try to blow off steam playing video games, I end up sucking at THAT too.

I was going to chug rubbing alcohol tonight. But I couldn't bring myself to do it. I don't think I can ever do it, but I want to leave so badly.
