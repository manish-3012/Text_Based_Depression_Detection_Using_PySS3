Decided im going to the hospital tomorrow but can you help me get through the night please?Hi im 20 and living in the UK. I'm transgender and the gender dysphoria I experience has become unbearable and I can't properly explain what this horrible feeling is to others. My family are saying cruel things to me about this position I'm in - about how crazy I am and how I'll "never be a real girl". I wen't to the hospital 3 years ago for suicidal ideation and got sent home when really I should have been sectioned, I'm sick of not having my mental health issues not taken seriously by others. I have 1 year to wait to see a specialist about my gender difficulties and I can not possibly wait that long. I cant imagine what I'll be like at the end of this month never mind a year from now. I am reluctantly transgender, I wish I could remove that part of me because its ruined my life.

Hello anyone?
