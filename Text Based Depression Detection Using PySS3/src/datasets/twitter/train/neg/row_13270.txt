I am the most worthless, useless, pathetic person on the planet.I'm not sure where to start. Everything about me is wrong. 

First, my physical deformities. My body is shaped unnaturally for a man, I have hips and buttocks like a woman's. It makes me feel like a warped freak. My shoulders are bony and jut out. I am scrawny and hunchbacked. Also my face is disgustingly ugly. Like, really, really repulsive.

Then there are my mental conditions, I have severe anxiety, whenever a girl acknowledges me I start sweating and shaking. I once ran away when a friend needed by help against a bully. I also have mild autism which has made my life very difficult. The few times I've been comfortable around someone I just say stupid things or make weird noises like a freak. I am extremely obsessive and unwittingly behave stalkerish/perverted around girls sometimes. Not sure if it's related but I also twitch all the time. I also have no attention span and struggle in school. 

I am incompetent at everything. I have no skills. I screw up everything. I am physically pathetic, I can't even run for a minute and I am laughably weak. There is not one thing I can say that I am good or skilled at. 

Thanks to my disgusting body, inability to socialise and incompetence I have never or will ever meet a partner. I am 17 and have not ever held a girls hands. Everyone I know is sexually active whereas I am stuck alone, with no option than to masturbate, a lot, and I mean a lot. I feel this may have contributed to my complete lack of motivation but if I try and stop I literally start shaking from the withdrawal. I will die a virgin guaranteed. In the past women have reacted to my mere presence with absolute disgust, and I don't blame them.

In short, I am a disgusting, ugly, stupid, incompetent freak who fails at being human. I have no other option but to remove myself from the gene pool, if I only had the balls to do it. Is there any reason for me to live at all?
