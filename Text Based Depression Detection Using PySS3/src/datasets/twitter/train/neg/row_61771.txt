hi i dont know what to do. im 19 im a huge fucking failure of a person barely skirted through highschool and completely unable to get into college. my life was never great, family deaths early in childhood and raised solely by my father. i never had many friends, but i managed to have one pretty close ones for a year or two. that stopped when i thought i thought i finally made a new one and introduced him to my other friend. they became best of friends and did everything together totally forgetting about me. it was ok though they were happier as friends than they were with me. this inst the only time this has happened im just a stepping stone until people can find anyone more tolerable than me.  i try to make more friends but it never works one day i finally meet someone who i think i really like and want to be with always and they do to and im happier than ive ever been and its great. but it only lasts a few months and they tell me the only reason they were with my because they felt bad for me. the only person in this shithole of  planet who wants to interact with me is only out of pity. what kind of contemptible creature am i how low must i be that the only person who wants to give me the fucking time of day is because im so fucking pathetic. i think of her every single day its been ten months  people say it gets better and you move on but it never gets any fucking better anything i do all i can think of is the time we had together and how it was a lie every second of it. i miss her so much i just want to go back. id go to therapy but my family is too poor to afford it and i dont want to be a bigger burden than i already am i dont know what the fuck to do i just want to forget everything and fade away
