I just keep ending up in the same placeEvery time I start feeling good or being happy I end up in the same dark place.  I get to thinking about my life and what I have in the future and none of it is good.  I feel like I've already failed and fucked everything up, with school and my family.  And with my best friend I feel like I irritate him so much.  Like I constantly am feeling down and depressed and I can tell he knows, and I feel so fucking guilty.  And it just keeps spiraling more and more to where I want to kill myself.  I end up hurting myself physically and then I feel even worse and it happens over and over.  I want it all to stop.  I really wish there were a way for me to just stop living with no pain or chance to second guess myself.  I want it over right now.
