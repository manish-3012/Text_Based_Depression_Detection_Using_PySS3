I realized yesterday that no one outside of my family considers me more than a casual acquantince.I pretty much had a mental panic attack at that point, because I'm 18 years old and have no one that I can REALLY call a "friend". No one that I can share personal problems with. No one I can reach out to for help or text on a whim and know they will hang out. Sure, I have 'friends', people who will hang out in a group but only because they like my brother and would feel bad leaving me behind. Honestly, I'd rather just have them be honest and tell me to fuck off, because I know they don't like me.

I'm supposed to be going into college this fall, but I just don't fucking want to at *all*.

* I'm gay, no one knows but I'm sure someone suspects it

* I'm incredibly anxiety ridden to the point that I feel constantly self concious whenever I'm out

* I don't REALLY have anything more then friendly acquaintances. 

* I've thought about suicide every day for months.

Honestly the only reason I haven't is because of my mom. She's a really great person and I don't think she could handle it, although I have been distancing myself from the 3 closest """"friends"""" that I have so that it hurts less when they find out I crashed my car into a pole.

fuck life
