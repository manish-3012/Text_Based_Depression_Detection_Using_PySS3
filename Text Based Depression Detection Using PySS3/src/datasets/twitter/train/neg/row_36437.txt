Told my sister I was suicidal and she didnâ€™t care. Called my mom and she was drunk. Called my dad and he said to take the dog for a walk. Suicide hotline didnâ€™t helpI am always scared to tell people Iâ€™m suicidal because Iâ€™m scared that maybe Iâ€™m faking it. I reached out and told her and she didnâ€™t even care. I donâ€™t want to die but Iâ€™m really scared and just feel like a piece of shit. I had therapy today and told me therapist and he didnâ€™t really even help me. Iâ€™ve literally done all the right steps.
