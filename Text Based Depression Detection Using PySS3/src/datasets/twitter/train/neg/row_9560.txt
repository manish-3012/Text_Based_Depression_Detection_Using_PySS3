I not suicidal per se, but I don't see the point in living. I'm ugly, stupid, and a failure. Even if things do get better, which is not a given, what's to say current pain doesn't outweigh future pleasure? Living is gambling in my situation.I'm 21 and I hate my life. 

Firstly, I'm hideous. I'm short, I have tons of moles, my face is asymmetrical, my teeth are crooked. I have no social skills and literally no one to even talk to. I had a girlfriend for about 7 months, but she broke up with me over my penis size. She could have just been using that as a scapegoat, but even if she wasn't, I can't really blame her. It's tiny and she deserves to be in a relationship where she's sexually satisfied.

I'm also a stupid failure. I'm supposed to start my second year of med school in a month, but I don't think I can make it. I finished around middle in my class last year (just below the half mark) which isn't too bad, but it's not enough to get into any decent hospital. Furthermore, I was averaging 120 hours a week every single week between class and studying. I would get about 5 to 6 hours a sleep per night and 4 hours for eating/traveling/laundry. I can't do that again, I just don't have the energy. Even physically, I can't do it again. The exhaustion and poor diet has caused me to lose a lot of weight. I went from a healthy 150 to about 115 or 120. Everyone else was putting in 60 to 80 hours per week. Some people would occasionally do 100, but then they'd take a day off to recharge. I literally have to work twice as hard for half the success of everyone else because I'm fucking stupid. The second year is supposed to be the hardest, so I'll almost certainly fail some classes if I don't put in 120 hours a week.

Right now, I don't see how dying would be dissimilar from euthanasia. It's possible for a terminally ill patient to get better, but the pain they'd have to go through for a small chance at getting better is too much of a gamble for them, so they choose to die.
