I can't get out of this pain for even a minute anymoreIt hurts beyond anything I can describe to have eternally failed in my life's potential 

I can't morally comprehend how anyone insists the best thing for me to do is live on when my dreams are all lying dead in the past forever, and I can't go back no matter how much I work on myself I will always be a failure because of my age.

Hanging is the method I idealized but I walk around so much trying in vein to reverse the damage done by time and any time I can walk to the big train tracks and get this over with. Nobody understands when the pain is permanent and constant and so intense that giving up everything and all hope is WAY less sad TO ME than enduring this pain for one more minute. But nobody wants to consider the possibility that I have a genuine pain past the threshold they can ethically ask me to take.

Nothing can help heal the pain inherent to time, and I was meant to be where I had to be 6 years ago. The stench of failure follows me constantly and I can't stop feeling the blissful relief of imagining death to absolve me of my failure and restore dignity to me.

Can't someone just escape their unbearable pain without people arguing?
