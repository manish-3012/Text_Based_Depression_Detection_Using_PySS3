fucking why?i dont see a reason to live. im out of work for the foreseeable future (and it was the only place i truly felt a sense of happiness) im absolutely broke and a nuisance to my roommates, fucked up.shit for my dad and probably a burden to him, genuinely unlikable, there's just no.fucking reason. only thing at this very moment preventing me from seriously planning anything is my cats, not wanting to burden my roommates with finding me, anf not wanting to potentially be another tragedy in my dads life

.y future is fucking hopeless. i just want to. hurt.myself. i just want to.fucking die.
