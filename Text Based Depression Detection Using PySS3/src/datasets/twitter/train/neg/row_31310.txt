Donâ€™t really see a point to life anymore. Everything is meaninglessNothing matters. My failed relationships donâ€™t matter. My failed dreams donâ€™t matter. My failed life doesnâ€™t matter. Wether I have a good day or a bad day it doesnâ€™t matter life has no point absolutely none whatsoever. I donâ€™t even know if I want to commit  suicide anymore or if I just want to do whatever I want to make life seem interesting until I die. I know I just said nothing matters but I guess I just kinda wished I mattered at least to 1 person. But I donâ€™t and never will. Thanks for letting me vent guys. Sorry if I bothered you.
