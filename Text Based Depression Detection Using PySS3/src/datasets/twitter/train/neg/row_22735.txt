Should I commit suicideThanks for anyone who gives a f*** about this topic. I'm 18 now and really i have been through a lot. My parents have never loved me the way parents suppposed to love their child, they always insult, curse me and even take me through several beatings but I did not mind back then. when i grow up, they did not stop. I have always been one of the best student at my school but literally they did not care??? Not a single compliment, lately they even say i'm ungrateful and they don't consider my their child anymore
Apart from that, my social relatonship sucks too, i have really few friends and no best friends. Moreover, whenever i have a crush on someone, they always reject me, even if they had held my friends or hugged me or whatever
I'm really lonely and I don't have any motivation to live anymore. Should I commit suicide to make my parents feel relieve and happy? They really don't care about my survival
