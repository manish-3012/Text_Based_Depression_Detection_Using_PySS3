No matter what I do, I annoy peopleI'm annoying, I'm socially isolated and I'm annoying, I'm fourteen, a Genderqueer Pansexual, At least I have family, which I inderectly annoy because of my Autism or according too one of my old teachers "laziness" and my ADHD, I'm home-schooled, my dad is supposed to take me outside, but he doesn't, he's never here, because he cheated on my mother and is now with another woman, And my mother can't take outside because she's disabled with arthritis so she can't take me and she's over-protective so I can't go out by myself even with my phone. I don't get any social interaction. so let me ask you a question, Why would I continue living, I can't have social interaction, because of isolation and metal problems? No matter what I do, I annoy people. (don't how to pm)
