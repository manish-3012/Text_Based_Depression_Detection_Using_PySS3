River walksFor the past week i've been going on walks by the river really early in the morning or really late at night. I'll walk on the ledge or railings and just tempt fate to see if i'll fall in. Sometimes i'll stop and talk to people I see. I can't swim and I'm a shitte fighter so both situations are risky but it kinda excites me. Basically I don't want to be here lol. Thinking about death and dying gives me a sense of happiness that isn't really happiness. It's more like a time that I can kinda breathe and relax. Idk if that makes sense.

But yh, chances of me getting kidnapped or brutally murdered at the times I go for walks is quite high but I think I'll keep going for a few more days. The river is reallly pretty when it's dark. I tried to explain this whole thing to my boyfriend an he just kinda freaked out so I told him I was joking. lol this is random but my go to joke is "I want to go for a swim in the River Thames," this normally leaves my friends a bit baffled so i'll insert the punch line "I can't swim." Yk indicating I'll drown. It didn't go down as well as I thought it would lol. But yh, sorry for this weird piece of information/ awful joke that nobody asked for. Just wanted to get it off my chest. Have a nice day :)
