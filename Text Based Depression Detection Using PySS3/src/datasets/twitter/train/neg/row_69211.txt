Anyone else here dealing with autoimmune issues and feeling close to the edge?I have vasculitis with the cause determined as autoimmune. My optometrist thinks I may have multiple sclerosis and referred me to a neuro ophthalmologist but I had to cancel the appointment due to the expense, so I don't know if I really have multiple sclerosis or if there's something else happening, like vasculitis affecting my brain. I have what feels like an endless list of symptoms and what's worse is some of the health issues are visible, like eczema or petechiae from vasculitis. At least when it's internal I can hide it and pretend on the outside that everything's okay.

I'm struggling more with it all now as winter has settled in. I've felt increasingly hopeless about the future as the day has gone on, and currently I'm in the dark without even starlight. I'm wishing I won't wake up tomorrow, and pondering hurting and potentially killing myself if I do. It's hard handling these things, remembering all the while you're such a disappointment to everyone.
