I'm addicted.I'm addicted to self-harm. I'm addicted to my medication (Seroquel). I'm addicted to smoking. I can't control myself around drugs or alcohol; I will consume whatever I can get my hands on. I feel like such a waste of life and I feel so fucking guilty because my fiancÃ© is trying his best to stay sober for me, and I'm over here drinking until I blackout every chance I get. 

He's medically listed as my primary caregiver (I am neurologically atypical, in case I haven't mentioned that before. I truly can't remember). I'm already officially listed as a BURDEN on him. It's in fucking writing with his signature on it. 

I know he would do better if I wasn't here. Everyone I know would be better if I wasn't here.
