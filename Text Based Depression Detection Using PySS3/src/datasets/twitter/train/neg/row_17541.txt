Tried to bleed 'til death(Backstory here: http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/2yesdh/22_days_to_go/ )
But failed. Stupid me I should have taken acetylsalicylic acid before.
I lost about 500 ml of blood, then a huge blood cloth formed in my nose.
I'm now on 75 mg of quetiapine and 20 mg of escitalopram, feeling all the same... My patience is running low.
