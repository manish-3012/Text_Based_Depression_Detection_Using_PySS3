Whatâ€™s the best way to suicideI know there are many ways, but I donâ€™t want to fail. If Iâ€™m saved, then there would be even more troubles. Thing happened and my future is fucked up. Iâ€™m a NYU student, and there are many rooftops in NYC. Is jumping a good idea?

PS. I know there are a lot of hotlines, and there is also mental health service in the school, but this is a calm decision.
