My friend told me she made a suicide noteMy friend had attempted suicide thrice this year.  I'm practically 1000 miles away from her and I can't go there to make sure that everything's OK.  I'm scared that after telling me her about her suicide note, she'll feel more compelled to carry it out. She's been my support system when I hit rock bottom and a reason for me to keep trying on living. I really don't know what I'll do if she dies. 

I don't know how to tell her she's a strong and beautiful person, that she's worth it, that I love her no matter how bad things get. It's hard to voice them out in messages and not sound like I'm just telling those as some other feel good compliments and I don't mean any of it. I can't make her call the national hotline because she absolutely hates making a phone call when she's crying, I can't force her to see a psychologist or go to a hospital because she couldn't afford it and I'm only making things worse to her financially. I'm so lost at what I'd do if she attempted again
