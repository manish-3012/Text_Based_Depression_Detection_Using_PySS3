thinking about a second attemptI just moved away for college a few months ago, all of my classes are online and I never see anyone anymore. all I do is work and school, if I can manage that. I'm doing horribly in class. I'm stressed about money. I don't have family to go back to. I don't have hobbies or interests or the energy to make some. 
I pretty much told my partner I was going to do this. they don't care and stopped responding, said they loved me and goodnight. they're going through their own problems right now. 

Im sitting here with the stuff in front of me and I feel nothing. I just feel like a disappointment. to be honest I feel too drained to go through with it, but I know I can't sleep and I have no one to go to now
