I am so so tired...just so tiredWorst fears came true. I'm tired
I don't have anyone to talk to about this. I feel so alone. So painfully alone.

I've given so much it feels like. I've sat down with my friends when they were having bad times. I've listened to my abusive mother cry multiple times teling her that even after she hurt me that it was okay. I've helped my landlords set up fibre out of my own pocket only for them to turn on me. I've stood up to my abusive father when he'd threaten to hurt my siblings. I've bent over fucking backwards for everyone in my life.

And I know damn well that no one would be there for me.
