it has got to be overi have been abandoned by everyone i have ever gotten close to- and it is all my fault. I am a terrible selfish person. I am a burden to everyone. I don't deserve to live. I have isolated myself so much I don't want to be abandoned anymore, but I hate this lonely existence. I hate being miles away from everyone else, metaphorically speaking. It's a gap I can't close.

I lost him. I want this tragedy to be over.
