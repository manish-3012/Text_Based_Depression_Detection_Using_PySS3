Grew up with a front row seat to someone losing their sanity - Now it's happening to meI am terrified.

When I watched my mother lose her sanity over the years I can only describe it as her being drowned in her own body until it was nothing but a shell with left over instincts and knowledge of who she was. A walking reminder to anyone who knew her of the pain we suffered.

The things she said. The things she did. I've been doing them a while now, too. It's getting worse, and now it's *rapidly* getting worse.


When I know exactly what it looks like from another perspective it makes it a lot easier to identify when I'm losing my own sanity. I've been slipping farther into some sort of failure to realize people are something that are real, only able to remember how much I need them around but lose regard for who they are as a person.

I never wanted to die. I just wanted to live a life. This path I've gone down was set in motion before I was born, I never had a chance. Unless breathing counts I haven't been able to live a moment in my 28 years. A good time to mention I'm 28/m.

I can't tell you what I have. It'll be some form of PTSD primarily from living with someone who was insane for years while our child welfare enforced our staying with her because "a mother should be with her children".

The most harmful delusion she had was that she believed everyone wanted to turn us against her and us speaking to anyone but her would poison our heads. We were not allowed to attend school, have friends, see doctors (had facial surgery at 5 as a result when someone saw and took me 3 years after the accident).

And soon. That will be me. I'm not staying to hurt everyone I know and love while I can remember they're real.

PS. Should this captcha really be asking people here if they're human?
