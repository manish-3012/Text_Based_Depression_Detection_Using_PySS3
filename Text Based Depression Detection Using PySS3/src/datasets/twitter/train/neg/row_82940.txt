More to sayThanks for all the kind comments youâ€™ve left for me to read over the course of my time as a user on this subreddit. You guys are awesome, and may god bless every single last one of yâ€™all. 

Lately, although I have not been suicidal, Iâ€™ve been idealizing the concept of killing myself consistently. You see, the way Iâ€™ve been seeing things lately are as follows: I believe I have spent a game-changing amount of time indulging and attentively nurturing things that had no intention of holding up their end of the bargain whatsoever. Whether it be a romantic relationship, friendship, a dayjob, or even a simple mundane task. As a result of these facts, I am exhausted to say the least. Over the past few years Iâ€™ve been fundamentally broken down not only as a man, but as a human being. I feel as though all the energy Iâ€™ve spent and wasted over the past few years has left me with nearly nothing left to work with in a time where decision making is at its most critical for me. I have little to no energy to spend on the things that matter most and that alone is killing me. 

I donâ€™t WANT to die. I WANT to have what was taken from me back. I want my heart to heal, I want my head to stay attached to the rest of my body for at least five fucking minutes. Sometimes idek if Iâ€™ll make it to 20.
