I give up (m16)I dont know what anyone on here has gone through and my life is definitely better than some peoples but for some reason I hate it and I have given up I dont love anyone anymore cause every time I did they didnt love me back it was only for their self gain and I dont plan on makeing it much longer I used to want to be a neurosurgeon I was slowly getting better climbing out of the hole I was in but I let my guard down and I dont care anymore. I wish I could dream at night just some kind of relief from reality I dont even remember the last time I had a dream I want some kind of relief but nothing works I just feel like screaming in a corner at myself cause I'm so useless I cant ever do anything right and then people hate it and I hate it then I hate myself for doing it wrong it's all hate and no one cares about me I wish I'd get hit by a bus or struck by lightning cause I'm to scared to kill myself like but I dont know how long that fear will persist maybe I will like the feel of the gun on my header maybe I'll give in to my darker wants but I cant say what they are.I hate myself or maybe I just hate people
