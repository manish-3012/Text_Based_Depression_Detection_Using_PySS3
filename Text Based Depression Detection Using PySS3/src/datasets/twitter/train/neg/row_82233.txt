So sick of life.I just canâ€™t stand it anymore. Iâ€™m in the military and I feel like I have no friends. I had issues before joining, but I thought that joining would be a big step in my life. The stagnancy remains though I have a friend would said he would talk to me today out drinking and everyone else is at a party no one told me about. I want to embrace the loneliness, but also want to make a change. I have no one in my life who can see the pain or cares enough to help. People only see a uniform when they look at me back home and telling anyone at my command about my thoughts will get me kicked out with debt. I donâ€™t care anyone and just wish I could die in my sleep.
