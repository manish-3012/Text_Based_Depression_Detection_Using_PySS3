I am brokenI am 20years old.I abused dxm and other drugs heavily for many years(I am sober now) but I am left with permanent brain damage and depression. An inability to speak most of the time, have been catatonic and psychotic with never ending physical pains from the internal damage I have done. I am also transgender female to male and waiting on surgery but the results aren't promising and the rate of complication is high. Girlfriend of 4 years isn't sure she wants to deal with this anymore. She still cares but I understand why she cannot. I would see someone like me as inferior as well. I lack purpose in life, unable to go to school because of the brain problems , had to drop out of college to work. I am unable to have any sort of sexual relationship even with myself and the hatred I feel toward myself is insurmountable. I am so tired. Survived suicide attempts before but my body is weaker every time. I have found someone who can get me a gun for $300 and I'm thinking of taking her up on it. I hate how this all sounds. I don't want to be here. I want friends but I can't relate to them and grow frustrated and defeated in depression. I even start to hate them out of jealousy. I feel like I'm screaming inside and crying all the time, I am begging for help and for someone to talk to. I am so afraid now that my girlfriend has shown me my worst fear is indeed true (as if I haven't been through this same exact thing in other relationships). It doesn't get better for people like me, I look around and I see unhappiness everywhere but people getting pleasure from life's gifts like sex and connection. Something I will never have. Is there anyone out there
