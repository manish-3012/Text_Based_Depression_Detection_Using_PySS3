[Vent]Just a vent. Because I am staying at the edge of the cliff, but I am not jumping off of it yet. 1. I think people see me as a slut or something. I try my best to not seem attractive or something. Idk, my psychologist told me it was because I assumed people thought something about me even if they weren't. 2. A guy wrote I sucked dicks. I donlt understand why. I have always tried to be polite, kind and agreable. 3. I don't know what to think! Are my opinions wrong? I feel guilty of thinking like that. How can other people feel happy? HOW CAN I THINK LIKE A HAPPY PERSON? I feel so crazy. My head hurts. I can't sleep. I just hope I could have someone who would care a lot about me, each day, that I trust, who cheers me up everyday and who is there for me. I feel so desperate. I don't know what to do!!!! I feel like I am mediocre. Worst than everyone. I am just shit. I am just shit. I am nothing. I just want to die. Please, can something magical make all that pain disappear? I want to start over my life or magically be happy without substances. I'm sorry, I think I may have caused negative emotions to the reader. I feel like I am stuck. The great thing is that I feel better writing my thoughts.
