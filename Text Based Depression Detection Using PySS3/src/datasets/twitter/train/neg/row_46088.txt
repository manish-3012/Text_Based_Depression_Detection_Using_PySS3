Sometimes I want to kill myselfThis is strange because I usually consider myself a positive person because I try to find happy and positive things in every situation. Despite this, sometimes when a problem happens I just say "Just kill yourself and solve this forever." also sometimes during one of those times, I really think about doing it and how I will do it. Luckily my positive side keeps me alive. These thoughts happen less recently but they still come to my mind also the thoughts come to my less during spring and summer. Id be very happy if you could help me.
