I just need someone in my life who cares.I'm surrounded by people, but none of them actually care about me as a person, or at least it feels like that to me.

I'm so fucking depressed.

I can't stop thinking about the death of my little Luna. I think about it almost every day. 

I saw her lethargy and her struggle for a day or two before doing anything about it. What the fuck was I thinking? That she'd get better on her own? I watched her as she lost her appetite, struggled to walk, but I didn't know she was *dying*, and it's entirely my fault that she's dead now. I failed to get her help when she needed it, and by the time she got medical help, it was way too late. I can't help but feel like I let her die.

I killed my baby. I killed my little girl.

I don't deserve to be alive right now.

The *only* reason I'm still here is because I've adopted another cat about a month after she passed, and I can't abandon him. I want to form a bond as close with him as I was with Luna, but I haven't been with him for long enough for that bond to really grow (and he's got a bit of a biting problem that I'm trying to train out of him, but at 2 years old, it's going to take a while to break that habit), so I can't cuddle or hold him like I did with Luna. I think I just want to feel loved again.

I feel like a monster. I'm a horrible fucking person.

And my job makes me miserable. I dread going to work. I have a new job, but I have to continue at my current job until the new one gets more consistent in order to support myself and my cat. There are so many things the owners *don't* do to maintain their business, it's practically negligent. But I have to put up with it, or I'll be broke and unable to provide for myself and my little boy. I hate it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have one person in my life right now that I can remotely call a friend, but I don't feel like I can talk to him about stuff like this. I'm sobbing alone in my room, I want to feel supported and loved, but I don't. I fucking hate my life.

&amp;#x200B;

I miss my Luna. I miss being with someone who loved me. I miss my dad. I'm so fucking alone.

&amp;#x200B;

I used to be okay with being alone, but now I'm alone and lonely. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've struggled with self harm for years, and I've been clean for a few months, but the feeling is always there, and lately it's creeping even further into my mind. I'm afraid I'll slip and autopilot back into self-harming behavior. There's nothing really stopping me, except myself. It's so difficult *not* to cut myself, but I shouldn't feel this way. 

&amp;#x200B;

Everything is fucked up and I wish I didn't exist.
