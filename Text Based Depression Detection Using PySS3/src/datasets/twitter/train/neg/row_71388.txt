I am tiredI don't want to end it. I don't want to kill my self. That is not why I am here. I realize that such an option will not lead to any result. But I am tired of it all. I just don't know what to do anymore. Maybe I'm posting this to the wrong place. Maybe I don't belong. But I am just sick of this bullshit. I just want to know what I need to do. What it is that I am here for. I get that I am a one in a million chance of life. I get that this is supposed to be precious. But I just don't see the point. I just don't see a reason. Why does it matter anyway?
