Do suicidal thoughts stem from self absorption?My mom sometimes tells me I'm always making things about me me me when I verbalize my suicidal feelings. I think she might have a point. My suicidal thoughts come from: "I am all alone. I have no friends. I feel so fucking bad. I am ugly. Noone wants to love ME. I'll never overcome my anxiety. I'll never get employment" It's pretty narcissistic. Honestly the only non narcissistic part about the whole situation is the fact that I'm not doing it because only for the sake of certain people around me (my dad- my friend whose cousin just did it- my mom grandma etc). But then I end up resenting them for keeping me in this pain- but thats once again thinking about MY pain. I'm just curious what people on here think about the link between suicide as like a negative type of narcissism. Were not focused on hobbies, other people, causes? Those thoughts are 100% ME focused usually? I don't know where to go from here but I'm hoping someone will have another eye opening point to add that will help the pain go away. I want to be a good person- I don't want to always think about myself. How can I contribute to others and make them happier? How can I live a fulfilling life without the narcissism of suicide looming over me ?
