Feeling suicidal tendencies, donâ€™t know whatâ€™s wrong with me.Hi guys. 
So lately Iâ€™ve been under tons of stress. Iâ€™m normally a really emotional teen that cries about anything. Two days ago I had a small fight with my mom, nothing serious. I normally cry after things like that birdie once I didnâ€™t it was really strange. My mon apologized later but I still felt angry and just... numb. 

I eventually fell asleep but the next day everything was worse. At breakfast I just started crying uncontrollably. I couldnâ€™t stop and suddenly I was in this deppresive rollercoaster of terrible thoughts. I couldnâ€™t stop crying and breathing way too fast and I felt like I wasnâ€™t even there. 
And for the first time I felt like it would all be so much easier to just kill myself and be done with all this shit.
