I don't know what have i done...Hi,

This is a throwaway account.

Ok I don't know where to start really. :-/

I had all, a good girlfriend that is smart, beautiful, funny, and above all that a really  good person. I loved her very much she loved me too, but i fucked it up. I have (or had) a job that is good, a good position, good pay, good colleagues, but i fucked that up too. Have or had good friends that where very supportive, good people, they wanted the best for me. I fucked that up too. A family that wants only the best for me, loves me, i fucked that up too.

Where to start?
I had it all, but inside of me there is that feeling that fire that always says "you can do better don't be satisfied with that that you already have" and i start to feel unsatisfied instead to be thankful  for what i already  have. I'm never satisfied and i start to make shit up, start to blame others, like friends, work colleagues, family and i start to dig my own pit in that self created misery.

Now everyone has seen what i am. What person i really am.

I talked shit about work colleagues, friends, family, just because i am not happy with myself. They have figured it out, and thats i think a good thing. Now I'm faced to lose my job, to lose my friends, everything.

I know that i've fucked it up, but what can i do? I always do the same things again and again. I think that if i get a second chance i fuck it up again. This fucking brain of mine is always unsatisfied and fucks everything up.

I trully love my friends, work colleagues, my family, but i cannot help myself, i always fuck it up big time.

What can i do? I don't even like myself, how can other people like me?

I'm thinking the best thing is to just remove myself from everyone, i've done enough damage already. :(

I'm writing this be cause i'm a pussy and cannot even take myself away from this beautiful world and beautiful people.
