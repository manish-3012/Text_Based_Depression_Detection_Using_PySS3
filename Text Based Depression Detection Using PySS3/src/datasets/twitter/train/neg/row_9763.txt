I said something racist and i want to dieLast week whilst drinking with friends, for some dumb fucking reason I said the n word. As soon as i said it i felt so fucking guilty and sick and now a week on from it i literally cannot stop thinking about it, i want to kill myself so badly. Im just so terrified that the friends i said it in front of are going to think im actually racist which iâ€™m not, and i also think me saying it was caught on film which makes me even more suicidal because it could be shared and then everyone would think i was a racist, and i would obviously deeply upset my black friends.
