Should I kill myself?I'm 14 at the moment, I'm about to be 15 in a few weeks and I have depression and suicidal thoughts. I don't actually want to kill myself right now but I fantasize about it. I just started high school so I'm giving myself some more time before I follow through with suicide. I'm planning on giving myself until my 21st birthday to turn my life around or else I'm committing suicide. Let me have your thoughts on this: Will it get any better? Should I give myself more time? Am I doing anything wrong? Please leave your suggestions.
