I can't take this anymoreI'm so close to being out of this house, away from the people who've berated me my whole life, and because of quarantine, I have to spend another birthday. Here. With them. She yelled in my face today and it hurt so much I don't know why I continue to let her control my feelings. I want to self harm, but Ik know she wants that. She wants to see me worse than her, in a mental hospital rotting away. I just want to get away. I don't care if death is my salvation anymore. I don't have a future.
