My mom says she wants to kill herself and so do I.I posted a few days ago but changed my mind.

She said she can't watch me suffer and possibly die slowly anymore

I have uterine cancer, I'm not dying, but I also have a mystery problem causing excruciating pain and lots of hospitalizations.

Two days ago some people who are doing construction on our house stole around 50 of my anxiety medication and my pain pills. It made me realize how dependant I am on these pills to get through a day. I hate that. 

My life at 20 years old has become nothing but pain and surgeries and scans. I'm so tired, and I guess my mom is too.

My mom is so strong and wonderful, I don't want to make her sound selfish and weak. It's just taxing on her to see me suffer so hard. I want to die to relieve her of her constant worry. 

Maybe I just need to shut up and take a nap.
