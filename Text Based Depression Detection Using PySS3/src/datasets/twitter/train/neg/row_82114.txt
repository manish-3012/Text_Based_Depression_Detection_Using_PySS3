negative thoughtsI'm gay. I came out to my family (my mother's husband kinda outed me actually) and they seem to have took it well from what it seemed like, but they still constantly make fun of other LGBT people in really mean ways. They still even call me slurs in "joking ways". I have always wanted to approach them about but whenever i do they make me feel stupid. tonight i considered suicide. i never felt any real love in this house. this isn't the first time i attempted something like this, i tried it back in April. 
i don't want to bother any other friends or family with my life problems so i had no one else to turn to but here. im in a relationship with someone but they don't know about any of this, i don't want to worry them to much.
