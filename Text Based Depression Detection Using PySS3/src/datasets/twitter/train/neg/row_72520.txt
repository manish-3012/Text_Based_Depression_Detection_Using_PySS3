I need to die , please help meI've reached my limit and I'm going to kill myself . I literally want nothing from life , I don't want to "get better"  , I don't even want to be happy . So I'm going to kill myself as soon as I can . I just have no idea how to and I'm a coward . I can't get a gun , I have nowhere to hang myself and there's no way I'd have the courage to slit my wrists or jump off a building . Pills seem to be the only way but that seems 50/50 and if I survive I'll be in a worse state than I am now unable to kill myself . I know I'm going to reach a point where I will inevitably carve my wrists open but I don't want to die in such a horrible way . I feel like I've suffered enough and I just need to know how to end it peacefully . Please someone help me , I just need to know how I can die I really don't need any other advice
