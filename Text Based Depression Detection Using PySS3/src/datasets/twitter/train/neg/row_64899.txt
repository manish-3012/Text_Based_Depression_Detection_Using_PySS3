I guess I'm done.My whole life I've had a different aspect on life. I've never truly been religious, nor thought about my future. It's my senior year, I've had one attempt and hospital stay which helped temporary. I'm taking online classes and have a few months till I can grad and enlist, but I don't want to. I have amazing family members who have pushed me torwards I.T and getting different Certifications to help me get a better job in the army, but again, I don't want to. I constantly have sad thoughts at night driving, wishing I had someone to text and risk my life whole driving to talk to. Tonight I went with friends and seen IT, a few girls were with us and I hit it off with each of them. But the one I liked the most turned out to just be a "hoe". Apparently my buddie and another friend were planning to run a train on her, showed me texts and everything. Then she didn't snap me back, so I guess my confidence took a hit. Another girl hit me up on Instagram, and don't get me wrong, she's hot but she's not my type. She's the type to over react to scary stuff and act like she's a baby. I guess I just don't see a reason to live, I'm lonely but only because I can never be happy with what I have. I'm probably going to do it tomorrow after drinking some and maybe smoking, I want to go out happy and on my own terms. Thank you guys for taking the time to read this.
