Meh..I'm not thinking of hurting myself, but just wanted to say that when you poor 20hr days into a project for a few weeks, &amp; I try to do something nice by giving away and open sourcing some of my artistic endeavours (which would allow people to make money from my work), I get told it's so easy, and trolled, when the guy even said it was easy because he traced over my image (created by me from a blank canvas)... not realising that the conceptualisation is sometimes the hardest part, like making something that doesn't yet exist in that form.

On top of everything else that's going on not even going to start, sorry), it's got me back on meds. Things get better I guess, so there's that to look forward to, or there's always more meds. If you would like to put a smile on my face, please send a hug or well wishes towards my loving grandmother in the comments, who could really do with a thought or prayer. When she smiles, I smile, so it may be the best thing in the world right now. Thank youðŸ™

Not using a throw away... maybe I should, but honestly, I'm just at that point where everything I try to do right, usually goes to shart anyway.

I would like to maybe help someone here with a little smile, so if you see any of my artwork in my post history, or really like Deadpool, hit me up and I'll do up a custom wallpaper or something for a few people.

Thank youðŸ™
