Does it really get better?I have been getting therapy and medication and I feel worse. I want to kill myself less, but that is because everything seems to be getting harder and harder. If I were to kill myself, I would have wasted a bunch of my therapist's time, a bunch of everyone's time. To think of how much time is left for me if I don't kill myself makes me wish I had killed myself sooner. The idea that I could enjoy life is something I can't imagine. I can't believe it. Is it even possible? Time is going too fast and everything is too hard and I can keep up and I don't know what to do. What should I do?
