Everything has gone to shitIâ€™ve been dealing with a disease for about two years and recently Iâ€™ve started getting these dehabilitating headaches every day. I think itâ€™s corona but I have to see my doctor. I think I must have the shitty luck in the world to get it in addition to having depression and PTSD for the past six years. A therapist called me today for a phone consultation but I could tell in her voice that she just wanted to send me to the hospital. So I just partially lied and said I was only a little suicidal. I have no hope that therapy will help. My mom yelled at me today to stop being lazy and just graduate from school. But I hate my university and how my parents manipulated me into staying here. Then my dad barged in and said whatâ€™s wrong with me. I just started crying and said I wanted to die and to kill me and he just left and closed the door. Fuck, I hate my life and my existence. Why is there no button to die peacefully.
