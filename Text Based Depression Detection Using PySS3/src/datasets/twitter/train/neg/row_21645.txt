Im too scared to ask for helpI have been getting worse lately - cant eat, cant sleep, feel anxious all the time, cant see any hope for the future, dont want to do anything..and i have trouble getting out of bed most days. 
I dont have many friends and the ones I do have, I'm too scared to tell them because I feel like I dont deserve their pity...they will judge me, they have their own problems so what right do i have going around making their lives harder by being an emotional wreck for no reason. 

I'm too much of a wimp to kill myself but i dont know what to do.
