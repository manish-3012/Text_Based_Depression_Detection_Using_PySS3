I can't do thisI've been living with severe OCD for a while now. My intrusive thoughts are thoughts of self-harm and suicide. I've attempted suicide many times but I've found a very effective way to do it. I still want to live but my OCD just keeps getting worse and worse. My suicidal thoughts aren't mine but I can't keep doing this. I want to do this but I can't keep fighting this.
