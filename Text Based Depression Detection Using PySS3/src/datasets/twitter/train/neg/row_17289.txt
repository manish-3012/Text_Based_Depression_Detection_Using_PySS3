I turn 23 next monthWhen I was in high school, I told myself that if my life didn't get better by the time I turned 23, I'd just kill myself and be done. 2 years ago, for the first time in my life, I knew what it felt like not to want to kill myself. It was nice. It was always in the back of my mind though, that 23 was still my cutoff. And now that my 23rd birthday is next month, my mistakes are catching up to me. I should've known better. I would change it all if I could. But I can't. I'm scum. Anyone here would agree if they knew me. Anyone alive would agree with me if they knew. I don't want to die. But I'll have to. I don't see any way around it. But I deserve it. At least I'll get to see what's on the other side. God, why did I have to be like this...I don't want you guys to stop me. By all means, please ignore me. I just needed to put this somewhere. I needed to say something before I did it. But I don't have anyone who would listen. They shouldn't either. I at least know that much. No one will be sad for me. They'll say this is a good thing. Because it is. I can at least take solace in that. Fuck me. Fuck everything that I am. I never deserved my life. I can't wait for this to be over.
