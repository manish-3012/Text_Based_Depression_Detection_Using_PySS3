I'm trying so, so hard to stay but I feel so trappedThis semester has all but killed me. Normally I'm a good student, if not a moderate procrastinator; but this semester I kind of just... Stopped. I kept letting my classes get further and further behind until it was too late to save them. My parents, my friends, my school counselors - none of them know what's going on. They all think things are fine, aside from being aware that I'm depressed. Here it is the end of the semester, when I was supposed to graduate with my associates degree, and I'm failing all of my classes.

The worst part is the shame. I'm really close with my parents, and I already know the disappointment on their faces when I have to tell them will rip me to shreds. I was supposed to be at a larger university in the fall, but I'll just be retaking the classes I failed. I feel so sick every time I think of how much I'm letting my parents and myself down, and of how I didn't do anything sooner.

I know it's not the end of the world. I know it's not even the worst thing I'll ever live through, if I can manage to do that. But shit, every day is just agony. Every time I imagine the disappointment on my parents' faces I just break down. I don't know how to explain myself in a way that doesn't sound like I'm making excuses for myself - hell, some days I have a hard time convincing *myself* I'm not making excuses. I just wish I could stop hurting and do what I need to do to fix my shit. I can't even make a phone call to set up an appointment with a therapist. I just kind of... Exist in this mess I've made for myself. It sucks.
