75Today is the lowest point in my life. My husband left me for someone else last month, and my son cried when he had to come back home with me today.

I tried reaching out to a friend and the conversation ended with him telling me I have serious issues within myself and then they stopped talking to me.

I had the worst anxiety attack I've ever had. I thought a shower would help, and it just led to me laying on in the bathtub crying and struggling to breathe until the water ran cold.

The only thing that calmed me down was the realization that my mother has a cabinet full of medications that could easily end it.

I tried using the suicide hotline chat and there were 75 people waiting before me. I chain smoked for 45 minutes and gave up when I was 34 in line.

I am so completely terrified of my thoughts right now. I'm not sure what to do. I think typing this out is helping, but I can't really tell. 

I don't know what I'm asking for here. 

75 people needed help before me tonight. I know I'm not alone in this, but it feels so lonely.
