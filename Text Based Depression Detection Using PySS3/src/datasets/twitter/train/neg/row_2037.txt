I'm a terrible piece of shit, I don't know if I can fix this...Hey, so I feel terrible me and my friend had an huge argument yesterday on Discord and he was already enough pain, and couldn't take it anymore, I made things worse and I've known him for 3 years. We got really close last year, related on so many things and I pushed him away. I didn't get over an incident that happened 4-5 months ago and I was petty between my ex-friend, who he's friends with. It's fine that he defends him, cause things definitely way got out of hand. He doesn't deserve all this pain, I feel so terrible. I really don't know how to write a sincere apology. I related to him so well, that I even harsh a bit. I really want to apologize, but I don't know how to word it.I found out he's in this discord group chat, but scared that he will get mad at me. Please help! I really am on the verge of ruining an amazing friendship. He means a lot to me, he doesn't mind me venting. But, I made things out of hand and caused this to be like this. It is my fault that I did this, I just don't know how to properly fix this. All I do is cause more damage and hurt others. I just really wish there is a good way of fixing this, like what should I say? I don't mind admitting my mistakes, but I feel anxious talking to a person who's also anxious often with social anxiety.
