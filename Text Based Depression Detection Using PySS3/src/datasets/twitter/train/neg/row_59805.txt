I almost killed myself 2 weeks agoI almost killed myself 2 weeks ago by overdosing and sadly survival instincts took over me and I freaked out and I didn't do it
They say "why you want to die?" "don't you worry about the afterlife?" like if my life right now is amazing and positive
I'm 22 and I already fed up with life and I don't have anything to live for
I'm horrible at university, I don't have any real friends in real life and I got ghosted by my internet friends even though I didnt do anything wrong they all just got busy with their lives and I got left behind
I'm so worthless, talent less and I suck at everything I do. I should have killed myself when I had the chance..
