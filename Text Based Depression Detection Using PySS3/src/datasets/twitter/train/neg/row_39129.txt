DepressedIve been struggling for the past 9 months with severe depression, I have been thinking about committing suicide for awhile and sometimes it's just tempting to just end all of it, the stress the pain of depression is ridiculous. I know people have it worse than me and get through it, but I'm not as strong I suppose. I have reached out to a few friends and they have been supportive but talking about it never helped, maybe cause I didn't give them the full story. I cut whenever I feel really bad and I hate myself for doing it. I feel ok when I'm out with friends but I tend to isolate myself and then lay in bed and just fantasize about death, or the easy way out. I get depressed for about a month and then it goes away for a little and starts back up stronger after a few weeks. I think of my depression as rounds in a boxing match and I'm on round 6. Who knows what happens after round 10
