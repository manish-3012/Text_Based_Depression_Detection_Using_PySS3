HAPPY TO SAY ITS THE END NOW.I feel a huge sense of relief in knowing that im not going to wake up tomorrow. I feel so tired. Pain is always with [me.It](https://me.It) will never stop. A part of me is sad, im not sure why, i think because i did have a suicide plan that involved seing some people being outed&amp;made to pay for what they did to me as a child. I did want my vengence against them. Its actually the only reason i didnt kill myself immediately after my mum died recently. but i cant wait anymore. Not sure why im even writing this here.
