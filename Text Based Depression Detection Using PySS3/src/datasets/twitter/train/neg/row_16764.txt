I have literally no will to live and its destroying meI have battled depression for as long as I remember.  I have thought about committing suicide almost every day for over 3 years.  The only reason I haven't killed myself if because I know my family will be crushed.  I'm not even living for myself anymore, and I haven't been for years, and its destroying my social life, my grades, everything.  I have some major trust issues too right now so its not like I want to talk to somebody about it in person.  I thought about enlisting so I could just be blown up somewhere or shot and die with a little dignity. I have no hobbies, virtually no will to live, nothing.  No one knows about my situation because I've been able to hide it behind a smile.  I'm not necessarily planning my suicide but I really need some advice from someone in (or was in) a similar situation.  I cant live like this for much longer.
