I'm going to be free tonight.Just wanted to let you guys know you've helped me learn a lot about myself. You guys do great work and I appreciate it, however I'm too far gone for saving... here's my note that I left for whoever finds me.

I've come to accept that I'm the clown, I'm just here to make everybody else laugh, to ask how your day is ... nobody will ever ask me but I guess I'm okay with that. If I can make somebody else feel better, it makes me feel better, I don't want anybody to feel the way that I do ... that empty feeling. I've had a rough life ... watching people fade away, change,  die, or turn on me... I've gone through a lot of betrayal but it's because of this betrayal that I know how to make others feel better. I can't cry. I can't show any faltering or weakness. Because the second I show how I really feel inside, I no longer become the clown... I become just another person. Goodbye
