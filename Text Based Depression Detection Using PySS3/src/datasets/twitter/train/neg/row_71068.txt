Life adviceDuring the unit of mental health in my AFJROTC class, we ended up on the topic of suicide. My instructor had been telling us a story about one student who had texted his friends to find him and so they tried to before he committed the act, but fails. This is when he looked to the class and said, "Wasn't this just a mean thing to do? If you kill yourself, think about how much if a jackass you would be to everyone you know. Killing yourself is the biggest dick move that you can make." This simple comment has resonnated with me ever since. I aspire to be liked by him along with all others, and so I was going to kms that day, but didn't, because I didn't want to be a jackass. These thoughts have come back however, and so I might just rip the band-aid off and just end it. I'm posting this to help others where I was helped, or at least temporarily as with me. No one knows about my thoughts, so it would be a complete surprise if I did, but idk. Don't be a jackass by killing yourself.
