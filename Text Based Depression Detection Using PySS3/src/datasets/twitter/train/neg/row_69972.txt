Want to be dead but don't want to actually kill myselfWell here I am. About to fail out of school again. Just lost a bunch of money gambling. Very expensive nicotine addiction. My anxiety makes it to where I'm completely unable to connect with other people. I'm unintentionally rude and unapproachable so nobody will ever love me. I'm on meds but they don't work. None of them ever have. I just want to be done.

I'm tired all the time. There's no point in me living anymore but I don't want to actually go through with killing myself. I just never want to leave my room again and hopefully just die of starvation or something but I know that will take a long time and I don't want to make my suffering worse..

I don't know what to do.
