Everythingâ€™s everythingI have suicidal thoughts everyday. Nothing in my life is going right or going at all. 
First, school. Iâ€™m 22 and behind because gap year/add/adhd. Iâ€™m going to school for Env. Science which is fine, but Iâ€™m failing general chemistry and have been at this community college for 3 years which feels like an eternity. Everyone else seems to be moving on with their life and Iâ€™m stuck. I donâ€™t want to drop out, but I want the constant struggle to stop. I want to be able to learn.
Second, relationships. Iâ€™m a 22 year old virgin. Never had a serious girlfriend, but kissed a girl for the first time a year ago. I never pursue women because I know they donâ€™t want to be with me. I want nothing more than to have a family, but I donâ€™t see this ever happening. All my friends live in other states and I donâ€™t know how to make friends.
I have no real hobbies or passions. One of the things Iâ€™m best at will end with the DEA knocking down the door and me posting this from prison.
I just want to be happy and feel love, but I donâ€™t think I can. I canâ€™t think of anyone I trust. Iâ€™m beyond lonely.
Sometimes my mind drifts to the 9mm in my bed drawer and how easy it would be to make this all a bad dream. Or drive my car off a cliff. Iâ€™m just so tired of life.
