My existence is pointless and so is this post.I am invisible to every one I know.
Obviously, I am physically visible and donâ€™t have superpowers, but yâ€™know what I mean.
Nobody notices me.
Nobody speaks to me.
Any post I make on any social media gets between zero and zero reactions.
I could get on FB or Insta and post â€œI want to die.â€ and you know what would happen?
Nothing.
Nobody would care.
I know because Iâ€™ve done it.
Not so much as a single â€œare you okay?â€
Itâ€™s been like this for years now.
â€œwHy dOnâ€™T yOu TrY tAlKiNg tO sOmeBoDy iRL?â€
Because I have nobody.
I donâ€™t spend time with anyone.
My family (other than my mother) shunned me years ago for being a â€œcriminalâ€ because I got in trouble a few times for smoking pot. 
Iâ€™m not completely disgusting physically, but nobodyâ€™s interested in a loser that brings absolutely nothing to the table but suicidal thoughts and shitty memes. 
Itâ€™s been at least 5 years since the last time I was physically touched by another human being. I donâ€™t even mean sexually, nobodyâ€™s even hugged me in that long.
It wasnâ€™t always like this.
I used to have friends. Relationships.
I have roommates, but I could walk through the house with blood gushing from a cut throat and they wouldnâ€™t even blink. Iâ€™m as invisible to them as I am to everyone else.
Until recently, Iâ€™ve been pushing through with the thought that things have to get better eventually. They had to, I convinced myself.
But things just get worse.
This week, my car died. I took it in for a routine oil change and when I picked it up, it had a bunch of problems that didnâ€™t exist when I dropped it off. I know, I know, that sounds like anyone whoâ€™s ever been to an autoshop ever, but thereâ€™s no way an oil change brought what was quoted as a $10,000 repair to the surface.
Because I no longer have my car, I lost my job.
Itâ€™s too far to walk and too expensive to uber/lyft/etc there. Iâ€™d spend more on transportation costs to get there than Iâ€™d make while working. My roommateâ€™s donâ€™t care about my problems and arenâ€™t interested in helping me get to work.
Soon, I will also lose my home.
Nobody wants to live with someone who canâ€™t pay rent.
My current life choices are to live on the street and/or to just call it quits and end it like Iâ€™ve been wanting to for too long.
I already know which one I choose.
I stole my roommateâ€™s gun tonight.
Iâ€™m not making this post so people can react and say â€œoh no, donâ€™t do it, Iâ€™m sure you have something to live for.â€
Because I donâ€™t.
Iâ€™m making this post so that maybe somebody somewhere will see the sad guy in their life and just fucking ask if heâ€™s okay and just acknowledge their existence long enough that they donâ€™t end up like me.
After 28 years of bullshit, Iâ€™m out.
I hope your lives are all infinitely better than mine was.
