I can't be selfish for wanting to be loved. Right?Who am I kidding, of course I am. I'm just a pathetic little piece of shit who wants a girlfriend even though I obviously have no good reason to. I know I don't deserve a girl because of what a shitty human I am but la dee fucking da here I am slicing my arm up because I'm gonna die a kissless virgin.

It pains me to see my parents everyday, who, even after handling me for 15 years still love each other so much. I can't ever have that. I can't. I can't. I cant. I'll never ever have a pretty girl to hold in my arms. I'll never be able to call a girl my "bae". It sucks and I can't take it meds dont help therapy doesn't help and my parents love each other but they don't love me so I'm shit out of luck. All i want is to be loved. All i want is a girl with whom I can make and share memories. But that's not gonna happen. So, that's why I'm ending my life right now. Because I cant live another second so lonely.

And fuck you if you're gonna say that it gets better or its just a teen thing.
