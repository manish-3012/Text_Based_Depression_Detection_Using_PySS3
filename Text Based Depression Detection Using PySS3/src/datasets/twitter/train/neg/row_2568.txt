IdkSo, I'm doing it on the 22nd of this month, I wanted to do it in May, but something came up.

Im scared, really scared. Not scared of death, but of the pain and the consequences I'll have to face if I don't actually die.

I'm kind of sad that I won't get to do all the things that I have always wanted to. I've always wanted to try sushi, to go to a WCE event, fly in a plane etc. All those little things that I won't get to experience.

I might get too scared to do it and end up not doing it, but I think I'm brave enough to go with the plan.

Idk, I just wanted to tell someone this, I think my friend is getting sick of me talking about my sad stuff
