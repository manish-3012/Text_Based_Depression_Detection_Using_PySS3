Probably the wrong subreddit, but oh well.My dad just walked in on me pulling up my pants after my boyfriend and I were making out and it was getting a little heated up. No sex was involved and it wasn't going to happen. The only way out I see is killing myself, but I know that's a retarded solution. I can't cope with it though.
