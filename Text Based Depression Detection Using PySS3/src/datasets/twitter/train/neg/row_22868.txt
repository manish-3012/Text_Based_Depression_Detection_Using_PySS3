i'm not even suicidal at the moment, i just wish the world would end.i had my last attempt two months ago, and i was suicidal three weeks ago. i felt relatively fine for these last weeks. now i can feel a depressive episode incoming. but i'm no suicidal at the moment. usually it builds up in a few days until all i want is to jump off my balcony. but honestly, given how chaotic this world is- with the overwhelming amount of things going wrong wity the world- i simply wish humanity would end once for all. be it an apocalypsis or a war that would wipe us all out or an asteroid. anything. i'd be in so much peace if one of those things were to happen now.
