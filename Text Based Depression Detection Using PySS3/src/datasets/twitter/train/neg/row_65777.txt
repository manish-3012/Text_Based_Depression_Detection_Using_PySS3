I hate myself.I posed on /r/raisebynarcissists and they suggest I post here. I guess I just want to reach out. I feel very very sad and alone. I have a good friend who tries and helps me but she is far away and I don't want to burden her further. 

I just absolutely hate myself. I do not want to live. I do not want to get up each morning and pretend I enjoy whatever it is I am doing because it is not living. I just exist. I go through each motion and every mistake is like another black mark to me. Even little things. 

I have started the weird habit of hitting myself or try to harm myself but without cutting. I have a strange punishment/reward system for my actions. 

Forget my housekey and miss the bus, cold shower and can't eat until five pm. Just strange things. 

Are these things my bipolar? Are they just depression? Is this at least somewhat "normal"? 

I know I would hang myself. I use my credit card debt as an excuse to not do it because I don't want anyone to have any more burden because of me. But right now I have enough money to pay it off and the thought that scares me is that I could just do it.
