I failed the entrance exam for my highschool. I wish I never been cursed by knowledgeHi guys I'm just a normal 15 year old  boy or that is what I think of myself.
I was born smart I already knew fractions and decimal since I was grade 1, ever since everyone has high hopes for me. I get judged every move, my dancing skills was bad and everyone laughed when I fail a move or even move at all, everyone bullied me and even my parents too. There were only 4 people that believed in me, my 3 best friends and my brother who protects me from every whip from my father's belt. He supported me Everytime where my parents didn't and my friends will play with me,in our gadget and outside, we play magic the gathering it was a very great game and I discovered anime. the second you knew I became addicted it was so many variables of genres mixed together with beautiful animations, such blissful memories I made back then. My classmates bullied me because of my shy and awkward side they only became friendly when there is a quiz or assignment. Sometimes when a student gets a higher score than me my parents would punish me,so much pain in it I couldn't feel my back from the punishment. We are close to graduation and we have an entrance exam for a prestigious highschool. I failed on purpose I only wanted to live a normal life that's it,that's what I told to my parents,they were furious,they said I threw away a future so great it can change their lives (they did not include me) so yeah 3 days after that I'm stuck in my room no need for social interaction it will ruin your scores they said, no more gadgets they distract you they said. No more I think in my head no more
