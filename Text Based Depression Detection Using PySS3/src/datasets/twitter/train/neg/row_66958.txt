Iâ€™m feeling a lot better but I still canâ€™t stop thinking about killing myself?The past week my new SSRI has finally kicked in and Iâ€™ve been feeling so much better. Not good yet, but better. I just canâ€™t stop thinking about suicide. I donâ€™t even WANT to do it at the moment, itâ€™s just always there. Had to do some vent art to get it out of my system because all Iâ€™ve been able to think about for the past 3 hours is drowning myself in the estuary 2 minutes from my house.
