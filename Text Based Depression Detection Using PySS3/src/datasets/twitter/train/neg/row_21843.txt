This is itNobody likes me. I have no hope left. My future is very bleak. I have two options: suffer or die. I feel like iâ€™m in hell. My dreams are shattered, my friends are gone, and I have nothing left. Iâ€™m obsessed with the person that ruined my fucking life. I just wish that there was a way to make it all go away.
