when will things stop getting worse?i made a really bad mistake friday night while extremely manic and i effectively pushed everyone away from me again. i cant stand being this way and i don't understand why god made me like this. i don't know what i did wrong. i ask for help but nobody is listening to me and it's making everything so bad. im so tired of being alone but im unable to switch on a normal human brain and just have friends and i just want people to like me, but nothing i do is working. i try to fake it and act like others and that doesn't work. i just be myself and that doesn't work. i dont know who i am anymore and im so tired of being a failure. i cant even kill myself without failing at that too and it's the easiest thing in the world
