just exhaustedmy boyfriend of 9 years dumped me on easter for a girl half my age. i'm feeling really really unstable.. i have to move out of our home by the end of may so that he can move her in. i'm feeling really desperate and scared. i don't know where i'm going to go or what i'm going to do. 

i have borderline personality disorder and i'm finding it hard to trust anyone and just really abandoned.
