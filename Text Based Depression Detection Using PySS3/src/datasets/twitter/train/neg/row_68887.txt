My friend has told me he's feeling suicidal - what can I do to help him?He just sent me a text message saying he's laying in bed contemplating suicide. I've tried to ring him, and replied to his text, but I havent heard back. I'm at work and am thinking of leaving to go to his house, just to check on him. But I dont know what to say or how I can help him.
