i want to kill myselfbi donâ€™t have a specific reason why i want to kill myself. iâ€™m just confused and bored of my life now. this girl has me fucked up too. iâ€™m starting to get bored of finding a special person. iâ€™m not really that insecure of myself. i learned to not care anymore. her friends say she likes me but she doesnâ€™t seem to be that interested into talking to me etc. iâ€™m just confused and overwhelmed. i have already tried killing myself... last year i felt overwhelmed by school and loneliness. now right now i have the friends i want, and we talk everyday and i donâ€™t have school right now. i just feel worthless, i donâ€™t really see myself being big anytime in the future. it sucks.
