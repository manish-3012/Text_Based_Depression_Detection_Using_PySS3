iâ€™ve triediâ€™ve tried holding on, hanging in, keeping faith; iâ€™m tired. exhausted even. at night i either donâ€™t sleep or sleep too much. i barely eat. i barely function. when i leave my house, i freak out and panic. iâ€™m only 18 and iâ€™m in Â£1000 debt because i had to move out away from my mum and didnâ€™t know what i was doing about my rent. i have no friends, may as well have no mum, and iâ€™ve ruined my shot at education by getting myself kicked out of college because i just couldnâ€™t handle the amount of anxiety it caused me this year. iâ€™m a such a failure. iâ€™ve never been able to do anything right. iâ€™m trying desperately to find a reason to stay and i donâ€™t even know why. i have no idea why i want to stay but part of me does. part of me wants to fight through it because thereâ€™s still so much i havenâ€™t experienced, but the rest of me, the stronger part, is screaming at me to give up. whatâ€™s the point in spending my life trying for something that will never happen? i canâ€™t do it anymore, it hurts so much i can scarcely breathe and everyday i cry now just from being so overwhelmed. i just want it to end, is that really selfish of me when literally no one is here trying to stop me? if i died today, no one would cry tomorrow. no one would even notice iâ€™m gone
