Found the right bridge.It's barely more than an hour away. The suicide barrier is considerately designed so as not to be a burden, and barring some ridiculously bad luck, it's guaranteed to be fatal.  

I also like that it's kind of out of the way, so it doesn't make any real news, not that there is any chance of anyone outside my family noticing.
