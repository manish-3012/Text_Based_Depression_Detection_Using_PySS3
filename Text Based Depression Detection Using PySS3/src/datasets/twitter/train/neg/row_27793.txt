It just feels like everyone I know has perfect lifeIt just isnâ€™t fair and the only person Iâ€™ve opened up to just says itâ€™ll get better. None of my actual friends give a shit about me and even when it was my birthday they didnâ€™t say anything even though they knew. Nothing good has happened in the last few years. I donâ€™t even know why Iâ€™m on this sub or writing this. I donâ€™t want to live anymore
