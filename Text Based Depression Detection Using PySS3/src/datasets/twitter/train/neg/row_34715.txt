Since it became 2017 I've just wanted to dieI was in a party, now I'm just waiting for my boyfriend and his friend to wake up and it's been a few hours, I'm just alone here on the shitty new year with my thoughts. We had a small party, and as the year changed I just got incredible sad and haven't stopped since (not that I wasn't sad in the first place, but I just got this crippling depression that's not letting me go). I've got no reason to believe this year will be any better than the last one and I can't find any motivation in me to drag myself through it. I can't think of any way to turn my life around so that I could be happy. I don't honestly see why bother
