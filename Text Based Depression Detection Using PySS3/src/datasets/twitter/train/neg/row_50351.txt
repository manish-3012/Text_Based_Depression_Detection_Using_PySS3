I think about dying but would probably not go through with itSo basically my friend died mid April this year and since then even more negative shit has happened to the point where Iâ€™m basically just thinking of suicide daily. I think of ways to go through with it, how itâ€™d be, what Iâ€™d eat last, what Iâ€™d do on my last day and Idk how to feel about it. Iâ€™ve always been depressed and had very bad anxiety but Iâ€™m fucking confused about this, itâ€™s normal for me to think about it quite often but not daily like I have been.
