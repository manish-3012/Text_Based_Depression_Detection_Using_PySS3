Planning my last day this week.I've decided this anxiety and paranoia is just not worth dealing with. I started Lexapro two days ago. I got an epi pen for my allergic reaction anxiety. Everything seems to be put in place but I'm just done.

I just want my son and girlfriend to know I love them. I want to thank my jiu jitsu Coach for helping me through my anxiety and weight problems. And most of all my dad. For helping me when I needed the help. 

I haven't asked for helped. I've just told everyone I'm tired of life. 

Not sure which day this week. Just when it feels rights, I guess. Most likely crashing my car. But I'm not putting other people in danger. Don't worry.

Thanks.
