I made all the bad decisions.Well, my rodeo is coming to a end. Not really much too say. I was born into poverty, i was never pushed too become anything, i never had self-confidence, could never motivate myself. I tried really hard in this last year to turn my life around but i couldn't beat the storm of self doubt alone. I cant go to college because i have no money, no car, no license, no job, and a 2.5 gpa. i am a full fledged failure at everything. I have friends but since they are all good people with nice families they will all go to college after this summer and make something better of themselves. Even hanging out with them no makes me beyond depressed because i know they have what ive always wanted. Loving parents and a work ethic. If backed myself into a corner that i cant get out of. So, to the people who loved me or cared about me. Thank you and im sorry. To the one girl who confessed to me and i drove her away because im a fucking loser. Im sorry that you fell for a idiot. And too my best friend, im sorry I couldn't hold my promise, i just can't take it anymore. Good luck too all of you in the future and sorry for making this so long.
