Why am I alive?I don't amount to anything. And I hate it because there are people here that do genuinely care for me and yet their support makes no difference. I'm not worth the effort. I won't get anywhere in life. I'll  never be happy. I'm too much of a pussy to kill myself though. I just hope that tonight when I fall asleep I won't wake up. Maybe someday I'll have the courage to just end it all and end this.
