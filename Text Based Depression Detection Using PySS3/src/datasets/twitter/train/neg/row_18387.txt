Anyone else relate?My childhood was rough,I dont feel like getting into it,as I dont believe it affects me anymore. I just recently got a girlfriend,and im still not happy. I thought having her would change everything,but it didnt change a thing. I have realized years ago that im simply not meant to be here. I can barely socialize. When I hang out with friends im always left behind. These days,the only time im happy is when im with my girlfriend,or when im high. My day starts off with me getting baked,and sometimes taking triple c's,going to school,sleeping all day,then I go home and hate myself. I hate being alive. I hate knowing im gonna be working all the time,that im gonna  be socially impotent for the rest of my life. That im going to think of suicide constantly. I have always known that I was the idiot of the school,but I never thought id hate myself this much. I never thought I would be so joyless. What difference would it make if I died? Of course,my family would be hurt,but I simply do not care anymore. I could have everything I want,and every day could be an adventure,but at the end of it,I would still think of suicide. I feel like im going to do it soon,possibly on my birthday in June. I dont know,im very sorry for rambling but I just dont know what im doing. I feel my life slipping through my fingers.
