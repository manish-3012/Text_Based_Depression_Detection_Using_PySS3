Am I suicidal?I've been feeling really lonely lately. I smashed a light bulb into tiny pieces and scattered the glass across the floor and now I'm walking barefoot across my carpet and cutting myself. I  am getting joy out of pulling the pieces out of my foot and watching the blood trickle. Is this normal? I have never done this before
