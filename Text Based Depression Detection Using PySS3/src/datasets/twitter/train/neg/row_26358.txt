My Girlfriends father called the police on meI moved in with my girlfriend around 2 months ago. Somewhere around 2 weeks ago she started being very cold to me and didn't even show any interest in me. I asked her what was wrong and she said, that she cannot feel comfortable while I'm at her place. She wanted me to go away, to leave.. so I did just that, I left. I've also said,that I will not be coming back.. I was intending to kill myself butt didn't say it directly. I was done. I had and still have nothing left. I am literally alone..

Her father called the police , because of the messages I've sent , that I'm never coming back, not telling where I was . They searched for me for hours. My Girlfriend and her dad were worried about me and I get that. I didn't know what I was going to do. I was planning sleeping in my car,because I couldn't go back to her.

I talked with the police about what my motives were and I just said,that I was lost and I didn't know what I was going to do next. Where I would've gone and so on..

I was so close trying to kill myself again but thought to myself, I'll wait till the next week. I had already prepared everything.. 

I want to see what happens next. How will things turn out. I still have holidays next week. If it turn out shit, well, then I'm gone.. it is so difficult.

 I have a week to prepare again.
