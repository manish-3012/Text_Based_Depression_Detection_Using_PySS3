i hate living hereI hate living here. Iâ€™m still a teenager and I just wanna get heard properly by my parents..

I remember my own mother laughing at me when I said I had suicidal thoughts. I was hurting myself in front of her eyes but she just left the room and completely ignored me. Whenever I think of suicide, I just think of the close relatives I have in my life that I thought would be able to at least show some respect when it comes to serious topics, but I guess not. Hopefully it doesnâ€™t affect her too much when the time of me finally leaving this horrible world will actually come. Itâ€™s all a sign I shouldnâ€™t be here anymore. I donâ€™t have anything left.
