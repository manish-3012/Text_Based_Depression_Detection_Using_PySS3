My suicide fantasy ends with me getting savedIâ€™ve realized itâ€™s hard for me to seriously carry out a suicide attempt because I just really want my best friend to stop me... In my fantasy he shows up and holds me and I just cry. 

In real life I know he wouldnâ€™t show up, even if I told him what was going to happen. He would just text me - maybe this is just a little selfish of me to want though. In real life I most likely wouldnâ€™t break down in tears as I hardly ever cry anymore. 

They say youâ€™re not truly suicidal if you want someone to save you, and I really donâ€™t know what to make of that. Some part of me just wants to kill myself just to prove them all wrong, I can still die while wanting that. But the other part realizes that it would truly solidify my loneliness to do so. But maybe I just need to come to terms with that. Maybe I just need to take that step and stop wanting things Iâ€™ll never have.
