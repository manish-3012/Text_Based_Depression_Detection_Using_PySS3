About to loose my job.My boss came up to me first thing this morning and told me to start looking for a new job.  I have been looking. It seems like all the jobs that are good for me require a higher degree than what I have.

I can't stand on my feet for more than an hour. I have cerebral hypotomia.  Look it up... too long to talk about.

In short I need a sit down job.

I'm screwed.

I don't have enough money to go back to school and live on.

I feel panic. I'm depressed. I feel like there is no way put of this.
