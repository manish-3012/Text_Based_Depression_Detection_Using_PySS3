Please...help meOH my god, I was so close. 
So, Iâ€™m 13 and i have depression and today, I was going to kill my self. 
I was in my room being the sad prison I am because I messed up the most important relationship I had with my girlfriend when I had this amazing idea, i was going to kill myself. So I went to my parents room because they werenâ€™t home and took out there hand gun. I went back to my room and loaded the gun...I held it to my head and I was seconds away from death when I stoped and I put the gun away and stared to cry my head off.  Why? Why would I even have the idea of killing my self? Iâ€™m a smart 13 year old girl who is really sad but I know there is a solution for me. 
God please...help me, I needed to get this off my chest
