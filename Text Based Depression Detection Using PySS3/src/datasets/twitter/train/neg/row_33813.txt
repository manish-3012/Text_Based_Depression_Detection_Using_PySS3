Sitting alone in my room trying to decide how I want to do it.Met a girl a couple months ago online, we've been talking for everyday since. We both suffer through depression and have talked a lot about killing ourselves. 

This morning I woke up to a text saying "I'm sorry." And she had deleted her Facebook. 

She won't respond now so I am assuming she finally decided it was time. Think I'm gonna join her. 

Never got to tell her how much I loved her.
