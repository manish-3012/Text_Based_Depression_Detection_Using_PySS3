I can't feel happyI have a decent social life, and an amazing girlfriend. When I am with her, I feel really good. But usually I feel really down. Down to the point of not wanting to talk to anyone. Down to the point of wanting a drink or two every single day. Though I keep that from her.

That was all working fine until last Saturday, when we got into a fight over a small thing and I raised my voice on her. She said she was mad at me and I snapped and told her about my depression. About the constant suicidal thoughts I was having but hiding from everybody. She told me to go see a counselor. All she has done is be supportive and want me to get help, but she says that she wants distance. 

I can't get out of my recent slump. I have severe social anxiety. I hate myself. I get bad grades even though I am smart. I want to die so bad but I can't bring myself to do it. Tonight I got drunk and took 35 pills of ibuprofen. I drink everyday as a way of slowly killing myself. I know that every great relationship I have in my life romantic or friendship has fallen apart, so why shouldn't my great relationship now. 

I feel alone. I feel isolated. I feel like no one understands what I'm going through and that I will never feel happy again. I used to get pleasure from things like running and playing basketball. Those don't give me pleasure anymore. I just want to die. I have a knife at my side now, half a liter of Stolichnaya, half a bottle of nyquil, and half a bottle of ibuprofen right next to me. 

I want to take 20 or more ibuprofen and chug the bottle of nyquil and Stolichnaya, or just take the knife and stab myself in the neck. 

This might be the last post I ever make, and the last thing I ever write. I don't want to hurt anyone but I just want to die so bad. Please, help me
