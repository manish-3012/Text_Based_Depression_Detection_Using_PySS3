I don't know what is stopping me from suicide.My only sexual experiences have come from porn and masturbation. I am twenty-three. You can say that there is still plenty of time for that, and it is a perfectly normal thing to be a virgin at that age, but let's get fucking real. 

I haven't even had friends before, let alone relationships. People have complimented me for being confident when I talk to people, and for being a nice person, but that does not help when you are suicidal, but you have nowhere to turn.

People are happy to golf-clap me from a distance, but whenever you mention relationships, they can't even imagine it. I want to feel loved. Why is that so much to ask? 

I cannot relate when people say that you do not need human contact to be happy. I want love, not to feel at peace with being alone for the rest of my life. 

Right now, I am just done. I have so many unattractive physical problems, and with my Depression and suicidal thoughts, just going out and being confident, dressing cleanly or whatever is not going to make me worthy of interacting with others. 

I just feel poisonous. I need to work on myself before I can even look anyone in the eye. However, how the fuck are you supposed to develop your own self-esteem when you have no-one in your life outside of your family. I can't even relate to my family.
