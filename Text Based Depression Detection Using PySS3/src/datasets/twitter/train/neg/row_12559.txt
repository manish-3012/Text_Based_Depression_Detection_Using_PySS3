Therapy/medication don't help when you don't want to get better, and you just want to dieI've been going through intense therapy and using different antidepressants that are prescribed to me for 12 years now, but it's so true, that nobody can help you unless you want to get better, and I really just don't want to get better. I want this all to be over, I don't want to be happy and be on this earth. I mean, I've heard of people who spend their whole lives depressed and miserable. Did it ever really "get better" for them? Was them not killing themselves because suicide is a "permanent solution to a temporary problem" really worth it? Was there problem at all temporary? I think not, so while suicide might be that for some people, for a lot of people it's not a "temporary" problem, it's a lifelong problem that will not go away.
