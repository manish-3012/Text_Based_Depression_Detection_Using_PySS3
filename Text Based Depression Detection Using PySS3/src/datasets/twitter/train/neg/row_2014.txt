My boyfriend is suicidal and I have no idea what to doWe moved to different countries for university. We planned on breaking up but ended up staying in touch because we missed each other. The only contact we have now is IMs and occasional phone calls.

He's had bouts of depression and suicidal thoughts for a while now, but at least back then I could go to his place and hold him or if we weren't together I could, I don't know, call his parents or something.

I don't know what to do now. He's currently living with some family friends, but I've never met them. I don't know his new address. Part of me is starting to think that if living is so evidently painful for him, am I even in the right to stop him?

I feel like I'm doing this so wrong, trying to get him to see that his beliefs about himself are completely misguided and make no sense. But I'm deathly scared that if he doesn't have someone in his life to get him out of that cycle of thoughts, it's only going to get worse. I desperately just want him to at least try therapy.

He called a psychological counselling call-line type of thing, and when he told them that he doesn't really see a purpose in his life anymore the woman told him it's just a "teenage" issue. I went from being thrilled that he's trying to get help, to wanting to push a call centre employee off a bridge. He, on the other hand, was more or less unfazed. He insists that therapy would never help him.

His suicidal comments get more serious every time we talk about it. I feel cold sweat gathering on my back when he logs off after having a conversation.

I feel selfish for constantly trying to change his mind without a true understanding of the fact that he's in legitimate pain right now. I just want him to stay alive so fucking bad.
