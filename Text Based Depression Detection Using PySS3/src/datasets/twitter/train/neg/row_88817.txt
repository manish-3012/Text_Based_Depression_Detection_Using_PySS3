TiredSo I guess I'll post this.

I'm going to kill myself on the eve of my 27th birthday. I'll be spending it alone anyways, since I don't have any friends (I think, I don't know anymore) and I'm nowhere near family. The few friends I have, have found better friends or decided they no longer needed me because they no longer needed an emotional sponge.

I've been documenting my thoughts, playing through everything that's been happening and this just feels fitting. Nobody will miss me, nobody will care. And my pets will be in good hands.
