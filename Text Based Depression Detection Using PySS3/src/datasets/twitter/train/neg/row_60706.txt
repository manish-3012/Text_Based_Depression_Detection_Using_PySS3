Turning 21 in 5 days but i dont think ill make iti've battled self harm all my life. When i ran away from my father's house when i was 16 to live with my mom i vowed the cutting would stop. I've never cut my wrists because i never wanted to be caught or asked about it. i always had cut my thighs and legs. It was a stress relief when my dad abused me. I've had a boyfriend for 5 years now, my only friend, and things have been really bad between us and ive been severely depressed. I told him i want to hurt myself because i thought he would try to talk me out of it or anything at all knowing my past but he didnt. all he said was "dont say that to loud or someone will hear you". He then left. I seriously dont know what im going to do. I just got done cutting and it didnt help, im still in a panic. I dont know what im going to do.
