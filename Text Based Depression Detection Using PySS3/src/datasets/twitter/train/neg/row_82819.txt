G g g goodbyeI'm gonna do it and I hope I don't fuck it up. Here's all anyone should know about me 

I was happy once, we didn't want to get married but we might as well have been.

I never knew my dad.

I grew up pore and my family doesn't talk.

I'm half Sioux Indian and I've lived on the res.

I was never good at taking about my problems and I've suffered from it.
