Okay yeah I'm almost doneThe next fucking horrible thing that happens in my life I'm done. That's it. I can't mentally deal with anything else that happens to me. My life was ruined by my own thoughts, it's all my fucking fault. If I got just a little bit of encouragement I could be able to end it right now, but sadly I can't get it over with. This is all my fault it wouldn't be happening if it wasn't for me. I did this to myself and I deserve to pay the price. I'm not living my life taking happy pills like this. Honestly if there's anyone out there that would like to encourage me to do it please go ahead.
