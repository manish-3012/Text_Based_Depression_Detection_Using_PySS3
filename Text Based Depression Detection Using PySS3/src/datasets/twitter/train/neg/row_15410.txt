Shopping to distract myselfI feel so fucking miserable. I canâ€™t sleep at night and stay up looking for things to buy to make me happy. Iâ€™m so fucking stressed with school and working 2 jobs. Thereâ€™s lack of support but high expectations from my parents. I feel like screaming and crying all the fucking time. I feel so over worked but no one cares because â€œweâ€™re all tired not just youâ€. I feel like Iâ€™m not allowed to feel sad or angry and my family just gets mad at me without even trying to acknowledge my feelings. My family and boyfriend are writing me off as over emotional and shopping is the only thing keeping me happy. Sometimes I just hurt myself because I feel like Iâ€™m just a fucking burden to everyone but buying expensive bags or clothes makes me feel loved even if itâ€™s just me loving myself.
