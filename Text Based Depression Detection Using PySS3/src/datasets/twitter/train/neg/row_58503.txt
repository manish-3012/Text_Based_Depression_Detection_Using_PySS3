ready to end iti have nothing to live for. there's one person on this planet i care about and he doesn't give a flying fuck about me. i live in a huge city thousands of miles away from anyone i know. i spend every single day working my ass off at school so that one day i'll get a job that will make someone think i'm cool enough to go out with. but that won't actually happen because no one would want to go out with someone like me, or even spend five minutes around me if they didn't have to. i've never had any serious meaningful relationship with anyone, romantic or otherwise. i can do pretty much whatever i want but i don't want to do anything but not be alive anymore. i'm fairly talented, i'm pretty good looking, i'm well educated, i've traveled the world, seen lots of "cool" things, had a comfortable life, etc etc. but the only thing in the world i want is for someone i care about to care about me even half as much as i care about them. and that's never going to happen. so what's the point?
