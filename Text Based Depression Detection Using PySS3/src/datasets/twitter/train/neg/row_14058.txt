The only reason that is making dont want to suicide is because it's a sin in my religionI know life is not to be always happy but since i was in 7th grade and i am fucked up my friends left to another school my family barely care about only if they need something other than that they barely know my and they make fun of me when i tell them about how i feel saying ( you are not a child anymore care about yourself ) every time i go to a job i stay for a couple weeks because when i say an opinion about anything they reply with ( a child will learn me my job ) i don't have a partner the school i wanted to attend didn't accept me because of a 10 fucking marks diffrence a 10 marks that made me enter a stupid school with barely anyone who thinks like me even people in the streets and my teachers blame me beacuse ( i am a boy with long hair ) or ( you look like a child ) so fucking racist all of this because i live in Egypt a stupid country who only cares about sex and how you look like them if you are different then you should kill yourself and i'm not joking my teacher said that to me once that i should kill myself because i asked him to repeat something in class . Help please
