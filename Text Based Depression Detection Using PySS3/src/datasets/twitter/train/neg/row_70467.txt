Life after psychosis.I'm not sure how to go on living after having a 6+ month experience being in psychosis. I don't think the same any more. I am less functional. When I was in mania/psychosis I just lived, I didn't question what I was doing I just went on a whim as to what to do next. I spent 6+ months basically homeless driving up and down Northern California and I was never scared or anxious I was just high. Once the mania/psychosis finally began to wane I became horribly anxious, couldn't go to the store, leave the hotel I was staying in, and became very suicidal. After a few months and getting back on medication I was able to regain some stability. Now I've been employed for about a year but I am completely miserable and no longer function like I was able to prior to the psychosis. I have constant suicidal ideation, have major depressive episodes, I'm treatment resistant. I've gone back to therapy, tried 4 different medications, see a counselor, secured mental-health housing but I'm utterly miserable. I feel like I am just waiting to die and nothing ever changes. Things just get worse and all of this after spending 3 months in jail, you'd think being free would help me feel better, but no I still contemplate ending my life daily. I just hate what it would do to my family, but I am so miserable it effects my work, my day to day motivation. I'm sick and there is no cure.
