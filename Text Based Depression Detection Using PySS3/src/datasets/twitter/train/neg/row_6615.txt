A speeding endIs there anyway I can end this. I just need this life to get better. Iâ€™m a speeding train chasing after my goals but I dont know if there is anything over the horizon. I want to pull the plug. I wanna jump off one of the highest buildings in this campus and feel my body crush against the stone cold pavement.
