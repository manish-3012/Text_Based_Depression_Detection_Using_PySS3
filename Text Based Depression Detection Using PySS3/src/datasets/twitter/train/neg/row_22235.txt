Loneliness and nihilism making me suicidal.My loneliness has been leading to anger, which has led to sadness/depression, and now thoughts of suicide. 

Albeit I'm relatively young, any relationship I have tried before has failed. But, I want one - though every time I attempt one they fail. I have friends in *that* sense either, so I'm grasping for something that's not even there. 

I don't see why I shouldn't die. "It's a permanent answer to a temporary problem", but what if the problem is permanent? Or what if the problem is everything about you? Or what if the problem is the fact that you just want to leave because everyone else despises you? 

17 years of getting lied to, hated, failed relationships, and ignored. I don't know if I actually *want* to kill myself, I just question the value in existing. 

"Don't end your life, you're young and you can still do things and work toward the stuff you want."

Except that I have the anger, and the dissent toward everyone around me. Those I don't want flock to me, and only anger and sadden me more. Those I want couldn't be farther away. 

I hate pity and have an ego, but I don't see the point in trying to maintain something that nobody else besides myself wants to take value in. 

I'm young, so if I end it here, I won't have to worry about what's ahead, like more failed relationships, sadness, loneliness, anger, and liars. It just ends.

I do it, I go away, I'm a talking point for a few weeks at home and in the school, and by October I'm forgotten. It's logical.

Therapy and "help" is embarrassing and expensive. I'd be ruined if I vented to anyone. Forced in some hospital for "help" I don't even consent to. It's not worth the burden.
