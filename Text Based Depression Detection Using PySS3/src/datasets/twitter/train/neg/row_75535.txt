I'm gonna do it tomorrow.Just in case someone I know in real life finds this, I love you. I always did. even if I don't show it. I'm just really depressed. so sad. I'm too caught up in the terrible thought patterns in my head. I couldn't take it. I'm not sorry though...this is my decision. I hope you all will get over this. assuming you need to in the first place. 

I'm in a better place. Heaven, hell, nothing. whatever my fate is, it's better than here. It has to be. Nothing has brought a smile to my face truly in years. I'm so sick of the rat race. I'm so sick of it all. I'm sick of this empty feeling in my stomach...I know none of you will give a damn. And honestly that has made my decision easier. 



remember me as the guy who wanted to be somebody. the guy who had a dream.

I wish you all good luck in your individual endeavors.
