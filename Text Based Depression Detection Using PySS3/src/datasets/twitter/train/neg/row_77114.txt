I'm $80,000 in debtAnd I don't have an income

Or friends. 

I feel so completely alone and my panic attacks keep me from making any kind of meaningful changes, but I can't even support myself right now. 

I've tried to kill myself before and am probably going to do it again, only probably this time I won't suck at it. 

I didn't have anyone else to say this to, so now you guys know.
