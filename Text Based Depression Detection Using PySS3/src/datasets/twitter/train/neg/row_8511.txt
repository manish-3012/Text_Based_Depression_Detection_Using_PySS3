ADHD/PTSD and SuicideI've spent my whole life feeling guilty.

&amp;#x200B;

I treated my parents bad. Treat them bad. Snap. Scream. Get frustrated. The ADHD doesn't allow patience. The PTSD reminds me of every meltdown I had. I get angry. I want to scream. Why didn't they notice? Why did I have to suffer? Why did I have to be a coward?   


I went to a therapist 

she just says 'you're smart! You'll get through it! this is a bad world we live in'. No, that doesn't help. It makes me angrier. I want out. Tell me how to get out.

&amp;#x200B;

My partner screams at me today, he says, "You don't listen! You don't ask about my day!" and my work, my work keeps screaming 'do this do that!' and screaming when I ask for pay. They always scream. my roomie screams to pay attention to him. my parents scream about the house. they're not screams. they're just coments. but they always feel like screaming to me. 

&amp;#x200B;

i have never felt guilt free. the second i feel free, i feel bad. no one will ever leave me be until i'm dead or they are, and no one is counting on me.

i was supposed to save everyone in my life

&amp;#x200B;

everyone will die because of me. i wasn't good enough. i didn't work hard enoguh. i didn't do the right thing. i didn't settle for the good guys. i didn't pay attention in clas. i didn't take meds years ago. i didn't breath the right air, take care of my body, stay away from alcohol and weed, do allt he good girl things 

&amp;#x200B;

i will die tonight 

probably 

we'll see.

unfortunately i don't want to risk giving my parents coronavirus  
so i guess it'll have to wait until this miserable pandemic is over 

but guys i don't think I can take this anymore   
the guilt   
the failures   
everything I do 

everything I am 

is a fucking mosnter of a mistake.
