Been here beforeI've battled depression for a long time. So long I can't really remember anything else. For a while I could distract myself from it and I thought that was working. It wasn't. I feel like I have failed at everything. I was such a screw up as a kid that now I'm pushing 40 and I don't see anyway to fix things. My job is not a career. No relationship. Even friends don't talk to me anymore unless I contact them. I don't see anyone close to me that I can talk to about this and things just keep sinking deeper. I nearly committed suicide years ago, and was only saved by pure chance. I don't know how to get off this path. Every option I have tried has ended in failure and further depression. I don't think I can attempt much more without breaking. I just need something to know there is other stuff in life besides this but I haven't found it.
