I suck, and I'm alone.I just finished my second to last semester of college.  I'm on break now.  I wake up at dark and do nothing all day cause I got nowhere to be, and no one to be with.  Literally all I want are the basic needs that everyone else my age already has - friends, a girlfriend, and a job.  I got none of those, and I'm really starting to think that I'm going to end up dying alone.  I'm a fucking senior in college who has little to no friends or work experience, and has never really been in a true relationship with anyone.  The only "relationship" I was in ended up with the bitch stabbing me in the back, telling me to kill myself, and then bailing on me after my friend died.  I'm pathetic. Don't tell me it gets easier.  Don't tell me to stop comparing myself to others.  It's impossible not to.  The holiday season only makes me feel worse, cause I know everyone else is spending time with someone they love and care about.  I'd prefer to see them miserable and alone because it makes me (a piece of shit) feel less alone.  God... is it too much to ask to have someone to love who loves me back?  Can I have just one friend to go out with so I can feel like less of a loser?  Can just one of these bullshit employers just give me a god damn interview?
