Been suicidal for many yearsI have something wrong with me. A personality disorder. But also Iâ€™ve just suffered too many losses and heartbreaks. 
Mostly my own fault. This is a low quality post lol! I just have a sad life and it doesnâ€™t get better itâ€™s getting worse at lightning speed. There is this guy I met in a unusual way and I let myself get very attached and since that ended I havenâ€™t been the same. I donâ€™t want to meet anyone else. I donâ€™t want to be lonely and old the rest of my life by myself. So Iâ€™ve decided to forget him and all the failings of my life by ending my life soon.
