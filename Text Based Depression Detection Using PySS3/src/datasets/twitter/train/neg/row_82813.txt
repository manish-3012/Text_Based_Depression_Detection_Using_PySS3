Britain.Sorry in advance if this is a bit fragmented. I'm not entirely sure how to say everything I want to say yet so it may be awkward to read.


So, over the past year or so I've been fairly intensely suicidal. I'm lucky that I have parents that keep me active because it gives me moments throughout the day when my head is free of any kind of suicidal thoughts. It's almost like how I heard mood swings described before becoming a teenager; every couple of hours I'll get a shift in mood, between "I'm feeling ok at the moment" to "I really just need to find some easy way to go".

This brings me onto the title. I think most days about how fortunate/unfortunate it is about the illegality of guns in Britain. When I'm feeling ok, I'm glad that there are no guns, because I know without a shadow of a doubt that if my family owned a gun I would have committed suicide just over 6 months ago. When I'm not feeling so good, it feels disappointing that there are no guns. They seem like such an easy way to go. One well placed shot and you die, virtually painlessly.

I know I really should look to getting help, but no matter how much I try and convince myself that I should, I can't bring myself to explain the problem to my parents or anyone else I know. I always seem to be feeling ok as soon as I go to explain it, and then I feel that maybe what I was feeling wasn't so bad, and it's nothing I should be complaining about. Even as I'm writing this it feels as though I shouldn't be complaining because what I'm going through can't be that bad. 


I should probably have thought of a more appropriate title, as this one is barely relevant to the post, but I really can't think of a better one.
