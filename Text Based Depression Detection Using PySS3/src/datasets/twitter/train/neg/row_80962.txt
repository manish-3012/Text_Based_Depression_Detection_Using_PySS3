Was thinking about ending it, things went from bad to worse. Now i'm not to sure. Is this right?I'm not going too going to detail about myself, but most of my life, if struggled with a crippling drug addiction, every day, i feel on the verge of a relapse, i feel like a burden to those around me. 

If i wanted to i have means at my disposal. I have had little to no support from anyone. I tried therapy, but that only made things worse.

The only person who has ever had a positive impact only my life told me i was worthless to her and that she was using me. I've got no one to turn too, no one would miss me, are these feelings right? I just wanted something to go proper with my life, nut everyone around me claims that "i am the root of their problems" and that i'd be better off dead. I just don't know if it's right, or morally reprehensible, i mean it's not like anyone would really give a shit.
