Up and down constantlyEveryday is the same. A never ending cycle of happiness and elation to sadness and anxiety. Nothing to explain either state, just the feeling. Itâ€™s painful.

Looking at my life thereâ€™s plenty to feel happy about, a good job, friends, decent financial standing, but despite that Iâ€™m constantly anxious about all those and more. Am I good at my job? Can I succeed? Am I annoying to my coworkers? Do my friends really care or do they just pity me? Is it worthwhile even having me about? What if I run out of money? How can I live?

Today is supposed to be a day I can spend happy and with family and yet despite that Iâ€™ve decided to spend the end of the day isolated and alone in my room. I went for a walk, but just ended up crying walking down the street.

I feel weak. There are people in worse situations than mine and I should just pull my chin up and push through... but I canâ€™t. It hurts too much. 

The only thing stopping me from ending it right now is the financial burden that not having me around would put on my mum and dad. If it werenâ€™t for that I donâ€™t think I could make it much longer.

Iâ€™m sorry for posting this but I had to say it somewhere. Otherwise Iâ€™d just try to continue to ignore how Iâ€™m feeling.
