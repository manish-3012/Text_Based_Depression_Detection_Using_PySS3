Iâ€™m gonna end it soon I fuck everything up for me and my friends. i know they hate me but i talk to them to keep myself from being lonely. I have maybe 2 people that i will miss but i know they wonâ€™t miss me. iâ€™m so fucking desperate. I have one person that iâ€™ve been interested in for awhile tell me that they love me. then they go and date someone else. iâ€™m just a fucking outcast that needs to be dealt with. iâ€™m a useless and pathetic human being with no direction. iâ€™m a disappointment to my family also. iâ€™ve failed all expectations for them. i canâ€™t do anything right. iâ€™m a useless wreck. i canâ€™t take it anymore. everything hurts to think about. it hurts to feel. every emotion no matter how hard i try to change it is negative. iâ€™m going to end it. iâ€™m just a useless piece of trash. honestly i would do it right now if i could. i canâ€™t wait to die. itâ€™s the one thing i look forward to anymore. the only thing that keeps me through the day is thinking about the day i can die and escape all the pain.
