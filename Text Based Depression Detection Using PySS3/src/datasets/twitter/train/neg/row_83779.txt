I think if I woke up one day happy and no longer suicidal, I'd probably die of a massive heart attack from the shock.(48M) I've dealt with depression and suicidal thoughts for probably \~35 years now.  I've been on pretty much all the different meds, had 2 rounds of TMS (30 sessions each), and have had therapy.  Nothing has made me feel any better.

I don't remember any other way to feel but sad, hopeless and suicidal.  I don't know how much longer I can keep going on.
