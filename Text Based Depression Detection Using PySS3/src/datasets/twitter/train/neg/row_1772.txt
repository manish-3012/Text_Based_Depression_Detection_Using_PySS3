Iâ€™m just done with myself...I seriously fucking hate myself. I donâ€™t even know what to do anymore. It feels like Iâ€™m just a ticking time bomb. Each day is just one step closer to the day I finally do it, and make sure that it works. There are so many ways I could do it. It would all be over in a split second. Iâ€™d make sure it works. Maybe like what, three people will show up to my funeral? Thatâ€™s probably being generous.

At least I know it wonâ€™t really matter once Iâ€™m gone.
