I just want to dieI have no reason to live. I'm the embodiment of an utter waste of life. I'm just so pathetic, ugly and disgusting. I've tried to stay positive for a long time but I don't deserve this life. I have no purpose and I'm all alone. Whatever I have in life doesn't matter at all. I wish I could die quickly and not think about anything
