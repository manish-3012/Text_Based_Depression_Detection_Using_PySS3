I drank until I lost consciousness last night with no intention of waking up.I was just so desolate and miserable last night. I continuously drank straight Kraken on a whim until I couldn't stay up just hoping I wouldn't see today. I'm going through a lot of shit. Shit that's been plaguing me most of my adult life. The people that raised me are all dead or moved away. Friendships are fleeting and a relationship is impossible. The love of my life doesn't love me back and no one else compares. I've been severely depressed for nearly 20 years and I have no motivation to help myself. I started self-harming recently and that helps my mind some but doesn't do my body any favors.

I had a bad day Thursday and when I have a bad day, it takes me about a week to get over it. It gets worse before it gets better and like a wound, the danger ends up being the infection over the wound itself. I remember waking up on my keyboard and at some point I moved to the living room while waiting for a text from the girl mentioned before and didn't wake up until morning. I don't drink a lot normally so that without any food made my tolerance pretty low. I'm not really sure why I'm putting this here. I don't expect help nor do I want advice. I had a stupid moment and just wanted to share I guess. It's easy for me to accept death these days because I look at it like, I could die now or I could die later. The only difference is age. That's how it will end no matter what and I'm only getting older every day.
