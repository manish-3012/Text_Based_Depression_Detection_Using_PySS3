There's nothing left I want that I can haveI just wanted a simple life. Just a husband and a house. A lowkey job. But apparently that was too much to ask. I'm 25, past it, can't get a job because I have no skills. Can't find a partner because I'm so ugly. No one wants me here. I'm just a burden on my family. I think even my 'friends' hate me. Why am I still here? I've tried. I really have. I gave it my best shot. But it wasn't enough. I was never enough for anyone. Sorry for existing.
