What happens to the lazy peopleCurrently in university but grades are dropping by the day. Got a 15% on my last test because I spent the weekend before on molly to try and forget everything else in my life. Not doing homework anymore and skipping class most of the time. Stopped talking to the few people I still see. Iâ€™m gonna go home this summer and Iâ€™m never gonna go back to college. Iâ€™m too lazy to do any homework, Iâ€™m too lazy to try and get help, the only thing I can do is listen to 24/7 lofi radio and look at r/depression or this sub. Wish I had more drugs to do so I could escape all of this. Iâ€™m just gonna drop out of college once this quarter is over and work a minimum wage job. You canâ€™t even live off of a minimum wage job anymore these days so I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™ll do then. Maybe Iâ€™ll finally be able to get rid of myself. If I had money Iâ€™d be happy just living by myself in a decent place and smoking weed and playing video games all day. But I donâ€™t have money. So I canâ€™t get drugs or video games. I wish I could just off myself right now but I donâ€™t have the balls.
