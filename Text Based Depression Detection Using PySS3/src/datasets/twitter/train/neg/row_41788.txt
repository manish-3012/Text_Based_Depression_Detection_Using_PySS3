Today is my birthday. never wanted to die more than today. I only keep working so my parents will be able to pay for my funeralHey everyone. Today I turned 23. Gotta externalize some shit

Iâ€™m very depressed because Iâ€™m trans and Iâ€™ll never pass as a female. Iâ€™m burly and masculine. I also live in an intolerant family and culture. Realizing Iâ€™m trans was the worst thing thatâ€™s ever happened to me. After the initial euphoria of realizing about a year ago Iâ€™ve been so hopeless. Being trans is a fucking curse

Iâ€™ve resigned myself to the fact that I will never be happy without a lot more money or the existence of magic so I can pass as a woman. Although I havenâ€™t decided when I will kill myself, I know when Iâ€™m eventually on an emotional upswing, Iâ€™ll finally have the energy to actually do it. Donâ€™t know when exactly.

I have a job but the only thing that motivates me to work is the fact that when I kill myself this year my parents will have to pay for my casket/burial somehow... theyâ€™ll be able to use my savings hopefully.  

Iâ€™m just lying in my bed right now periodically punching myself in the forehead and wishing someone would break into my house and murder me so my parents wouldnâ€™t have to deal with the fact that I killed myself. Itâ€™s been so long since I showered. Happy birthday me
