At peace with suicideI'm at peace with the fact I will kill myself soon. No one can stop me. 

No beds available on a psych ward. Only 3 nights at a house place but then I'd have to return here. 

The only thing that would stop me for awhile would be having my own place but I can't afford the places available for long so it will just add stress. I don't plan on being alive for the new year. In fact I was going to do it tonight but my migraine is so bad I can't do it.

I have doctors tomorrow but like I said, no beds available so he can't even stop me. Nothing can stop me. I'm beyond help.
