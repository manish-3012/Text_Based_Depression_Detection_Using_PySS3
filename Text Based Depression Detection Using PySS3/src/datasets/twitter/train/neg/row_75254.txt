I really must be beyond hope or something...I'm sorry. This is the second post I'll have made here in about three days, and I'm not sure if I should be taking a hint from [last time around](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/diowe/it_doesnt_seem_like_anything_is_going_to_work/) that I'm not worth advice or that I'm truly beyond repair. Maybe I just end up feeling depressed enough to post at the wrong times of the day.

I feel somewhat desperate, though, so I've posted again. I've been spinning out of control even more than normal since the car got stolen Friday afternoon, but even before then I've just been hopeless and helpless. My father and a few others every so often get frustrated and conclude, "I don't understand. You must not want enough to get better." Even knowing that I need to earn money (particularly if I'm ever going to replace these important possessions, but I needed to start pulling some financial weight regardless) isn't enough to shake me out of my constant depressive paralysis. I just can't do it. I ran into problems at the wrong times in my life, and even at 19 right now I'll never be able to recover enough at this rate to have a life worth living. I find existence sadly impractical.
