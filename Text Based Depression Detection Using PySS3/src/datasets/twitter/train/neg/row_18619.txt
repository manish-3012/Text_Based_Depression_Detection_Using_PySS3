I don't want to leave my dog behind, but I've given up hope completely.What do you do with your dog? I love him to pieces but it is obvious that I am no good for either of us. 
Before you start telling me I shouldn't do it, just dont. I've tried hard to get help out of the abusive situation that I am in, and I am constantly told one thing by people and then let down. Im tired of being lied to. People urged me to make a GoFundMe, so they could put money in it. I made it, as embarrassing as it was, and only one person who urged me to do it even donated. The rest just completely ignored it and talked shit behind my back about how pathetic I am. No one cares. They won't care until I'm dead. Then they'll be stuck with my funeral bill, which is more than I needed to get out of here in the first place. I'm just done trying to fight to make it, if no one cares anyway.
