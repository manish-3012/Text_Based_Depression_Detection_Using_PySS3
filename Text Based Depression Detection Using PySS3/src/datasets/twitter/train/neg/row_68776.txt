this is pointlessI don't think that anyone is a shittier person than I am, or has ever felt lower than I do right now. I do not deserve to live or to be loved. It will not get better and nothing will ever make me happy.
I just do not want to attempt again, fail, and end up in the mental hospital like I did a few months ago.
So I'm stuck here, for now.
