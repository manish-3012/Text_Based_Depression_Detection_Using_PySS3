It will be the only way. They won't understand until I'm gone.15 years ago, I made terrible choices. 
They've recently resurfaced in my mind and at my current age (31) I am more aware of the weight of the and damage those decisions have.  

Bittersweetly, I live in a town where various pills are easy to come by and getting alcohol isnt s problem at all. When the time comes, that's the  exit plan. 

One of my issues is do I wait until shit hits the fan or bow out sooner so that way my family isnt embarrassed by my terrible god awful choices.
I don't want to do it. 
Thinking of how many people would be hurt makes it worse. It's not like no one cares but if they knew what I did...I doubt any would associate with me and be ashamed to have known me. 
I'll HAVE to do it. There is no other way.
I've planned on writing a letter to my sister explaining everything. 

I cant go to a professional because I've read up on things and I'm pretty sure they'd have to report me to some authority. 

I'm torn up also because I want to reach out to the people behind some of these posts and try to be there for them but how can i when I've planned my way out. Wouldnt it be hypocritical of me?

I kind of wish I could hold someone's hand as I go, maybe as they're going too. I know that's fucked up. 

I don't deserve anyone's compassion, pity, or remorse. I'm not a victim. I was the monster. 

I dont want to do it. 
I cry at the thought. 
But there is No. Other. Way.
All that's left is...when.
