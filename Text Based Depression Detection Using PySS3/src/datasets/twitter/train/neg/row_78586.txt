I'm having a depressive episode and I want to dieSo many things have gone wrong in my life, but I generally have a good life now, apart from my depression. I'm not on medication because I take pleasure in some things, but sometime she I have these episodes of serious depression, usually triggered by something. Well tonight it is because,for the first time in my 17 year of life, my father has refused to hug me goodnight. He was away for almost all of my childhood until I was 12, and I've always softness of subconsciously wanted to make him happy I guess, and I've always tried to make his life easier. Tonight I came out to him as bisexual, and I tried to give him a hug goodnight to try and make the night have a good happy ending, burn he didn't believe hug me back. I could tell he didn't but want to touch me or be near me and I feel awful. I don't feel loved by him anymore, I feel like I should just go kill myself, I mean what's the point right if I can't get the person I've tried to make happy for the past five year to love and accept me, I want to die
