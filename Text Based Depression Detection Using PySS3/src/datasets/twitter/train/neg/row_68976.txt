I donâ€™t think iâ€™m depressed but i feel worthless?This year has fucking sucked. I am 21, in college, living with my parents. I feel worthless, pathetic, when my parents ask me to do things, i have no drive to do them. 
I have drive to finish college and get a good job and Start a career with computers and I enjoy streaming games and stuff. But everyone seems to see that itâ€™s a waste of time. 

I lost my job, I donâ€™t have a lot of friends, My girlfriend has bad anxiety, I try to help her as much as i can and I always stay positive with others. But when it comes to myself, I canâ€™t be positive, I canâ€™t see any good in me. I donâ€™t do stuff around the house to help my parents, I donâ€™t do anything. I try to create something, it just gets shuts down. Idk I might be ranting iâ€™m just so sad.

Everyday seems so hard to stay positive and stay motivated.
