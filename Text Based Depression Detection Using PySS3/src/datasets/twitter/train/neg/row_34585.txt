It's just getting a lot harder and I'm worried.Hello people. Last spring semester of university I was withdrawn with a medical withdrawal due to depression and serious consideration of suicide. I moved home and after the summer enrolled in my hometown's university. As the last two semesters have passed, I've felt myself slowly slipping back into my depression. I thought I was better, damn it. I know that sounds silly to think I got over it so quickly, but I really fucking did. Things are going all right for me. I'm lined up to transfer back to the university I was originally at for this Fall semester. I'm going to have a decent GPA this semester. My family dynamic is still really fucked, but I've got a decent support system. I still want to die, though, and I've thought about exactly how I'd do it. I'm the only one home this week, due to finals. I have work tomorrow in the afternoon. I could do the old hose/exhaust thing in my truck tomorrow after my family leaves, and my family would find me when they got home around six pm. Maybe I'll drive to this secluded wooded area I know within a mile or two from my home and do it there, so my family doesn't discover me. I don't really like them, but I don't think I should fuck them up with my stuff. It just hurts. I don't even know why it hurts. But yeah, to wrap this up, apologies for the ramble. I may or may not kill myself tomorrow. We'll see.
