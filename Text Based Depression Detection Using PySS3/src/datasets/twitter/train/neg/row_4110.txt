i need a reason to stay.i really donâ€™t see a full on reason anymore. 

i have nothing. 

i lost an amazing person, i canâ€™t pay for my car, i donâ€™t make enough money at work, i donâ€™t have anyone to turn to for help, my relationships never work out because of me, iâ€™m almost failing in school. 

but whats reason to stay, whatâ€™s my purpose?
