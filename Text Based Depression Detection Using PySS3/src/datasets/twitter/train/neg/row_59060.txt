DamnMy life and by proxy my family's lives are in bad shape because of me. My sister died of cancer I knew it hurt but I didn't know how profoundly it effected me. I quit my job for a reason I can't explain I have had trouble finding a new one but finally I did it's not as good but a job. That is not changing the fact that my family can barely get enough to eat and may lose our home. I haven't been paid yet my bank account is in negative and until it goes positive I can't even withdraw what was deposited. We are running out of everything. I have been thinking about killing myself for awhile and was almost there when my son attempted it I had changed and quit thinking about it for a bit to help him but those feelings didn't go away just went to a back burner as he gets in better shape the thoughts and planning is getting stronger and gain I cannot keep the up. I want to be there for my family but I am getting close to just doing it they really will be better off without me I can seem to fuck up a wet dream I have my bottle of whiskey and my xanax I want this struggle to just survive to end because if I can't live just survive I don't want to be here this is not what my family deserves. They may miss me for a bit but at least I won't keep fucking up there lives any longer damn living sucks so bad
