I'm sorryI can't even type this, I just hope nobody gets mad at me for this. 

I'm always crying, I've locked my room and haven't gone out for 6 days, my friends are all gone, my family hates me, and all I can think of are suicidal thoughts. I've needed a hug for around two years now, I really didn't need to be cut off with this quarantine, I've never felt so alone. My life ended a while ago, I'm sorry for being so annoying, I hope you all live full, happy lives and that all your hopes come true.

I wish I could give hugs to all of those who have situations like mine.
