I just donâ€™t know what to do anymoreEverything in my life is being taken away from me. My grandparents are going to die probably when I graduate and Iâ€™ll be left alone. My parents health isnâ€™t the best and they probably wonâ€™t be alive when Iâ€™m 40. 

I have a syndrome called PCOS and it gives me a number of symptoms that make me ugly and disgusting, and raise my risk for other diseases. Iâ€™m a girl and my hairline is thinning, Iâ€™ve got excessive body hair and I have a terrible body shape. No guy is ever going to love me. Iâ€™ll lose my family and Iâ€™ll just be alone trying to deal with problems that I canâ€™t even fix. I just want to die. I have no desire to be alive. Iâ€™m worthless and ugly. I have no talents or interests. Iâ€™m not good at anything. 

I used to the prettiest most happy girl. Now my hair is thinning when Iâ€™m 15 and I look disgusting and thereâ€™s nothing I can do about it because my mother refuses to take me to the hospital to get help with pcos. 

Fuck this. Iâ€™m tired of living with myself and Iâ€™m tired of looking like this. I wish I was a normal girl. I wish I was good at something. I wish I didnâ€™t have to lose people. I wish I was the girl I was 5 years ago. I never asked to be perfect but I would have liked to at least be normal and healthy. I donâ€™t have any plans because Iâ€™m not planning on living after high school. Thereâ€™s no point. I wonâ€™t find a guy who loves me. I wonâ€™t find something Iâ€™ll enjoy doing. Iâ€™ll be alone with no family or friends. 

Why do things have to be this way? Why did I have to grow up to become like this? Why did I have to grow up to be so ugly? Iâ€™d rather kill my self than live like this. I graduate in two years. Iâ€™ll probably kill myself after. I canâ€™t live like this anymore.
