I just wanna ventSo I was having issues but then I deleted the post because of feeling embarrassed I guess. I'm not gonna talk about those problems but I will say that I've been having intrusive thoughts for the past few day that have been making me really angry and I just want to feel like people are trying to understand me. It's really hard to deal with when people talk to you in a way that's demeaning to you and it pretty much haunts me even years after it's happened. Probably because it's happened way too much to me and so I'm finally sick of it and really angry. I get suicidal thoughts because of this. I want to use this anger to try and make things better for other people who might be experiencing the same thing I am. That would really help me with my suicidal thoughts.
