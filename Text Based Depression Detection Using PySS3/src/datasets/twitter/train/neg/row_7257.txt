Constantly thinking about suicide, nothing to live for etcLately I've been experiencing more and more suicidal thoughts, I cry all the time and worry about everything. I feel like I have nothing going for me in my life and that the better years are behind me. 
I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety when I was 17 (I'm now 25), and have been on fluoxetine on and off, and on various doses, since then. On valentine's Day this year I was put on Zoloft after finally going back to the doctors. I have had CBT and counseling in the past but just nothing seems to work and it's all too much for me to cope with. 
I've spent the majority of today researching suicide methods because I just can't cope anymore. 
I'm sorry for posting but I just don't know what to do.
