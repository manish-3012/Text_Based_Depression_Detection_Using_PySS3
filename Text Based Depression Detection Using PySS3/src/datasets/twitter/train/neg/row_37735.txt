Comforting Thoughts?This is a trigger warning for suicidal thoughts. You were warned. 


I find that I'm often comforted with thoughts of suicide - I mean say I'm very angry or upset (work gaslit me today because I expressed fear of being assaulted which has happened on their property) anyway I started thinking about ways to kill myself, how it would feel and what I'd say and it calmed down my anger. I felt so safe and comforted by the idea I could just go die, and I wanted to know if anyone has experienced anything similar. 


Thanks for reading.
