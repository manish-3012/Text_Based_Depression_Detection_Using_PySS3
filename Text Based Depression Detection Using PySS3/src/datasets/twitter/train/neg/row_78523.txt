Idk if I can do this anymore.Family angers me, friends arenâ€™t such friends anymore, even the ones that I considered brothers, still heartbroken by the same bitch for over a year now, isolation and loneliness are my biggest fears and my â€œbest friendsâ€ go out and do shit without me and get mad at me when I told them I felt abandoned, Iâ€™m probably never gonna get a job, already attempted multiple times but Iâ€™m sure Iâ€™ll kick the bucket this time, therapist and antidepressants donâ€™t work, nothing is worth living for, Iâ€™m at a creative block with music and fashion, and my best friends are musicians and have been getting success in the underground lately, and I know itâ€™s because Iâ€™m not in the way to fuck shit up. I canâ€™t do this no more.
