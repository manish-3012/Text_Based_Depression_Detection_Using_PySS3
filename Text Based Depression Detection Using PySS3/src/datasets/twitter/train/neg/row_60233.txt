I Just Need To Let Some Things OutYou know it's really fucking sad that I can't even muster the effort to talk about the actual issues anymore. Just gonna type some things and make the best of it.

My family has stopped listening. As long as I'm alive they're happy. I'm almost 40. This hasn't went away in 30 years. It's never going to get better, but fuck me if they have to be sad for a minute. I've been doing this alone my entire life.

I haven't even semi-romantically held someone's hand since 2007. I forget what it feels like to be cared about. I don't taste anything anymore. I don't like anything anymore. I run everyone off. Everything seems to have lost its vibrancy. I don't see colors like I used to. It's just all a messy haze.

My friends are too busy living normal lives to drag me along anymore. They have kids graduating high school that have progressed further than I have. I know they don't want me around anymore. I don't blame them.

I've been in the system and have the outstanding bills to show for it. I can't get anyone to fucking just help me. Just go to a social security office to help me file paperwork. Help me figure out how to file the shit at least so I can get a lawyer to help me fight the rejection. I might actually want to eat when the last three people who put up with me are gone. Fucking hang out with me and not ask me to fix your phone then bounce. No I don't want to read your damn bible. Thanks therapist I'm sure that worked for your magical mystery other clients. Thanks doc for the meds that make my hair fall out and my dick limp. The last scrip that made me hallucinate was my favorite.

This is just the worst. This complete hopelessness. I don't know what I'm doing, and it's not getting any easier.

There is no help.

I wish I could make them see that if I were gone they wouldn't have to deal with my bullshit anymore. It'd be so much better long term.

I'm convinced they just keep me alive to satisfy their own agendas. I don't even get calls from my brother anymore to make plans. He calls my mother and asks her to bring me to group shit. I only live here because my last suicide attempt failed and I lost everything after being hospitalized. I've been taking care of her through two knee surgeries this year. After six months of full time help mixed with my already bad work history I'm now totally unemployable in this area. I can't even press auto parts and just wait to die. Fuck me for helping someone.

I'm so far detached from reality at this point I'm almost convinced that none of this is real. That I'm already dead and this is hell. There's no way this is my life. Ten year old me didn't want this. I wanted to be a veterinarian. I wanted to get married and have kids and host the family reunions. I wanted to be a fucking ***superhero***.

I know no one out there in the world gives two shits. I'm not stupid. I don't care about help lines or hands up. I just want someone out there to hear me. Just know that my shit is a mess, and I only know one last way to handle it. When it gets too deep sometimes ***you just fucking drown.***
