I made the wrong choice and can't fix itI screwed up college and made the wrong choice of degree. Full ride and I fucked it up. I believed in the 'follow your dreams' bullshit. I thought I could handle the 'take a bullshit job until you make it as an artist' lifestyle.

I realize now that I can't. I don't want to give up entirely, but now I have nothing practical to back it up. And since I wasted my education, I have no way to gain that practical job. 

So I'm screwed and I just want to die because I hate this life.
