no one caresive been trying so hard to be happy. ive been trying to get out of my head and talk to new people and try new things but i cant. the thought of leaving my room makes me feel sick. my mom hasnt talked to me in weeks but a couple days ago she came into my room, drunk off her ass, tore my posters off of my wall because they were "vulgar" but they were hand drawn that me and my old best friend made and we just moved so i lost everyone then and now my memories are in a pile on the floor. i really am trying to find a reason to keep going but i dont know how much longer i have.
