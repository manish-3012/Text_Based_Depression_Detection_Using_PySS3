I just don't understandI thought maybe if I just started off with a fresh start that things would automatically be better. Nothing is better I'm still stressed and I don't even know why, I have no friends to talk to about this, my family is too busy with my other sister after she tried committing suicide. I feel this season is worse in some ways compared to last I don't have hopes, desires, everyone ignores me, and everyday im closer to the only thing that will stay with me even if it leaves scars for a lifetime. I just want help ive been like this for too long some days in class I just draw me jumping off a building, some see and ignore it. I'm always trying to help my (maybe)friends since their home lives are so horrible and nobody expects me to be depressed or suicidal. I have tried to bring it up to them but then they start to steer the conversation somewhere else. I have never hated how I look so much until now, I just feel like a ugly pig that people us for their own personal gain. Every real person who I could talk has left me, and all my (maybe) friends treat me like garbage and say I'm annoying, shut up, etc. I hate to hurt my family if they did care but I can finally be at rest I guess I just don't see a future for me
