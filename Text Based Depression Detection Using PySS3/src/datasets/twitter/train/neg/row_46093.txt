I want to disappearI have been lonely for some time now, and itâ€™s made me realize how much I suck. I have low self esteem so making friends is draining. And I just feel like I am an exception in the universe. For example i believe everyone should be capable of self love and happiness etc but I am an exception. Because of my childhood, my low self esteem I am not going to truly feel these things. Maybe temporarily when I have a good mental health day ( which have been rare lately) itâ€™s so exhausting dealing with this that I wish I could disappear. Leave everyone and everything for a couple of years. Itâ€™s highly unrealistic though because I can not afford that. But I just want a break, I wish I could wake up and be happy but itâ€™s hard. It seems easier to leave for a long time. I wouldnâ€™t really disrupt anyoneâ€™s lives, I want them all to completely forget about me, I am so embarrassing I canâ€™t imagine what people think when they hear my name.
