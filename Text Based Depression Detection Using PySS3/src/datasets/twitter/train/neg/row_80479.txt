I remember an old me I miss and just want to get back to. That's what hurts the most, the memoriesI got better for a few weeks and was doing great then I don't know what happened. Went back into a downward spiral and I just want out. I just want to be okay again. I want to be the old me I remember. I want to be a good husband/son/brother/friend again. I just can't get out of this. I'm lost in this battle and know what I need to do to get out of it but I'm just stuck digging this hole deeper and deeper and only making myself more and more broken. All I do is hurt those around me that are trying to help me but I can't get out of this. I just want the old me I remember that was happy and had no stress or depression or anything I was just happy to be me and be here.That's what hurt's the most is that I can remember a "normal" me, I want that. I want this pain to end. I want to end this pain I'm causing my family/friends . I just want to be okay again
