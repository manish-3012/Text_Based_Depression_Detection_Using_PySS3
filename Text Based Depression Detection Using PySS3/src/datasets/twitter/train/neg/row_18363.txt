been in bed for 5 hours trying to fall asleepanxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts, and whatever the fuck else keeping me up. I'm so tired of everything. every single fucking day I try to keep myself from killing myself. why? why don't I just end this constant pain once and for all? I won't remember this life, I won't have to bear any guilt, I won't have to work. I won't have to worry ever again.

one friend, god bless him, doing all he can to help me. no one else gives a fuck. therapy ain't helping, meds ain't helping. but I don't want help anymore. why should I struggle to live a life I have no desire to live? a life that was imposed on me? I'm hanging myself tomorrow. just need to cross that barrier, and I'm free. no feeling, no pain, nothing. I hope people feel hurt, even for just a little while. I hope it eats at them for the rest of their lives. at least then they'll understand what I felt. fuckers. everyone's there for you until you open up,
