It hurts so bad still. Lost my first love(23M) and I'm trying to cope. So much sadness and then bouts of numbness....I've dated other girls, but this one was my first love(2 yr relationship) and I had more firsts with her than anyone else.

The first time I visited NYC was with her and it was also the first time I saw a Broadway play(or even a play in general).

First time I went to Europe was with her. We went together in the summer and traveled for 2 months together.

She was the first girl of my race that I dated...Being multi-racial and finding someone who has the same background as you, both racially but also culturally was amazing. Someone who understood the unique difficulties of being multi-racial.

But there were also bad.

She was the first girl to cheat on me. She did it the second time which just ended the relationship.

She is the first girl who I thought would consistently cheat on me if she drank. Whenever I was not around, I thought that she would cheat on me if she was drunk. It was a constant source of worry...

But besides all the first, she was my best friend. And even with all her flaws, it still hurts like hell to lose her. She was someone I could cuddle with and talk to for hours. I could hold her hand and never want to let go. She could make me feel like a millions dollars in an instant and now she is gone. It just hurts so bad...

I haven't had more than 6 hours of sleep in 3 days. I haven't eaten more than 600 calories a day. I just seem out of...vitality. It just hurts and the only time the pain stops is when I am numb.
