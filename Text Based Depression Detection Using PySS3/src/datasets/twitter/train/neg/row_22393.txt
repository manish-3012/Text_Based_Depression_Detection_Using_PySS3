I think this week will be the week.cw / sexual assault 

Everything has become too unbearable.
Three years ago, I hooked up with someone. Everything seemed consensual while it was happening. A day later, they said they were drunk and insinuated sexual assault. I knew they had a few drinks, but had absolutely no idea that they were  inebriated to the point of not being able to give consent. Everything happened so fast â€” but it doesnâ€™t matter. Iâ€™m done trying to make excuses. I have been trying to make peace with myself, but whether intentional or not, I guess I sexually assaulted someone. They never said those words and told me I was overreacting when I offered to go to authorities for him, but things can (and most likely) have changed. I feel awful, and the guilt is eating me alive. Rightfully so. I will not message to apologize again, because the chance of opening old wounds to make myself feel better is not OK. I donâ€™t want him to hurt anymore. I have been going to therapy, but it isnâ€™t working. I have no desire to continue onward â€” I will have no career, I will have no family, no children, no happiness. I do not deserve it. I am trying not to sound all â€œwoe is me,â€ but this is the truth. Thereâ€™s no coming back from this. I am so, so sorry. I am a monster and ashamed of who I have become. I am an â€œessential workerâ€ and will be able to pick up a gun tomorrow, I hope. Iâ€™ve heard pills donâ€™t work often. Iâ€™m sorry, goodbye.
