I have no will to live. Could that be related to suicidal thoughts or could be a problem?I started to feel this months ago, I have no will. I feel like shit, I have no friends, I have no motivation.

I'm going to graduate next month and for me it's like meh. Everyone has a job except me, I look for them but there's nothing for me, just stuff not related to my field.

No one knows how I feel except my (ex) girlfriend, that just left me because she doesn't want to deal with someone like me, she always said she would help me but she never did, she barely wanted to see me because she was tired because of her job (but she had time to do other stuff or see friends but no me).

I feel like garbage, completely useless, I'm not happy with me, how I look, how I am. I try to see something interesting on me but I can't do anything, I know anything, no skills.

I'm really tired of everything around me, people, situations I have no desire to live, I feel like I'm just here in this world with no purpose, I'm just floating around. Everything would be fine if I were dead, I forget about this shit around me. At the end of the day I have no friends, no one really cares about me, no one talk to me, I'm always the weirdo, that I don't speak, shy, but they don't know how I feel, everything inside of me and I hate that fact, because I have tried before to be different but people still see me as always and I'm tired of it.

The only thing that really help a little bit but really, a little bit, are my parents because they have given me everything I have. But it's not enough, simply I don't want to live, I hate me and I hate everyone and their happy lives and their jobs. They are just perfect. And I'm just here, playing video games, reading, or running just to forget but it doesn't help at all. I have low self-esteem, I'm insecure.


Sorry for the paragraphs, but I really wanted to bring out how I feel.
