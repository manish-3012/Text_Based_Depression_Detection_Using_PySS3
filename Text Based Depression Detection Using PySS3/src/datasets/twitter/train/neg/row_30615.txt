I got a concussion and everyoneâ€™s reaction was to brush me off and not take me to the emergency because Iâ€™m â€œoverreactingâ€ and i really hope i die in my sleep otherwise ill have to step in and take my own lifeI really hope i die and knowing everyone in my family doesnâ€™t care if im hurt im sure theyâ€™ll be ecstatic to know im dead. I just ran up to my room after telling them all â€œi hope youâ€™re all the last to know when i finally get brave enough to kill myself or lucky enough to die.â€ So now im gonna sleep with my concussion instead of going to seek medical attention
