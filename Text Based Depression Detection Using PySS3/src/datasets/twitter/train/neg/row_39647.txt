I 'm such a failureI've made a new account so that none of my siblings or friends know about this. 
I'm a failure. Plain and simple. Ever since I was born I've caused nothing but trouble. So much so that all I want to do is die. I had failed getting into university, and because of that I had to go to a community college. Funny thing is, I still managed to fail even that. I'm almost in my mid 20's and still mooch off of my parents. I've tried to get a job without much luck. Even when I did get a job I was usually fired within the first two months. I start to think that The only way for everyone around me to be completely happy, is to just kill myself. By then I won't be a problem for them. Everyone may be sad at first, but I know they'll eventually get over it and move on. They should be using the money meant for me, and use it on my younger siblings. That's the best option here I guess. No point in me focusing on making myself happy when all it does is inconvenience others. I know it all sounds so selfish and egotistical, but there's really no other way to fix things. It's either I succeed or they do, and at this point I'd rather see them succeed. The way I see it: what point would there be in me striving towards a goal that'll only destroy any chances for my younger siblings and my family to succeed? These thoughts have plagued me for so long that I can't remember a time when I actually experienced joy. It's all so painful to think about. Death is the only answer for me. Besides, my health isn't exactly the best either. I may as well just get it over with sooner.
I don't even know why I'm writing to strangers on the web. Maybe I'm just scared to actually go for it. 
I'm sorry for wasting all of your time as well.
