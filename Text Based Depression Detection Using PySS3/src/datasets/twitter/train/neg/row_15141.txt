Just helpSo i have two small children 19m and 5m. I have PPD. 

I have No Joy what so ever. I hate everything about my life, and i cant even say out loud that i love my children. 
I have No idendity left beside being a mother, and even though i do everything i can i fail hard.

I cant handle IT anymore.

The thought of just being gone is so tempting. I cant disapoint my children and my partner if i am gone. 

I am on medication and go to therapy. 

How do i get some purpose back. How do i get to be there for my children and ser Them grow Up.
