I will never be loved or accepted for who I amI don't understand what God would give a genderqueer bisexual to a homophobic catholic family 

I will never be free

I can never look like, act like, or love who I feel is right for me. Not if I want my family. 

I been through so much trauma. I literally lost my best fucking friend to suicide so I know the pain it causes but they wouldn't be mourning me. They'd be mourning the version of me I had to invent to protect myself. 

I hate it. I'm exhausted bro FUCK 

I cant quit because I have a child but it's getting to me. After 24 years it's finally getting to me. I don't know what to do.
