The End is NearI don't think I can last much longer. I have tried getting help, but it just doesn't make me feel better, it makes me feel worst. Since I was at a young age I felt like shit, but now it has gotten worst. I have no friends at school, no one to talk to, All i do is sit alone at lunch and not eat. I am failing behind on 2 online classes, while not turning in things in my other classes, which makes me think about suicide even more. I try and do stuff to take my mind off of suicide, but it just makes me want to die even more, because my parents would yell at me for skipping assignments and not turning them in. At those moments I can see that i am a disappointment and a failure to my family. My sister is a hard worker and is taking an internship with a doctor, while i'm here struggling to get through life. MY life has just dropped at his point, I think about suicide everyday, and at school I can't pay attention because all i think about is suicide. I don't get ready for tests, i just wing them. I think no one would care if i am gone, i am just a little spec in the universe, and we are all going to die in the future, why not just make it quicker. Even my grandma doesn't care if she dies, she knows that no one would care if she is gone. I have almost tried to kill myself on rough days, where I can't concentrate at school, and when I get home my parents yell at me, which is now getting more common throughout the week. I just live through a routine, where I go to school feeling like shit, and sitting in class, looking up ways to die. And when I get home, I get yelled at by my parents, and I just sit in my room tying a noose and thinking about suicide.. I think im just ready to leave at this point I think only one person would care if im gone, which is my best friend that I haven't seen or talked to in 3 years. No one likes me, and thinks i just kill myself and I might end it all at the end of this week....
