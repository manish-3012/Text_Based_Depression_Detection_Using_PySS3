I don't know how to get helpI guess it all started when I moved in the middle of 5th grade. I never got to properly say goodbye to all my friends, and everyone in my new school was so rude to me. I remember one day I was just reading a book, minding my own buisness and I overheard this boy telling a girl how beautiful she was. He then turned to me and said something like "what are you, like 1000lbs?" Everyone started to laugh, so I did too. I'm turning 16 in a month and weigh about 110 which I guess isn't that much but all the comments I've gotten on the way I look over the years has completely distorted what I see in the mirror. My bullies all had one thing in common: they were male. At least girls have the decency to talk behind your back so you don't have to hear it. This made me believe that the only reason why a boy would want to talk to me would be to tell me how ugly I am. I have almost no guy friends because I get too anxious around them. I want a boyfriend, but I can't even look them in the face. I started having suicidal thoughts in 7th grade and began wearing makeup every day in 8th to try to bring my confidence up. It kind of worked, but I'm still never satisfied with what I look like. In 9th, I started throwing up food, but I don't do it that often and I'm trying to stop completely. I've gone on and off diets, but they never make me feel better. I know that I have it better than a lot of people, so I feel guilty for having these thoughts. I really want to get help, but I don't know how. I've considered calling the hotline, but phone calls give me anxiety and I don't know what to expect from it. The calls in my house are also recorded, and I don't want my parents to know that I called. I just don't know what to do.
