I'm so ready to end this.The last year has not been kind to me. I've lost best friends, done horribly in school, and am on a fast track to relying on pot to get me through the night in one piece. I don't know what I'm doing and at this point I don't particularly care. Who says every soul is compatible with this life? Why should they have to be? What's the point in living if you can't enjoy it? I don't see what's so great about this. No one cares about me, all I do is fuck things up. I've already been hospitalized, so it's not like this would come as a shock to anyone. Probably a relief to most, honestly. My boyfriend would be so much happier if he could follow his dreams without the burden of my dependence. My mother could leave town, start again somewhere she'll actually enjoy. My best friend... well, she'll find someone new. She's wonderful enough that she'll have no problem moving on. My dad would be thrilled to not be disappointed in me anymore. How dare the daughter of an engineer long to be an artist? My point is, there's nothing keeping me tethered but others' expectations. When I finally stop letting that hold me back... the pills will still be there.
