I think this is really it, I'm doneI heard from someone you're still pretty 


And then


They went on to say 


That the Pearly Gates


Had some eloquent graffiti


Like "We'll meet again" 


And "fuck the man" 


And "Tell my mother not to worry" 


And angels with their grey handshakes


Were always done in such a hurry
