Friend is MIA I don't know what to doHey there. So, I've been trying to contact my friend for the past few hours.

His girlfriend whom I've never really talked to sent me a message asking if I could call him because they had a fight, he said his goodbyes and that he didn't feel like himself anymore.

He canceled his birthday dinner coming up earlier today.

He posted a couple pics saying goodbye (which he's done before, kind of an artist thing) but these felt different. 

Thing is, he doesn't answer his phone, texts. Nothing.

He recently moved, I don't have his new address so I don't know how to tell anyone about this. Kinda freaking out.

Tried contacting his sister but no response so far. I don't know what to do and this is crushing me.
