My suicidal thoughts now are so calm it's scaryI pretty much joined reddit and came straight here because I really need to let something out. I used to have suicidal urges a lot and I've attempted before. It used to be that my mind was in chaos and pain and suicide was a way to escape. It was panic and desperation. But over the last few months it's been different, I've contemplated my life, really deeply and I keep coming to the same conclusion. That after my mother and my dog passes the best thing I can do is die.
And I don't know if I want to die. Some days I do, some days I don't. But I spend maybe an hour or two each day, more on bad days, actively thinking about killing myself. And there is no panic. It seems like cold logic. And though I haven't attempted it scares me more than my attempts. I don't know how to fight my own mind when it's being rational. I don't even know who I am anymore. I don't know if I'm suicidal with a part that wants to live or if I want to live with a part of me that is suicidal.
I don't even know what I hope to get out of this. I guess I hope getting it out will help. Idk.
