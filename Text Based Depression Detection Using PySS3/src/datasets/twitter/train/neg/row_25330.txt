Little bitterTook a hole bottle of tylone and what was left in the aspirin bottle I took all them pills and then layed on my bed waiting for death I was awake and then I would shut my eyes and wake back up on and off about 6hours go's by I start to puke it was pure white when it came out I puke till I couldn't breath no more every little sip I took it came back up couldn't eat anything I layed in bed for 4 days till I went to the hospital the whites in my eyes were yellow I was pale white weak I didn't tell the doctor I had took all these pill they couldn't understand why my liver was inflamed a week went by in the hospital till I was let go they ran all kinds of test took blood two times a day so the doctor tells me I shouldn't drink any beer wine or whiskey for a couple months I say scared to death the doctors would find out. I tried my best to explain this experience.life's crazy I should have died that day 2 months after that happened is was in a car reck mashed my legs I lied in a coma for a week I was told I was grey I didn't see no light but I'm shore I wasn't far from it lucky I was still able to walk after 6months of learning how to walk again what im getting at is I've been really close to death and it's no fun great experience but not a fun one
