No reason to go onThank you if you read this and can say something that will give me a reason to go on. I have nothing left. No hope. No possibility of change. I have been in the same black pit for years. No effort of any kind has made any difference. No way to escape the despair. Happy pills useless. The last counsellor i went to see had an anger management problem. With someone else. But i didnt feel like being his next punchbag. The only reason i havent killed myself yet is because i fear it may be worse afterward.
