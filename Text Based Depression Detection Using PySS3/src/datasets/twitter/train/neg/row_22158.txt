I'm just kinda done.I'm just done with everything. All I do is go to school, come home and sleep and repeat. I'm stuck in an cycle that is always killing me. I want to be done with everything. I don't care about all the things people my age look forward to in life. I don't care about all the cars, the huge family, the luxurious life. I just want to end all my stress about the future. I hate how my day is constantly filled with I hope I pass this exam, or I hope I did well on that last essay. **I HATE IT.**

I was just in an accident on the 28th because some careless idiot decided not to brake and have his SUV hit my small 90's firebird that I loved. Its totaled and part of me wishes I died in the accident. All I had was the typical whiplash and back pains. But damn don't I wish I died in the accident. 

If it wasn't for my girlfriend and parents I would have killed myself sometime ago. I just lost the point to live life because all I see in the future is stress and bills and depression. What's the point? 

I'm not gonna kill myself anytime soon. I just feel physiologically dead.
