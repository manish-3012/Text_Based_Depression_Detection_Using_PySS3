No matter how I change my life its never enough. I'll always be sick and I just want it to stop.I have suffered from bad anxiety and depression for almost as long as I can remember...since before puberty and I'm in my twenties. I always thought of various reasons why I hated myself. Stress from the current job. School. Anything. I fucked up a class by forgetting to write a paper because I'm working too much. I feel like a total fucking failure and think I should give up and drop out and just become a housewife to my boyfriwnd and finally have kids like we planned even though I shouldn't be a mother to anyone I just want to make my boyfriend happy because he deserves it...he deserves so much more. Even thinking about all the stress of school being gone doesn't help. No changes help I still just wish I was dead.

 I have a deep hatred and distrust of anyone except my boyfriend. It scares me how much I have a legitimate hatred for human beings. I truly believe people are the most evil thing alive. We destroy this planet. We do unspeakably sick things to animals and wildlife. I often think that if I could kill off the entire human race, myself included I'd do it in a heartbeat. I feel like our entire species, our society, our exceptations, is bullshit. None of it fucking means anything...I'd rather die so I don't have to deal with it. Id rather die than go through life.
