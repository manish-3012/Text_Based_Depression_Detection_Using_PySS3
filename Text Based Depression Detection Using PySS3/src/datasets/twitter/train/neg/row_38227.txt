It just makes senseI don't see how I could ever benefit society. I do not have any marketable skills. I am pretty sure I have some mental illnesses. I am very shy to the point where I fuck up every social interaction I have. I've felt this way for a very long time, and it seems like a stupid fantasy to ever wish for anything better. It just doesn't seem like I could achieve anything I want because of how much of a fucking loser I am. Since I can't contribute to society, and I always fuck up, it makes sense that I should kill myself.
