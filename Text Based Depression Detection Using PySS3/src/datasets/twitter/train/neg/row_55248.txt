PleaseLet me die. Girl, come fuck me up. Leaves a mess. Mix my poison, get undressed. Let me feel you, reassess. I'm drinking everything you ever said. Let me die. Come break my heart and pour it into a mixture to dip a dart., and beaufiful darling, my work of art. Slow-step a dance with me, deep into the dark. I'll feel the poison and smiling fade. The dance I led, the sweet charade, i can't feel anything. Except the rain of memories upon my face. For you, I'll go to sleep? You choke me out - with venom deep. In your arms, my darling rest, I'll close my eyes against you silent chest. I love you, I'll join you soon.
