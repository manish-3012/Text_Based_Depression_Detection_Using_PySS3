I need help21M, single father, struggling to survive, struggling to find a reason to go on other than for my son. I know it sounds selfish, and thatâ€™s eating me alive. I still live at home. I have 3 jobs, 2 of them are mind numbing and make me want to gouge my eyes out, but pay the bills when I can get hours. The other brings me a lot of joy, but would take me away from everything. My religion helps, but I get a lot of flak for not being Christian, being the only religious leader for hundreds of miles doesnâ€™t help me much either. 
 Iâ€™m fighting to see my son, and kinda winning if Iâ€™m being completely honest. I barely see him now but it beats what I used to have with him. My family is split on supporting me and not giving a shit. My best friend sided with the part of my family that doesnâ€™t give a shit because she â€œdoesnâ€™t like who Iâ€™m becomingâ€ and I â€œdonâ€™t realize what Iâ€™m doing and how itâ€™s gonna affect my sonâ€. 
 My girlfriend(kinda, my anxiety and the distance has kept me from officially asking her) lives 2 hours away and tries her best to make me feel better. Baby momma keeps spreading rumors about me, refusing to cooperate even for the sake of our son. 
 I struggled with depression, anxiety, and suicidal/harmful tendencies for most of my life, and Iâ€™ve been almost 5 months clean of hurting myself in any fashion, but lately Iâ€™ve had such massive urges to hurt myself that itâ€™s driving me crazy. I donâ€™t know what to do, I donâ€™t want to give up, but everything is hitting so hard, and all the defeats in my head and heart are louder than the victories Iâ€™m winning, just feeling really lost and alone.
