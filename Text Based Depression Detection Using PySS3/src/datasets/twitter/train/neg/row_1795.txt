Last WordsI'm leaving this here like a name scribbled on a wall. Something that proves I existed at all... I no longer have the will to live. I just feel as if something inside has gone out. I can't feel joy anymore, I barely leave my room, I can't hold a conversation.  I'm thankful for meeting a few great people in my life, and I've always, always loved them no matter what. Hopefully they'll remember that. I'm sad to be leaving them behind but its too late for me now and they might understand given time. Tonight I'm going to read my favourite book, put on my favourite album and drift off forever. Whoever you are, I sincerely hope you have a great life and I wish you the best, but I have come to terms with my decision and I'm no longer scared. I'm going to look at the stars one last time out of my window. I'm going to close my eyes and sleep forever. 

*Edit: I'm still here and open to speak to anyone but it is nearly time. I'm listening to Nujabes. I just finished reading Beowulf. I'm just waiting for the stars to become a little clearer. Its been amazing to have some human interaction in the last hours. I care about each and every one of you and hope your journey takes you to new and exciting places, even after I'm long gone and forgotten. If somehow I'm still going tomorrow, I'll let you know! If no message comes then my brief time here on earth is over. I'm not religious, but if there is a next life I'll put in a good word for all of you! Farewell and good luck!

**Update: Various kind and amazing people talked to me about my decision and made me doubt it. After I logged off Reddit I tried anyway because I'm like that. It was a pretty halfhearted attempt. My method just got me really high, didn't kill me. Woke up feeling like shit but I'm still here. 

***Update: I spoke to a close relation and told them how I was feeling, but not about last night. I'm going to the doctors to seek treatment.
