Just ventingI have work in two hours and it's making me want to end it all. It's a dead-end job that I'm terrible at. We do inventory, basically count things in stores with handheld machines. I make a lot of mistakes and count slowly. Each shift is really hard to get through. 
I do want to end it and have wanted to for a while. The only thing holding me back is my family. My mom wouldn't be able to forgive me and I have three smaller sisters that would be scarred. However I'm at a dead end in life and don't know how to keep living day to day. 
There's nothing that brings me joy. I basically just read this subreddit and watch YouTube videos on my time off. My sleep is fragmented - I wake up multiple times a night and it really sucks the enjoyment out of sleep. 
I have tried multiple medications before and therapy and none helped. I'm just so fed up with everything.
