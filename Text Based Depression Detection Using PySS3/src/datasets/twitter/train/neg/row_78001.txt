Is 14 too young to kill oneself?Hey, 14 year old male here. Let me put this out there: I do not hate my life, I just I do not see the point in it. I'm not one of those 'edgy nihilistic teenagers' - I believe what I believe is rational (to some extent, aha). If I am completely honest, I struggle to find pleasure in many things but I've always been like that, so I see life as work, work and more work until you drop dead. Yes, I know it is more than that, but that's essentially what we do. For what reason? Don't ask me. I'm thinking about whether I should just get it over and done with or wait and see what my future has to offer. I'm just bored... really, really bored.
