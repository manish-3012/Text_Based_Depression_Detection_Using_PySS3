why ?does this ever get better . i am done with this talking shit . 

i am done with everything . u already see urself dead . u dont want to live anymore .  u know you cannot win this . u know this is a lost  battle  . then what's the point ?

&amp; ppl dont even care unless you are dead . 

dont u say me things get better . then why the hell u should even exist .  why can't corona take me up . why ppl who love their life has to die .  why everytime innocent ppl who love their life has to die .

&amp;#x200B;

i dont see any option . it 's all dead . there is no fighting back . u are completely shattered . and the worst part is i cannt do it . i wish god give me little strength to end it all . 

it wont change . things wont be better . i see my life going down already . it is better if i end it here . nothing can be changed , it is all fucked up . 

i wish i never up back . yes i am selfish . i dont love this fake world anymore . it is pointless . why even struggle . when there is no pont at all . 

plese god . dont wake me up . please . i dont want to see anymore . i dont want to live anymore . 

fuck u all
