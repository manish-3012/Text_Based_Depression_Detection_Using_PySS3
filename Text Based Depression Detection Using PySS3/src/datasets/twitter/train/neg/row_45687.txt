I'm tired.I'd just like to sleep forever, not die, but sleep, until old age takes me. I flat out don't enjoy life. Never have. I've sought therapy my entire life and got nothing but an aversion to other human beings, now I can't even talk to professionals because doctors refuse me, and my so called friends stopped talking to me a while back - even my family have got bored of my whining at this point. I can't even call a suicide hotline because the thought of talking to someone makes my skin crawl, and I can't even remember how many times I've posted here and got nothing but prayers and the usual "You should talk to a therapist". 

Why should I continue my miserable existence that brings me nothing but pain? Regardless of what action I take it brings me nothing but misery.
