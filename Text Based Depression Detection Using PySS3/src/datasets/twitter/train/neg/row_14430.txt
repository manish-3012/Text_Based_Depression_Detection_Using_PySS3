Iâ€™ve tried calling over 20 helplines but none even connected.Iâ€™m from India and most numbers either do not operate at night/ do not exist/ eternally busy/void numbers.  Only automated responses. Global helplines donâ€™t work and most mental health services are region exclusive. Thereâ€™s no such internet calling facilities for the same globally either which I could find. Iâ€™ve been trying since several hours just to have a Verbal talk with like anyone. 

Sometimes life just makes sure you canâ€™t get help. 
I hope someone browses my history and checks my notes when I call it quits.
