The only friends I have are ignoring me and I feel so aloneI only have two people that I talk to regularly, my best friend and her boyfriend. I was incredibly depressed and too exhausted to hide it the last time we hung out and now they're both ghosting me.

I have literally no one else to talk to, I normally feel so alone even when talking to them, and this is exacerbating that feeling. I just want to stop hurting, distract myself, but I can't. I can't even talk to another human being.

I'm wasting my life, no one would miss me, I add nothing to the world. I just want it to stop hurting.
