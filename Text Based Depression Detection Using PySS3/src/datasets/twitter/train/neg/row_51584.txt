Why am I still here?I have suffered from depression for well over 6 years now. Finally, I felt I was on an upswing.  I was getting somewhere. I felt like I was regaining aspects of control in my life and I was beginning the (gradual) process to reclaiming my mental health and confidence. And then I felt the walls close in. I tried to push against with all the strength I have, but for once I realized I wasn't only fighting my own demons. I am fighting other people. People who are supposed to be my rock, my life support, but instead back me into a dark corner and turn their backs and walk away. As if it were that easy just to leave someone you love behind. These are the same people that call me selfish for wanting to die. But is this really living? Groveling on the floor desperately grasping at any semblance of hope and strength while the person dearest to you, who should love you the most, tramples your reaching hands and steps on your chest while you gasp for air. They scream "fuck you" and "I don't give a shit what the fuck you do" and "I hate you." And my favorite, "do whatever you want, kill yourself, I'm going to keep screaming fuck you and I hate you until you die so that's your last memory." Lol. So what am I doing? I have always wanted to die, but I always felt like, what's the harm in living another day? What is the rush to die, if in death nothing means anything anymore, it's not like it would remember the extra memories of pain and betrayal. I would just be nothing. Nothing. That sounds blissful. Life is empty promises and uncertainty. Death is certainty. I know what I will become: nothing. I know what I will feel, nothing.  I'm not in a rush to die, but I know when death it worth infinitely more than the life I am living. 

I would love to feel nothing.
