I'm going to end my life tonight.[ ] Being genetically ugly and objectively unattractive means I probably won't find love
[ ] My mother is abusive and beats me until I bleed
[ ] My father is abusive and molested me as a child when I was in kindergarten
[ ] I'm not smart or good at anything
[ ] My brother hasn't talked to me since 2012ish (I'm 14 he's 17 or 18)
[ ] I have no hobbies
[ ] I'm overweight (130 pounds and 5'8) and black so my peers don't care enough to notice me
[ ] We don't ever have enough money for fucking anything
[ ] All my friends are fake
[ ] I hate capitalism: I dont want to have a desk job where I just fuck around building wealth and capital for somebody else. 
[ ] I have an imaginary world: one in my head where everything how's the way I want it. In this world I live in a Manhatten penthouse with my 2 little brothers and my mom and my dad. Occasionally I use my super suit to go to California, where my godfather owns a motorcycle store and my babysitters kid is my boyfriend. Going to bed every night realizing this isn't real and will never happen makes me want to die
[ ] I'm ugly as fuck
[ ] Nothing makes me happy anymore, I used to just feel distracted, now I'm just numb to everything. 
[ ] I live in a town called Kanata, it's in Canada and it's winter and it's so fucking cold
[ ] Literally nobody cares about me. Literally nobody
[ ] I have most of everything planned out already, just take a bunch of painkillers and put them in pancakes or something to make them taste better
[ ] I don't have anything to live for, I'm fucking stupid and my grades are trash. No amount of studying ever fixes this
[ ] Every minor thing that happens to me into a spiral of negative thoughts. 
[ ] I have crippling anxiety that makes it so hard to do fucking anything
[ ] I'll never be able to live my teenage years to the fullest
[ ] No friends.
