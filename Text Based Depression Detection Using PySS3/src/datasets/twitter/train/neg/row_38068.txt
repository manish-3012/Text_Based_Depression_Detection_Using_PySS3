Looping thoughts of suicideI usually only think about suicide a few times a day. It's easy to distract myself. But some days the thoughts rapidly loop like crazy. Not just "I wanna kill myself" but more like "I wanna kill myself I wanna kill myself I wanna kill myself I wanna kill myself I wanna kill myself " like a broken record. I'm curious if the same happens to you.
