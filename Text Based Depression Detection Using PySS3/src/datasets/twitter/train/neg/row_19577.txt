I threw everything away for someone who threw me away.I moved to Mexico to be with a girl I fell in love with. A month later, she broke up with me. Less than a month later, I learned some of the truth of what was going on between her and her abusive ex. Less than a month after that and her promise to "always be there" for me is broken too as she deleted me on Facebook and told me to stop talking to her.

I've been depressed for most of my life. I've been alone for most of my life. For once, with one person, I felt happy and not alone. But she could easily throw me away.

I've really been on the verge of just killing myself since the breakup, and every step on the path since then is a step closer.

I am all alone here. I don't speak the language. I don't know anyone within 1000 miles. I need someone to talk to.
