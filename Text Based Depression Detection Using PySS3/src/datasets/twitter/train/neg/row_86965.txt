Could it be that some christians like me don't want to live anymore because we believe we are saved but are not ultimately in the list of people has predestined for salvation, and whereas we believe to be saved we are in fact in the list of those predestined for perdition???It's pretty much the only sense I can make of my situation and the situation of so many christians who lead very miserable lives.
