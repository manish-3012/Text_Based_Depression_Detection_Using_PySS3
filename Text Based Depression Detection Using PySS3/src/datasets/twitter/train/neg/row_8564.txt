i canâ€™t do anything righti fuck up literally everything. i canâ€™t even cut myself right. i told my roommate i feel like i do everything wrong and he said â€œits okay, its more efficient that wayâ€ please you wonderful dumbass, just tell me iâ€™m doing okay. the only two things keeping me alive are the facts that my mom would be sad and my corpse would be gross and fat. i donâ€™t want to die. i just wish i was never born.
