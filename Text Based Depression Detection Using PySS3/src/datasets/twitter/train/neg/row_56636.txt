I don't think I can go onFirst, sorry about my english, I'm not fluent.
I'm 20 and diagnosed with OCD. I always been a shy child, few friends. As I was growing up, knowing more about science, history, observing the actual world and society, I was getting more and more lonely, with the feeling that I didn't belong this world.
Since I can remember I hated myself, always thinking that I were worthless and unwanted by anyone. The first girl I could get in my life was in my 17s, that smashed my feelings. I suffered A LOT with this, just reinforcing the "I wish I were dead" feelings that I've always had. Last year I was diagnosed with the OCD, after a few months thinking I had depression instead. 
Took daily my medications for OCD and finally forgot the girl this year, after more than 2 years suffering for her. After all, I had a obsessive passion/love for her.
But now I'm getting more symptoms of depression (aside from the ones I've already had).
I'm sorry, it's really hard for me just do keep the thoughs and tell them right. I always had the though, the wish to be dead, sometimes to kill myself, but I've never had the courage to do it myself. 
By the other side, I do not have a job, I'm not doing college (was studying electrical engineering, but quited), and I don't like to do almost everything. I simply cannot think of myself doing anything in the future, not a single career.
So yeah, I have OCD, probably depression, loneliness, self-hatred, almost no friends, disdain for the mankind, no hope for a future career, dismay to do anything that I've enjoyed, no courage to end it alone.
I don't know what to do anymore, I cannot stand the pain.
