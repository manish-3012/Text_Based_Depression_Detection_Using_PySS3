I just set everything up for my second attempt and took everything downHi, I previously tried back in November by jumping 4 stories and surviving because I fell on a tree but I have brain damage, thus, I have a lot of trouble using the left side of my body, I have some trouble walking and I can lift my left arm to my right shoulder but no more. The doctors say I will have permanent damage in my left arm and I may never drink again because of becoming an alcoholic since my brain doesn't have as much control over alcohol as it did before. I know I'm lucky and the damage could be much worse but I still feel like I fucked myself over for life. My girlfriend has been very supportive and has been through it all with me. She clearly loves me, which I appreciate very much. But the real question is, how much can she take? If she decides that she can't handle this anymore and ends our relationship, I really think I'll attempt suicide again and succeed this time.

Because of this fear, I set up my note in the kitchen on my phone with myself beside the stove to emit carbon monoxide indefinitely with no pilot light. But I couldn't go through with it for some reason. Maybe because of my antidepressants? Anyways, I just wanted to let everybody know my story and I'm still here.
