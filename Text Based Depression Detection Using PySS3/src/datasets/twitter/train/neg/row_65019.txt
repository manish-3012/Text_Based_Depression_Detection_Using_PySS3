Iâ€™ve fucked up my life to make the motivation to end it strongerI trashed and deleted all of my creative projects. Fucked up my computer. Been recklessly spending. Stopped showing up to my job. I want to make it so i donâ€™t have a choice. I canâ€™t back out now. The pandemic helps too. I have no reasons left to stay.
