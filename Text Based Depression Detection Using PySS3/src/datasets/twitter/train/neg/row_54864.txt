No money, job, or hopeI'm 29. I can't get the thought of killing myself out of my head. I have a few different methods, specific and certain since I have a background in chemistry/research. Fuck. I just wish I could do it. I want to do it. When I don't do it, I hate myself even more. Thoughts get less coherent after this, muddled with anger and migraines. I want to be hospitalized, but will never have money... never get another job. I can't be around people. I got fired from my last job for unable to work with others, yelling at one, because they're so goddamned irritating and idiotic. It ended with me telling my boss how fucked up everything is. Fuck him. Fuck the world. 

I have nothing but madness in my head and want it to stop.
