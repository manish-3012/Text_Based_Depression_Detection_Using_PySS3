why would the people who gave me my life make me want to end it so badlyi donâ€™t even know what kind of person i am. i feel so lost and alone in this world, like i was dropped onto the face of the earth with no guidance or support. i hate that the first eighteen years of my life iâ€™m struggling to stay afloat in the place that i should feel the safest, i hate that i have to start my adult years like itâ€™s an escape from a fucking prison, i hate the fact that you had a choice to bring me into this stupid fucked up world, knowing that iâ€™d be feeling this much pain and you brought me here anyway. iâ€™m so scared of everything ahead of me and i just wish you gave one shit about my wellbeing. but i know if i killed myself it wouldnâ€™t matter to you. i know youâ€™ll never feel bad for anything you did.
