Life is a comedian and I'm its best joke.Today while I was adding my last touches to my suicide note, my dad walked into my room and his first instinct was to ask "why aren't you studying?" (Asian parents smh.)

I've tried commiting suicide for the third time just now. It was so painful that I went "meh I'd rather live."

This really made me think that life is actually pretty funny, if you have the right sense of humor. 

Just wanted to share my weird outlook on life. Have a nice day y'all.
