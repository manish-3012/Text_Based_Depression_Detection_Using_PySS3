How to distract myself from my loneliness on my bdayI'm going to turn 19 in 7 days, I don't want to live any longer than that and might do it soon after my birthday has passed, or at least be gone before I'd enroll university. I have been feeling even worse than usual these past few days and I already know I will be doing VERY bad on my birthday and might not be able to endure it on that day. That's why I'm planning on spending it alone and taking the 2h train to the next large city. I wanna have a last good day and also wanna distract myself on that day from how lonely I actually I am. Besides obviously avoiding anyone I know. So I wanted to ask for suggestions what things I shouldn't miss out on before I'm gone and what kinda stuff I could do on that day whilst I'm there.
God this sounds so stupid now that I'm proof reading it and it sounds as if I'm attention seeking. I really just want some help on how to have a worthy last day.

Sorry my  expression in English is kinda wonky please bear with me

Also I'm sorry if I sound selfish or this isn't the right place to ask, I don't know where else to ask. Please tell me so if I should delete this and move my question to somewhere else
