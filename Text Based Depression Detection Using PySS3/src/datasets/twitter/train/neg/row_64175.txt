mind has this going for months nowDrink powdered Xanax to be absorbed faster, snort lines of blow to disturb the body system with ups &amp; downs, then take gun shots to the heart when drugs start to take effect to be disable the possibilities of surviving. Doing all far from a hospital location since a gun shot to the heart can cause death within 5-8 minutes depending what location is perforated along with other traumas to the body to respond. 

I think is not ideal how people always shoot their head lol so many possibilities of surviving &amp; you will have a disfigured painful outcome. 
The heart is the blood circulation source, it can disrupt the oxygen / blood from the brain. The drugs will stop the heart much faster after the trauma.

 This are just my thoughts, idk if to just keep going. Hell is out for everyone but some of us get tired to fight against the excessive amount of pain, emptiness, hopelessness, not belonging, life loses, betrayals,  &amp; give up.

No one to alarm, just sharing the deadly thoughts with strangers.
