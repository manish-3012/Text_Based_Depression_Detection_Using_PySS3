20 year old trans person with very little will to livehi, is this thing on?

iâ€™m not super excited about why iâ€™m posting here, which makes sense given the subreddit.

dysphoria is a bitch and i feel like giving up

ive been nothing but dysphoric for the last year or so, with little spurts of enjoyment here and there

at one point, this was enough to keep me going

it was nice to feel like there was something to look forward to

surgery, being able to be happy in my body

alas, poor yorick. plans have changed

iâ€™m so dysphoric that it impacts the rest of my mental health

depression and anxiety the likes of which mean i have to wait to get surgery until my shit is back in order

thus making me more dysphoric

a vicious cycle

canâ€™t afford hair removal

canâ€™t afford surgery out of pocket

insurance wont cover hair removal at all

insurance wont cover surgery until my mental health issues are â€œadequately managedâ€

insurance wont cover anything deemed â€œcosmeticâ€ and â€œnot medically necessaryâ€, i.e. hair removal, facial feminisation surgery, voice training, the likes

iâ€™m not sure what to do any more
