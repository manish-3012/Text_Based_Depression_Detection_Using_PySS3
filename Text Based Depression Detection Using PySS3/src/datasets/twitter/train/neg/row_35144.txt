'A lost cause'Well i dont know where to start. Call me E, im sixteen and i made this throwaway to just leave my ranting. I couldn't do it on my usual account.

I cant remember the last time i was happy. Well that isnt true, i have brief moments of happiness when with my friends like all teenagers but it's nothing more than a quick laugh. 

My family constantly put me down. My mother cant look at me because i look too much like my dad... well as much as any daughter can look like their father. My dad died in a car accident when i was four months old and she's never been able to look me in the eye, not when i was younger and not now. We constantly argue to the degree where i have had to move in with my aunt and cousins on occasion. She screams at me asking why i can't be like my older sister. She cant see me as a person without comparing me with those around me.

Speaking of my sister, she is perfect in every way. Absolutely gorgeous, sporty, bubbly, the person everyone loves and craves the acceptance of. She's absolutely lovely too. Well... to everyone but me. It doesnt help that she's studying medicine at one of the top universities in the country. I am the exact opposite of her. She is everything i am not. I hate it. I live in her shadow with a question being uttered to me atleast one every night 'Why cant you be more like Rachel?' 

I wouldnt say im horrendous. Im average in all areas. Well i thought i was... i dont know anymore. My depression is just getting the better of me.

Itshard to put how i feel into words. Right now i know what youre thinking;

'Why is she complaining? There's barely anything wrong withher. She's just a teenagers, they all go through this. She shouldnt be here.' I dont feel i should be here wasting your time with how im so beyond help that im going to off myself. 

Okay. I give up. I cant put this shit into words. Im sorry for wasting all your time.
