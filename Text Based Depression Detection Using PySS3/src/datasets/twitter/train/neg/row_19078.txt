I feel like dying today.I don't want to live anymore, and I'm only 21. I'm so tired, so exhausted, even if I sleep over 10 hours. I wake up with a heavy feeling.

My family is toxic. My parents are horrible narcissists and treat me like dirt.

My ex broke up with me 3 months ago now. He was my first everything. I loved him more than anything. I gave him the world. I gave him all the parts of me. And he left me hurt and shattered, broken. I still miss him. And it hurts every day. We had so much together, planned a future together, everything. I was ready to spend my life with him. And now it's gone. My first love, where I felt happiness for the first time in my life, is gone.

I don't feel happy. I feel nothing. This covid-19 situation makes it worse because I can't go out. I would be at college, but everythings closed. I'm home instead with a toxic and loud family. I can't focus.

I cry every night. Nothings getting better. Nothing makes me happy, even hobbies I use to love. I have no motivation. I don't see the future anymore. I don't see anything. I don't care anymore. I want to die. It hurts too much, the pain is unbearable. I can't do it. I'm not strong. I want to give up. I have prepared to give up. I don't want to exist. It's tiring, and I am tired.
