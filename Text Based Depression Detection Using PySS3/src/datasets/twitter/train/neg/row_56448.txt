I've had enough of life I think this time I'm done2 mental hospitals
50 different meds
Finally on lithium and seroquel, I thought these were supposed to work? 
I just had it. All this pandemic, the world has changed for the worst. 
I am full of hate and anger, I always have been. 
I attempted suicide at 5yo with a paperclip and an electrical outlet, to bad it didn't work. 5, can you fucking believe it, 5? Fuck me! 
I've been fighting battles with mental health my whole life. 
I think I've lost my mind
It might be tonight as the wife sleeps I'll just slip out. 
Nobody will care but her and my dogs. 
Hopefully someone will miss me.....
