I don't know anymore...warning ... this might be long.  
  
I don't ... even know how to begin to explain this. I don't want to be alive anymore, though. That's for sure .... I've felt that way for quite a long time, and ... well, I'm afraid to even do anything about that, and the fact that I can't even bring myself to plan it or anything, makes me feel even worse. I'm a coward, for not wanting to live ... but ... being afraid to even try to do it, or think about it, that makes me even more of a coward, and that makes the feeling much worse ... and well ... it just spirals and I feel prettymuch worthless.  
  
I don't do drugs, I don't drink .... I don't do anything wrong, I'm a good person. .... so how come I'm such a failure. I have no job, no friends, no ... well ... anything. I've tried to get a job, but I just can't handle anything. It's all too much for me. I live with my grandmother right now ...and everyone thinks that I just take advantage of her, because I never do anything myself. Everyone thinks I'm lazy, and only care about myself. But that's not true... When she passes .... I'll have nowhere to go, and I won't be able to take care of myself.  
  
For some reason .... people don't like me. I don't understand why ... nobody ever talks to me, and when they do, they talk to me once, then never again. I have one "friend" ... I guess you can say that, but he always makes plans with me, and then ditches me and does other things, or makes up excuses...   
  
I don't even know where I'm going with this. I'm sorry .... I'll just leave it at this.

Edit: I don't seem to have very stable moods either. Times when I'm unhappy, I start to cry, and I can't function at all. But other times, I just don't ...feel. Anything, at all. I'm sitting here, eating cake, and watching videos. Not any specific ones ... just random videos I find so that there's sound, I guess? ... I don't know.
