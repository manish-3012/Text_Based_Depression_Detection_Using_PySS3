I feel so alone.Iâ€™m 20/f, diagnosed with bipolar, ptsd, on a low tonight. Iâ€™ve been clean of self harm for 2 years now but want to do it tonight so much bad. I just want this to end. Thereâ€™s this overwhelming amount of pain and I donâ€™t know why. I have no reason. I canâ€™t remember the last time someone has asked me â€œhow are you?â€ Other than the customers at my job (in which I just say â€œIâ€™m doingâ€) and my managers who I canâ€™t tell that I want to kill myself or there would be a big problem. Iâ€™ve been with a girl for almost 2 years now, weâ€™ve been on long distance for about 6 month, Iâ€™m moving back soon but she couldnâ€™t give two fucks. she thinks my life is easy and yeah compared to hers it is. but I am struggling mentally and no one is seeing it and itâ€™s making me so angry because I feel so insignificant which is so stupid. Iâ€™m bottling all this shit up and I just want to die. I just want this to fucking end because I donâ€™t feel like Iâ€™m worth anything anymore.
