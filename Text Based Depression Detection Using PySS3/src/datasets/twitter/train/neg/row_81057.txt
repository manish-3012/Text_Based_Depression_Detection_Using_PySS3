Over a decade ago I did something that will ultimately cause me to end my life.The guilt is overwhelming some days and I can't shake the memory of what I have done. I don't know how to get over it. I don't feel like I deserve to get over it. I am scum. I may have hurt another human in the same ways I was hurt, and that makes me truly believe the only fair punishment is death, and the only penance is to never take another breath. But perhaps my sentence is a life of mental agony instead because I dont deserve the easy way out. But I don't deserve joy either. Ever again.
