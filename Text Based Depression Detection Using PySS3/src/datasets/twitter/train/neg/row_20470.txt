UndecidedMy head feels empty but my emotions run rampant. I hate being me. I hate being me. I hate that I hate myself. I hate how trite this sounds. I hate that my life isnâ€™t bad on paper but my shitty self canâ€™t recognize that. I hate how unproductive I am. I hate how few options I have. I hate how alone I feel. I hate how little self control I have. I hate me. I hate me. 

Everyday I open my eyes angry that Iâ€™m alive. I canâ€™t bring myself to do it . My resistance is atrophying though and Iâ€™m not sure how much longer I can hold out. Iâ€™m not sure if I should.
