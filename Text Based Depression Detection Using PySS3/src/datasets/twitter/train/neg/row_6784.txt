Unlovable?Two months ago I lost the best friend I've ever had. I always told him I could be myself with him without having to put on any facade. He's the first person I've ever met since I was a little kid whom I've felt that comfortable with. With most people I have to pretend to be happier than I am, or act like things are better than they are so I'm fun to be around. I left and joined the Navy over a year ago and was kicked out last June for being bi-polar. I can't get my life back together._x000D_

I spent a few months out of state with family. It was the worst experience of my life. My mom and g'ma are great, but they have no life whatsoever (not one friend or hobby) - and I'm a fast mover. But I didn't even have money for gas to go anywhere, and I didn't know anyone other than them in the state. I have a master's degree and couldn't find a job. Just when I was about to lose it, my brother called with a job opportunity on the other end of the country. I packed up and left. It was great for 3 months... til I got laid off. My boss made it clear to me that I had done nothing wrong; he just didn't need my position anymore and couldn't afford to keep me._x000D_

That was October, and I have yet to find a job. The first week of November, I lost it and tried to kill myself. The strain was too much for my best friend. He stopped talking to me. A month ago, he sent me an email, telling me how much what I did hurt him. He was absolutely right - I was selfish and I put him through too much. He told me he still loved me, but he needed some time. It's been another month. I texted him for Christmas and told him that I miss him and am thinking about him. He has yet to respond._x000D_

The thing is, this completely justifies the whole reason I tried to kill myself in the first place! His life is obviously better without me - I was just weighing him down. Otherwise, he'd miss me by now. Also, if the one person whom I was ever myself with, whom I ever opened up to completely can't even stand to talk to me... what does that say about me?_x000D_

I haven't had a real relationship in years. I can't hold onto a friendship with the sweetest, most selfless person I've ever met. I can't keep a job. All I do is suck the life out of those around me. Why in the world should I continue living? Oh, and my savings just ran out again. This week I'm moving back in with my mom and g'ma. This time I don't even have my friend to talk to from afar. Where do I go from here?_x000D_

All I wanted for Christmas was my friend back... instead I got swine flu followed immediately by pneumonia. Without any income or healthcare, you can imagine how much fun that's been. I don't really care about any of that. I just want my friend to forgive me. I'm starting to believe he never will. It's been two months, and I still cry everytime I think of him. It reminds me of two things: How horrible I was to him, and My uselessness as a human being.
