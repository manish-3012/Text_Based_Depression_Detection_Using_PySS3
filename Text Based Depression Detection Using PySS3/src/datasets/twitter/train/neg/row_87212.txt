My plan just keeps replaying over and over in my head.I keep picturing exactly how Iâ€™ve planned to do it, and I think Iâ€™m near a breaking point. I have a painful cavity and for some reason despite all my trauma, the things I have to deal with every day, just everything, the fucking cavity is just making me itch to do it. I donâ€™t have insurance so I just hope the damn thing rots enough soon that it stops hurting. I canâ€™t sleep. I just donâ€™t want some innocent kid in the woods to stumble across my body, thatâ€™s the one thing thatâ€™s stopping me. I feel scattered right now.
