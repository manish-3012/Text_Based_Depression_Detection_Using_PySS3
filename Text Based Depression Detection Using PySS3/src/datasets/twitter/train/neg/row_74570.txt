Is it worth it?I don't even know what to put here. I can't stand life. There are many reasons why and all of them are cliched. I can't see a way out of this hole and I don't know how to ask for help. I have financial problems as well as emotional problems. My family all has somewhat of their own problems and one of the only reasons I still walk this earth is because I don't want to put my family through any more. I have dreams about suicide and I think about it almost constantly. I was washing dishes the other day and when I came across the knives I had to tell myself multiple times not to drive them into my own chest as hard as I could. I'm scared and lonely, but fear institutionalization if I talk to people who might be considered close to me. I think about the impact my life has had on society and I know that my life is negligible. Even if billions of people knew my name and my story, what does that change? I'm still just a speck riding a slightly larger speck circling another speck in the grand scheme of the universe. I feel worthless and nothing I do changes that.
