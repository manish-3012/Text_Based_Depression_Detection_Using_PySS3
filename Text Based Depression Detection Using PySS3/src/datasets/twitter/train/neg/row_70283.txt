I think about it a lotIâ€™d rent a hotel room, listen to music, slash my arms. Iâ€™m comfortable with that kind of pain, used to it. Itâ€™s the one method that doesnâ€™t make me feel queasy. Iâ€™m just afraid of being unsuccessful. If I truly attempt, I want it to work. One of these days. Iâ€™m so sorry.
