The one person who is keeping me alive I will no longer seeI'm going to start this off with saying I'm a sophomore in high school and the one person who kept me from ending my miserable existence is a freshman. We had the same fourth period Spanish class together. I tried to open myself up to her maybe be her boyfriend but she already had one. Now that hurt me a little but I was suicidal before this so that was by no means the straw that broke the camel's back. The sad part is that Tuesday, May 30th, is likely the last day I'll ever see her. She's homeschooled half of the day and Spanish was her last class. I'll probably never have the same classes again or see her the hallway. I really didn't care that I wasn't her boyfriend after about a week of knowing her. Her personality was just so perfect and the way she looked was stunning. Every day she was there in class I found a reason to not end it. There were people like her in the world. And some of them might like me. Those thoughts made me feel something I haven't felt and so many years. Happiness. But now she's gone. I won't see her. I have no will to live. My existence is pain. She'll only be a fading memory from Tuesday onwards.
