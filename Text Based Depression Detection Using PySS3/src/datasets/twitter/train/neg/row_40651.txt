Only 5 minutes awayYesterday i went to a party with my best friend who is a girl and is pretty much the only person I care about in this world. We are extremely close and seem always to cuddle and hug and generally be close to eachother even though we are only friends.

Long story short we ended up making out a little bit both of us being pretty fucked up on some weed. I kissed her first but then she kissed me back and kept going. We had long conversation afterwards and during and before and all was good. I thought nothing of it and was kinda happy that it happened.

This morning i wake up to her telling me that I took advantage of her and that I knew she would never do that when she is sober. I had absolutely no intention of taking advantage of her and was 100% sure that night that she wanted it to happen and was glad it happened. 

Now she pretty much completely hates me and cannot even look at me. This hurts me so bad to know that i hurt her since she is so important to me even if i didn't know I was hurting her. There is nothing i can say to fix it no matter how much I apologize and say it was my fault.

I went to the store and bought some rope and went into the forest only 5 minutes by walk away from my house and tied a noose and tied it to a tree. I contemplated for awhile before going back home but I know that I can go die in 5 minutes flat whenever i want to. she is the only one I can talk to, the only one i wanna talk to. That is also why I am writing on here is because i have nobody else to open up to. 

All i need is 5 minutes of courage and I will be gone.

This is not the first time I've been suicidal but this definitely put me over the edge of being serious and ready to do it. 

Please give me some advice if you can preferably on how i can fix things with her.
