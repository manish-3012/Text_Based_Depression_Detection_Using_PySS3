A dream changed my mind about suicide.I never understood the whole "your family will be devastated" thing. Why would they care? I'm basically nothing to them. Nothing would change if i wouldn't be here. I didn't really care about how my family would be affected by me necking myself until i had a nightmare.

I dreamt that my sister had killed herself. The absolute dread i felt was terrible. I saw my parent confused on what to do. I had no idea what to do either. Not only about the situation but about my life as a whole. How do i keep living after her death. It happened so out of the blue. It all felt real as i didn't know i was dreaming.

After i woke up i realized that all my family members would feel the same if i would have done it. It would be as surprising to them as it was for me. 

Maybe its not going to stop me from doing it but it will take much more for me to do that to them.
