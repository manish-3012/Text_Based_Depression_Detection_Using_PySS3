Ready to goI'm going to do it tonight. I have a bottle of pills here (not Ibuprofen or some shit, these will actually do it) and I've already started taking them. 

Where do I even start with my reasons why? I'm in love with a friend from high school, but she's gay and I can't get over her. I can tell that we're drifting apart too, which makes it even worse. College is shit too. I'm paying an insane amount of money for a degree I don't even know what to do with, I barely got good enough grades last semester to keep the scholarships I need to afford to keep going to school, plus I don't have any friends bc I'm an antisocial piece of shit.

So I guess this is it. I don't even know why I'm writing this, I guess I want to get my thoughts out one last time
