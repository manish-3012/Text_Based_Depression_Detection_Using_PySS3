My suicide noteHello everyone. Since I donâ€™t feel like writing this out I am simply typing my final words.

I first noticed his eyes. They were blue like sunshine shining through water. I loved him with all my heart. But then he left me. If I canâ€™t live with him I wonâ€™t live at all. I tried to bounce back, but my current relationship is bringing me nothing but grief. I love him. I love them both.

This will be my second time overdosing on painkillers. Hopefully this time will do the trick.
