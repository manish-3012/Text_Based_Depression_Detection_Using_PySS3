I made the worst decision of my life and I can't talk to anyone about it.I recently moved away from a good job in a good (if expensive) city with a few good people around, to seek out similar employment with a lower cost of rent in a different city. I also find myself constantly seeking out new experiences (which come with obvious risks) That's just a little background on the situation I find myself in. 

In the past two years I took several doses of acid and mushrooms, as well as using cannabis more than I've ever used it. I recently quit everything (about 1 month clean) because I was afraid it was detaching me too much from reality. I consider writing my passion and I just finished a book (which I'm finding difficult to publish). I can't find a job and I can tell I'm ruining things with the only people I have around me.

My most recent move was probably the worst decision of my life (at least my adult life, but perhaps my entire life). Savings are running out and friends are a thing of the past. I've never felt closer to suicide than this weekend. At least not in the past 7 or so years. 

TL;DR I had everything I needed and left it all to find something "different." Now I have less and less every day. I am ready to be done with it all.
