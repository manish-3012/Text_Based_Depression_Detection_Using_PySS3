HelpAnxiety is getting worse. Suicidal tendencies. Help. Please talk to me. The only reason I'm not going through with it because it's, a selfish escape. I don't want to be selfish, but i also want to be, nothing. I feel so fucking numb I can't even feel stuff. I don't know. This probably doesn't even make sense. I swear I'm not an attention whore I'm exercising every option to stop myself.
