I am going to jump off a bridgeI don't know why I feel compelled to do this, but it seems like the thing to do kind of like clearing out accounts on rpg games before leaving, it feels like that. Life is a videogame. There is nothing wrong with that, it just is. I am fairly certain someone is trying to kill me and I was suicidal before this stalker so now it is like I have to kill myself or risk getting killed by someone else or worse. I don't want to get into details, they might read this. They would enjoy my pain. I would like to see them die or know they did die, but that won't happen knowing my luck. so bye who ever sees this and try to be a good person.
