Suicide isn't so bad of an option?None of us really matter, I think. So what if my grades are bad, my parents are disappointed, me feeling suicidal. We're bunch of hairy animals living on a wet rock in space. I'll be dead, they'll be dead, my friends will be dead, you reading this will be dead, and you wont remember being alive. Maybe im just fucked up thinking that, but it's the only thing that keeps me calm and lucid. I hear exit bags with helium is great. I think I'll try that. Thanks for listening.
