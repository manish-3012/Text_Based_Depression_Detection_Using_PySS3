Running out of time.(M 22) I have one week to decide to get a job or go to inpatient therapy. I have done inpatient before and it was a tough experience for me that made me self harm and have suicidal thoughts. I am conflicted because I'd love to get a part time job, but I have extreme anxiety and depression and I don't know if I could handle a job. It seems like whichever route I choose there is inevitable failure. Any advice would be appreciated I feel if I fail this next time suicide will seem like the best option.
