I hate everything about my life. I find it hard to continue.There is nothing in my life worth living. My life has always been a struggle and nothing comes easy for me. I get no enjoyment out of my life. There is nothing for me here. I just want to give up and end it, but I can't commit myself to even hurt myself. I don't want to continue living this life anymore. I'm trapped living a life I do not want. I'm over 30 and still struggling to get a girlfriend. At my age, I shouldn't be struggling with that. I should have other things to worry about. I'm so behind in life. I'm so ashamed of my life. Nobody wants me.
