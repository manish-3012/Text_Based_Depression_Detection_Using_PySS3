I know how meaningless write depressing shit.I know no one can solve anything in here.
Everybody knows.

If I express anger and depression in real life, It will ruin all my relationships.
Because no one want to be a friend with mentally fucked up skeptics.
I try not to look like a depressed weirdo outside.
I know It look desperate and pathetic.
But I don't want to be socially isolated anymore.

I just want to feel iâ€™m not the only one in pain.
That's why I'm here knowing it's not helping.
