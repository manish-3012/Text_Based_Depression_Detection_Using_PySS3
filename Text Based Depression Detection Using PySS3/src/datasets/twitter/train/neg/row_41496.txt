Suicide or dissapearI use to have friends and a girlfriend. No one talks to me anymore now. Iâ€™m 18 and I live with my brother, I work 40 hours a week and I do nothing on my free time. I lack the motivation of going out and donâ€™t know how or where to make friends. Everyone seems happy but me. I feel like a failure after dropping out of college last semester and I just want to end it. I suck at everything I use to be good at and feel like everyone gets annoyed with me. I donâ€™t want to feel like this. I use to be able to smoke but have been about 5 months sober since starting my new job due to drug test. I honestly think if I could smoke again I wouldnâ€™t be so sad but I canâ€™t fuck anything up because itâ€™s my only option after dropping out of school. I want to get help but just scared of opening up. Am I to young to feel this way? Iv been suicidal since 5th grade and itâ€™s always this constant thought of ending it. Is something wrong with my head??
