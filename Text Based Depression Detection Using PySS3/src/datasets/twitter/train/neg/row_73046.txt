Fell over and smashed my head on the concrete last night. It felt good to feel somethingWas drinking with friends last night. Stumbled to the club with a couple of other drunk people. Me and this guys balance was terrible and we even fell over on each other. We made it to the club and I realised I didnâ€™t have my wallet and keys, because this was the first time I had drunk in a while because of exams. I sprinted back and a few minutes from a flat I lost my balance down a hill and smashed my head on the concrete. 

The pain felt amazing. It felt good to feel something other than emptiness. I made it back home and relished in the pain and my wounded face. I followed the advice online and cleaned it and bandage etc 

I began to realise why I stopped drinking however and went completely overboard because of how empty Iâ€™d been feeling. To me getting really drunk is like itching a scab. It might feel good but you know itâ€™s bad in the long run and will take longer to heal. But the difference for my depression is that it does not look like it will heal for a number of factors. 

I think I have a mild concussion and itâ€™s weird that I donâ€™t want the pain go away. It makes me feel ever so slightly more alive. But of course my face is bloody and wounded which will mean self care, worsened self conscious and waiting which is fucking hard when your depressed. Have gone home to self isolate in my house in the middle of nowhere for my face to heal. I will relish in the pain while it lasts
