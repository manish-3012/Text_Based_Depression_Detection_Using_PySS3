School makes me want to end my lifeEveryday of the week drags on so long. I hate seeing the same faces I have nothing in common with everyday. I hate the same schedule in which Iâ€™m told when Iâ€™m allowed to move from one seat to another where I spend the next hour and twenty minutes soaking in useless information Iâ€™m not passionate or interested in. I hate my ghetto environment of wanna be hard ass upper middle class waste babies with no  cognitive capabilities outside of what they were conditioned to growing up (conditioned referring to their piers). I can function with the knowledge that narcissistic, ignorant, close minded, inconsiderate, obnoxious, disrespect, humans exist, but to be forced in a room with them on a daily basis is so mentally exhausting. I canâ€™t fucking bare the thought of having to do this shit for a year and half longer.
