i'M ALWAYS the one looking out for everyone elseim so fucking tired of hearing about eveyone elses shit, like seriously just want to buy a gun put a bullet in my head sometimes. these mother fuckers that are my friends always expect me to be the one that has it together. i always go for the wrong girl, that shit literally fucks with me, i am getting older (33) and all i want is a fucking family, to raise some kids and be happy? am i kidding my self with this shit? do i go for the wrong ones always, how stupid are my expectations? I am expected to always be the strong one, that has his shit together, and that is a role model for everyone else, do these fuckers not know i have literally nothing together and am just living day to day? .............. fuck it man, its like my only options are to move away, stop talking to everyone i know and become a  new person, or just say fuck all these people and fuck the life i live and end it.... anyone got any advice? no matter how much time i spend inbetween these feelings i always come back to ending it, whats wrong with me? is this wrong of me? i feel so selfish to feel this way..... but im so tired of caring and putting everyone else first.... like wtf?
