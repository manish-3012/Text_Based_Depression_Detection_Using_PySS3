Very on edge and want to die, I'm scared of everything coming up
Somebody please help I don't know exactly why I'm panicking over this is supposed to be a simple operation.  But still is a part of my manhood so to say and I'm just not sure I can handle it with everything else. For those that are curious is a surgery to remove one of my testes.
Because I've had an undescended one since the age of 11,no thanks to Doctor for a hernia check. 

Plus I have my gastroenterology appointment tomorrow and I'm taking about that too. I just can't get ahold of myself. I feel like I'm going to hit that complete breaking point and wind up down the rabbit hole and start cutting again and I know one I start is going to get really bad because I've only had 2 lapses in 8 years. At my worst I used to cut upto 35 times a day, and I don't want to go back to that, but I don't think I'm strong  to fight it anymore. 

Everything is just boiling over for me and I want to die. I want to be in the darkness and just want to hide. 

Why can't I have a normal life Ave not everyone I turn around access think I'm getting even the slightest but ahead I get pounced back about what feels like 1000 miles from where I was. I feel like Im not making any prices health wise and is driving me more insane then I anyway am. 

I know I'm rambling, and I'm sorry

Edit: if I'm doing this wrong I'm sorry.  But I just need to let this or. 

I've tried all my coping strategies for dealing with my urge to cut and none of them are working.  I so want to hold a knife in my hand.  I don't think I'm strong enough to fight it right now.  I just way too have pain I can control.  I'm sooooo tired of being in constant pain, emotional mental and physical.  I CAN'T LIVE LIFE THIS ANYMORE.

I just want it all to stop.
