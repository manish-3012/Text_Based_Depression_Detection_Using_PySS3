How to tell my family I love them without alarming them?My brother had schizophrenia/depression and committed suicide when I was 13 (im 28 now). I want to tell my sister (only other sibling) that no matter what happens I love her because the chance to might fade. As of late, I have been struggling with depression and sense that mentally I am on shaky ground, and in turn losing control.

Itâ€™s hard to convey, but I feel like I am losing control of my mind and in a deeper way, my inner most thoughts. I donâ€™t want people to think I am crazy but amidst this turmoil I feel like my personality is slowly dying and I am not myself. 

I have dealt with depression and thoughts of suicide before in my life. but this time is different. It has an undertone of tranquility and finality to it. Like internally I have acknowledged my suffering that I refused to acknowledge my whole life and that this will be the final time. 

My relationship with my family is good but it would definitely trigger alarm bells if I had a discussion of this depth with my sister or told her whatever happens I love her out of the blue. 

I just carried anger inside of me for so long when my brother committed suicide without really saying goodbye or any explanation. Maybe the same happened to him and he lost his chance to say goodbye. I donâ€™t want the same to happen to me.
