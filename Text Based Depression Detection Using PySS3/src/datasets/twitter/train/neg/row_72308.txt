Life sucksAs above. I've already hated almost everything at this point and almost everybody. People are so judgemental. I hate life. Why am I always waking up to a nightmare each day? I just feel like punching the people I hate in the face to see a blue eye on the people who keep on provoking me. But, I control myself because I don't think it would make any difference, and also, it wouldn't make me feel good to inflict violence on others. It ain't right. I just feel like ending my life for this reason, because nobody ever really listens to me anymore. I don't think people realize that my recent aggressive nature stems from feeling unheard.

So, as the adage goes, show and don't tell. Killing myself will help demonstrate that.
