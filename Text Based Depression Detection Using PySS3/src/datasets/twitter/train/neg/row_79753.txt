4 years into therapy, no betterI justo feel like a worthless man, I'm 23, I've been to therapy for 4 years and I feel like it is for nothing. I don't feel any better and the urge to hurt myself. To kill myself is still with me. I don't want my loved ones to suffer, but I don't want to live either...
