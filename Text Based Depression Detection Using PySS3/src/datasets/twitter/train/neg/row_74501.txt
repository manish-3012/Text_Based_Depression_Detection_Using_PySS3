I don't think I can do this without my dog.Long story short: I got a job, job changed their mind after I quit my old job, then I had no job for a while, then I got a job but it was too late and I had to move. So now I'm living in Florida with my aunt out in the middle of nowhere.
  
I'm grateful for the place to stay, but my dog is unhappy here. Aunts dogs fought with him and now he just spends most of his time in my room. He's also allergic to grass, and even with meds he's constantly itchy. His skin is so sensitive right now he yelps when I brush him. I might have to give him to my ex.  
  
Problem is, I rely on my dog so much for emotional support. I really don't think I can make it through this without him, but also can't bear the guilt of keeping him in a place he's unhappy. He is literally all I have that has kept me going this long. He is the friendliest, most loving dog I've ever known and can't stand seeing him afraid to go outside.  
  
I know I can't do this without him. Even with my aunt being extremely welcoming and her family loving, there's too much shit life has piled on for me to handle.
