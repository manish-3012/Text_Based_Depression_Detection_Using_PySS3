Iâ€™m so tiredIâ€™m only 18 and i feel like iâ€™ve hit a wall that has no end. I live on my own and have a full time job to support that and i just feel like i made it all the way to adult hood to realize that thereâ€™s nothing there. Everyday feels like a horrible chore and i make myself get through it but iâ€™m tired, i donâ€™t want to anymore. I just want to be done. I donâ€™t like being alive anymore. My mental health has always had dips in it and iâ€™ve survived a suicide attempt, which after i tried to get myself together but i just donâ€™t see the point anymore. I feel dead inside at work. Itâ€s like when layne staley said; â€œone who doesnâ€™t care, is one who shouldnâ€™t beâ€. I donâ€™t care anymore. Iâ€™ve been hurt a lot, raped, abused. I just canâ€™t anymore. Never felt more numb and I donâ€™t know what to do
