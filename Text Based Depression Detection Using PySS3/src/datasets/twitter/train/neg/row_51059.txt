I don't know it anymore.Since i have depression I feel like that I can't be myself anymore and my life is not really good. I have talent in my electric guitar because people said that I can play very good without any lessons. But how can I develop my talent? I'm behaving weird to people. Sometimes I'm so happy but sometimes I just want to kill myself over and over again. I don't understand anymore. I feel disgusting atm. Everything goes wrong! My homework, my parents, my teachers. I feel like a fucking psychopath because somethimes i have sick thoughts. I'm playing games the whole day everyday. I have a clan with 40 friends were I talk to. I don't have help because it just don't work for me. I don't like talking to people. I feel my total different then other people and I'm looking total different. I have so much problrms with school because I don't have energy anymore to work and do my homework and learn for my tests. I feel like I'm worthless. Can someone help me because this post is my only help.
