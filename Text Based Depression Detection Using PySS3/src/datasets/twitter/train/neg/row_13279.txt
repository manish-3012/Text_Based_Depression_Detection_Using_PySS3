Our business is destroyed. I donâ€™t want to live.We worked our whole lives to provide a nice life for our kids.  We did nothing outside of building our business.  It is ruined.  We could pay overhead for maybe 8 months.  But this shit is never going to end by then.  We have a public event business.  High overhead for rent.  We have no other source of income.  We have no other skills.  We gave our lives to this business.  I do not want to live with this new reality.  I donâ€™t.  Lots of people will be fine.  We were just unlucky.  I have no desire to live and watch everything we have worked for go away.
