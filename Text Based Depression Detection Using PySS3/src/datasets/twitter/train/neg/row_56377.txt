I'm at the lowest of my low and i've been here many times. I really don't have the strength anymoreThis is a lot so I apologize in advance. I don't have the strength or will to move on. I have many people who are angry at me, all very unjust but not fixable anymore. I have been sexually abused a couple of times by family. I can't go to my parents for a reason I can't even write down here. And now, after being rejected after being held onto a leash for two months when he didn't even like me from the start was the final straw. I gave him so much and I cared so much but I was way too deluded. He was really the only thing that kept me sane and motivated. I'm gay and I've been trying to get a boyfriend for a really long time. I'm currently 24 and I came out and started dating when I was 16. I've been rejected, so many times. Rejection is part of dating, I understand and heartbreak will heal overtime. But I don't have the strength anymore. I've been here so many times. People tell me I am above-average handsome, really nice and caring. But I have never ever received anything good from it.

I am here at home, I have nothing. Anti-depressants don't seem to work. I just want to die, I really really do. I wake up and then I feel clear for a good 5 seconds and then it's back to physical pain again. It hurts to be alive, I'm screaming in my home, I fall asleep on the floor, I haven't eaten for 2 days. I don't even find the will to do anything or undertake anything anymore. I tried being happy I really did. I started writing a book, I draw/paint a lot, I make music. But I don't get anything out of it anymore. I'm so so done. I need a miracle because I don't see myself breathing in 7 days.

I have this amazing friend and I love him so very much and he is probably keeping me from doing it until this point. But I can't do this anymore. I'm so alone. I am so alone and I have nothing. I want help but I don't want to talk to my friends about it anymore because I've been doing it too much to the point where they say that i'm like a baby to take care of.

I have been to a psychiatrist 4 times now in my life and I can't afford to go again. I just can't go back there.
