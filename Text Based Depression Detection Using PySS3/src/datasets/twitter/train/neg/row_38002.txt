I hate waking upI've been on a difficult life journey and the more I wake up the more I want to close my eyes. There are so many things in daily life that harm us and nobody pays attention to it. I don't want to continue explaining in detail. I've done acid plenty of times (lost count 20+) and shrooms over a handful of times but at high doses the highest being 7gs. The perspectives help me wake up bit I'm waking up to quickly and to the point where I'm overwhelmed with things I shouldn't be doing and that everyone else probably shouldn't. Life is a game and I want to quit or change games.
