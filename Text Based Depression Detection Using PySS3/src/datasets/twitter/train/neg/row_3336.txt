I'm just really struggling to hold onI'm just really struggling to hold on

I've had depression and anxiety for years now, tried many medications and been to therapy a few different times, but I always feel either 100% ready to die and feel no hope, or just sort of fine but still sad, I'm never happy. I can be in a good mood for a couple of hours, but it never sticks. The only reason I haven't killed myself yet is that the anxiety makes me terrified of dying, and I know that my mother probably couldn't live without me. So I'm just living purely for someone else, which is making me miserable, which is making her worry. 

But as time goes on and I get worse, I start caring less about what it would do to her. I just can't go on like this. I've been prescribed Mirtazipine recently but it's just getting worse, and I know they tell you it gets worse before it gets better, I just don't know how longer I can hold on.
