I'm tied of being unwanted.Really it's just bullshit to wake up everyday and face another day alone. No one is in your corner really, they are just looking out for themselves. I hate volunteering, working and doing stuff. Everywhere you go it's just users. I've never really been wanted. After my dad died my mom walked out on me. She never really spoke to me again until the day she died. I've never been able to get a good job because I'm always rejected by them. It's always a job that barely pays enough to live on. I never have the ability to save up to go do something fun. Even if I did I wouldn't have anyone to do it with. I've always been rejected by women too. Every girl I've asked out has rejected me. It's just bullshit. I'm tired of life going nowhere and I'm tired of being alone all the time. All I wanted was to start another family. That's impossible with as little money as I make and the fact that I've been rejected by every woman I've asked out. 

So fuck it, I'm going to hang myself. People won't tell you that you're not wanted here, they will even lie to you and tell you they want you here but in reality, I know I'm unwanted. It's time to die and get out of everyone else's way. I'm sick of the attitudes I get anyway.
