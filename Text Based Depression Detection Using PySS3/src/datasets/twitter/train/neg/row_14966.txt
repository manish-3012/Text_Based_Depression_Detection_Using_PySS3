It hurts it hurts it hurts to feel so unlovedNot a single person cares. Iâ€™m trying. So hard. So many cries for help but nobody fucking cares. I just wish I did it now. I feel like an absolute attention whore. All I want is help, someone to be there. I know it wonâ€™t make a difference anyways, but why does nobody care? Am I really that worthless? That expendable? Is everyone else just better than me? Or is it just that people care, but itâ€™s never enough? I think so. I donâ€™t deserve to be missed when Iâ€™m gone. I just wish someone would miss me.
