Taking all pills seems really temping right nowAnd I have many most of them for my asthma I tried yesterday but it wasnâ€™t enough Iâ€™m tiered I thought they were gonna help maybe do something but my expectations were too high I went to the ER few weeks ago with my dad cuz  I passed out from having panic attacks (my parents arenâ€™t supportive about my mental health at all and I was never diagnosed with anything so I just described my panic attacks with out actually saying it also my parents donâ€™t speak English very well) all of the doctors (even a heart doctor) in the ER said I was showing symptoms of an anxiety disorder which me barely even telling them anything. 

The second day I had an appointment with the same heart doctor he said the same thing (anxiety and nervousness) and put heart monitor on me. 

My dad told my mom what the doctor said and my mom told to stop being nervous and â€œget myself out of this moodâ€. I had another appointment 2 days ago with another doctor was reading â€œshowing symptoms of anxiety disorderâ€ out loud to herself there were 2 doctors in the room and the other doctor basically asked me if I was a scaredy-cat and I said no... then the doctor told me to just eat healthy and exercise and to come to the ER if it happens again... it never stopped 
 When I went home I told my mom what the doctor said she told me to stop overreacting and Iâ€™m fine.

Im Tiered no one can help I just want to die.
