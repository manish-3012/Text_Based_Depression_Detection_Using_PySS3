TodaySo I stayed home from work for two days. Yesterday smoked weed and slept. Today just slept and couldnâ€™t stop thinking about suicide. My plan was finally to go outside with a sheet, tie it to a tree or pole and jump. It would be so easy and final. Iâ€™ve been suicidal for almost 35 years. Had a few attempts but nothing needing hospitalization. When does this stop? Will it ever stop? Is there a â€œother side.â€ It just sucks! I wonder if I would have done this 35 years ago would I be at peace. Kinda hard to tell but I do believe in an after life.
