I'm sure I'm gonna kill myselfHopefully today I will but I'm a coward so I might not. But it doesn't matter. Ill kill myself one day. Tomorrow today a year from now, it doesn't matter. I've excepted that ill never change and I'm to sick to ever live a life that makes me fill fulfilled. I'm not happy with any thing in life. Money means nothing to me. Objects mean nothing to me. My own life or feelings mean nothing to me. I've only stayed around this long cause im just a fucking pussy. To scared of not existing. Just as scared of living. I will either kill myself or live a life of nothing. Just pain. Day after day of this fucking insanity. I just really hope i can bring myself to do it. I don't want to live this monotony. The same thing over and over till I die a sad old man. I would rather die than that. I want to go walk a couple blocks to the highway and walk into traffic. My only options left in life are to live with my parents till they die cause I'm to fucked up to even work or to kill myself now. That I truly believe. Those are my options and i hope I have the balls to choose the right one. I think my last thought will be what evil being makes a person to just have them be born so sick in the head they can't even enjoy existence. So sick nothing can make them happy or whole. So sick they can't work or live a normal life... So sick they just burn and break everything they touch.
