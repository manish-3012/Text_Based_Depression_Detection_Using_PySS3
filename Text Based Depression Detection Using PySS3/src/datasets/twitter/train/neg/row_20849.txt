I donâ€™t know what to doMy friends have moved away. Iâ€™m so lonely and I donâ€™t know what to do. I canâ€™t sleep and I feel like nobody cares about me. Iâ€™m moving out of my parents house soon for 4th year of university because I feel like I need some space but I think itâ€™s only gonna make things worse because I have no one to talk to. I feel suicidal but Iâ€™m so afraid of dying.
