One question, why do people act like it ever gets better?It won't. I have been bipolar as fuck for 6-7 years now and nothing fixes it. It just gets worse and worse until I die. But to be fair I do deserve it. I am definitely a piece of shit who should kill himself, so it isn't really a bad thing. It just sucks you know? It would've been so much better if I wasn't born in the first place but unfortunately for everyone here I am. And it's soooooo selfish of me for killing myself if I decided to do it right? Because it's not like I have thought of anyone else but myself right? That's why I want to kill myself right? Because I'm a selfish bastard. Sorry for posting this, I just wanted to get my thoughts out. Don't waste your time trying to help me, it won't work.  Sorry for being born.
