It's a little long, sorry. I just needed someone to know the whole story.Before we get started I would like to apologize for any lack of coherence in this. I have many thoughts filling my head, no real sense of direction with this other than getting them out and hoping for the best.

Iâ€™m not sure if I should be posting this here or not as I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m an immediate threat to myself, but at the same time I know I need to work through this, but donâ€™t know how.  I canâ€™t continue doing this, something needs to change, something needs to give and I just donâ€™t want to let it get to the point where I would be a threat to myself.  I apologize if I should be posting this a different subreddit. 

Hereâ€™s some basic information about me just to get us going. Iâ€™m a single 27 year old male. I was molested by my older female cousins when I was five. I have gone to therapy before, but did not disclose this information to my therapist at the time and returning to therapy is currently not an option. I lost my mom to cancer and have since been largely disowned by my family after coming out as an atheist, which happened shortly after her funeral.  I am unemployed with roughly $27k worth of student loans to pay off.  Unfortunately I was unable to finish school due to lack of funding, so I donâ€™t even have anything to show for my efforts aside from my debt. 

About the only thing I have going for myself is that I somehow managed to make some amazing friends.  They donâ€™t really know everything that is going on, but they are kind enough to let me crash on their couch rent free. They know there is no way I could possibly pay rent, so they donâ€™t even ask for any money at all. I offer to help pay for food, but they donâ€™t allow it. Honestly I would be beyond fucked if not for them.  Being in this situation makes me feel like absolute shit though. I canâ€™t help but feel that Iâ€™m taking advantage of them. I help clean up around the house, fix their computers  and basically do whatever I can, to help them out, but it doesnâ€™t feel like enough. 

I see no real forward direction in my life that makes me question what I have to live for. I know Iâ€™m going to have a hard life ahead of me and that as I get older it will only get worse. Iâ€™m in constant pain due to injuries I sustained playing soccer in my youth and have already been told by doctors that I need joint replacement surgery.  Even if things were going well for me I donâ€™t know that I would want to grow old and deal with my medical issues.

Knowing what I have to look forward to with my medical problems as I get older has also had the effect of taking away my motivation. I feel like Iâ€™m just going through the motions of trying to find work and trying to get my shit together, but really, I just donâ€™t even care. I feel empty and like Iâ€™ve ran into a wall. I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m doing with my life, I donâ€™t know where Iâ€™m going and I donâ€™t have any direction or path in life. I feel like a waste of oxygen and that despite billions of years of evolutionary success leading up to me, Iâ€™m a complete failure and my genetic lineage should end with me, preferably sooner rather than later.

Thanks for taking the time to read this. You donâ€™t have to worry about me doing anything drastic for the time being, I just hope to avoid letting it go that far. Sorry , if I somehow had a negative impact on your day by putting this out here for you to read.
