Tired and depressedI'm so tired to wake up every day feeling like trash. Always tired and burned out. Constant feeling of depression and stress 

It feels like I'm slowly dying I cant think straight and I've lost my creativity and I cant have any fun with anything or have any sort of satisfaction or excitement 
Everything i wanted to do I've failed. All the relationships and friends I've fucked up. Opportunitys it feels like I screwed up my life after missing out on so much and being left out. I no longer have anyone and I'm only getting deeper unable to get out of this mess. Everytime I freak out with somebody about my depression or im too mentally drained they leave me or post half-assed responses not caring at the slightest or ignore I got no social skills or interaction anymore 

What pisses me off is how every body is getting better or progressing. Going forward having amazing opportunities great friends and careers. Having fun and being able to do shit. while I just fail at everything I try to do and my brain can't handle it no matter how hard I try and literally nobody seems to care about me and it hurts. It's like I'm cursed with something. I dont know why and I dont know what everybody thinks of me at this point but everybody seems like a fake plastic two faced prick

It's really starting to get to me I cant handle this and I dont know if I'm making sense at this point. I really dont know
