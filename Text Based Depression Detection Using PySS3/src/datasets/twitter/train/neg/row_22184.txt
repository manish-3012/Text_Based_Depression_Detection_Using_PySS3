I just feel no need to be alive.Everyday is a struggle to go on. I even have the way I want to kill myself. I go to the Tri-Rail every Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday to get to work. I want to jump in front of the Tri-Rail. I have had depression for so many years. I am just married, but all we do is fight, so I just have nothing to live for. Not a single thing to try to get me to go on everyday. My cats are back at home with my family in Baltimore. I hate living here. My husband lives in Trinidad. My roommates get to be in love and be with each other where I rely on Skype to be with my husband. Dear lord I JUST CANNOT TAKE IT ANYMORE! The thing that stops me from killing myself is that I am afraid of the afterlife. I think I am growing less and less afraid now.
