Mom might have been right... Maybe suicide really is the answer.Haven't seen my therapist in like a month and a half because I had to travel for work and then she had some trainings to go to the week I came back.

I didn't want to go. Work has been a huge stressor in my life the last several months and things have gotten way worse the last few weeks. She knows about my suicidal ideation and that I got a gun recently, but she doesn't know about my aborted attempt about a month ago. 

And honestly... I'm just barely hanging on here. I hate the military. I hate the toxic environment in my unit. My best/only friend just moved away, and my supervisor is making my life a living hell. My family sucks... They only care when I can help solve their problems. I'm just so over it all. My mom killed herself 7 years ago, and I think she had the right idea.

I don't know why I haven't just pulled the trigger yet.
