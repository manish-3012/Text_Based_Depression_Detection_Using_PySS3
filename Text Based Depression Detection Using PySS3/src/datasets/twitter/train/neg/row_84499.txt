Just learned about suicide prevention awareness month. Apparently I'm not just suicidal, autistic, depressed, an ideot and have ADHD; BUT I WAS ALSO BORN ON FUCKING SUICIDE AWARENESS PREVENTION MONTH!!!I feel like this has at least *something* to do with my depression and the fact that im fucking suicidal!
