Death looks so peaceful, so comfortable... My heart breaks for myself.I've been posting here for over a week now, I've tried to reach to others, my heart breaks for myself and for all of you, none of us deserve this.

At this moment I would prefer for anything, any fucking in my body to hurt, just not to feel this, just to get rid of depression.. this is the (one of the) most fucking horrible things someone can suffer of, it's taken over my life, I can't enjoy anything anymore..

I get so much support, I have people who love me, whereas others have no one and nothing, but I'm still hurting so much, they ask me every day if I'm better, and I want them to stop worrying and not to suffer, so I tell them that yes, it's a bit better today..

but it never is, and that's why I'm trying to be patient with the meds my doctor put on almost 2 weeks ago, but death now looks more comfortable than ever.

The problem is that I don't want anyone to suffer, to be in my pain because of me, specially my parents, I would rather be sent go through hell that cause them any pain, but guys... it's getting so fucking hard, I don't know how much longer I can keep this up.

I fear that one of these days I might kill myself against my will, if that makes any sense.
