Hate when people act like itâ€™s your own fault for having zero motivationIâ€™m sorry I canâ€™t find a reason to try. Iâ€™m sorry there is nothing left that seems worth striving and working towards. We canâ€™t all have hobbyâ€™s and passions and motivations that keep us going and itâ€™s no ones fault of someone doesnâ€™t have those things. People can have a differant outlook to things and thatâ€™s not there fault. Itâ€™s no one fault, itâ€™s just how it is
