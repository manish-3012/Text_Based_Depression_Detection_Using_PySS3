Getting concerned and scaredI had acquired both depression and anxiety some years ago; have been relatively stable on meds for a while now.

I don't really have a history of being suicidal, always been too scared of death. At worst, I'd get "bursts" of feeling like ending it but it would usually happen once every few months and would never last long.

Now, however, I am getting increasingly concerned. Got the invasive thoughts and desperation, if you will, two or three days ago. Except, this time, they are not going away. Quite the opposite, even. To make matters worse, I was going to bring it up at my psych appointment this week but it got cancelled.

I can't say I will attempt anything at this current state but I doubt I can last long.

It's scary.
