Insomnia Depression Suicidal thoughtsHaven't slept well for about three weeks, mostly staying up late due to not being able to sleep, and contemplating suicide and or self harm. Been in meds before they don't work - medically incurable or immune - been hospitalised six times this year but this was done through boarding school, away from home. It's holidays and I also moved schools so now its harder to get help as I'm anxious as heck to ask mum to take me from anxiety that she would react badly. She's told me to grow up and or that it is selfish to commit suicide... wonder if she's contemplated it or lost one to suicide. But I'm thinking of going to ward when I get home... I'm currently away from home with relatives (inner family). Though I've been to this hospital countless times (broken bones, asthma, alergic reactions and operations) that I could map out some parts of it, I'm still anxious to go and or go without telling mum or a family member as they would try stopping me and getting me to just sleep the night, which just prolongs everything and makes me worse.

I'm 16 and in Australia so law wise I think mum could withdraw me.... untill I'm 18.
