Why the fuck must I be in a position that forces me to live even though I don't fucking want toI want to fucking die, I really do. I didn't even feel sad walking home, I was just thinking about how I would even get to the rail station to kill myself. Then it hit me that I can't fucking kill myself anyway, I'm an only child, and because my parents had refused to have another kid when they were still together, I have to force myself to continue living my pointless, empty fucking life. Worse still, they're good parents, so I can't even just say fuck it and let them deal with the pain. Fuck, why couldn't I just have one fucking sibling at least? Just one and I could die, at least my parents would still have another kid. But nope, only child, so I get to continue living my sad fucking life, with my one friend that has nothing in common with me and only likes smoking weed, at this awful fucking college where I don't fit in that has completely destroyed my future, in this awful fucking city I can't even leave because I made the mistake of getting a house for next semester. I want to fucking die.
