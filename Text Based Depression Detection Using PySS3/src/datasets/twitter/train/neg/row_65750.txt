Iâ€™m lostIâ€™ll spare the details and long sob story but basically the average bad childhood, bad family life, been fucked over by anyone Iâ€™ve ever let into my life. Iâ€™m out of school didnâ€™t go to college have no career path and have always been depressed and suicidal from a very young age, I didnâ€™t see myself living to 18 my whole life and I turned 19 a few months ago and I have no idea what to do. I hate my life, I hate the person I was and am I feel so guilty about horrible things I did in the past and I feel like I could never live down I donâ€™t want to be me. Realistically no one really wants to die they just donâ€™t want to live the life they have I just canâ€™t stand being me itâ€™s so draining I feel so worthless and like such a piece of shit from awful things Iâ€™ve done in my past I donâ€™t know how to live like this just hating myself and everything I ever was I donâ€™t want to be me I donâ€™t want these drowning feelings I feel like I can never get out of this endless pit of pain, guilt, and abuse Iâ€™ve went through. I just feel like Iâ€™ve made every wrong choice I could have ever made throughout my whole life and I canâ€™t deal with all my mental illnessâ€™ I have I donâ€™t want to die but I donâ€™t want to live as myself
