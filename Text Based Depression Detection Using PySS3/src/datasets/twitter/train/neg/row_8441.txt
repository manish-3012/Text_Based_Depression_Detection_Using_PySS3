I've been thinking about it a lot moreFirst off, here's why.

I've struggled with self harm, anxiety and depression for years now. No medication will work, and I'm pretty sure I'm going mad.

I'm a worthless human being to whoever I know. I don't have any friends anymore. My family is all dead. So I'm stuck here in hell, alone. I had a boyfriend for awhile, well until he couldn't stand me being depressed and left me for some airhead. 

I've got nothing to live for, no person, no pet, no kids, nothing. So tonight I was thinking about a hotel and a gun.

Just somebody to talk to, please.
