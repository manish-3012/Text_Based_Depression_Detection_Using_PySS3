one year ago tomorrowi remember one year ago tomorrow. we were at a friends house for a party. i was feeling troubled and i dont like big social gatherings so i mostly kept to myself. 

but then we went home together, and i cried. and u held me &amp; wiped my tears. and we tucked in to bed and fell asleep. 

and now i am here, alone in our house. iâ€™ll probably spend tomorrow alone. and the next day, and the next. until the next time you call for me, iâ€™ll come alive. flip me off and on like a switch. 

itâ€™s not right. nothing is. and youâ€™re doing just fine, even BETTER without me. and i am a wreck. thereâ€™s no hope. i hope this weekend i get to feeling really shitty and horrible and get the courage to do something to end it. 

i miss you
