Can't take it anymoreI truly feel broken beyond repair I have been in therapy and it seems like my life is only getting worse and worse. It is all a decline I lost my job, cheated on, moved far away from friends, false rape allegations, verbally abusive mom, no money, im unhireable just due to me not being able to work over Christmas. I don't know how to relate to people. I am home schooled so I can't meet new people... I am just done with all of this shit seriously I have ativan and alcohol and I knew this would happen.
