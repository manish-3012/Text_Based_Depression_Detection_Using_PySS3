Has anyone been able to change themselves in a significant way?I think about killing myself every day, like a daydream that makes me feel better. My depression and reasons for being such a waste of space are all completely self-caused, though. I'm a worthless excuse for a person, all my life I've been a drain or leech on others and I have nothing to show for it except for broken friendships and wasted opportunities. The most intense feelings are those of personal shame and regret after existing for so long as a selfish, lazy bigot. I've been drinking and smoking for about 3 years to get my mind off of it but it's come to a point where those habits have only made me way worse and I just want to die and stop existing this way. It's so hard to change. Has anyone else had success or known of people who have had success with changing who they are and their life?
