I almost did it last night because when I woke up I thought I was still dreaming.I had just committed suicide in my dream and it woke me up, also I had to pee. When I woke up I was still really hazy and kinda of half in half out of dream state. Like the dream world was kind of meshing with my house. Which is very out of norm for me cause when Iâ€™m up, Iâ€™m up. As I come back from the bathroom I remember I forgot to take my medication before bed because I fell asleep watching videos. I go to take my meds and as I try to shimmy them out they just all pour out into my palm. This kinda triggers me back into the dream state cause it was the same as in my dream and I almost swallow the palm full. I havenâ€™t had an attempt yet for about 5 seconds there I was there I was at that point and I felt it. Luckily I snapped myself back. But that feeling was terrifying. Itâ€™s even scarier cause itâ€™s like I almost killed myself subconsciously or by accident. But I let my spouse know and I have an appointment on Monday and we have implemented safety measures in the mean time so Iâ€™m safe at the moment.
