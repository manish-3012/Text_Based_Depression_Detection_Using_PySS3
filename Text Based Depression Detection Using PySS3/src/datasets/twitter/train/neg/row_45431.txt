I'm going to die aloneMy SO always does his best for me and whenever I feel nasty or selfharm he tells me that we're gonna get through this together, that he'll always love me etc etc but I always feel dreadful when he says this. I don't deserve love. I'm a gross rat who should've died long before meeting such a beautiful person. My last ex dumped me because she realised how horrible I was and ditched me for her own safety, as anyone should. I don't deserve people to care about me. My SO always tells me we'll die together, but I fear one day he's going to get sick of me and my unstable personality.
Today I started cutting again.
