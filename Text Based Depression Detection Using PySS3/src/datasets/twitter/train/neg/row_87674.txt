My little brothers best friend just killed himself, how do I support him?My brother just called me while I was out at lunch, he was in tears, he found out his best friend (John doe) killed himself this morning. 


The friend we all knew and hung out with, my brother has been friends with him since grade school almost. John was funny and fun to hang out with, then he started getting into painkillers, soon it turned heroin... We all stopped hanging out with him regularly, his girlfriend got fed up with the drugs and left... And now this.

We just saw him on Friday, he was supposed to be a groom in my brothers wedding, he seemed happy...


Me and my gf took off of work instantly and are now otw home, my brother is there waiting for us.


How do I be a good big brother and support with this situation? I've never dealt with it before and
I'm trying to hold back tears on the bus home... How can I support him? What do I say to him? Should I get us a bottle of vodka and some pot from the dispensary to calm the mood? Should we stay sober?


Tl;dr - my brothers best friend killed himself, how do I support him?
