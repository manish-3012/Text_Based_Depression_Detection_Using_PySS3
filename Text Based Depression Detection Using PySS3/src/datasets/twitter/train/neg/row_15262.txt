I'm sick of sharpening a nonexistent pencil with a half-hearted handBreaking whatever this is down into terse sentences because otherwise it would be incoherent.

- haven't been diagnosed with anything, but struggled with a melancholic aimlessness ever around the age of seven

- understood that living had no point, but turned it into an excuse not to study and be spoiled

- ten years later: grew up, but it feels like I haven't changed at all and worsened in some aspects

- settled for mediocrity. Forgot or ignored some essential life skills (hygiene, grades, social skills and Determination) that resulted in bullying and a great decline of my already dismal self-esteem

- "whatever. Keep trudging on. With your inability to do anything right, you'll probably fuck up suicide too."

- bit by bit, lost interest in previous passions as concentration dithered. Have faint dreams or ambitions, but I don't get or complete them because I can't invest myself into anything. Losing interest in everything else, even the time sinkers. Everything including myself is so vapid and superficial

- be like this until junior year, trying out all those self-help mantras with college on the way (I will Ambition without Wanting! I will Succeed without Putting in 100%!), until the Cancer Nation attacks and takes the only person who (somehow) gave a shit about me: my mother, who raised me alone because my real dad's an abusive asshole. 

- She's one of those people who went to the gym at least four times a week and bought organic vegetables to turn into green juices. She died within the span of a month and spent the last two weeks of her life with little to no brain activity.

- she tried to help me the most, offering lesson after lesson and weekend after weekend just for me, but I fuck that up too and reject her and her love. Was afraid she'd find out and become a bigger problem to her than I already was (am), something she didn't deserve with her working to the bone to get where she was.

- spent January wondering how to get my shit together with no one left to provide and how to eat all the food people keep giving

- spent February fucking up harder than January

- likely spending March sinking deeper into the abyss

- it's hard to go to school when feeling like a waste of space and time not just for society, but for the people who pat me on the back or send me "are u ok" messages when I fuck up and break down. Friends aren't my therapists. Can't confide in them without disrupting the harmony. Therapy doesn't seem to help either.

- missed too many opportunities to even settle for security

- becoming hyper aware of my faults despite knowing that no one gives a shit and drained whenever talking to people for too long

- at fifteen I vowed that if I still didn't find the point at eighteen, I'd fly to somewhere isolated, drive to a remote area in said area and go with carbon monoxide poisoning. It's still a viable option now

- I'm too much of the wrong things and too little of the good to end up somewhere, let alone anywhere

- externalization used to help. Now it doesn't. Wake up in the morning feeling too tired to smile and ask other people about their days when small talk comes

- I know I could be experiencing actual problems (human trafficking, my own cancer (like I'm not cancer already), be entrapped in poverty), and that just because life is pointless doesn't mean I can't make the best out of it. I know.  I want to begin each sentence with something other than "I," but life itself is a yoke best delegated to those who can handle the heat. I'm me. I'm a piece of self-aware waste who realizes her insignificance. 

- typing this out because echo chambers are fun when no one knows who you are and will forget

- might go to Germany this December and do the deed if I swim into deeper waters of indifference; haven't reached the stage of numbing apathy yet. There are times I'm on the verge.

- meditation may at least help with calming myself down, and the Practical Guide to Suicide is relaxing to read a bit of at night

- sorry for typing too much. Oh-oh, brevity, it's working against me

- I hate myself and am indifferent to myself but still utilize humor to cope with the drudgery. Yay.

- my mother would be disappointed in me and my overwrought complex(ities) reminiscent of the below-average Tumblr poetry blog. Hell, even Lang Leav can do better than the mess above.
