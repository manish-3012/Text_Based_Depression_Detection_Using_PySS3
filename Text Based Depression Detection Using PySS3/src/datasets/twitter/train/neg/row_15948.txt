ONLY 361 DAYS LEFT...I've lost my temper...I don't want this life anymore...whatever I wanted I've written it in my diary...I am going to spend the last 361 days of my life in meditation, reading books, and crying for my own death... I'd like to thank my parents for pushing me till my limits....FOR DEATH the main reason of my suicide is my PARENTS
