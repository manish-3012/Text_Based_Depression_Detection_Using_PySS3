Debating if death, homelessness, or a terrible job is the best option.I went to school my whole life, got a couple of useless degrees, got out and unsurprisingly couldn't handle the real world.

I've been unemployed three years now and I've accepted a retail job. I used to have one, it was honestly soul crushing, so I know exactly how bad it'll be. I slept all the time I didn't work. There's no point to living like that. 

Since I'm actually a giant baby who can't handle basic shit, I've now got a few days to decide if dying is the best option. I'm probably just going to do it. I hate everything.
