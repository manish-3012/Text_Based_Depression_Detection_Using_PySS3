Iâ€™m Fighting A Losing Battle At This PointYeah I post about wanting to die and all that but Iâ€™m honestly being really serious when I say this

There is no hope

Literally no hope for me

My whole plan for 2020 has been officially ruined by this pandemic

Now I have no choice but to conform with college because if I donâ€™t my life will be miserable because my parents wonâ€™t let me get a job and I wonâ€™t be able to move out. Because Iâ€™m living in their house theyâ€™ll torture me because they can until I finally give up

My parents always win no matter what. This time it was just a fucking cheap shot because of covid 19

I was SO close to finally going through with my plan

But not only am I still jobless and back to being in my room all day, but I havenâ€™t even started on the movie I was supposed to make. I made a promise I thought I could keep. Now I probably have to face my 1000 fans and tell them I just canâ€™t make the movie

Iâ€™m way too depressed to even do my school assignments. I havenâ€™t submitted a single assignment all month. I keep telling myself tomorrow I need to catch up on my work but I never do, I just sit in my bed contemplating suicide while listening to music and the last day of school is this Thursday

All Iâ€™ve done throughout this quarantine is procrastinate and contemplate suicide. Thereâ€™s too many obstacles now. I just canâ€™t handle it anymore, and Iâ€™m finally accepting that Iâ€™m fighting a losing battle and Iâ€™m not going to win

So hopefully this week my parents will go to Louisiana again and Iâ€™ll finally end my life. Iâ€™ll post an update before I delete my account and die like I should

Itâ€™s pointless to keep living now. I said Iâ€™d die if I couldnâ€™t make 2020 my year and it looks like I couldnâ€™t

Unless 6k-12k dollars just magically appears in my bank account I do not expect a miracle anytime soon. If a miracle does happen like that then I clearly have a purpose in life but for now.. nope nope nope
