Im 100% alone no one wants me not even as a friendPeople avoid me irl life no one wants to even sit next to me in class, i try to reach out online but people just ghost me, i used to have ( or i thought i had) a really good friend we would talk to each other everyday but now he wont even reply to my messages and only talks to me when he needs something when he doesnt he just ignores me, i dont feel human anymore its life everyone hates me
