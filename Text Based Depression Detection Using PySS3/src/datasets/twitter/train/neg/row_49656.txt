Getting help?I want to stop being sad, 

I want to stop having suicidal thoughts,

I want to stop being angry all the time,

I tried to kill myself yesterday and it didn't even work... I don't really want to try calling suicide hotlines because I've heard a lot of bad stories about it even though I'm not American

I just want it to STOP
