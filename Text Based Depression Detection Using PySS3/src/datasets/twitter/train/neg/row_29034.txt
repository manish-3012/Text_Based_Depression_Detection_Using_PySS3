Death is my only way out of this hellhole of a relationshipMy boyfriend is the last good thing in my life. The last thing to give me strength and push me to keep going. Or at least he was until he became a cold abusive monster. Weâ€™ve been together for 5 years and I loved him so much. I still love him but I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m still with him. Probably because Iâ€™m terrified to be alone and I still am holding onto the last shred of hope that he will change.

He cheats on me compulsively, when heâ€™s angry with me he doesnâ€™t let me leave the house and physically blocks me from leaving, hell kick or shove me, anytime Iâ€™m talking  about anything Iâ€™m slightly interested in he talks down to me like Iâ€™m stupid, he forces me to have sex with him and guilt trips me when I donâ€™t, I told him he was turning out to be a monster like his dad and he kicked and stomped on me on floor while calling me a stupid bitch.

I was always sad, but I still had a small sparkle. I used to bubble up when talking about my favorite tv shows or hobbies, I used to be the life of the party, i was always sad but sometimes I could be really fucking happy.

Thatâ€™s all completely gone now though. Iâ€™m a shell of the person I once was. He took away everything from me and I let him. Iâ€™m such pathetic fucking loser. 

Despite the feelings of worthlessness and misery he brings me, he is all I have. Itâ€™s either him or Iâ€™m alone, and I canâ€™t handle being alone. Death will be my only sweet escape from this nightmare of a relationship and life and I just canâ€™t wait for it to be here. I know it will be soon, whenever I can save up enough money to buy a shit ton of Xanax or heroine. I donâ€™t do drugs but I know they will kill me. Iâ€™ll make sure he finds my body and knows he did this to me.
