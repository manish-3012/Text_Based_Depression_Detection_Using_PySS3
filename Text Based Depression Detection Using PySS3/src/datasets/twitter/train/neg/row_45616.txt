The Hole: A short story about my lifeIt just gets worse and worse and i try so fucking hard to make something better that is wrong or find something to make me happy or to slow my hole from being dug any deeper but nothing works so i keep on digging ive never tried to disappear from life but ive been close plenty of times every time it seems like ive slowed down the digging it was just a hallucination and i snap out to find myself digging at just the same pace. Im waiting any day now for strangers to come to my hole and move my hole to a little cage in a big building with cold floors and steel rods all around maybe thatâ€™s what i need to get better or maybe Itll make me dig a bigger hole maybe the only way i can stop digging this hole is by disappearing i cant just keep digging though and nothing i try works when i dig this hole people fall in anyone who is near to me the slip or dont notice the hole and sometimes i pull them in on accident because ive gotten real good at disguising the hole either way the hole cant go much deeper ive almost dug myself to china and when i dig to china theres no going back to where i started.
