I just want to go.I don't feel anything. I feel empty. Lonely. And I know that my shitty life is my fault, but there's no point taking chances trying to fix it because it's still just as likely I'll be stuck in the same spot again.

Tell me how to die. I have no fun, but I just want to go. Be free. Away from this evil world, but mostly, away from MYSELF
