I tried to kill my self today.One week ago my father told me that I stole his money. I did not steal it. But I could not to prove it.  He humiliated me and I got mad and I wanted to put him outside for one, or two hours. But my mother tried to stop me. Then he fell on floor. He started to scream: help, this thief will kill me!. I hurt and humiliated me a lot. I spat on his face and I kicked him with fist in stomach.

After that I left a room. I cant remember where I was. Than I came back to room. I started to swear and to search this money and to trow things everywhere.

After that I realized what mistake I made. Feeling of guilt started to kill me. I cant forgive my self what I did. How could I do this to other human being?

And this morning I decided to kill my self. I made suicide note. Then I made fire in fireplace. I opened a door of fireplace and smoke was going in room. Room was full of smoke. I was thinking there was carbon-monoxide and I will fall into sleep and die. I was waiting one hour but nothing happened. After one hour I changed my mind.
