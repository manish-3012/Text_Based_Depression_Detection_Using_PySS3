My fear of receiving helpI've been experiencing issues with my mental health for quite some time. One day I was feeling extremely suicidal and overdosed on anxiety meds. I somehow survived and the next day, I decided to talk to my therapist about it. She almost had me admitted for a week. The thought of it gave me terrible anxiety and i refused. 

I have issues with dissociation. It happens quite often, and for some reason, i believe that having myself admitted to any kind of hospital/institute will only worsen my dissociation. I still struggle with suicidal thoughts and self harm. I've been in a situation where I've taken a bunch of pills. I wanted to take 40. But out of fear i stopped at about 18-20. I started feeling REALLY REALLY ill. I started vomiting and aching all over. I  wanted to call an ambulance but i was terrified of being sent away to a mental institute.

Does anyone else experience this? I feel like my fears are irrational... And sometimes i regret not calling the ambulance that one night because obviously i needed help. I really feel stuck on this.
