Just feeling hopeless..Recently I've been feeling really down and it just seems to be getting worse and worse. I feel like I'm drowning in a sea of unrelentless work and social issues. To make matters worse I've just reached out to my boyfriend.. guy I've been with for years.. for help and he basically told me that he was to tired. I even told him how depressed I'm feeling, I just feel so unloved and unwanted right now. 
I'm reaching the point where I just want to not be here and feel like this anymore.
