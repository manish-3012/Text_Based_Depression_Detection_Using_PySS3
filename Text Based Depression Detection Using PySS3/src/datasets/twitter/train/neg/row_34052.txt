Why can't I be judged by my personality, not my looks?Hi, this is probably my last post. I've been depressed secretly since I was 12,  'm 15 now and a sophomore, alot of things have happened in those few years, including lots of bullies judging me because I'm skinny, because I have glasses, and all that other stupid shit. I also have a hard time starting cnversations so its hard for me to make friends. All in all it has really taken it's toll on me and has driven me to the edge. I just want to feel loved, my parents never make me feel loved. Even a simple friendship would make feel cared about, I want to feel needed. 

This world is fucked up and needs a change. Why the fighting? If we all showed each other love, the world would be a better place.  Of course that will never happen. I plan to leave this world soon, I just don't know when, or what method to use. Thanks for reading this, hopefully  meet some in the next life.... 

Goodbye,
