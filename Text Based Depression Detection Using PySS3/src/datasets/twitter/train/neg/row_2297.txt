IncelLol.

With many disease. acne, GERD, poor eyesight, poor teeth, aspergers, anxiety, depression, PTSD, fat, dizziness, dysautonomia..... How could I become so pathetic?

Worrying about not have a real relationship with good romance and sex. I have been with a trans woman only for months when I was 19, but anything is AWFUL. We donâ€™t do anal but Iâ€™m afraid of getting disease so I never come up with any idea about anal sex.

And she is a terrible person, really terrible. Even she wanted me to be her boyfriend.

Iâ€™m afraid of being laughed as gay (Iâ€™m heterosexual) and virgin.

No motivation on learning social skills and outfit......even hairdo. So does dating. Even I attend too less events or courses, ha.

I do so many wrong decisions in these five years even seven years, or whole life. I wish I can restart my life after suicide, but time wonâ€™t be backwards.......

Why should I dropped out so many times????????? Why should I have no motivation on having a good female partner?

Why I do not do so much self-improvement, even I have so many hobbies and interests?

Nevermind, I do not have any expectations, no hope to my future.

Maybe next day, next month, next year. Death is approaching me....
