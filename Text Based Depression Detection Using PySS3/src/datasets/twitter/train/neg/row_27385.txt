I don't know if I actually want to kill myself.I have had suicidal ideation since I was 12, when I found out what suicide was. I'm 22 now. I think have thought about suicide almost every day since then, and have made multiple half-assed attempts. I have anemia, and used to get dizzy sometimes. When I almost fainted once (saw static, couldn't stand) I was terrified. I just needed to vent.
