I've quit drugs but I can't get betterhello..wondering if anyone else feels the same as I do.

Throughout highschool and until I was 23, I was heavily addicted to anything I could get my hands on, from weed and adderall to heroin. I am now 26 years old, and still feel horrible and want to kill myself every day.

What's made it even worse is drugs have compeletely destroyed my appeaerance. As a female, this had made "moving on" so difficult. I think I will be alone forever, because no one would want to be with someone who looks like me. 

I can never calm down, I am always tense and stressed, I always want to either distract myself until my brain hurts or lose consciousness completely.  

I will never be who I was meant to be, I will never be as smart as I could have been or as pretty as I could have been. I feel like a walking corpse basically....I just want to take the last step through the door.
