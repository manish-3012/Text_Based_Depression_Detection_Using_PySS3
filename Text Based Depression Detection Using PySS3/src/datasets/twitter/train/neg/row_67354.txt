Having a hard timeI attempted recently and was rescued.  Now they have me on some meds. But idk if it's enough.  I thought I was feeling somewhat better but today I feel so unglued. So many things set me off, trigger, self destructive feelings.  12 cut marks on my wrists later... Cutting didn't give me the release it usually does.  Idk what I am trying to say.. I don't think I will try to kill myself today. I'm just stressed.
