I need someoneMy first suicide letter was before I went to high school, I wasn't even ten. I am 35. I went to a clinic once and they took me in and I had to leave for some stuff. I promised to return but it took a while and when I came there with bags in hand, weeks later, a different doctor sent me away.
I was in therapy once and I was so ashamed that I couldn't be properly depressed for my therapist. I stopped going when the money ran out. 
Once, a professor arranged for me to see a psychiatrist. He gave me pills. They made me anxious but I could get out of bed. I put on so much weight. And my family told me that my sickness didn't matter. I had to write my thesis. I did. Then I was unemployed. Lost weight. Had a a bmi of 16. It was a light feeling.

I asked everyone I knew to help me. And they all left. I don't blame them. I wish I hadn't asked. Now I have no one who even knows what I was like as a young girl.

I am 35. I can't kill myself because I know my brother won't take care of my parents enough. And it would kill the remnants of their marriage. I need to keep going. And I keep telling myself that I need to be strong.

But every day, for decades now, has been such a struggle. The only people who pretend to love me find me because they can sense how broken I am and that they can use me. And yet...I wish they could just pretend a little longer. Be just a little nicer so that the illusion won't shatter too early.

I know I won't ever have someone care for me. But you don't understand how tired I am. I just need the illusion. I need some idea of hope.

I am so tired.

I am just so tired.

Please. So tired.
