I shut down myself from everyone else.I skipped my classes today. I sit the whole day in front of my laptop. My only best friend came here to my room just now and I just ignored her. I switched off my phone since yesterday.  She had left. I sit here, alone in my hostel room. I have a knife and a bunch of paracetamol on my desk. I'm not crying, just feeling numb and senseless. I'm a mess.

Edit: I'm a bit shaky as I'm typing this. Just puked out the pills but not all. I'm going to contact my friend. Thank you again for your support.
