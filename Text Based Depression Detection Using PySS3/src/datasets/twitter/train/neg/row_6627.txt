everyone beats me down and i get yelled at, im forced to choose between happiness or obedienceand even if i choose one of them the other will beat it to a pulp. if i want to be happy those who want me to be obedient will emotionally and verbally abuse me. and if i want to be obedient i won't be happy. im forced to choose between my mental and physical well-being, and if i choose one the other will destroy me. i feel like there's nothing I can do, and I feel like I'm going down a never-ending spiral
