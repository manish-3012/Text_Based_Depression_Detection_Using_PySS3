I am definitely going to kill myselfIt may not be today or tomorrow, but one day I'll snap. I hate being alive and I hate myself so fucking much. I lack the most basic social skills to live in this society. I have no friends and I bring joy to absolutely no one's life. I feel like a constant pain to people and no matter how hard I try they only pity me. I'm weak, pathetic, and a loser. I seriously just want to end this chaotic life, before I get hurt even more.
