How do I convince myself that I am worth anything?How do I convince myself that I am worth anything? I've been entertaining the thought of taking that 5 hour drive to a very remote place where I can be alone and end it in peace. I can feel that I'm starting to accept that thought. That maybe it's how things are supposed to play out. And that thought doesn't scare me anymore. I'm not even tired. I've had enough.
