Well than.I'm 14 and angsty so don't read if you don't like annoying rants.

I've been diagnosed with depression so I went to therapy yesterday and was honest that I've been feeling like shit and have planned two ways to die but haven't acted on them yet and we spent most of the time planning on an emergency plan for if i do it and who he can call and blah blah and he recommended i go to a psychologist to get antidepressants because he didn't know I was feeling depressed enough to want to die until now but anyway he printed a paper with all this info on it and a reminder for the date I'm going to the psychologist and him again. (He talked to my mom and made sure she's okay with going to a psychologist.) My therapist said that I'm supposed to be able to choose if i take pills or not and keep therapy information to myself but i accidentally left the paper in the car. My mom read it. Shes anti drugs and apparently thinks she absolutely needs to get involved somehow and now apparently wants to help by bringing up a dead animal we saw on the side of the road a week ago! :) And apparently reading the paper that i was allowed to have confidentiality with was love or something. the last time i told her i was feeling all she said was "well thats stupid." She didn't care to help than so why does she want to now? How would she? She's literally just reminding me of a gruesomely smashed animal and asking me "hOw DoEs ThAt MaKe YoU fEeL?" Jesus Christ. End of spoiled teenager rant thanks for listening~
