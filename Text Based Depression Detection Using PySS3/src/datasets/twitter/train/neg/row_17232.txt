Im tired of it allI'm not sure where to start with what I hate about my life but as each day passes I see less and less reason not to just kill myself. Its Like with each day I have less hope it will ever get better or I'll ever be happy. I regret almost every decision I've ever made. I just want the pain to stop. The disappoinment. Then everything around me is a reminder of how people are happy or doing the things I couldn't do. I heard a story about someone and my first thought was that for me to get that lucky it would take reincarnation. And I thought that really is my best shot and what reason so I have not to. I don't even believe in reincarnation but the idea is better than my life
