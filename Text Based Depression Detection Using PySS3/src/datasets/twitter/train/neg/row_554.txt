Reoccuring suicide urgesI really thought I was over this part. My studies are on track, my work is on track. I've gotten wiser. I am thankful I didn't jump a year ago. I've found someone who loves me deeply and I love him. But today I got that urge again, while on the train. I don't want to die. But I'm afraid that I can't veer myself back from those thoughts. I picture loved ones dying in disturbing vivid detail and it makes me go mad with tears. Then I picture me jumping and it feels right. I know it isn't.
