GhostI just want to lie in bed and rot away.  I'm tired.  I'm tired of trying pills.  If all these different ones don't work, then maybe I don't have depression after all.  Maybe I was just born to be this way.  It seems to run in the family, after all.  Maybe I'm just a bitch with a bad attitude.  Or maybe I just never managed to learn how to survive in this world.  All the privilege in the world won't save a person from herself.

Drink, smoke, eat, sleep.  Caffeine pills.  Brother, favorite brother, I know you do meth.  Does it help you?  Does it shake off your lethargy and let you function in life?  Or are you just doing it for fun because you don't feel the same way I do about life?

Lover, you are the millstone around my heart that pins me to this planet.  Set me free, let me fly away.  I cannot bear to break your heart, but I cannot bear to live like this either.  What kind of life will you have, knowing the woman you love would rather kill herself than live her life, even when that life includes you?  You have been betrayed in other ways, by other women.  Will you find a healthy relationship?  Or a string of broken girls like me?

Mother, father, siblings, you have each other for comfort.  I think one of you will not care.  I think two of you will be heartbroken, but you are strong enough to survive.  I think the rest of you know and understand what drove me here, and will be able to forgive me for it in time.
