Failed HangingYa so last night I tried to die by hanging myself. I was almost gone, then I felt every part of my body fall asleep, like pins and needles, and I freaked out and managed to get out and onto the floor barely in time. How much damage do you think it caused physically? To almost suffocate to death. Iâ€™ve had an awful headache all day and a fever, are there any long term effects I should watch out for? Idk I might try it again but Iâ€™d also like to know more of the risks I guess in case it doesnâ€™t work out again...
