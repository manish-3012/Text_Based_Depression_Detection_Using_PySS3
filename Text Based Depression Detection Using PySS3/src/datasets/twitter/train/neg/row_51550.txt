I'm done.Note: this might be a long rant, so I'm sorry in advance. 

I'm fed up with life, knowing that there are people out there who are worse off than me doesn't make my life feel any better. 

I have just been feeling nothing but numbness for the last few months, and even for Christmas. I spent it with my entire family and it was great spending time with them, but I see them all the time anyway, and I just wish it hadn't felt so underwhelming. I received a $30 piece of camera gear, some cologne and 2 articles of clothing (I have 2 siblings). I don't even like clothes, I feel like I went all out for my family and got them the best things I could find and made it as personal as I could and they didn't even bother. 

I ran away from home about a year ago and the police ended up taking me home and I pretended I wasn't that bad for their sake, but I feel like life only goes down hill from here and I have started self-harming on a semi-regular basis. 

I just feel like a nobody. If I died right now people would instantly forget me. Maybe I should die. Maybe I should just stop being a burden to everyone who cares about me because all I ever do nowadays is ruin other people having fun by being in a shitty mood.
