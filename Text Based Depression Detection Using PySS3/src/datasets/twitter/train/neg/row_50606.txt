Kill meI feel as if my life has just gotten so worthless that I want to just die. Everyday I go to bed crying feeling so worthless just seeing people around me filled with Happiness makes me realize how alone I am, even when I'm with friends I still feel lonely like everything I do is just worthless I feel as if I am nothing and that I never was anything why I feel this way I don't know maybe its my childhood that made me this way having only one friend and everybody else hating me, maybe it was just really not having any real love and support. I'm still in high school and have had multiple thoughts of killing myself as well as some attempts but I never did I thought about talking to my friends and family but they would probably just say things and tell me not to do it. I just honestly don't want to continue living besides everyone would probably think i'm insane.
