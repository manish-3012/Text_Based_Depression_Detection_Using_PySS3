Why should I have to suffer?When someone is terminally ill and they pass away itâ€™s devastating and seen as a great tragedy. However we often hear â€œat least now they arenâ€™t sufferingâ€. I get it. Mental illness can be treated. For most it will always be there, but it can be managed. So far I havenâ€™t found a way to treat it, or manage it. 

So why should I suffer with this mental prison in my brain? Every day is agony. Iâ€™m on medication, Iâ€™ve been through countless therapists and sessions. I just want to die and not have to suffer anymore. 

I just love my family too darn much to do it. I know theyâ€™re not being selfish for wanting me to stay alive since they love me and care for me. But gosh, sometimes it feels that way. Iâ€™m here just for them because their lives would be gutted, but each moment is complete agony. I rarely feel happiness and joy. I canâ€™t work or engage socially. Iâ€™m just wilting away in my home waiting to succumb to death. So why do I have to suffer to appease others? 

Does anyone else feel this way?
