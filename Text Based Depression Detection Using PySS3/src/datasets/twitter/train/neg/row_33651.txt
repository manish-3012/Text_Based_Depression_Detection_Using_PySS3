Making Plans..I havenâ€™t been coping with my SOâ€™s cheating at all. Thinking of taking my life everyday and making me feel better about life, knowing it will end soon. 

I figured I would leave the apartment that was meant to be my forever home, go to some shabby motel or great outdoors (havenâ€™t decided yet), slit the wrists upwards, thrust into my abdomen, or swallow a cup of bleach if all else fails. 

Itâ€™s a shame. I really wanted to celebrate Halloween. Now here I am writes notes and planning what Iâ€™m going to wear on my last day. If Iâ€™m going to give anyone my belongings despite having no one. I genuinely didnâ€™t have a chance in life when I was born, I might as well give up and spare myself the trouble of being in pain.
