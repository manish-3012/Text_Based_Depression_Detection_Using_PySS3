A RevelationI was just scrolling through r/MorbidReality, when I saw a picture of a brother holding his sisters hand hours before she died. 

She was just a little girl and she died of cancer... 

I got angry, kids like this were dying each and every day without a choice, and I was fucking sitting here thinking about killing myself?! 

Us, those who are suicidal and depressed, have a choice. A choice that people like that will never be able to make. 

It may be hard now, but Iâ€™ve come to the revelation that I need to work through it, push through the pain and anger harder than I have ever before. 

We, though we may not think it right now, are privileged. We have a choice at life, while others do not and yet we sit here and think about ending it? 

Please, Iâ€™m begging you to see life in the way that I now do. Lifeâ€™s hard, it will always be hard, but there are moments within that are beautiful, moments that people like that little girl will never be able to experience. 

I know Iâ€™m still going to have issues, both with anxiety and depression. But now... it seems a tiny light has opened up in a tunnel that was previously void of anything.
