I no longer wish to live but I cannot kill myself.I am very unhappy, my life is like a job I hate but I cannot quit. I cannot leave my mother, I am an only child and have no father, my suicide would kill her and I don't want that, I also do not want to let my Grandmother down or my small circle of friends. 

My life is a living nightmare and I do not know what to do.
