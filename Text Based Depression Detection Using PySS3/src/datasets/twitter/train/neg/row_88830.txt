I fear this break up broke meI've thought about suicide on and off for years due to various things in my life, I'm too lazy to write about them.

I'm sorry if what I'm about to write seems trivial. I don't think I have it in me to keep going. Life is kind of alright I guess, but not all that great. 

I just kind of feel inside that life is pointless without my ex boyfriend. He still has feelings for me but doesn't want a relationship anymore (this was an LDR).

I don't think I'm entitled to anyone, people break up, it happens. But that's another thing... I invested so much time and energy and care and thought into this relationship, I saved up for months to see him on the other side of the world (to be fair, he also saved up) for a couple of months. Then I had to leave :-(

2 months later he breaks up with me. I told him that I felt unappreciated and he agreed and that he felt bad about himself and apologized.

Why would I even want another relationship with anyone again? I'm too tired for this stuff. So I do everything and get broken up with anyway! Nobody gave him near the extent I did, his parents don't care about him much and nor does anyone else and he knows this. 

This is our second break up. The guy is going to forever have his grip on me. I'm trapped. I've thought about ending it before numerous times but this is the icing on the cake. I've been attracted to him ever since I've known him for 2.5 years. I'm pondering whether to end it in a few months or not. I just don't want to keep existing like this...

I don't know how silly or ridiculous I sound. I wonder if anyone else is going through something similar? :-(
