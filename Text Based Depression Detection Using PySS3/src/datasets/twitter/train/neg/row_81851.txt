What goes around comes aroundHard for me to express myself even through a computer screen.
After being used by everyone. It's hard for me to trust anyone or love anyone.

 I can't move forward anymore, the past still haunts me.
Been through sexual to physical abuse from family members while being bullied at school. When I was a kid.
I'm 23 and First Nation Male.
Haven't finished high school
Gave up. it was either from the hunger or the failure of every subject i took.

I guess thats it.
