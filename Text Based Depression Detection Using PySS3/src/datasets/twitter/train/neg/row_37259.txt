Very suicidalMy Pure OCD mental disorder makes instrusive thoughts make horrible images of me pop up in my head doing from everything sexual to violent disemembermenf and even darker topics Iâ€™m not ready to open up about. Iâ€™m a good person who wouldnâ€™t lay a finger on their loved ones or anyone else, but my mental health disorder makes these images come up. Iâ€™ve tried praying to God to ask him to save me from these horrible thoughts and to forgive me, but I still feel hopeless. I canâ€™t take the mental agony the tears the depression this disease is causing me any longer
