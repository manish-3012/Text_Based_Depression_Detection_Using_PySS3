An interesting observationHi everyone. I have an interesting question about this sub.
(First of all I am in a better space at the moment so this is more hypothetical right now)
Why is it that when people post that they are suicidal everyone tells them they shouldn't do it and say things that are good in the world etc and yet many of us are still actively suicidal ourselves. 
Like why can't we extend the same courtesy to ourselves that we do to others? 
I don't mean it in a mean way or anything (I have been there too and an likening to be again) I am just curious and would like to have a bit of a discussion. 
Thoughts anyone?
