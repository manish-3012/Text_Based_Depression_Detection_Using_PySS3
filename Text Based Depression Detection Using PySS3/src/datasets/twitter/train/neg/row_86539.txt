My body is begging for pain and sufferingIt could sound wierd but after loosing every will to live the only thing i have left is a craving need of pain. I've dream of loosing one of my legs (I tried to... lose it), i loose myself watching stories of people how survived cancer and i tell to myself "if only i could have this to, i mean ... it looks so painful and unbearable. And i could even have the chance to die after". The thing is that hurting myself is the only thing that makes me proud or brings me joy like ... "yeah that cut was verry deep" or "I succeded to keep the tourniquet on my leg for an houre and a half" ...

I dont really know why i'm telling this ... maybe because there is still a part of me that knows it's wrong. Maybe because i still hope that i'll miss something that worth living for if i kill myself ... but the thing is that for know i'm just sad and lonely ... 

If you want to give me advices juste feel free to do so ...

Ps: sorry for the english i'm Belgian
