Gonna Die AloneJust been thinking tonight about how I'm going to die without a romantic partner. It just seems so impossible for me to be with anyone . If I were a girl , I wouldn't want to be with me for any reason . And the rest of my life is so stuck rn that I literally can't fix it . It's so frustrating to know what to do and how to do it but not doing it because you don't see a point to living your life to the fullest . And when you don't live your life to the fullest , you end up being a lonely worthless piece of shit.  That's where my mind is at tonight and I just want to kill myself. It's just so hopeless
