I just don't know anymoreI honestly don't know what to do with my life. I'm 17 and my grades were good but they dropped to a like C average. I even failed a class. I don't even know what to do with my life anymore, I have family that care about me but my friends basically just use me. My will to live is at a all time low and I hardly have the energy to motivate myself to wake up. My life isnt shit but I feel like it's not worth it anymore.
