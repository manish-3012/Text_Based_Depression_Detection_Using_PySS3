So... Thinking about it. Again....Arguments with my wife have occasionally made me feel like this. It's my 2nd wife. Cheated on the 1st, got 2 boys with her (9 and 11 - crazy names, might change them next year...) . Current wife is REALLY struggling with how she sees their behaviour (on the occasional times she's around them - due to her work, and when we have them here) they're generally not naughty kids, they're just... Kids... And sometimes they fuck up. Don't we all. They obviously try and lie to stay out of trouble when they do fuck up, but my wife hates lying.

So, tonight I was having a stern word with the eldest after he lied about peeing on the toilet seat. He was stood there, started to wobble and sway, then literally went rigid and started to fall. Luckily I caught him. After I got him safely onto the floor he was hyperventilating. Was very scared and confused as to what happened. Wife is saying he's being a drama queen and putting it on and I fell for it. I think he got himself so wound up and anxious and had some kind of blackout. Wife calls bullshit, and now we're not talking. The passion (from her side) left a long time ago, and now she despises my kids' behaviour. And me.

He's fine now, back at his mom's.

I currently help look after stepdaughter who has quite some disabilities and complex needs. 

But right now I'm real close to saying fuck it all. To everything.

A couple of Christmases ago I was stood by a motorway bridge, and then by a freezing pond. I even went to a 24hr supermarket to get a notebook and started writing my explanations and apologies and goodbyes. It was writing to my boys that made me walk home. Need to see how tomorrow is before I decide anything. Anyone have pain-free tips on how to go?  Tablets and alcohol or something?
