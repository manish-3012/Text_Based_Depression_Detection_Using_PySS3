I officially hate every part of my body (thanks, mom!). Another reason to kill myself.I've hated my thighs since I was nine. 

I've hated my breasts since I was ten. 

I've hated my face since I was twelve.

I've hated my shoulders since last week.

And now because my mom just _had_ to compare me to how "beautiful" my younger self and my posture was, I hate that too. It makes me feel like a failure. Like my younger self is better than me. Like I did something wrong.

I probably did.

I already started trying to starve myself, but now I can't even look in a fucking mirror because of what my mother said.

At this point I really don't see a point in living. What's the point of staying alive if you hate every atom of yourself?
