Any way I can find this person?Hi, I was lonely so I decided to do a chat with a stranger on Omegle, I connected with someone who said they were on top of a bridge and about to jump off. I have no idea where they are, and I'm afraid for them. I tried to talk them out of it but they disconnected and I don't know if there's any way I can find them. I accidentally closed the chat log, is there any way at all I can at least find a rough location so I can call 911 for their area??
