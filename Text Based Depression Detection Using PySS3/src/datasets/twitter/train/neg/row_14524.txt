I don't want to die. I want to be able to be normal. I want to be functional. But I've tried everything...I have social anxiety and depression and generalized anxiety. I'm tired. I have been trying to get a job, just some minimum wage one, but I can't. Everytime I get a call back, I can't even listen to the voicemail. My arms start to get tight and I can't breathe. And I feel instantly this dread. 

And then there is the problem of boys. I am really pretty supposedly, so you know you have a terribly unloveable personality when nobody wants you even though you are not ugly. I am afraid of going on dates. I stood my boyfriend up because I was afraid to go to the movies. He broke up with me. And I am single. Again. I have had sex with 6 guys. It's all wrong. I am a whore. I have no skills. I am afraid of this nothingness. Nothing bad has ever happened to me. I am like this for no damn reason.

I went to therapy for months. No progress. I was on Zoloft and seraquel. Both made me worse. I am now on nothing, there is no hope. I quit therapy. I will not kill myself, because I am hoping if I live long enough it will get better, but it never does. I've already tried that. I will keep trying, but it's sad to feel so much disappointment constantly. I feel guilty for existing.
