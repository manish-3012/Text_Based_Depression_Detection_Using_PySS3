HopelessnessSuicidal thoughts are something that pops up in my head very often. 
I survived a suicide attempt last year and went to a psychiatric hospital for 27 days. It really helped me. I thought I would never have suicidal thoughts ever again.
But this year, I've had several moments where I idealized suicide. 
Mostly because I went through the loss of my grandmother. 
I remember several nights where I begged her to come take me with her. 
I avoid sleepless nights because that's when I most feel depressed.
One of these days I took a wire and I made into a nose and put it around my neck. I don't know what was going through my mind but I didn't want to kill myself, I feel like I was testing out to see if it would work. 
Once I realized what I was doing, I was extremely scared of myself and the things I could do without thinking twice. 
I am bipolar so I have very impulsive behavior. I'm really scared of what I might do. 

I keep thinking to myself. I'm only 21 years old and my life only just began. I've been through so much since I was 9. I know I've been very strong, but I'm very scared of the future.
These suicidal thoughts won't stop. I don't think they ever will. 
I feel like there is no hope for me in the future and maybe one day I won't be that strong anymore, this fight is tiring and someday I might give up. I feel like it's my destiny and I won't live long. 
Does anyone else feels like this?
