My batchmate is using suicide as something to gain attention!he has epilepsy which is in primary stage and has been said that it can  almost be cured by just medicine. He tried to seek attention with that but it didn't work. Now he is isolating himself and blaming on other people that we have isolated him(which we have not). he is going to professors and telling them that we are messing with him(again a lie) and he is seeing suicide as last option so now he is having what he wants ATTENTION of almost everyone in the college.

Trust me people he is doing all this for attention I have lived with him for past 2 years and yeah he had just one epileptic attack and also he doesn't take his prescriptions (things are just adding up against him as I write this and try to recall my experiences with him). I m not judging him or I say I have known him completely in this short time of 2 years. the thing that pains me and really hurts me is he is using death as a tool for his benefits what if there is someone who really needs help would anyone step up, no they wouldn't they will think that he is also fooling the public. This society already doesn't understand depression and now this.

I was suicidal and when I tried to tell someone they made fun of me and laughed at it. I don't know why people can't see. I see him in college all sad but when he steps outside the campus I see him cheerful happy laughing with outside people.

This is really depressing for me when I needed help they laughed at me now they are being sympathetic to someone who is lying. And this is something seen not just by me, but us who are his close friends. The truth will come out and then it will be ugly not just for him but for others too.

I say one thing to myself and I share it here(and you all can disagree with me):   'it's not a coward who takes his life but the brave'
