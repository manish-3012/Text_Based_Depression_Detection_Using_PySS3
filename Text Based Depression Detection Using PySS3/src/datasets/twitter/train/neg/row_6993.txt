I used to be one of you.I wish I came across this subreddit earlier. It's so sad for me to read some of the things in here. I used to be where every one of you currently is. Dragging along in life, knowing that things can never get better. I've attempted suicide a few times in my life. The first time was by hanging when I was 15. The last few times were through intravenous overdose of heroin.

Things have happened recently in my life. In 8.5 short months, I have been able to change my thinking and behaviors, and completely turn my life around. I'm 23 years old. I should be dead, but I pulled myself out of the hole I lived in for 22 years. I promise you that there is a light, there is a better way to live. There is happiness waiting for you if you pursue it and just hold on long enough for the miracles to happen.

Life likes to test the strong, never the weak. Don't sit in your own despair, looking at your miserable past, keep moving forward no matter how hard that might seem. You are the strong. You can and will overcome, but it does take effort and patience. On your darkest of days, I know you feel that no one fully loves you. That you're tainted, unlovable, ugly. But know that I love you, and if it were possible for me, I'd fly to every person in this subreddit and extend my hand, in person, to help you see this light of mine. Unfortunately, I can only extend the invitation of you sending me a message. Please do. 

With love and hope

Paul
