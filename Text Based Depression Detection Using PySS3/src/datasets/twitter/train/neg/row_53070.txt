Sister sisterI want to start off by saying that I love  my sister and I have no animosity towards her, but her life is so perfect. She got married to a wonderful man, has a gorgeous house and a baby on the way. I've been putting on showers and events for her for the last four years and even thought I'm happy for her I cant help but feel like we are constantly celebrating her.

I just can't help but see what a contrast my life is to my sisters and it makes me feel like such a failure. Its also hard to not compare when you are always planning and shopping for her parties and such. I cant help but feel like life forgot about me. I look like such a fuck up compared to her. She is loved and perfect and I'm over here alone till I'm need for her. I feel like I don't even have my own life; I'm such a supporting character in my sisters life and only here for her.  Its a shitty thing to live with

I just want to know if there's anyone out there that can share their feeling with being the black sheep of the family, even if you aren't really a black sheep in society.
