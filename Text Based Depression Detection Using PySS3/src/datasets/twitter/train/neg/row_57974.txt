I'm lost.I don't know where else to go. I guess the fact that I'm turning to a Reddit forum when I really want to give up proves how lost I am...there's so much happening and I can't deal with it all anymore. I'm not weak. I've been trying. I don't want to anymore. At the same time..I have hopes, and dreams. I want to live them. I just don't want to live..now.
