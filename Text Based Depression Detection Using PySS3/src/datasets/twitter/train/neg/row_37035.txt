Im only 13Iâ€™m only 13 but ive listened to my mother be beaten by a man I called a step-father while I was curled up in ball pulling my hair as I silently cried for and hour until I was drained of my energy and fell asleep. Iâ€™m only 13 but Iâ€™ve been verbally abused by my father and mother to the point where I no longer have any confidence anywhere. Iâ€™m only 13 but iâ€™ve been bullied since I was 5 to point at the age of 10 I was watching what I ate in fear of being called fat. Iâ€™m only 13 but my mental illness are looked over and ignored because people insist iâ€™m just looking for attention. Iâ€™m only 13 but I flinch at the raise of a hand. Iâ€™m only 13 but iâ€™m terrified of men in fear of being assaulted, raped, or kidnapped because iâ€™ve seen what men have done to my mother. Iâ€™m only 13 and I fear Alcohol for reason of my mother yelling at me for hours into the night because I looked at her wrong when she was drunk. Iâ€™m only 13 but i have no escape of this hell. Iâ€™m only 13... but I find the thought of death comforting
