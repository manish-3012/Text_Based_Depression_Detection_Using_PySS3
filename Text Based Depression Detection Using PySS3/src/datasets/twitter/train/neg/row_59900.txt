I feel like I ruined my life for loveI moved 700 miles to be with a girl who hasn't wanted to be with me since before I moved, but she encouraged me to do it this whole time. I left all of my friends behind, I have no money, my credit score is down the pooper because of this, and I feel stupid and embarrassed. 

I'm living in her family's house with her. I'm in her room on my computer right now because my room is in the basement and doesn't get a wifi signal. I keep trying to tell myself that I can coexist with her but I'm so paranoid that she's seeing somebody else and I can't handle the thought of her bringing him home. I've been looking at guns all week and I'm so close to buying one when I get paid on Friday so I can kill myself and not have to worry about this shit. Maybe I'll blow my brains out on her bed or wake her up one night so she can watch me do it. Anything to get back at her for tricking me into abandoning my life to live with her.
