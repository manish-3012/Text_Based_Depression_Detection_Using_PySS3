LonelyIâ€™m never first in anybodyâ€™s life. My parents dote on my brother, my friends have other better friends that theyâ€™ve knowm longer and all my ex BFs have eventually left me only to immediately start dating someone else. Iâ€™m never the first choice.

I havenâ€™t made any new friends at college, contrary to what my parents said would happen, and my roommate hates a very fundamental part of my identity.

Iâ€™m worried Iâ€™ll never meet someone to fall in love with BECAUSE of that identity amd even if I did I worry that I may not be able to fulfill some of their needs in a relationship. I donâ€™t want to kill myself directly, but it wouldnâ€™t hurt if I just phased out of existence. Parents would probably be better off without paying the 40k+ per year it costs for me to go to college.

I constantly need attention but donâ€™t want to seem clingy or annoying by asking for it. I donâ€™t know what I need but right now Iâ€™m not getting it.
