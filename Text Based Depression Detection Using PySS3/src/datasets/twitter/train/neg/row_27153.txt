Kicked out of collegeI was kicked out of collage for inactivity, I was trying trying to piece back my mental health and when I went to check back on my classes I was kicked out. I donâ€™t know what to, I just want to disappear and stop existing. Now my mental health is lower then it has ever been and I donâ€™t know what to do. I tried contacting my collage but no one is answering. I just donâ€™t know what to do.
