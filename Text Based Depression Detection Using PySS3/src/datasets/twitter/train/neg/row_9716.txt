Couldnâ€™t make it until SundayMy skin is itching. The back of my throat is folding and I can feel every hair on my body vibrating. I had this elaborate plan to do it on Sunday, but Iâ€™m laying here unable to see 10 minutes ahead in my future. My body is on edge, but Iâ€™m somewhat at peace. I wish I had more to say, Iâ€™m usually a pretty talkative person, but I guess Iâ€™m just reveling in the moment. Iâ€™m so happy to know that so many of you in this community here are so loving and positive. If life doesnâ€™t give you all of the joys and wonders you deserve, Iâ€™ll be sure to come back to life and kick itâ€™s ass for ya haha. I love you all.
