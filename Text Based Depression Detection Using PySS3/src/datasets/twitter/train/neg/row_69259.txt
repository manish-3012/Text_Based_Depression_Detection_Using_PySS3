I've made a mistake having a child.My baby is the light of my life. But starting to realize I'm not good enough for him, he needs to be with people who not only love him, but will do anything for him. I'm such a bad mother, I'm useless. I love him so much, and made progress before he was born, but I feel like I need to kill myself before he gets to know the person I am. He doesnt deserve such a horrible mom, he doesnt deserve a life that wont be kind to him. He already doesnt have a "real" dad, do I take away his "real" mom too? I shouldn't have had a him. He deserves so much more. I'm not going to be a good mother, I can't be the loving mother he deserves. I dont know how to be. I look at his little feet, and hands, his little nose, everything about him is perfect. He doesnt deserve a shitty mother. He doesnt deserve a mother who is unsure about herself. He deserves love. He deserves a chance. And I can't give him that.
