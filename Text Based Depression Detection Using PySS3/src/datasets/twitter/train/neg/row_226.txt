I can't go on any longerI'm so sick of this, so fucking sick of this. I actually hated my therapist and forced myself to see her because I'd get my medication and let it do its job. Stopped seeing her, I'll take someone else. She was cold and I felt like she really didn't give a fuck. I'll call my family doctor to see if he can prescribe me some stuff, because I had to stop my treatment. Ran out of pills.

So many bottled up feelings inside of me. I want to put them out, ALL of them. I feel like I'm falling apart day by day, my creativity is blocked despite having plenty of ideas, I just can't get to do them. I can't confess to my best friend because I'm afraid I might lose her friendship, especially since she's got a boyfriend. I left many of my old friends because those assholes left me right when I needed them, and despite talking it out with them, I can't fucking go back to them like I used to. I met new people, but I can't get myself to truly go towards them. I don't want this anymore. I don't want to trust people, and have them care more about the death of a fucking idol than about their depressed friend. 

The true reason why I'm currently seeing family is that I don't want to be alone. I'm afraid I might do something stupid if I stay in my dorm room. I just want someone to hold me and tell me it's okay. Let me cry in their arms. Listen to me. I can't show this part of myself to people because depressed people like me become a huge pressure. They usually leave right after. One of my friends did, and it was the last time I came close to suicide. 

I'm sick in the head. I'm shattered inside. I feel things I have no right to feel. I'm a mess. A fucking mess.
