I hate myself more than evermy friends all just try to get away from me. none of the actually like me. i have no prospects of getting any sort of beneficial relationship with a new person. i will die alone and i deserve it.

I have literally never hated myself as much as I do right now. Iâ€™m weak and pathetic and ugly and fat and a fucking jew that nobody likes or cares about.

i donâ€™t care anymore, i swear in a few weeks iâ€™ll be gone iâ€™m gonna figure out a way to do it and iâ€™m actually gonna go through with it and itâ€™ll be amazing.
