Professor berated me in front of class, and it's possible I could fail, please help calm me downBackground: I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder when I was 14.  I'm 20 now, and I've been pretty much ok for the past year, but things get bad when I'm stressed or when situations like this occur.

Yesterday was the final exam for one of my easy introductory college classes. I woke up late and had to rush to make it to class on time. I realized I forgot my wallet so I didn't have any ID, but this professor has never required ID for any test before so I figured it was ok. I only have a pencil and my cell phone with me. Well, it wasn't ok and she required ID for the final. I handed in my test and explained to her that I forgot my wallet and I'm very sorry but I don't have any ID. She was pissed and said "why would you do, how stupid are you?" and continued to yell at me saying "you always need to show ID for finals, haven't you ever been to school before?". This went on for 5 minutes with her yelling and sighing and saying there was nothing she could do, before she told me it was ok and let me hand in the test.

To make matters worse, I missed one of the tests for this class (do to an anxiety attack). The final grade takes into account only 3 of the 4 tests taken in the semester. I thought it would be ok if I only took 3 tests but now I'm not so sure. This was pretty stupid on my part, but if it's not ok and she counts the zero I'm pretty much screwed because I can't go to talk to her after yesterday.

I don't know how to deal with this. I've always been a top student, I have a 94 average in this class and a 3.8 GPA. I have never been yelled at like that before and it has me really shaken up. I don't understand why she was was freaking out so much or why she couldn't understand that I made a mistake.
