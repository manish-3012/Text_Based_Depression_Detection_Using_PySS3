I Hate Waking UpWhen I was sleeping I was thinking about her and how much I love her.. I had a lot of nice things to say and I opened up about wanting to explore my sexual fantasies with her. It was beautiful.. until I woke up and I realized one time I asked to talk to her. She said ok. I opened up, and got ignored.. that pissed me off. Iâ€™m so.. so close to telling her off.. telling her to go kill herself.. telling her to she shouldâ€™ve died on her birthday. I mean it too. Iâ€™m not just being angry. Iâ€™m so tired of this
