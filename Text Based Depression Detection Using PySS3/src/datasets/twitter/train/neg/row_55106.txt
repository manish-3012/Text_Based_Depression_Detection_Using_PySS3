Nobody would care if I killed myself. Everyone around me is pretty indifferent to the idea of me dying. Iâ€™m gonna overdose soon, I donâ€™t care anymore.Iâ€™m angry. Iâ€™m mad at myself that I havenâ€™t been successful with death yet. I canâ€™t do anything right.

I think my therapist probably doesnâ€™t want me to die only because she might face legal action.

Iâ€™m so tired.
