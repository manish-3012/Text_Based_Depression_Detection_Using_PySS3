I can't take much more.Hi all. I've been lurking here for about a week, figured it was time to post. I've been suicidal before, but this time feels different. 

When I was young, I realized that I am transgender. After suffering throughout my teenage years and coming out to my unaccepting parents (they have since gotten better) I started hormone therapy and transitioned to become a female. Had gender reassignment surgery at 23. 

I'm now 29 going on 30 and while I'm glad I went through transition, I wouldn't still be here otherwise, I'm still absolutely miserable with everything else in my life. I got into pot and drinking as a teenager to deal with my feelings, sometimes other drugs as that's the kind of friends I made. Just in the last year I realized that I'm an alcoholic and have been trying to get sober. I've got just over a month at the moment.

During this time however I've let my life fall apart. I owe money just about everywhere and it has also put strain on my relationship with my parents, especially my dad. I work a retail job, sort of, my performance lately has been sub par as I can't even bring myself to care about or put effort into anything anymore. My home is a disaster. My finances are in shambles. This is not how I thought I'd end up. 

Also I haven't been in a relationship in years. I've been treated badly and gossiped about by so many "friends" along the way that I just kind of extracted myself from any kind of social life I once had. My only sexual experience since my surgery was with a guy I thought I trusted and he gave me herpes the first time. 

Basically, I feel trapped in my own shitty life and I already feel dead inside. There's a more and more vocal part of me that says I should just end it and stop existing in this world that doesn't seem to want me anyways. 

Thanks for reading, I don't have anyone I feel I can say this stuff to and I've really been needing to get my thoughts out somewhere..
