The urge is strong today.Never had normal friends or family . One of My first memories is my dad pushing my head into a door giving me a gash. He once choked me for crying once when I was 7. In school from 1-12 I was always picked on and the odd one out all while having to deal with an overbearing mother who used food as control and even locked me in my room periodically in order to â€œsave foodâ€ because I ate too much. That was one of her reasons. I know this is not much backstory but Today I am in my early 20s and I donâ€™t see my life progressing In a positive way at all. When my mom would lock me up I would think about suicide. I was around 12 when sheâ€™d do this to me so Iâ€™ve been thinking about dying for a long time. Itâ€™s getting old and Iâ€™m growing numb to everything &amp; I just hate myself and my life. Idk whatâ€™s taking me so long to just do it.
