Guys I cant take this please helpIts just so confusing. I cant escape this loop of im feeling awful for a month or so then im ok for a week then im awful again. By awful I mean depressed, anxious, and sucidal. I give up on school. Its no use, its just to hard to go through the pain and meloncholy of the schoolwork. Ive tried again so many times. Over and over and over agian but it doesnt get better. I just want to be happy like I was in 6th grade. (Im in 10th now) School did this to me. In 8th grade I wasnt doing as well acedemically anymore and all the adults around me started emotionally abusing me. (Parents, teachers, etc) You know how horrible it is to hear "You better get your grades up or your going to be a failure" Or "Why didnt you do this and this and this and this and this and this?" Every single fucking day at age 13? Only to find out now that 8th grade didnt even matter. So much stress and pressure was put on me that I forgot basic fucking social skills. Nobody loved me anymore either. Nobody really loves me much now. I dont know what to think anymore I cant think straight. I just want to be happy. Im a lost soul stuck in a cage. I lost all my creativity. I lost my ability to have fun. I lost my ability to accept failure, instead of fearing it. I just want to be better. Im so sad. Im stuck in this fog and I dont know what to do. Please help.
