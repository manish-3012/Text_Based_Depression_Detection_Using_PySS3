I don't want to die..Reddit, I'm going to start out by saying I'm 14. I'm in a magnet program at high school, and loved it for the first three months, but now.. My best friend is ignoring me for other people, people are paying more attention to her.. They don't realize I have feelings too, y'know? Nobody talks to me, and me and my friend have been fighting a lot lately.

My dad is very abusive, and I've gotten away from him physially, but that doesn't stop him from being verbally and emotionally abusive. I haven't spoken to him in 3 weeks, and he denies ever doing anything to hurt me, even though he fractured my jaw when I was 10.

I just don't feel like I have anyone to talk to. I've been depressed for about 2 years now due to bullying and other things, but this is just pushing me over the edge. I'm always there to help my friends with their problems, but where are my friends when I need them? 

I can't deal with the treatment I get in this magnet program I'm in, but I want to go to a good college.. Ive been thinking about suicide for about a month now..

I don't want to die, but I can't take living like this anymore.
