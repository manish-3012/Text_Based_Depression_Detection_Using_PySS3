Advice on how to find a good therapist?Iâ€™ve been to therapy twice for different reasons, but I never found it helpful because I felt that the therapist could not relate to me. Do you have any advice on how to find a good therapist?

I think Iâ€™m severely depressed right now because I had a really bad breakup a few months back and I still feel terrible about it. I cry almost every day, also due to changing life situations and how Iâ€™m not sure what to do with my life. I also have a lot of exams to finish for uni, so I am very stressed about that. I have wonderful friends and family, but theyâ€™re such good people and I donâ€™t want to bother them anymore with my problems. They try to help me, but I feel that they cannot relate to me and my unique situation. I guess COVID-19 also plays a roll; Iâ€™ve always been good at tricking myself into being happy with whatever situation I was going through, but now Iâ€™m just not doing too well. I sometimes want to die because I feel like it would be easier than coping with the pain. I would never actually do it because I am too afraid of being physically hurt and having a failed attempt, but I donâ€™t know how to be more positive like I used to be. Thatâ€™s the context in case it helps. Thanks :)
