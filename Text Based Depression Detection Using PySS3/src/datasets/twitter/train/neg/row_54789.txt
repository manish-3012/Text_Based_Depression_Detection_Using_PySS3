I just can't stop thinking of ending it.Im so tired. I just can't get it off my mind. Every time I get in my truck I think of crashing into a telephone pole or something. I'm so tired of not amounting to anything and being useless to everyone. I'm literally just a burden. I don't know if I can do this much longer.
