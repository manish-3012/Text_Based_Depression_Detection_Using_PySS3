need help for my new friend.     basically, i met this girl really recently that goes to my school. Iâ€™ve only really had one conversation with her. she seems like an extremely nice person overall and is almost always positive.

     but, today on her Snapchat she posted a picture of herself saying she bawled her eyes out before school and that she wanted to kill herself. i didnâ€™t really know what to say, and it was during the school day so i couldnâ€™t really reply to it. but now itâ€™s the end of the school day and she posted another pic. it read:
â€œi want to kill myself and everyone thinks im jokingâ€
this is when i knew i had to say SOMETHING to her... im just really not good at comforting people, i just donâ€™t know what to say. i know how she feels, as im depressed myself currently, but i just donâ€™t know how to make her feel better. despite just meeting her, i care and wouldnâ€™t want anything to happen to her. please help
