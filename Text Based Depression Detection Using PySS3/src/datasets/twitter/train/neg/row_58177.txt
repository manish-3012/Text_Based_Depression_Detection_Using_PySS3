I just can't take it anymore..I'm tired of fighting to stay happy, when life just constantly gives me something to be happy about.. but then rips it away from me with great pain.

a few years ago, i met a girl over the internet, and we grew close very fast, we talked, we texted, we lived together and we got engaged.. but just a few months ago, she betrayed me and cheated on me..

and just shortly after getting cheated on and abandoned, i met a new girl granted this one was just slightly younger then me.. well we grew close together, very fast, it all happened by accident too. she randomly messaged me one day, and things just grew from thier we live in seperate states, so we cant see eachother physicall, but weve constantly been talking on the phone. we both self harm and deal with really bad depression, but we balance eachother out, when we talk on the phone with eachother we are both very happy, and feel like our depression is gone..

but just two days ago her parents have said that they dont want her speaking or texting me or messaging anymore, because "its not her responsibility" to be my support and my partner. They think that i am taking advantage of her but im not, and we both are really happy with eachother, and we plan to spend our lives together and start a family..

but i only have till friday to be with her..after friday if she cant convince her parents to let her still talk and text me and be with me... well.. i cant handle loosing another person whos made my world happier..

even as i sit here.. i feel like just giving up.. im so tired of life throwing me someone that makes me feel happy.. feel safe... and then just taking them away from me.. and abandoning me.. i cant..i just cant handle it anymore, and im about to break!
