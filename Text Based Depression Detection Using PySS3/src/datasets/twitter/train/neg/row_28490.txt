Knife + Power SupplyToday, my dad just walked into my room. He got mad at me for not doing the dishes. I am 13, but my brother is 15. I am just pissed off now because he got so pissed. I didn't do the dishes, but I did take our dog for his usual walk. But my dad doesn't get mad at my brother when he doesn't do stuff, which he never does. He always just goes to me and gets mad and says "oh were you working on you stupid minecraft game or something". No, actually I fucking wasn't. Today I watched vsauce and learned a little more on AI deep learning and started teaching myself calculus. I think its just so fucking stupid and I never even care to live. Its just one of those moments, I have no reason to live and there is no point in it. We will all just die and I don't believe in heaven. So what if I just grabbed my power supply from my computer and just, stuck a knife in it. Would I die, because I really would like to be pretty sure I die.
