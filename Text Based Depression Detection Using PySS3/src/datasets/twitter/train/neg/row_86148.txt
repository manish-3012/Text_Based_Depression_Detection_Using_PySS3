Gambling addict on the edgeIt's the feeling of being correct. Feeling like an expert for predicting something. It's like you have the ability to be able to tell the future and when that prophecy comes true before your very eyes there is a feeling of immense satisfaction and power. But the worst part is when the sport/race fails to materialise you have the urge to try and regain the feeling. You're conscious of your actions but not able to control it all whilst 100% sober and thats frightening.

You can spend years studying horse racing form and variables but you will never be able to control revenge betting. You become so attached to the process of euphoria that you're unable to relinquish it, known as an addiction.

I've found that pleasure and happiness are two seperate things. Gambling can bring me high octane adrenaline filled pleasure but could never EVER bring me happiness. You become so transfixed in the addiction your money becomes just a number or like monopoly money. I can have 2k in my betting account and not care, I don't want to urgently withdraw the money like a rational person would do.

It's only when you lose it all you start thinking about the things you could've bought with that money. It's like part of your brain shuts down making it impossible to stop. Gambling is never about the money until you lose it, a win just means you have more to gamble with. You canâ€™t stop when youâ€™re winning and you canâ€™t stop when youâ€™re losing. The only time you feel free is when you have nothing left.

Gambling is a deregulated and legalised drug pushing multi-billion dollar corporation parasite responsible for thousands of suicides a year. They use hypnotic and mesmeric methods used to seduce people into a trap of inevitability. It's another case of capitalism profiting off peoples pain. Gamblers are expecting a creation to voluntarily turn down the volume of its intrinsic design.

And yet you still can't go a day without seeing a catchy slogan or betting organisation promotions. You can't watch the football without being exposed to gambling advertisement on the players shirts or plastered all over the stadiums. We live in a world where greed and expenditure is more important than people. The fact we discreetly advertise suicide and even on youtube videos where the age demographic is predominantly KIDS is a disgrace to humanity.

Gambling addictions are very hard to explain to people who have never experienced it. It's very hard telling someone that you lost 5k and then did the exact same thing a week later. The only time I've cried over the past few years is from losing all my money gambling.

It has made me lose the concept of money, made me lose the notion of emotions, made me question my ability to think rationally, made me have hateful mood swings, made me spend countless days in bed because it's the closest thing to not living, made me heavily contemplate suicide, made me miss out on countless social events because of no money, made me be horrible to the people I love, emotionally and physically drained.. amongst others.

How on earth have gambling organisations been able to create an empire where punters feel at peace when they have lost ALL there money. What kind of evil genius is that?

After all this I still don't have the willpower to quit.. I know for a fact in the near future I will again lose every cent I earned that week... I know for a fact I am addicted and have a problem... I know for a fact I need to tell somebody about my issues... I know for a fact I need to seek help or at least speak to somebody for some motivation to quit and advice... I know for a fact people would be upset if I did do the unthinkable and carry through with the suicidal thoughts gambling gives you... I know that I probably won't do any of those things.
