How do i help a friend who has completely given up on life?Hi, never made a reddit post before so sorry for any mistakes or whatever.

Im just gonna get into it. My friend has a history of trama, self harm, even attempted once and i just feel really helpless on what to do. He keeps saying hes tired and hes done with it all, tired of the flashbacks when he wakes up everyday, tried of having breakdowns.Hes tried medication, therapy for a few years, went to the hospital, it truly seems like hes done everything he can in his eyes. Im just so scared of what could happen, the only reason he hasnt done anything is because he wonders what i would do if he did. I really would like any advice here on what to do, i just feel so powerless. Hes a very special person in my life and i just want to do what i can.
Thank you.
