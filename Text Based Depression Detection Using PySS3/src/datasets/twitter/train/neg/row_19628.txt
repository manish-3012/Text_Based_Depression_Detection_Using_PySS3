My life is pointlessI'm 28 and have only held a few jobs at mcdonalds and a few wareouses. I dropped out of college years ago because I couldnt pass an algebra course. I've been living at home my whole life and basically only play video games all day, have no car so I can't go anywhere. I see no future for myself, I don't have a girlfriend or ever want kids and I see no reason to stick around. Does anyone else feel like this or is in this situation?
