I finally tried to end itI feel like thereâ€™s just no point to me being here anymore. I never asked to exist. Everything just keeps piling up and Iâ€™m so tired. I gave in a few days ago and tried to hang myself. I ended up panicking and just crying in bed instead. Everyday hurts to be here. Iâ€™m going to lose the one person that Iâ€™m staying alive for and Iâ€™m scared. Iâ€™ve given up on the whole â€œthings will get betterâ€ saying. Every time I think that things are looking up I get hit by everything that could go wrong. Iâ€™m really tired of all of this. My depression just keeps getting worse. Iâ€™m done.
