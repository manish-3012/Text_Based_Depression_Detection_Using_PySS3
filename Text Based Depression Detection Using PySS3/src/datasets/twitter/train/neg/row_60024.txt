Very determined to get this doneHey guys it's me again. I'm pretty tired of constantly putting on my social media about how I'm gonna kill myself or harm or whatever. Idk why I keep doing it. All it does it scare my friends or stress them out and that is legit the last thing I want to do, yet I keep doing it? I feel like I'm tormenting one friend in particular I feel so bad. Some of them are even a whole lot younger. Kids their age shouldn't have to worry about shit that I go through.

 I guess the thing is is that I want to say something before I'm gone forever so that people know what's up and I just don't disappear forever and for them not to know what happened. 

I've attempted 5 times, one recently and all have been OD. This time I'm taking my time and planning on buying my own gun and using it. My parents are already suspicious due to my behaviour so I'm having to be really patient with it. I'm not a patient person and want to get it over with right now and not weeks later. 

I feel like I'm somewhat hesitating yet it's all I want to do. I guess I'll have to gather my strength as well while I bide my time. 

Sorry if none of this is coherant, I just need to vent or something.
