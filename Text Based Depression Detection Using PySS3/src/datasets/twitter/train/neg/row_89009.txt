I'm depressed and I might hurt myselfI'm 29. My relationship with my wife has taken a turn for the worst. She's completely physically and emotionally checked out. I love this woman. More than anything in this world. 
She doesn't love me anymore. Not like she used to.

My brother passed away. He was the closest person that I had, other than my wife. He had cancer. 

Other than those two I have no one else. I'm pathetic. 

I don't work, actually I just started college trying to fool myself into believing that I'll actually be something. Graduate at 33? Yeah, that will get me a good job. 

I've started taking Prozac two weeks ago and everything only seems to be worse. The struggle is daily, constantly. Should I do it? Should I just peacefully sleep and never wake up? 

Every single day is pointless. My life that I've built has completely collapsed around me and this helpless, sad, terrible feeling is all that I have left. 

I don't know if this is my "note" or not. Ultimately it really doesn't matter.
