suicidal and memory losslast night begged my bf to give the pills that made me suicidal back because I thought theyâ€™d help, he gave up and gave them to me and I counted them and asked if 20 was too much to take and I kept telling him I feel empty and even more suicidal, I begged him to hold me and make me feel loved. I woke up for work this morning foggy and confused, last night felt like a dream. I have no motivation to keep going, my body hurts Iâ€™m so exhausted I just want to die in my sleep. No one takes you seriously until itâ€™s too late
