I have nothing left. Nothing feels real.I've been living with debilitating chronic pain for 15 years. The only family member who still cares about me is mentally ill and is incapable of supporting me emotionally. I have no friends. The only thing keeping me alive was my best friend, who I just found out has been lying about his entire life for years.

Nothing feels real anymore. It's like my brain isn't connected to my body. Everything feels weird, and I just want it to stop. I want the physical pain to stop, I want to stop being so alone. I don't want to be hungry anymore, I want to be able to eat, shower, go outside, meet people. This is not a life. This is a prison.
