I sincerely do not see the point in living.This is not meant to be an attention-seeking post, although I can't deny I could have simply written this down on a piece of paper to myself, so I guess to some extent it is. But anyone who knows me know the last thing I am is an attention-seeker.

That being said, I sincerely do not see the point in living.

I have zero meaningful social or emotional bonds. Literally every single friendship I've had in life has disappeared. My family and I are relatively distant. I don't have sex. I barely get dates even though "on paper" I have a lot going for me. I can easily go an entire day without speaking to anyone, without anyone even knowing I'm alive. I've developed a ridiculous and pathetic sex addiction regarding various escapisms like porn/sex lines/virtual interactions/etc...

Objectively speaking, I don't matter to anyone in the world, and I only matter in a very specific and technical way (essentially my job). No one calls me. No one wants to be with me. No one loves me in any meaningful way (certain no one who isn't "required" to love me). I don't matter at all.

I'm moved my thoughts of suicide from a somewhat distant place to a place where it might be 35 percent likely to happen. Not exactly likely, but it's no longer an abstraction or hypothetical situation for me. I'm legit considering it as a very real alternative.

I have no idea what I am hoping to accomplish here, but maybe it will help in a small way to type this out...in any event thank you all very much.
