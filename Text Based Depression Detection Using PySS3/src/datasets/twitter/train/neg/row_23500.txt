HuhI never really thought i would stoop this low in my own opinion at least, i have always thought of suicide to be a cowards way out - still do. But the last two year i have been contemplating suicide on and off, and thats fucking hilarious, looking in retrospect, i have improved my life in all the way that i hated it. And now i am considering this... 

I don't know why really i just don't want to live anymore, no one hurt me, no one hates me or anything. At least thats how i see it.

I'm 22, never had a real love interest (i think), only had 2 sexual experiences. Never really been good at anything besides problem solving, suck at math and grammar, but i do well with languages. I'm cocky at times and i am known to be hilarious. Yet i feel empty, i have recently taken up a new hobby and its nice. Even now writing this, i'm just sitting eating my dinner as if this is not a serious issue. I've considered help like going to a shrink, but i don't feel like i am sick so h why should e i? I've been l searching p for things that makes me want to NOT do it, but the only thing i can find that makes me withhold from such action is food. I would miss eating, considering there's is only the void in my future (be it now or in 60+ years). I'm not religious to any extent but have considered becoming just to fill something.

My life has been good, only some small low key shit like a small amount of molestation - but from a person only a couple of years younger than me, and i have written it off as tomfoolery, because i wasn't forced - but guess it's still molestation since i at the time didn't know what we where doing. But nothing that has left an emotional scar.

But I'm slightly scared - i used to be a happy person, and i can't be happy if i am considering to end it... Can i?
