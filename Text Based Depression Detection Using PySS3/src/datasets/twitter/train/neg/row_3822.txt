I cut for the first time todayI was hurting bad today to the point I was sat with my arms crossed over my chest trying to stop the pain. I couldn't be distracted so I got an idea.

I took a blade out of some old razor and tested it out on the side of my hand. I can feel the wound everytime I flex my hand. It's a little uncomfortable I should've tested somewhere else.

Then I cut three small lines on my bicep, stupidly below the t-shirt line. I don't know why but watching it bleed felt really really good. It bled a lot. It didn't really hurt that much and I cleaned the cuts with antiseptic. That stung a bit. I washed the blade (with antiseptic again) and put it in a tissue in an old wallet and hid it on my wardrobe for next time. I'm sitting here looking at my handiwork and tbh I can't wait to do it again. I completely forgot about the pain. I know this isn't healthy but if I can't kill myself to stop the pain I can do this at least. They're only little cuts and I doubt they'll even scar. I'll do it somewhere else next time that can be hidden easily. I don't really care about scars since I made myself a deal that if I don't have a reason to live by twenty I'll just end it despite being a pussy. I probably need help but it's not like anyone around me really gives two shits. Idek why I bothered hiding it nobody will give a fuck lol.
