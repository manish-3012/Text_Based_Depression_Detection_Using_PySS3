It's been a year since I tried to kill myselfJust as the title says it's been a year. I took a shit ton of prescription drugs and overdosed. I was found, taken to a hospital, put on a 5150 hold, and shipped to the nearest mental facility which was a like a hospitalized jail. 

I have been fine since both mentally and physically but I just wanted to reach out and say I've been there. I was depressed, I was suffering mentally inside, and just not in a good place. As a testimonial to saying things are capable* of getting better, if anyone needs someone to listen, to try and understand without feeling like a burden or repetitive I'm here! This sub is filled with dark emotions and I just want to bring some light to it! If I can help in any way, shape, or form I would love to try my best. 

*I say capable because I'm not going to bullshit anyone like the rest of the world does in saying things like, "things ARE going to get better". Using the word "are" in that circumstance falsely guarantees a future that no human can foresee in most circumstance where that saying is used. BUT things are always capable, not promised.
