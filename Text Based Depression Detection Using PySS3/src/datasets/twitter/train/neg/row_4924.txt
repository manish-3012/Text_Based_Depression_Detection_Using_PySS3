BahI feel like, if life had anything left to offer me, I would know
I think sometimes the universe tells you your time is up and itâ€™s just not meant to be
In the past, it certainly has intervened before my time
I always assumed itâ€™d be difficult to go...I felt so far from those elderly or terminally ill that seemed to let go
But now I really just want peace and rest more than anything, to stop fighting
And my soul does feel at peace with that
With the prospect of no tomorrow
Thereâ€™s not much left I want to see
This life is bullshit
Alls I know are decaying monsters, anyway
I just didnâ€™t have what it takes, to live
I played my hand the best I could
And found too little of a saving grace, too late
