Collage work and general life is getting to me.This is mainly a vent as I don't know how to deal with the feeling of being depressed, angry and sad all the time. All through out my high school days I never found the lessons or exams hard, never had to revise and found it easy and then I went to collage and everything is stepped up. No matter how much work and hours I put in to the lessons it never gets my grades up, I then found out that I am dyslexic and had to have tests done during my exam times, which was all stressful and then the grades came back only to show I failed in every aspect which lead to the constant 'playful' mocking at collage which only makes the situation worse and then work starts to pile up and the lack of sleep and then exams come around again. There is no break from the stress and after a year of this its become to much to handle.
I have considered dropping out but I know I will only regret it, I can't leave work otherwise I can't afford to get into collage and I'm sick of this shit. I have considered self harming and had the thoughts about 'oh how easy it would be if I was dead' and then realized how stupid it is and not the way to go.
I don't want these thoughts and I don't want to deal with everything that is going on. I realize it seem likes nothing compared to what others are going through but I just needed to vent this off. Its just rapidly getting worse and worse and I don't know what to do.
