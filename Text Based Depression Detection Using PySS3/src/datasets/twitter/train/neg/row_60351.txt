If nobody talks to me first, then nobody wants to talk to me at all.This is what I have convinced myself through years of going to schools further and further away from home.  I'm in college now, many states from where I was raised, and feel stable while I'm there (mostly) but just fall into a massive depressive spiral whenever I get home because.. nobody is here for me.  Like, literally nobody anymore.  The only people I have left live at least 5 hours away.  And it just feels so worthless and helpless because I know for a fact that as soon as I graduate... this is just gonna be my life full time.

And then I get a destructive thought.  A really destructive one.  And my logic is always the same: if people cared about you, they'd say something.  If they wanted to catch up after a while, they would reach out.  If you were to vanish, *nobody would notice.*

Every time I become suicidal I feel like I get closer and closer to actually acting on it.  It's been affecting me for only a few years but it feels like it's been an eternity.  

I'm sorry if this didn't seem to have a point.
