Anyone feel suicidal but terrified of death?It's weird. I had a traumatic experience a few years ago that left me with PTSD. And now thanks to that I am absolutely terrified of death. But I can see myself going down a dark path. I hate who I'm becoming. And I don't feel strong enough to keep going or get better.

I have no choice but to keep being miserable though because I'm so afraid of death.

I feel stuck. Sometimes I just wish I could go into a coma or a catatonic state. Just let me... exist and not have to deal with this.

There are some things that make me feel happy. But it's rare and only temporary. I don't know what to do. Just keep going I guess...
