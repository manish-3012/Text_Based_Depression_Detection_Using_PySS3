This is why I did it, this is why you should all stay safe and lock your heart away.I thought I was the happiest one
Now I realize I threw that out.
One day in December I decided to create hell 
No one knew how I felt, how could anyone really tell? 
My heart had melt.
I never wished it upon me yet I created that virtual reality.
I made my fatherâ€™s pockets empty, I lied to the people so vaguely.
I made my vow that I broke unfaithfully 
and now I am standing on this chair all alone disgracefully.
I loved a girl, I loved friends and I loved my family.
But it was all a fake pearl on the ocean ground that revealed itself 
To me too early.
I am young not so strong, yet I am old as I look through the years and feel
Myself scold at me.
Why did I do it? No one will ever know
I will take the thoughts with me to hell
To demonstrate that no one should ever go
I wonâ€™t tell a single soul.
I promise you.
I pondered then I wondered.
I found the answer to my facade of a life.
I am sorry to tell you this, but I am afraid I am going to die.
Farewell, my dearest friends. For it has been a journey I wonâ€™t forget.
Live peacefully and never regret.
