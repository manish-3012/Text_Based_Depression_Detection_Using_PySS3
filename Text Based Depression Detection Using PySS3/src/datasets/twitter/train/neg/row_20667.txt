I've been such a horrible personDear Friends,

my 1.5 year girlfriend broke up with me about 5 days ago.
I just cant handle the the overwhelming guilt i feel when i think about the extremely hurtful things i did to such a sensitive person. I once even said "the sex with my ex was amazing, i dont think anything wil ever top that" just out of the blue. i just feel so sorry i didnt even think when i said that.  how is it possible that i did not have that empathy? i feel like me being alive is just not worth it when i can cause that much pain
