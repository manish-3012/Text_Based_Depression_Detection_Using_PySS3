My best friend/sister tried to commit suicide last nightI'm not sure if this is the right place to post this but I'm disassociate in really bad and just need to get it out. Our friend from NC messaged me telling me she drank a bottle of vodka and ate heart pills last night and I didn't find out until noon today. She's okay and she's at work but I don't know what to do. With how things are with COVID and being stuck on my campus under lockdown and the fact she's not my biological sister I couldn't go home on grievance leave or to help her since she tried to commit suicide. She has BPD and her mind translates bad things happening to "oh it's my fault", I'm one of the few people who can talk her out of his state and calm her down I've known her for 16 years and she's been more family to me than my own and I can't physically be there to help and I'm calling her later tonight when she's off work to talk to her and make sure she's okay. 

I need advice on what to do, I'm terrified to lose her and I can't go home right now. Any help would be fantastic, thanks
