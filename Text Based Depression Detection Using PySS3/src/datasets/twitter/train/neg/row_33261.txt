Can anyone help and talk with meThis is a throwaway account. I do not want others to know what I am going through.

I just can not shut up my internal talk. I have been trying not to kill myself for a year.  Since I realized that there is no meaning to life and my work or efforts would be wasted, I just can not bring myself to do anything. I have been trying to just keep going with the flow.

I have set up my goals and trying meditation. Nothing works. Tried therapy. It worked for a while but now it is again coming back. I really do not know what to do.
