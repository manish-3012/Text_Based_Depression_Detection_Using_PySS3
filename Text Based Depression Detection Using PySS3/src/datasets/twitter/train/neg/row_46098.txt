2 Corinthians 1: 8-10 "8Â For we do not want you to be uninformed, brothers and sisters, about \[[d](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+cor+1&amp;version=AMP#fen-AMP-28809d)\]our  trouble in \[the west coast province of\] Asia \[Minor\], how we were  utterly weighed down, beyond our strength, so that we despaired even of  life \[itself\].  9Â Indeed,  we felt within ourselves that we had received the sentence of death  \[and were convinced that we would die, but this happened\] ***so that we  would not trust in ourselves, but in God who raises the dead.  10Â He rescued us from so great a*** ***threat of*** ***death, and will*** ***continue to*** ***rescue us. On Him we have set our hope. And He will again rescue us \[from danger and draw us near\], "***

2 Cor 4:7-9 " 7Â But we have this *precious* treasure \[the good news about salvation\] in \[unworthy\] earthen vessels \[of human frailty\], so that the grandeur *and* surpassing greatness of the power will be \[shown to be\] from God \[His sufficiency\] and not from ourselves.  8Â We are pressured in every way \[hedged in\], but not crushed; perplexed \[unsure of finding a way out\], but not driven to despair;  9Â hunted down *and* persecuted, but not deserted \[to stand alone\]; struck down, but never destroyed; "
