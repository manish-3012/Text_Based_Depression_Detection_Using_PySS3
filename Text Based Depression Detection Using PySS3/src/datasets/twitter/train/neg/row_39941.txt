It comes in waves.I thought moving to another far away city would help. And it has, but it still comes in waves. One minute Iâ€™m okay and the next I want to jump in front of a passing streetcar. Iâ€™m trying my best but I feel like Iâ€™m losing my will to keep this up. Iâ€™ve told my whole family I want to be a doctor, but honestly I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™ll live that long.
