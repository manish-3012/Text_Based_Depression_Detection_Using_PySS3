tonight my plan is to get drunk enough to get the courage to kill myselflast night I got pretty drunk I did some things that I regret. I don't know how to keep living. my last relationship was the best thing that ever has happened to me.  I feel empty and I don't feel sadness or happiness i just feel numb and I can't stand the feeling anymore I can't stand to keep living like this being alone every day, every night. it's horrible I just don't know what to do anymore. Life just doesn't feel like its worth living anymore. yeah, ive been alone in the past obviously but this time i feel different.
