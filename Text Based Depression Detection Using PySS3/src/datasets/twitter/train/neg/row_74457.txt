TodayI spent a good part of this afternoon walking around my neighborhood in a kind of daze. Walking without purpose, I ended up in the local park. I sat on a bench there for an hour, not doing anything. Just sitting. Then got up and walked slowly home. I live in a big city, but I don't remember seeing another person the entire time. It was so lonely. I wish I could preview my world after my death, like "it's a beautiful life". I think I'd be a lot less resistant to dying if I knew my family would be okay. Oh well. Maybe I'll go back to the bench tomorrow.
