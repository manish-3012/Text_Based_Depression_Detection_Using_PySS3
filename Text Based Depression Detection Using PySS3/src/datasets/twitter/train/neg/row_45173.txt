Avoidance personality disorder destroyed my life, why do I have to continue to live?12 years have passed since I developed mental illness over-night and 10 years have passed since my last and only suicide attempt.  Since then things have only gotten worst for me.  A tragic accident made me lost my good look, my mom passed away, having cataract in my right eye, back problems, digestive problems, growing bald from stress, liver problems, countless headaches from stress, one emergency visit, and I developed OCD.  The last time I talk to a girl I like was also 10 years ago.  

10 years have passed and nothing has change.  I have never been on a date in my entire life but I have had multiple opportunities only to be shut down by avoidance personality disorder.   Without love and sex, I can't hold onto a job nor do I have anything to relief me from the stress of life.  My body is slowly rotting away like a terminal illness and I can't do nothing about it because years of medications and therapies was just not good enough for me to have a chance at a normal life.

I try improving my life on several occasions with work but each time I fail or the jobs deteriorated my health even further.  I join the military to have a future but only found myself injured and not graduating.  I don't think I will go back again.  But nearing 30 without even a plan, money, love, house, what the point anymore?  I'm human, I have emotions and feelings like everyone else, why do I have to feel guilty for wanting to end a life I never asked for?   Is waking up in the middle of the night crying and being alone all my life not a justifiable enough reason to want help ending it?
