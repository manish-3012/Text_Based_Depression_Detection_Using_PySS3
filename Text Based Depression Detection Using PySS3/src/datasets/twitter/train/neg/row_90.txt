I really have no way outI just can't keep living this life. I want it to end but there are too many reasons that make me need to stay here. I can't live a day without feeling remorse towards my parents, who see their son like that, same with my little brother and sister, i don't want them to be traumatized and become depressive themselves because of me killing myself. I have one precious friend, a girl that really does everything to help me, and it makes me sad to know that it will hurt her at the end. My faith in God is telling me to keep going but it's been a lifetime that i've been doing it, and i think i've reached my limit. I can't feel any form of happiness or enjoyment that make me forget about my problems, i also feel guilty about all of this, that i live an easy life, in a peaceful country, that i have something to eat and to dress with, a roof to go under but with everything life granted me i still can't appreciate it. I feel like shit. It's litterally impossible for me to kill myself because of everything i said, my life doesn't only have an impact on myself so i'm trapped in this life and it's going to be like that until i die. Sorry for the long text and my approximative english
