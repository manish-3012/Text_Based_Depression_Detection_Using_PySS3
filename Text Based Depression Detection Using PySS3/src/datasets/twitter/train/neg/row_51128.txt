Suicide is foreseeable.I don't know how people can see others in pain, especially after they mistreat them, and not think that it could end in suicide. 

Some people are meant for it, and you can tell who they are from what they have been through, and the look in their eyes. 

I am sure some of you guys have lost people to suicide, or been there during announcements of it. You hear a lot about how people are assholes to others when they are alive, but suddenly feel remorseful when someone kills themselves. 

Do you think that surprise or change in heart is genuine, and why?
