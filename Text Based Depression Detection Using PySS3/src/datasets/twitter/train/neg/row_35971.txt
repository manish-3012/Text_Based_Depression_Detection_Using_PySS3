Just numbI'm not sad. I'm not having a bad day.
I just feel so lost, so numb. I feel so unreal.
I don't know why should I stay here. Nothing matters and I'm tired of just living for some short moments that I don't ever remember. 

I wish I could just stop being in this limbo between feeling almost unreal, wanting to die and wanting to try again. I wish I could turn myself off forever.
