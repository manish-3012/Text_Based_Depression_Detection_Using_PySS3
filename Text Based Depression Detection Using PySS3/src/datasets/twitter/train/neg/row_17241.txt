The urge to cut.I am not feeling me again today. I am thinking of cutting again when I go home. I cannot think straight rn. I am going to finish my work then go home and do my cutting. It will relieve me from what I feel most likely. It is a heavy feeling.

If anyone knows an alternative not to cut of some sort. Kindly comment it. I may need help.
