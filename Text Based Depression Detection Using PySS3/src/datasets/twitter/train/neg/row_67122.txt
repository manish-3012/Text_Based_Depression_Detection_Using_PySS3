I think Iâ€™m ready nowIâ€™ve been suicidal for ten years now. It comes and goes in how bad it is but itâ€™s always there. There have been some moments in my life where Iâ€™ve been happy and felt content to be alive but theyâ€™re always between much bigger mountains of time feeling terrible. 

Recently I havenâ€™t been getting a long with a friend. Iâ€™ve tried to talk to him but heâ€™s ignoring me for the most part. I feel so depressed and empty. I always end up back here. My boyfriend has gone with his parents to a party. I think this might be my opportunity to get out. I donâ€™t know if I should try to say goodbye to anyone or if I should just do it. But I think Iâ€™m ready to end everything.
