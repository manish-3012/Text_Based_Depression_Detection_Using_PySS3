No need to reply or anything, there are people here that need it moreIdk
I dont really have anyone in real life i can talk to
I attepmted suicide twice till now. Every once in a while I get really numb and juat really impulsive and thats when I try killing myself

I just have so much to do and not enough time and everything in life that somehow still had a point and allowed me to feel something other then pain is just falling apart. It just seems that the best option I have Is simply ending It. Life is not worth this.
