I don't want my suicide to be considered tragicI don't want to live anymore. Why should it be considered a tragedy? It's not like I have any friends or much of a life for that matter. I've figured since middle school that this was going to be the way that I am going to die. When someone kills themself it's always made about everyone else in their life and not them. Yes, it will probably hurt my family but it's my life and I don't want to be here anymore. Why stick around? I don't even want another year of this. Nothing feels real.
