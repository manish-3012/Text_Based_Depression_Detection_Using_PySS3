Iâ€™m so lostSo iâ€™m laying in my bed, i let out few tears, i canâ€™t even cry.
I have 0 friends. And i donâ€™t mean like those people saying â€œoh i have no friends only 3 bffs and many othersâ€.
I literally have not a single friends. I usually spend like 10+ hours a day on the Internet. Nothing else excites me.

I have no identity, no interests, nothing makes me happy. I donâ€™t know who I am. 

I donâ€™t want to kill myself but on the other hand I do. 
Always that or the other one
