When I hear "please don't kill yourself" from people that have no idea who the fuck I even am,I shake my head.The above is *hypothetical* because I am smart enough to never admit suicidal feelings directly to anyone's face.That is why I post here because its a safe place to vent such feelings.Honestly I might laugh if some rich social worker making $100,000/yr told me "please....please....you have *so* much to live for".Why would someone living high off the hog care if I ended it all?Society dictates that you must stop someone from ending their life.I know this may seem too philosophical but why does someone care?Why does anyone care?Does anyone in this world care about me.No....the answer is no.Noone even know I exist.I'm not seeking celebrity,I'm just stating a fact.That is the truth that I feel.That is the truth that I know.Because after that two week stay at the hospital ends (again,hypothetical).....I am alone.I'm also angry because California just changed their state mental health law last yr.Now......instead of a three day maximum,now its a two week maximum.Even worse,in CA now they can theoretically hold you captive for up to a month before letting you go.This is as a result of mostly the homelessness problem.Those NIMBY's up in ritzy Sherman Oaks,CA want the *problem taken care of* 

Prop HHH &amp; Prop H were passed a year ago......no new housing construction.

When I'm short on my rent,I am alone.When I'm a bit lonely or bored,I am alone.When the bus drives away &amp; I'm right across the street from the bus stop,I am alone.When I'm checking my list of responses from a Reddit post,all calling me stupid,I am alone.

I am alone.
