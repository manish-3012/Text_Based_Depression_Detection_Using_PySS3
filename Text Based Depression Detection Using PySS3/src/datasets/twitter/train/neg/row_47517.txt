Ends here... Please readI am a 22 Year old african living in Europe, since I came to europe all ive seen is bad, nothing good. My family still struggling, my finance is worse now that im in debt, governments dont care, people dont care. Friends is a word used wrong in europe, back home a friend is someone you can trust, talk to, offload stress and they do the same, but in EU your friend takes but never gives. I have a list of atleast 2000 things i can say about europe and life in europe but its not what im here for... I have reached the end of the line, theres nothing to say do or take that will change my mind. I have experimented everything to see what will help with depression, but found nothing, I left africa to help my family members, but since i left all i see is deaths of loved ones,  illnesses and debts that my family didnt have before. I tried to help but theres nothing I can do. I recently opened a Bitcoin account, this is for me to pay money into for my family but now I cant, after today i cant. Like i said, this is the end, im done with this life, the racism, the hate, debts, problems, I cant take any of that. So **24/09/2020 at 17:00 ES**T I will no longer exist, if you want to donate to my family after im gone then heres the address:

you might think why would he put a bitcoin address before he dies, thats because after I die no one will be taking care of my parents, or my siblings or the rest of the family. I want to leave, I made my mind up. I just dont want to leave my family without anything.
