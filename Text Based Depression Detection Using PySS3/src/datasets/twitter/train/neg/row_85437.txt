I feel hungover after a really bad episode. Just want to go back to sleep but I have work.Broke down yesterday morning.  Spent...hours in an episode of anxiety.  Punched/slammed anything I could, screamed.  Spent a couple hours googling cost of psych ward stays.  I canâ€™t afford it, so, guess Iâ€™ll just keep going it alone.

Had to meet family later.  Put cold compresses under my eyes to mask how upset I was.  Itâ€™s so bizarre when I pause to think, how hard I work to hide all of this.  Iâ€™m calmer now but also fucking exhausted.  Head has been throbbing, canâ€™t really exert myself.  I always get like this after a bad episode of wanting to kill myself.
