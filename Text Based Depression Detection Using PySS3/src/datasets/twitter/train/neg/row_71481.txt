Now that I don't want to die, I might.I (18M) have what I suspect to be Rona. I know it's not supposed to be deadly for people in my age groups but I also suspect I have an underlying lung illness. Anyway, I'm on my third day and my sputum/phlegm production is higher/more yellow than normal and my chest feels weird. All of that is besides the point. I had been kind of planning my suicide for a while all the way up until I got to college last September. My outlook on life changed once I got there and away from home. I haven't been suicidal in quite a few months now but things aren't looking good for me. I have never had the healthiest lungs thanks to living with my chronic smoker dad for 4 years and now that I've contracted the hot new thing, I have this sneaking suspicion that the end is near for me. Normally, I'd be having a complete and utter meltdown. Anxiety and panic would have consumed me. But nope. I kind of feel nothing really. I don't know how but my anxiety has just magically disappeared even though I've had panic attacks for much, much less. I think that either subconsciously I have accepted that I might die within the coming weeks or I haven't grasped the full gravity of my situation yet, which I think is way more likely. I want to cry but I just can't. Crazy how I felt fine a few days ago and now this lol. Anyway, thanks for reading this. It means a lot to me that you sat there and read my ramblings for a few minutes. Take care!!
