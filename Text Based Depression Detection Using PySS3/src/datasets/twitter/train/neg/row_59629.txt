Are some things not worth living thru?Do you guys agree with me that some things &lt;in my case its trauma but it could be anything you find horrific and soul-crushing&gt; are so bad u just wanna hit rewind and since you cant ofc you'd rather die? Does that make any sense. Try to talk me out of it if you dont agree on why someone who was for example gang raped &lt;I wasnt&gt; should try to go on. If you DO agree with me please tell me why you do. This is a thing that keeps bugging me a lot.
