I never post.I wrote this earlier today, hoping someone would try to speak to me. No.

I am not doing better. I cannot anymore. Iâ€™ve done everything in my power to lie to everyone in my life that Iâ€™m doing better. That Iâ€™m fine. Iâ€™m not sad anymore. everyone. every person. I donâ€™t know.
i am not a person anymore. i am an empty shell. i am nothing. i am watching myself. i am hollow. sometimes i am half full, but lately i have been half empty. 
my therapist doesnâ€™t want to see me. i am so sad, i am insane. ill do anything to feel again, to feel something again. i promise. i want to talk to my therapist.
for the first few sessions, i do not want him to talk. i want to let everything. let my sadness out of my body. iâ€™ll let him reach inside my head and let it out. i need a person to hear my screams. i need a person to save me. i canâ€™t swim anymore. i am drowning. i have never been this scared of the future, the present, the past before. everything is haunting me. everything is keeping me from happiness. my head is heavy. i need to let it out. 
heâ€™ll hear me and whatever advice or knowledge he will give me, i will take. i will use it so hard. i will do anything to let myself up for air. i am suffocating. i need to be opened.
it is selfish to say, but i have watched myself and watched others. i cannot be more empty and sadder than anyone else.
i am but a hypocrite. i say i cannot feel but then claim that i am sad. i donâ€™t know. is it bad to not know? here i am, continuing to lie.. i am sorry.
i will take any words of advice before i drown. anything.
he will hear me. why must i think that a person can cure me? give me strength? no one believes i am strong. i am weak and drowning.
i am being taken away. i will soon be nothing. no, i am already nothing. what is below nothing? nonexistent. that is my name.
im not sad. Iâ€™m not sad. being terribly sad made me unable to be sad again.
i no longer panic. never anxious. i thought i was happy because i didnâ€™t feel those. but, along with those i grew unable to feel any other emotion. are those emotions, at all?
i no longer crave to be around others. before, i loved their presence. i loved seeing smiles, new faces, and familiarity. i loved love.
now, love is absent. i question it. i suffer from my lack of. 
i question everything, without emotion. but donâ€™t care. my suffering drained me.
i donâ€™t know if i am this way or not, i am unable to know. i am expressionless. faking it has become hard. my lies made everyone proud of me, so why am i broken? i have never been whole, being broken would not be a surprise. 
continuing my life is difficult, but my only other option. i donâ€™t care enough to kill. killing involves me caring. crying involves me feeling. i can't.
i canâ€™t let anyone know. i am trying so hard to have a heart again. i want the world to see that i am okay, i will force myself to be content with my emptiness. 
the last real thing i felt was hate. hate for myself. i was awful, with my horrifying thoughts and all. othersâ€™ trust for me was ever alive. 
just like me. being alive will truly be a new experience. i say i will never kill, but what if it is my only way to being alive? 
people have grown tired of coddling me, taking care of me. i am a burden. pretending to be happy and healthy made their life easier. they were actually happy.
fools.
i am full of nothing. Almost 20 years of nothing.
I told myself i would not be alive past 16.
