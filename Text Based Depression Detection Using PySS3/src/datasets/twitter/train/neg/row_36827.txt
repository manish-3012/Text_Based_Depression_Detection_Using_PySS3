Even if I live I know this feeling will come backBecause at the end of every â€œfunâ€ day I have that crash where I sit in bed and think about what I really want which is to not be alive. And I canâ€™t stand the thought of living longer only to keep ending up back at the same place. Iâ€™ve felt this way since I was 12, Iâ€™m 18 now so yeah I lasted 6 years of this but I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m any better for it. I was just killing time. I canâ€™t even get anything done with this time because I keep getting dragged down. What does staying around do for me? I feel like I wasnâ€™t cut out for this. The last time I suicide attempted I didnâ€™t feel any of that last minute panic or fear I felt like... very cold and calm and relieved. I was crying happy tears. It was mixed in with a lot of other things but I keep thinking about that. I just donâ€™t want to be here at all. Whatâ€™s worse is my dog died two weeks ago and I just feel like sheâ€™s waiting for me to show up in whatever afterlife there is to keep her company. I donâ€™t want to keep her waiting. I wanna get out of here it doesnâ€™t feel right for me Iâ€™m so uncomfortable :( 

TLDR whatâ€™s the point of living even another ten years if they feel like this. The bad doesnâ€™t outweigh the good and being alive feels wrong to me
