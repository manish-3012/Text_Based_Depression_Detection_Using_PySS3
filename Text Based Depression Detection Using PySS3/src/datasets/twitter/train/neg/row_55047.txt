I donâ€™t know what to sayTo be honest, Iâ€™ve been lurking this reddit forum for a bit before deciding to make my own account and post on here. I recognize that in a way Iâ€™m probably triggering others and if I do trigger you Iâ€™m endlessly sorry. 

Iâ€™ve had suicidal ideation for the past few months and it went away for a bit. Life didnâ€™t feel refreshing but it was nice to not feel as dreadful. Itâ€™s back again and Iâ€™m so tired of living life. Iâ€™m sick of my family and although I have lots of love for them theyâ€™re overwhelming. It feels like people donâ€™t really care and itâ€™s because they genuinely donâ€™t care. If I killed myself, people would move on. It wouldnâ€™t affect that many people. My parents, sure. My sister, yeah. Because nobody takes me seriously, I donâ€™t think it would rlly affect others as much. I know that sounds apathetic but seriously nobody cares about others the way they should.

Iâ€™m just tired of holding on for a world that will keep on spinning without me.
