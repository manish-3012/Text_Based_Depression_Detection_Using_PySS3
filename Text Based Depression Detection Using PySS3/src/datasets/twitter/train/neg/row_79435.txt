Mum wants me out of her houseObviously a few extra expletives interspersed here, but the was the crux of her shouting. 
I wouldnâ€™t mind, but I thought Iâ€™d done well today - looked after my ASD brother for 12 hours, made a stew for her coming in from work and spent four hours fixing the washing machine (getting numerous cuts that probably need a tetanus jab). 
A blazing row erupted because I wanted to wash this morning and had announced so last night, but apparently I need to be a mind reader because my sister did also and I was unaware. Nevertheless, I cut my bath down to ten minutes so she could wallow for an hour. 
Perhaps Iâ€™m shallow, but I wanted at least a â€˜thank youâ€™ for the unpaid labour Iâ€™d given, but instead I hear about how Iâ€™m lazy, a freeloader, a disappointment and need to leave. Bear in mind I have a physical disability that makes moving my lower body impossible unless I want agony with every step (spoiler alert: I do it). According to her, Iâ€™m not actually depressed - instead I simply make the rest of the household depressed. 
So she wants me out? Itâ€™s not through lack of trying on my behalf. For my last attempt, she thought I was â€˜huffingâ€™ when in reality Iâ€™d collapsed in the kitchen at 5am and after dragging myself to bed, spent the next twelve hours vomiting up my overdose. 
So this time Iâ€™ve gone different. Ive taken more of my crazy pills than I should, downed a bottle or two of wine, attacked my wrist and injected 300 units of slow acting insulin. By tomorrow night, hopefully her problems will have disappeared.
