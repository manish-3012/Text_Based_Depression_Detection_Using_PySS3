So tiredI am only holding on for my four year old daughter. There are no other reasons. I feel completely empty. I just donâ€™t want to exist anymore. I know she isnâ€™t better off with out me but those thoughts have started to creep in. I keep asking myself if she would be better off without me. Better off without me and my mental illnesses. Better off without me being unable to take care of myself. Iâ€™m sick of feeling this empty. I just want to end it. Merry fucking Christmas... ðŸ˜”
