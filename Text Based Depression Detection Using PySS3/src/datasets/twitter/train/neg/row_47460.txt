I think I'm done for goodI can't fucking take this anymore. The girl I thought was truly my soul mate, the one who was more like me than possible, apparently had sex with another guy while we were together. For context, we were together almost a year, until she left me for this guy who abused her for six months. The day they broke up she came back to me, saying that every day she thought of me. We got back together in August, and just recently went on a break. Tonight I come to find out she had sex with that guy right before the break started. I'm devastated, and texting her about it right now. That was just the final straw: I've been in a depressive downward spiral for about a month where I've been on some drug every day, dropped out of college and nearly lost my job, but then I fractured my wrist so I won't be able to do my job anyway, so I'll probably lose it anyway. I can't fucking do this. If it weren't for the lack of tools, I'd have killed myself some time in the past month, but after this anything will have to do. I don't care if I have to walk into traffic, I'm done.
