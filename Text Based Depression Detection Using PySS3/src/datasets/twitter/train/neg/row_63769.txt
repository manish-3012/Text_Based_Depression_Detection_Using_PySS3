16 and ready to die.I've hit rock bottom again, I don't have the energy or will to even take on life. It's fucking bullshit and it's only fucking me over more and more everyday. My psychosis is telling me that this girl I met in my new class is my future wife, which is bullshit - he's a fucking liar and I can't stop him from putting shit into my head. My head is completely fucked from auditory hallucinations to the uncommon visual hallucinations. I really don't have the will to deal with this shit anymore, for three fucking years all this shit has been going on and it's never stopped. Depression on top only makes this even more unbearable, I have to be a completely different person to who I am in public and everywhere else. My voices think they can take over my body, they can't they just can't. I don't know if I want help or I want death. I'm so confused.
