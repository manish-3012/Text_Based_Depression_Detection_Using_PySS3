The thought of killing myself gives me comfortKnowing that I wonâ€™t be here for much longer. That itâ€™s a matter of if not when I commit suicide. The fact that when itâ€™s done I wonâ€™t be in pain anymore. Knowing that thereâ€™s nothing on the other side to worry about, no negativity, no pain, nothing. All of it comforts me. I canâ€™t wait to die. I think about killing myself everyday. Hopefully it wonâ€™t be that much longer.
