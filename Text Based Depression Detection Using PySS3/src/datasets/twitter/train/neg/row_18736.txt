I want to end it todayIâ€™m a failure. I graduated last 2019, had a job for a month and then resigned because of anxiety. I moved to another country where my dad works. I canâ€™t find any job here and I have been unemployed for almost a year until I found a job last October. Because of many reasons, but mostly because of anxiety, I left that job and I only lasted for a month. I honestly donâ€™t know why am I like this. Now Iâ€™m looking for a job again and I canâ€™t take it anymore. Being in this house makes me feel worthless. My dad and his gf always remind me how ungrateful I am for quitting that job. They would remind me how we need to pay for the bills. I felt so guilty and anxious I canâ€™t even eat. I just want to die
