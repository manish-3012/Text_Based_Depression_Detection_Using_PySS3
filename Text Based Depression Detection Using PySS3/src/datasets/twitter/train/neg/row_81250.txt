I want to break up with my depressed/suicidal girlfriend (because of the drepression and her being suicidal) but I don't want her to kill herself because of it.  What do I do?  Bonus points if your solution doesn't make me look like the worst kind of person in the eyes of family/friends.My girlfriend and I (six years) are going through a rough time.  The TL;DR version is that we don't like each other all that much, and it's becoming more and more apparent as time goes on.  We've changed over the course of our relationship, and now we are together more out of habit than anything.

Normally, you break up at this point in time.  But not when you factor in my girlfriend suffering from depression.  I'm pretty sure that if I broke up with her she would end up either killing herself, or making a show out of trying.  Either by taking a bottle of pills or cutting up her wrists.

Does anyone have experience breaking up with someone who suffers from depression or suicidal thoughts and tenancies.  I want out but don't know what to do, and am scared to try anything.

I'm terrified that she is would do it right after we break up and everyone I know will blame me.
