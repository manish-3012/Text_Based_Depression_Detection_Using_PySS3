vent.i donâ€™t really know what to say or how to start this but iâ€™m going to try to kill myself. and soon. iâ€™m 18 (still in high school), and have been recently kicked out from my dadâ€™s house. i love in with my mom but it hasnâ€™t been working out. she called me a burden today and told me that i made things harder on everyone and that i ruined peopleâ€™s moods and no one wanted to talk to me. that i think was the last straw. i packed all of my clothes and things just now so they can throw them away quickly and just be done with it. i donâ€™t really know what these medicines are but hey. i figure six full bottles of miscellaneous pills has to do something. some of them are higher doses too. wish me luck.
