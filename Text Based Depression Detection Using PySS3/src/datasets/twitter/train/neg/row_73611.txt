What is the pointI've had severe anxiety and depression for years. I'm a 17 year old male, 18 in a few weeks and I've completed high school. Although throughout my life I've faced a lot of adversity and challenges of which I've somehow always been able to overcome, enough is enough. About a month ago I tried to kill myself for the first time. It was planned days in advance and I almost got away with it, until my mum walked in to my room and found me unconscious vomiting blood. I spent 3 days in hospital, and then 2 days in a psych ward. I cannot cope with the pressures of my life anymore. My anxiety causes me so much stress I feel like I'm going to explode. I owe lots of money for lots of things to many people, and because of this I started dealing drugs to make money to repay my debts. My parents caught me dealing drugs and I cannot cope with the embarrassment. I've tried therapy and drugs to no avail. I have nothing going for me in my life, no one I turn to help for. Before my first attempt all that had stopped me was the thought of hurting and bringing disgrace to my family but I no longer care. Tonight I am going to die.
