Iâ€™m 13 and reality has just sunk inI donâ€™t think Iâ€™m cut out for this whole life thing. I never wanted to work or do anything that required effort I thought I could just be happy watching spongebob all day and shit but now I have to go to school and put in effort and thatâ€™s just not something Iâ€™m interested in I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m gonna kill myself today and prolly not even for a couple years but my death is gonna be by my own hand Iâ€™m already bored asf of life itâ€™s just so boring itâ€™s just bullshit that this is what life is when I was 8 I didnâ€™t care about the future I didnt want to think about it but now I have all this responsibility And I know this is just the beginning of all the work idk Iâ€™m ranting now I just wish life wasnâ€™t so boring I wish there was a point to it I just want to be a little kid again I mean I guess I still am but I wish I was a cute little kid again and I could get away with anything and my older brothers friends would come over and I thought they were so cool and I thought I was gonna be like them when I was older but Iâ€™m nothing I donâ€™t have many friends or anything idk i should prolly end this rant already
