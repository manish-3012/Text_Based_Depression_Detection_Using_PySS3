Kinda tried last nightSo last night I tried to slit my wrists but all I had was scissors and I couldn't find lidocaine, idk why I did nothing was really wrong. Even sitting here now I just want to feel the pain, I want to die. There's no other way to fix things, I need to die. I think next chance I get I'll try.i want to talk, if you are going through this too I'll listen to your problems if you listen to mine.
