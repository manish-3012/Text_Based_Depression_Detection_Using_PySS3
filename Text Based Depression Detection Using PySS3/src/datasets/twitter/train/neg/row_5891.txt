Need hope.Please try to read everything before commenting. 

1. I was in a car accident in february that ruined me financially, physically, and mentally. 
2. I worked as a lyft driver because im disabled so I spent 5 months unemployed because my car was totaled. I have a pending settlement on the way because im not at fault. 
3. I crowd sourced money for a car and went back to driving for lyft. 
4. 2 months later im in another accident and my insurance provider forgot to add rideshare endorsements to my policy. We're in the process of trying to retroactively add them. 
5. The more recent accident is 100% my fault. There's $5,500 in property damage and thats without talking abt the cars. 
6. My lawyer handling my settlement from the first accident says getting in another accident will likely tank my settlement because they'll blame my "new injuries" for crippling me for the rest of my life (EVEN THOUGH THE NEW ACCIDENT IS WAAAY LESS SEVERE) . So instead of walking out with 10k in my pocket im lucky walking out with 2k. 
7. I want to kill myself. The thought of being at fault for this accident and having NO coverage and having to pay everything is agonizing. I have no assessts (im probably going to have to surrender the car), I have no savings, I have no job, I have nothing. 

The only thing stopping me from killing myself if the fact that my debt MIGHT transfer to my mother which i cant force her to handle ontop of her disabilities, my demented grandma, and my shitty abusive older sister. 


Is it worth filing for bankruptcy? Is it worth filing for disability? Like what are my ways out of this hell hole.
