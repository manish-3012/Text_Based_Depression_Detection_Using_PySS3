Chat? Please help :/Been feeling really suicidal and really down Iâ€™ve just stopped myself. Just feels like itâ€™s the end of the world for me because so many main things that are in my life have all just fucked up at the same time and Iâ€™m lost. I wouldnâ€™t be surprised if next week was my last week as I need to end this pain. My friends donâ€™t understand my depression, my parents donâ€™t understand, therapy doesnâ€™t help. I come here because people here I can relate to and it makes me feel better and less alone. I need someone I can chat to or vent to or something. Iâ€™m 14f so no one over 18 but I just need someone to talk to to get shit out of my mind. No relationship stuff though because I got broken up with 4 hours ago. This shit really making me feel suicidal
