Reaching outI suppose I'll start off by saying the past few days or so have been unbearable. I've never felt this lost and it scares me because I don't know where I should go from here or when I'll be able to start feeling anything besides cold

I'm uncomfortable sharing too many personal details out in the open. So if anyone has time to spare I'd be grateful if someone could message me. Not to be picky but it's ideal if you're lgbt too
