Stop mePlease someone stop me. I want to die.
I have an autoimmune sjogrens syndrome that has been active for too long. Im only 24 years old and my DLCO from a pulmonary function test is 67% which is below normal. I feel breathless EVERYDAY. TALKING TO PEOPLE, reading outloud, walking leaves me breathless. I probably have scarring and Interstitial lung disease from the sjogrens....

I recentlt found out that my pulmonary function test that I took 3 years ago revealed a "moderately decreased DLCO" and that asshole doctor said nothing was wrong and that I only had asthma....if you ask a pulmonologist asthma DOESNT cause a decrease in dlco. It may even increase the DLCO. i know scarring is not reversible, so I just want to die.

I will never have the life I was working for. I only have a few classes left before I graduate from Uni with a degree in Biology. I have no degree, no job, and no energy to do either anymore. Im breathless, fatigued, and yearning for a swift death, or a remedy.
If I knew of a way to improve my state by at least 50 percent more than where I am at, I would be willing to fight for my life. But everywhere I look, western medicine says I'm doomed to decline.  I'm just a burden on society and I will becoming even more so of a burden the more I am alive. I only have insurance for one more year before I will be stuck with nothing to pay for my meds and nothing to pay for any procedures I will need to do.

I dont have money, I dont have energy, and I dont have hope. How can I end it all as painless as possible? (I hate feeling pain). I dont expect people to actually answer that one but thats what Im thinking of right now.
