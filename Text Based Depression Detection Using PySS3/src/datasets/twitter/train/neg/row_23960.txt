Life got fucked up by familySo I was unlucky enough to be born with parents that were Jehovah witnesses.I have never gone to somebody house before because the think anything that requires you to interact with people who arenâ€™t in their â€œreligionâ€ is Satan trying to persuade you.
              Iâ€™m a high schooler and pretty much athletics has been the only thing to keep me going.Im almost positive I have a lot mental disorders simply because of the lack of interaction Iâ€™ve gotten.The only places Iâ€™ve ever been to in my life has been the store, their â€œmeetingsâ€, school, and home.Anyways, I joined athletics and discovered that I am actually pretty good at wrestling.As soon as I joined it my grades skyrocketed and Iâ€™ve been so happy. I shouldnâ€™t have tried.Pretty much now they banned me from doing that because itâ€™s also â€œbad associationâ€Iâ€™m tired of living a life like this and I canâ€™t see any good place my life is headed.It would be extremely hard for me to even try going to college and if I do try to make a life that is good, I know that everybody I know will shun me.
        It just feels like Iâ€™m wasting my time by living and itâ€™s just going to cause me more suffering.The one thing that made me think better about life now gets ripped away from me. I cannot understand how parents just assume that their kid will follow their religion and force them to live their life by â€œgods wordâ€
   Iâ€™m thinking about ending it all soon, although itâ€™s not like anybody would miss me as I have no friends because those are banned too unless itâ€™s someone from our church.
