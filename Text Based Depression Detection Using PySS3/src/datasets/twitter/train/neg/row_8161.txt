Donâ€™t feel like anything.I feel like Iâ€™m going to just be cast aside and forgotten if Iâ€™m not already.. people donâ€™t want to have to deal with me which I get it, Iâ€™m an annoying mistake.. but it still hurts. And the one person that could make things better wonâ€™t even try to be there for me at all and it makes me really sad because I thought I meant enough to them for that.. everyone I know will tell me things and then just leave me alone and expect me to be able to do them when Iâ€™m at my lowest. 

I hate being the way that I am and I donâ€™t know why I had to be born this way. 

I want to put a bullet in my head so I can stop this constant agony.
