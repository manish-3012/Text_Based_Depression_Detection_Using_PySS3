I tried to slice my neck but the knife on my leatherman is a little dullTried to cut my neck after an event with my step mom because i was too busy writing my essay for college and didn't answer the door to my room. She said that i dont even live in this house and my room should belong to one of my other half siblings who are both under 6 and share a room with each other. After screaming to my face and stuff i didnt feel anything just my heart felt very heavy and with the amount of stress im having with college i just took my leather man and tried to slice my neck just out of curiosity if i could do it. Well turns out it was dull and now my neck is bleeding but not heavily and it stings. I stopped for 15 minutes to continue on my essay and thought i should give it another shot and tried to slice my other side of my neck. Nope its not sharp enough to cut through deep enough. Now i have several cuts on both my neck and they are bleeding and dont know what to do anymore.
