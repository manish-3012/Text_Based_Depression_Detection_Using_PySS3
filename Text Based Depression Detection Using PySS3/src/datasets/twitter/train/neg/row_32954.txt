Why the fuck am I still here. I dont want to kill myself I want to disappear I want to leave.Hi reddit, hopefully I dont get messages like it will get better it never will get fucking better, Even when I think it gets better something happens and I get 2x depressed. I'm tired of my parents I'm tired of having "friends" who act like they care but really fucking dont, my teachers look down on me like im a fucking loser I'm just SO FUCKING DONE.  It wont get better believe me. What do I do?
