Running out of reasons not to kill myselfThe dysphoria's getting so fucking bad. I feel like they're going to start putting people like me in ovens in the coming year. I know they're going to write laws to make our lives even harder so we can't even flee the country soon. 

I feel so fucking trapped. I don't know how to get out of this. I just want to change my name, get my surgery, and get on with my fucking life but I can't. I'm so fucking scared, but at the same time I hate myself. I hate my fucking body, I hate the fucking person that I am. I can't change either any more, I've tried. 

I don't know if they let people like me buy guns , but I want to so I can just blow my fucking brains out as soon as possible. Quick messy death. Dead tranny in the newspaper. Nobody cared.
