work (in particular) and life (in general) makes me want to kill myselfitâ€™s 4 am where I live. I woke up with a really heavy panic attack because I had another nightmare about work. I have a long history of battling panic attacks (I have an anxiety disorder and depression) but with the help of therapy I was finally able to go month without even having one (used to have multiple ones daily). 
Iâ€™ve started working at my workplace 5 month ago. Itâ€™s been hell but itâ€™s important to keep on working there if I want to get into my dream job. 
The first day of work was also the first day in month with a panic attack. Iâ€™m constantly crying at work because Iâ€™m so stressed out, I feel useless, I had holidays for 2 weeks and have to go back now and could not enjoy even one day of them bc I got so anxious thinking about going back to work. 
I have to go back in a few hours. My life is overall going downhill atm and Iâ€™ve never been in such a bad place before. I had plans to kill myself on New Years day but didnâ€™t carry them through, mainly because of my best friend but we got in a big fight yesterday night so he probably hates me... thereâ€™s no reason to stay, if I kill myself during the next few hours I can get rid of all of my problems, it feels so right and Iâ€™ve been feeling this way ever since New Years, I feel like getting rid of myself is the only right thing to do at this point. I donâ€™t have to worry about work, about all of the family drama, I donâ€™t have friends who could be sad because they all left once my depression got worse a year ago. 
Itâ€™s all so pointless. 
I really want to die. I really want to do it now. I donâ€™t have any doubts. This is the only right thing to do, itâ€™s the only thing on my mind, thereâ€™s nothing else. 
Todayâ€™s the day. Itâ€™s all too much. 
Goodbye.
