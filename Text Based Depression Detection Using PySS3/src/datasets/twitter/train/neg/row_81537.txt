Why why why (should I post my pain on Instagram?)Why do I keep going? I didnâ€™t want to live past 18 and now Iâ€™m going to turn 20 in a couple months and still do not want to be alive. The only reason Iâ€™m staying on this earth is so my friends and especially my parents wonâ€™t hurt as much as I do. Everything is fickle and fake. There is nothing for me to live for. Everyone Iâ€™ve reached out to doesnâ€™t even know what to say. Everyone around me expects me to perform in college but itâ€™s too much. Iâ€™ve been through too much. Iâ€™ve given up a long time ago. If I could just disappear I would.
No one would care for long if I died except my parents. Thereâ€™s just things I canâ€™t tell people in my life without feeling worse. I just canâ€™t tell people how horrible living is for me and Iâ€™m tired of pretending.

I almost want to post how much Iâ€™m hurting and how suicidal I am on Instagram so everyone knows how much Iâ€™m hurting. I feel like a big weight would be lifted off my shoulders.
