RollercoasterI'm so tired of getting better. I feel like at this point I'd rather constantly be at a low point, because at least then I won't have any false hope. Every time I get better, I reach out more and make plans just for them to fall through as they always have and probably always will. I'm tired of having false hope. I'm tired of making effort in relationships where I feel like I'm the only one putting in effort. I'm tired all the time, but I just can't ever sleep. Fuck everything.
