Would a suicide hotline send someone out to me if I were an immediate threat to myself?I'm trying to get out of this rut I'm in and I want to contact a suicide hotline but I'm scared that they'll send someone out to me. None of my family knows that I'm suicidal because they're partially the ones who contributed to it and I just don't think I can deal with them knowing about it.

Are the conversations I have with hotlines private?
