struggling in the mud all the way.I really just feel like I want to enjoy the feeling of the mud completely surrounding my body.

my friend says he might have a planned a way we would be able to do this, and maybe even together. digging a 10 foot deep area  in a private location.

I spoke with one of my friends about it, They, had an actual experience in quicksand, when they were 10 years old, and were advising against doing so.

I've know my friend "Jesse" for a long time, and we've talked about possibly going together, to wade and sink together many times, but he didn't take me because of how badly anxious i had felt.

I want to try to sink all the way, But my other friend, Says that since I know the dangers involved, and still want to go, that I'm suicidal for wanting to make the attempt.

I'm just not sure.
