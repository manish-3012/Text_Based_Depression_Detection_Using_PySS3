I donâ€™t know what I have left to live forEverything feels terrible.
My health is shit bc I had a bad reaction to a medicine that was supposed to fix me, my best friend/sister and I barely interact anymore and I canâ€™t trust anyone.
I think this is it.
I have nothing left to live for.
I donâ€™t think anyoneâ€™s gonna change my mind, but if they can I sure as hell need it right now
