i try so hardi became a person that relies too much on making other people happy. i try so hard to be positive to help someone and be a good friend for them. my friend killed herself and if i were just a little bit better everything could be different. except i constantly fail with everything i have no matter how hard i try. i canâ€™t even keep a friendship let alone help anybody. poison
