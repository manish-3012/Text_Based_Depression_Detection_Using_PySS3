Im so tired...I just want to disappear, i cant bear it anymore. I dont want to be happy... i just want everything to end. Happiness is a lie, it doesnt exist. No matter what i do i always end up feeling pain. I tried so hard but nothing helps. My feelings dont make any sense, i just dont understand them anymore. I opened up and talked to people dear to me and while it did help a little and i felt relieved, at the same time it caused so much pain. Why... I distanced myself from everyone and cut all my relationships. Im so lonely. I ruined everything. When im alone i feel pain and when im with others i still feel pain. No matter what i do i always end up feeling pain. Just what am i supposed to do... I attempted suicide once but i changed my mind in the last moment and i regret it so much. If only i had done it back then... Im not even afraid, the only reason am not doing it is because its wrong and because i want everything to have a meaning. I dont want it to be all in vain...
If only i had a reason, anything, im sure i could do it. But there is not a single good thing about life. Not a single one. Everything is so pointless. I dont want to pretend anymore. Im just so tired. I cant do this anymore. Life is shit. The world is fucking shit. Everything is pointless. Its just not worth it... Its not worth it. I hate my life. I hate this world. I hate myself. Im the fucking worst. I ruined everything. I hate myself so fucking much. I wish i was never born.
