I hate being trapped in my own headiâ€™m tired of being alive.
nothing I do matters.
the only thing keeping me from attempting is the possibility that it wonâ€™t be successful and iâ€™ll end up institutionalized again. I honestly wouldnâ€™t even mind that but i donâ€™t have health insurance and my credit is still bad from my first attempt. I cant take it anymore. I feel so hallow. I feel like things will never get better for me. I wish I could sleep forever. i feel like a prisoner in my own head. I hate my life.
