I keep breaking downJust learned another kid I knew die recently. Just saw him the other week. Almost confessed my plans slip after finding out. He said thatâ€™s always a way. I agreed. Just not the way that most people see.

I broke down crying in the subway. I wasnâ€™t even close to this kid, but I could feel his pain. I canâ€™t say that the idea of just falling in front of the next train didnâ€™t cross my mind. 

But I canâ€™t traumatize someone else like that. I feel my lifeline snap one by one. Each day Iâ€™m falling more and more downward spiral. Why am I still here undeservingly alive? 3 years ago. I was saved. But now I donâ€™t think it will happen again. My strength fades more each day. I just have to hold on a little while longer. But that urge hits me more each day. I was sitting on my bathroom floor against the wall crying myself silly. Iâ€™m breaking down daily. I canâ€™t do this anymore. Iâ€™m slipping further into the darkness and honestly I donâ€™t want to get out this time.
