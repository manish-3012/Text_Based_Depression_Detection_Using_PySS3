Friend needs help - she is depressed and suicidal. What do I do?My girlfriend's roommate has issues with her self image, and the way her life is going. She is in her late 20s and in a dead end job, not making much money. My girlfriend is covering most of her expenses, like rent and some utilities. She is depressed about not being able to support herself and has, in the near past, tried to overdose on pills. She doesn't have any health insurance and I think she really needs to see a professional, e.g. psychologist. What can she do? She lives in the metro-Boston area. 

Some misc info: She drinks a lot and when she is drunk she gets really depressed, to the point of crying uncontrollably. I never seen this side of her. One thing for sure is that I won't drink with her again. The problems she are really way out of my area of comfortability and expertise. She has weight issues, self-esteem issues, and her parents are much of a help (I think her mom just says she needs to go to church). I talked to her about it that drunken night and it opened up Pandora's box and I realized I had no idea what to do. I thought I could help her loose weight, but the problem is deeper than just exercising. 

Any help or recommendation will be great. Now, everything is back to normal. My friend seems fine and happy, but I know nothing was resolved. This problem arises every now and again, and seems like it is just brushed under the rug for another couple weeks.  

I don't know if this is the most appropriate sub-reddit to post this on, so please let me know if there is another, more appropriate, one.
