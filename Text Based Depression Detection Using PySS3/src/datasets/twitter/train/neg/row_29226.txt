Why am I like this?Why am I like this? I think know why I'm feeling sad and depressed, I'm a relatively successful, and have a decent group of friends who I know care about me. I'm a union electrician, drive my dreamcar and have a loving family. But recently I just feel like I'm drowning in pitch black Ocean, where there is no light coming through. I think I know where these feelings are coming from and I hate it, I my now ex girlfriend a handful of months ago and we dated for probably 3 weeks. I was always there for her and I won't pretend I was perfect but I spent so much time energy and unfortunately money on her. I spent everyday for 2 weeks staying up until 12 just trying to get her to open up to me and talk about her problems even though I had to wake up at 4 in the morning to go to work. All I did was try to help her, and what did she do? She starts dating my best fucking friend, who hasn't done anything I have for her. he didn't drive 9 hours straight to pick her and her best friend up. He didn't spent 1300 bucks for hotel rooms, gas, and time missed at work. What hurts is that they fucked in the room I paid for and I got to hear the entire fucking thing. The worst part is her reason for braking up with me. She said I was to mature for her, that I was too accepting and understanding of her. I won't be doing anything serious so no one has to worry about me, I feel like I just needed to say something where none of my friends know about my account. Sorry about my wall of text and the formatting, this is my first post on Reddit. Thanks for reading.
