Tiny things push me over the edgeI dwell on small, petty situations for hours and hours, thinking that I am a horrible person because of a thing I did. Combined with my past, I feel like the next tiny thing is going to push me over the edge where I will finally commit suicide. 

I need to die so the world can be a better place.
