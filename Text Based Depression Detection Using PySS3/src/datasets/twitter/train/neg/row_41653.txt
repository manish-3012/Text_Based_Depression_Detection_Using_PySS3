I didnâ€™t think I was going to be alive for as long as I am and Iâ€™m not prepared for my futureI practically threw away my life around middle of senior year of high school. Grades falling, losing friends, stress at home was too much, and that was also when I had my first attempt. Thinking about now, Iâ€™m so not ready for the rest of life. Itâ€™s just misery in the future so whatâ€™s the real point of keeping my hopes up? Iâ€™ve made a vow to myself that if my life doesnâ€™t get better by the end of the year, Iâ€™ll end it right before the new decade. So far, it looks like Iâ€™m on that path; itâ€™s only gotten worse. Sorry folks.
