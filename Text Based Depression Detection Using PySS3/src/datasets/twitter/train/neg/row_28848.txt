Just saying it out loudEver sense my mom died. My life has rather taken a down hill turn. My job laid me off for two mouths now.
Friends donâ€™t want to see me. Or they just wanna ask for money then leave. Girl of my dreams runs to me for help then as soon as I help her she leaves. Best friend only want to use me to move out, but wonâ€™t take no for a answer. 
 Then any time I get interested in a girl I get rejected. Because of the fact I can speak well. My speech has gotten worse to the point I developed a stutter and stammer.
I repeatedly have muscle spasms about when I think about stuff like my mom past relationships.
