Don't know if I can deal with this anymorebefore I start sorry for the poor grammar and punctuation will be writing this fast
I just don't know what I'm doing anymore I don't want to live anymore and I keep searching for the light at the end of the tunnel to go out of this but only ever get a light pass over the top of me and make me happy for a day at the most and then it is right back into the darkness I just can't take it anymore I'm sick of my mind always ruining everything for me, every memory that should be positive just twisting into I'll never be that happy again I'm just getting to the point when the lights aren't good enough anymore and the only way to stop the darkness is to stop and turn off for good the feeling of crushing loneliness is just getting to be to much and I'm sick of people having no idea what I'm talking about when I have told the very few people I have told. Last night I spent it with one of the most amazing people I had ever met but as happy as I was this time last night now I feel 1000 times worse and just don't know what I'm doing. All I want is my phone to go off and it be her but I know it isnt going to happen and it is crushing me but it isnt just her I just want someone to reach out and try and pull me back someone I can just sit there and talk about this stuff and who can just listen and help but no one does, I'm searching for a exit from this hell but I'm utterly lost.
