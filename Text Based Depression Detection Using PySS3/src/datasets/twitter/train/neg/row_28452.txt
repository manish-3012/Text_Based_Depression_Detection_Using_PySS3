I need helpIf anyone is out there, I need someone to talk to. I got dumped last week by the love of my life because she isn't over her ex. Apparently I didn't do anything wrong, so how am I ever going to be good enough? The last 2 years have been an endless disaster and I want to end it all. I have enough pills I think to do it after work tonight.
