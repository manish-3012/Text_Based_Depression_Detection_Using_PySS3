I need help.I've tired to talked to my friends about how I'm feeling, but they either don't get it, latch on to something  minor that I'm saying.. Or just plan play dumb. They say they care but when I all but say I'm thinking about ending it... Well they just don't seem to want to hear it. 

I'm tired, I don't want to be here anymore. I'm tired of fighting to keep my head up. So fucking tired of thinking I'm okay, that I fixed the situation only to have it back fire in my face. I don't see the point of anything anymore. Not even my dog brings really makes me smile.

 The only thing that's stopping me is the fear of death itself. I've started covering my bases, handling what I have to.. Because honestly one of these quite nights, I won't be scared anymore, or the pain will out way the fear. I feel closer to that point every night.

I need help, I know I do. But I have no way of getting it. I can't even get to a therapist if I had one, no transportation. Can't even pay for bus fair. Barely even eating now a days, hardly even want too. 

I just feel so lost, nothing makes sense anymore, and I'm tired of trying to find my way.
