RelapsingI suffered from suicidal impulses for years, but about half a year ago they became controllable and eventually went away. I wish this was where it ended but my suicidal impulses has started coming back and more regularly than before over the last month. I don't know what to do and I fear if this continues any longer that my days have been counted in the near future.
