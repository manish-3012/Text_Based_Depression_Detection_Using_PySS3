QuestionDoes anyone else think that if someone is fundamentally sad that suicide may be the correct choice?

I do support euthanasia and with that in mind I watch people I know struggle with depression and suicidal ideation. I wonder if it would be more humane to let people die instead of encouraging them to stay alive. 

I've watched people struggle through treatments that haven't worked. I've watched my mum have suicidal ideation for my entire life. I am aware she tried to kill herself a few times before she had children as well. 

Because we have hope as humans we encourage others to live and that "it will get better, this is only temporary" "permanent solution to a temporary problem" but with the suicide rate so high in the elderly I'm pretty sure it doesn't get better and if it does there will still be the point where it heads back down. 

I feel guilty for trying to keep my friend alive. What makes me so special that he has to keep feeling like this just because I need him and so I feel less alone. That's so fucking selfish of me. 

I've had suicidal ideation for 28 years. 
I can't do this for another 40.  Abject misery interspersed with moments of " in this moment it's ok" or having a cat snuggle up to me. 

It's not worth the pay off. 

I have my plan. My sister is about to give birth so I have to wait for a least a year. I can't be that much of a cunt.  Just pretend everything is ok and then I'll be swinging in a tree on the golf course.
