A lot of people say their depression feels like nothingness. I wish I could just feel nothing instead of this crushing sadness.Iâ€™m such an abject failure and I feel like Iâ€™m drowning in the many ways Iâ€™m a disappointment. I do feel hollow and lifeless, is that what people mean? I could never quite understand it.
