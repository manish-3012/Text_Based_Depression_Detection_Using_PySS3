Holidays startedThat's all for studying for this year. But my head is empty and i'm still feeling constant shame and pain. Want to have a rest, but can't. 

Some people say that winter is beautiful. But it's grey and cold. 

I can no longer talk to people. Especially close relatives. World is overflown with noise and murmur. 

Also, tomorrow me and a friend of mine decided to go to museum together. Eventually she started to favour me more and more. Every hug we have is becoming warmer and longer. 

But i'm afraid that if we start dating i'll just destroy her life. Just because i'm worthless irresponcible egocentric shit that doesn't care about people close to him (as it happened with attitude to my mother who cares about nothing but my studying and grades).
