Not depressed or sad but getting more comfortable with suicide day by day because I just dont enjoy the struggle of being alive. 

I really don't know what i'm doing with my life. I'm 25 years old and i'm a filmmaker, people praise me for the stuff I make, write and work on but the more they do, the more uncomfortable I get. I have no real friends and no family, everybody in my life seems like an asset to my own succes, I can't help it and it sucks...... 

I got kicked out at 16 and became homeless pretty quick, since then it seems I have become desensitized to life itself, i'm actually doing really great now but still.... I'm slowly becoming an alcoholic after having been an stoner for over three years. Lately I have been thinking about getting a gun or making an exit bag and just ending it, I mean why not? Life is good-ish, i'm happy most of the time, why should I endure another 40-50 years of uncertainty and struggle while I can just end it now?
