I feel like I'm stuck in a loopI wake up, and immediately anxiety sets in, I go to school where I'm not able to focus due to constant thoughts racing through my mind. I go home and talk to a friend a bit, most of the times a lot of bottled up emotions come out and I'm starting to feel bad about me talking to her about my day.

I just want to break this loop, cease to exist and just finish it all, sometimes the days are okay but I'm starting to feel like a burden to my friend and the people around me.

Fuck
