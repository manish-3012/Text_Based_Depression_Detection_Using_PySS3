No hopeIâ€™m really really tired.
Iâ€™ve had a big year achievement wise, but no one to share it with.
I drifted from all my friends of over 5 years after we left high school last year, but itâ€™s all my fault because I isolate myself.
My family is a mess, all I do is work.
Iâ€™m plagued by anxiety and depression all the time, always putting up a mask. No one from my work place would guess Iâ€™m as depressed as I am.
Iâ€™m too ashamed of myself, I support LGBTQ+ but canâ€™t seem to come to the fact that I am apart of it myself, because look at all the judgement still out there!
I honestly have tried everything, therapy, medication, exercising, throwing myself into work, keeping busy.
I think Iâ€™ve nearly reached the end guys.
19 years of life, 3 months away from 20.
I donâ€™t know how Iâ€™ll keep going on with no one.
Well even if I have people, I still feel lonely.
Iâ€™m honestly hopeless.
