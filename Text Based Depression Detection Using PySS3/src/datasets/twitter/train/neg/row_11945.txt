i hate my life.i feel sad all the time. i spend more time alone than most other 16 year olds. my mother has been sick for years now. im sick of the way my dad treats her and the rest of my family. ive been bullied my whole life. i developed crippling anxiety because of it. i hate myself because i am lazy and no matter how hard i try to do something i give up if its too hard.

ive dealt with depression for more than 3 years now and have been having suicidal thoughts nearly every day for over a year now. im sick of having this heavy feeling in my heart area caused by stress.

this world is so fucked up. theres always someone who cant accept someone else for who they are.

i want to die. im never going to meet a girl. im never going to have a lifelong friend. this world sucks. all you do is work a 9-5 job to pay bills.
