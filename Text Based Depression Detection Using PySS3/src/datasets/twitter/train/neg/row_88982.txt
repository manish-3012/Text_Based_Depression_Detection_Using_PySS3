I'm going to be my school's first student to suicide(hopefully)My high school is fairly new, been operating for 6 years i think. I haven't heard of a student that has killed themselves. We have had deaths but not from sucide and I'm going to be the first.
Idk why that makes me happy. I'm ending my life on my own terms, my past was filled with pain, my present is filled with pain and my future? I'm sure it's going to have pain.

Ive tried to off myself like 9 times. This time I'm going all or nothing and going skyhigh baby. I'm gonna jump. I still haven't found the building which is high enough but I'm sure i will. 

Sky high baby.
