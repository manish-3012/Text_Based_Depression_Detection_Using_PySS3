I'm sorry, to everyone I've let down.I'm a 19 year old kid living on his own, attending college 3 hours away from home. I was recently diagnosed with PTSD due to my upbringing under an alcoholic father and complacent mother. I'm so desperately trying everything to survive being an adult on my own, but whether it be money, or school or even friendships I'm a fuck up. I'm trying to land a fulltime job in this new city, I'm trying to eat healthier and lose weight, I'm trying to attend all of my classes and get the grades I need all the while keeping in touch with my family and friends. My folks are always on my case about when I'm seeing them next, but I cant just up and drive three hours when I work two part time jobs and have school. They say I'm inconsiderate, and try to guilt me into going home when that atmosphere is toxic for me. My father, who is playing the loving act after so many years just wont leave me alone. After abusing me and my mother up until I moved out, he calls me all the time letting me know he misses me. But that is mute at this point. Nothing I do, whether it be going to school, working my ass or being social is ever enough. If I just ended it then I would have no more expectations to meet, it would be my choice and that would feel truly liberating. But I'm conflicted, because I want a future. I enjoy life when its good. However I keep letting everyone down, even myself. I am so alone, I feel like I'm suffocating.
