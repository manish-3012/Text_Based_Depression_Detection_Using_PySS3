I can't see any future for myself.I'm struggling with the thought of living. I'd rather not be alive anymore, but I'm too much of a coward to kill myself. I'm having trouble seeing a future for myself. I feel like there's no other options at this point.
I don't want to kill myself but I can't help but feel satisfied at the idea of walking into traffic and being hit by a car.
I wish I could just go back in time and change the way I lived my life.
