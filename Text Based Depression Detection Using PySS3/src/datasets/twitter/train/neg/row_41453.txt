No Insurance, No Income... How to get help?Can anyone here tell me something I can do to get help?... especially a diagnosis, because I just want to know that this is real. I have no resources and I want to at least try to get out of this hole.

I'm  fairly certain I'm on the autism spectrum and the difficulties I face in life are ramping. I've decided that I can only give up after I honestly reach out for help, but I don't have any resources.
