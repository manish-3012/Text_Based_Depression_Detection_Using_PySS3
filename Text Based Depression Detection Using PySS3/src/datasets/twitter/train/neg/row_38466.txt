I want to live, just as someone else, somewhere elseMy whole life has been one big waste. I really, truly, cannot do anything right, I am a bad person for reasons i do not understand, and just by existing i am doing something wrong. i spent my life alone pretending to be someone I'm not for people who didn't care. I know that i can never truly exist and be myself because I am unlovable. i am lonely and left out of life as i see people connect with one another and feel passionately about things, and i think don't know how. my own parents regret having me because of how mentally fucked up I am. they wanted to leave a legacy, see themselves in my but better, more impressive, and I am a disappointment. really i don't do much with my life besides wait for it to be over. so why can't i just get it over with already? The boredom of life is getting hard to tolerate
