My psychologist promised she would never leave, I told her she couldn't promise that, she insisted, but still ended up doing it. Why?She also didn't refer me to anyone. I don't know how I'm so unlucky. I feel like the whole universe wants me to die.

This is a +1 month wound, but it still hasn't healed and I can't seem to make peace with it. I don't eat, I don't sleep, I don't care about anything, I am at an all time low and I honestly just want to rot away and not do anything anymore until I'm dead.

Why would my therapist do this to me, especially when she knew that my BPD is triggered by abandonment and rejection? I don't understand.. can someone try to give their opinion on what may have happened?

I was very close to her and one day she decided that she would ask for advice (I don't remember what was the right terminology she used but it seemed like she seeked other therapist advice or something) and she just canceled appointments until one specific date and in that day, she told me that she wasn't going to have any more appointments with me. Is this normal? I don't even want to go to any other therapist because of this.. My trust was already very damaged by previous experiences but when I decided to give one last chance and trust, this happens! I'm done with this.

She was my college psychologist and she didn't even referred me to anyone.. What am I supposed to do? I don't even really have the patience or will to issue a lawsuit against her, either.. Now, I am all alone and I can't afford a private psychologist. To add to the whole "pile" I wasn't accepted on any college this year.. Also, my psychiatrist is sick and canceled the appointments indefinitely.. Why is this happening? I'm so tired..
