Public Breakdown #2Honestly canâ€™t handle being alive anymore. Depression and anxiety got the best of me today on an airplane of all places.. stuck in the middle of two randoms. 
Seeing my ex last night brought me all the way back to where I started and i donâ€™t have the strength to get back to where I was before. 
I feel shitty because I feel like thereâ€™s so much worse to be upset about than a girl but I canâ€™t help it. And Iâ€™m scared that the one person I feel like I can trust talking about this is sick of hearing me whine about it. 
I donâ€™t know I guess I just feel like Iâ€™m slowly falling deeper into a black hole and I donâ€™t know how to get out of it
