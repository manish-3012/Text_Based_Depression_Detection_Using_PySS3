What the FUCK is wrong with me? Do I deserve to die?Trying to keep this brief: smoked way too much weed and cigarettes for almost a decade. it was self-medicating because I'm neurotic. After I quit I became convinced I will get lung cancer and have ruined my life. Filled with regrets and self-loathing because I think smoking is for losers. Filled with negative self-talk. Wanted to kill myself. These thoughts kept repeating for months and I was so miserable that I wanted to die. 

In an irrational impulse I contacted my ex because I was going to kill myself anyway so what the hell. What I did to her was fucking harassment. I wasn't thinking straight. She kept insulting me and then blocking me so I wanted to defend myself and I made new accounts. In the end she was SO angry that she wrote one last message that completely eviscerated me. 

There were some unfair things in it and it was so extremely mean that I couldn't stop thinking about it. Like just hour after hour I would hear it repeat and I couldn't deal with that. I would have snapped out of my bullshit mindset of dying of lung cancer by myself, but now I have to deal with THIS. So what I did was just constantly sending new messages on instagram begging her to reply and talk this out because I know this will repeat for at least a year. Would delete them later because my rational part of my brain knew that I was stalking her. 

We're 4 months later now and I'm completely disgusted by myself. Like so sick of my shit. Completely embarrassed that I bothered my ex so much. I don't know what I was thinking guys :( It's completely my own fault for not shutting up after her first angry message. I'm just such a fucking psycho. What was I doing with this pathetic behavior? I never expected myself to drop to such a low level. I want to kill myself now. I lost my self-respect. I'm a crazy person.
