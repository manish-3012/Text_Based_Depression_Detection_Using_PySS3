My mother set me up, he is coming for me...My mother went online pretending to be me, found a guy and now he is coming here to marry me. 
I couldnâ€™t stand up to her because Iâ€™m afraid of her. 
I canâ€™t see a way out... 
there is no place for me to go, even homeless shelters for women wonâ€™t take me.
