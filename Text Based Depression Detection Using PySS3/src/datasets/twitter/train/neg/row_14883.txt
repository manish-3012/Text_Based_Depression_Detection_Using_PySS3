I'm done with livingI think I have come to the realisation that I'm just done with life and done with being alive. I don't feel hopeless and I don't feel that kind of despair that used to come with my suicidal thoughts anymore. It irritates me, because most people who want to commit suicide are in intense emotional distress. For me it's actually the opposite. I don't feel fear anymore. I'm not scared of death or dying anymore. In fact, I feel relief. I feel relief because now I finally don't want to live anymore and I'm not scared of dying, so there is really nothing holding me back anymore.
