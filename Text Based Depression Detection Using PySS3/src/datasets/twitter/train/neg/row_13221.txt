i canâ€™t stop *trying*within the past week, i have attempted to kill myself almost every day. i overdosed on pills, i slit my wrists, and i even tried to hang myself. 
now, when i first accepted i was depressed, i told myself that i would never kill myself by suffocation or start cutting. i have allowed myself to fall asleep on railroads and be disappointed when i would wake up. this happens multiple times a week, but it follows my rules. i gave up on not letting me cut myself 3 years ago. havenâ€™t been able to stop since. but iâ€™ve been trying to keep my cutting not too deep on my arms â€œjust in case.â€ 
the fact i finally tied a noose and hung there for an hour before i opened my eyes shocked to be alive shows me how my life only gets more fucked up. rules donâ€™t mean anything anyways. 

to make shit better. the only person i considered to be a â€œfriendâ€ of mine told the whole school i was suicidal and i had fucking CPS come interrogate me. everything is shit and im just now able to get high again. hope this weed keeps me from failing again.
