( 22 year old with paraphilia). Thanking everyone who was supportive in my previous post which was deleted by reddit admins. I am not going to kill myself anytime soonI posted about 2 days ago about my struggles with pedophilia. 

Update: Thank you everyone who has been so helpful and supportive over what Iâ€™ve been going through. I was honestly surprised by how many people were supportive of my situation instead of  making me feel worse about myself. Iâ€™m sorry if I didnâ€™t get a chance to reply to all of you. Reddit banned my account the same day I posted my story because apparently my post violated some rule that had to do with sexualizing minors even though I clearly wasnâ€™t encouraging any behavior of that sort. Luckily, I talked to the admins and they reverted my permanent ban, so now Iâ€™m back.

Again, you have no idea how much my attitude has changed because of your comments, sympathy , and understanding. I donâ€™t want to kill myself and this just gave me an extra drive to continue my journey on overcoming this darkness of mine, and finding some peace of mind while continuing to better myself. Best of luck to everyone , thanks again.
