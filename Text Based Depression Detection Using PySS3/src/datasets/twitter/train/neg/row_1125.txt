I don't understand it.I have been helping people cope with depression and suicidal thoughts for years and have helped a lot of them get back on their feet looking at a brighter day. But in reality I've been preventing them from doing exactly what I can't sum up the courage to do myself. I know I don't want to exist anymore. I just don't know why. I just need a reason to exist and I can't find one...
