Someone Important.Recently I've met an individual that, for the entire year and a half that I've known them, has impacted me in both negative and positive ways. I have read through the two links in the subreddit that specified methods of talking with someone who is dealing with thoughts of suicide. I am not a very well equipped person when it comes to social skills. After reading through the tactics used I am still worried about this persons well being. They commonly talk about death, avoiding the word suicide, and about hiding their emotions emotions to those around them. I'm currently talking with them about their take on the way things have played out in their life. I'm trying to use the tactic of open ended questioning to learn and try to go to the depths of their darkness with them, but I'm not sure what other tactics might work? I'm attempting to be an active listener, while trying to dig deeper to better understand the person. Granted I've only know the individual for a little over a year now, I'm determined to see that they at least don't feel alone if they should find that death is their only option. I've lost a previous friend to suicide not long ago and I don't want to lose another. I guess I'm asking for more advise from other people.

Thanks for reading.
