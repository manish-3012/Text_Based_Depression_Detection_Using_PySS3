Freshman in high school. I know Iâ€™m young. I donâ€™t care [UPDATE]https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/6z61bu/freshman_in_high_school_i_know_im_young_i_dont/

Well. Itâ€™s been more or less six months since then. The kids in my class have been outcasting me, and Iâ€™ve gone to every single counselor about it. Theyâ€™ve done nothing. Iâ€™ve calmly made a statement about transferring to another school to my parents. They yelled at me for even bringing it up, and that I should focus more on grades and not even have any friends. My only friend (mentioned in the last post) is drifting away from me. Heâ€™s made plenty of friends, who are far more interesting than Iâ€™ll ever be. Tomorrow is my schoolâ€™s formal; Iâ€™ll be sulking off in the corner while all the happy people with dates are loving life. I just want to fucking die, every night I fantasize about how everyone I know will react. In reality, no one will say anything. Even though everyone pretends to care.
