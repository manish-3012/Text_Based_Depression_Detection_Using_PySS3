I just feel so disconnectedI feel like my family doesnâ€™t care about me anymore. I feel like everyone around me has meaningful friendships and relationships and I will never have those things because no one could really love me for more than a little bit of time. Iâ€™m such a difficult person to deal with. I feel like Iâ€™ll never find happiness and I just want to give up. Iâ€™m so at peace with the idea of dying like ASAP that I feel like thatâ€™s why I was born. To die young and unaccomplished. No one will even remember me. My nephew is too young to remember me. My niece barely knows who I am anymore. It doesnâ€™t even matter. 

The only thing keeping me alive rn is my cat. I donâ€™t want to abandon him. But I want to be done with this life soon. I canâ€™t â€œliveâ€ like this anymore.
