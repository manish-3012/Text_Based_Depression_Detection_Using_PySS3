I need a talking down. Please.I'm in a really bad spot.
My boyfriend...he hasn't always been the nicest.
He's accusing me of lying. He's threatened to throw away my clothes in the apartmen we share. I'm not there right now. I know him leaving would be best as he's not always nice and accuses me of lying, but I'm scared.

Also, I love my mom but I feel our relationship grows weaker every day. She's cold on the phone with me. She says I only care about my boyfriend (not true....) she'll say I don't love her. To call her mom.
She has a lot of pills...A lot.
I could sneak some and have some close to me.
It's so tempting.

I used to have more suicidal thoughts as a teen. I used to read this weird space-themed purple suicide page. It always calmed down.
