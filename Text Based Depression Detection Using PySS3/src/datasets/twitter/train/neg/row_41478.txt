My sister has possibly committed suicide and I don't know what to do.Hey, I don't know why I'm even posting this but I guess im trying to do anything. Not long ago my older sister who has struggled with depression and has been having troubles of late went into a panic attack after my piece of shit mother stuck her nose where it didn't belong once again. And now my sister has gone off after telling me on the phone that she can't do it anymore and it's just too hard.

Edit: she answere. She's at a lookout. I tried to get to to stay and let me sit with her.. After 10 mins she hung up.

Edit2: we found her. She's alive, but still worry. But now my mum is threatening suicide. Saying she can't do it anymore. Fuck my life.

I don't know what to do.
