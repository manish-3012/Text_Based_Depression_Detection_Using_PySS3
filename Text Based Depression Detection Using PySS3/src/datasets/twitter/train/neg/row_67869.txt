hostage no moreIve always felt like a hostage to this life, like Ive always been forced to like it here, to want to live. Im supposed to want to be here but never have. Not being captive to those feelings feels so amazing. Thinking about and getting ready for whatevers next. Nothing matters here anymore, nothing now or nothing that ever was....its such a relief like I can breath.
