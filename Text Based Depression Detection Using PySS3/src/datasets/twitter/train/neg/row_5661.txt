SuicideWanted to share this with whoever the fuck would listen so here it goes.. 28 and fucking over this so called piece of shit, â€œlifeâ€. Raised in foster care most my life. Spent everyday with my brother in and out of foster care only to have my mother kill him with overdose of depressants that she forcefully put on him. She decided to try and be a mother at his age of 18 as my brother died in the same home as her due to pills. She died nine years later due to the same cause of overdose, â€œoh the ironyâ€. I have no family, no friends, no job, no money, no freedom, nothing at all. Thereâ€™s no point in suffering in such a mediocre life. This is my farewell in saying, â€œthis world is twisted and fucked beyond beliefâ€. Family and friends are all a fake terms to make you feel like you have something but you truly donâ€™t. Everyone is out for themselves. They want to merely use you or abuse you. Been thinking about suicide much lately and this is my farewell. I wish the worst for everyone that has abandon me. Always wanted to do good but it doesnâ€™t seem like thatâ€™s possible in this life. Farewell humans.
