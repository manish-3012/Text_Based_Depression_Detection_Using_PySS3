I'm a social outcastI only hangout with my parents, and all I do is look at social media wishing that I was dating cute girls. That's my life right now. I'm stuck on my stupid hot ex from 10 years ago. I'm so tired of it. I never meant to get in anyone's way. I just wanted a peaceful life. I don't know. I guess I'm overthinking but I'm lost right now.
