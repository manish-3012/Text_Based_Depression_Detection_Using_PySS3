Been having suicidal thoughtsI keep thinking if I don't get what I want and things don't change next year, I won't stick around
Like, what's the point of being here if I'm not wanted the way I want others?

Or my works aren't celebrated?

Or my activism is ignored on Facebook?

Or I'm belittled or treated like I'm an annoying bug?

And dont tell me I should love myself!

It's hard

It won't last

And I'd rather love others, instead
