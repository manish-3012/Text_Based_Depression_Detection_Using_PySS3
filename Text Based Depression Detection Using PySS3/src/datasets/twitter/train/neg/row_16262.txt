They are goneI saw my friend take his own life because he couldn't deal with the loss of his sister. I was so close to stopping him.  Now that my brother is gone I struggle when I need help. Right now I'm heart broken. I ache. My spouse hurt me, but idk if she knows how much. I sit on the edge with nobody to talk too. I have never gained another friendship like his. It keeps me lost right now
