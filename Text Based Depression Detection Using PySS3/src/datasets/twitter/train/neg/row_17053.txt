What can I do for a suicidal friend who's location I don't know?Hi there, I hope this is the right place to post this.

A girl I used to be friends with and just drifted from has posted essentially a suicide letter on twitter tonight. The tweets were 45 minutes old by the time I saw them. I have sent her a message asking her to talk to me but no reply. 

I don't have her phone number anymore or her address. I know the name of the town she moved to. Is there anything I can do? Can I call the authorities when I don't have an address for her? I'm in the UK if that helps. Thank you
