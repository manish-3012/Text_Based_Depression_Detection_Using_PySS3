Itâ€™s so difficultI ought to provide a semblance of context before I express my feelings. Iâ€™m a 15 year old high school student with a rather rough (but not to extreme levels) background, and the household I have lived in has always been monetarily far below average. I have no siblings and only one parent â€” my grandparents have passed away and my mother is... gone. I donâ€™t know if I suffer from depression, and Iâ€™m not going to say that I have it unless I get an official diagnosis one day. 

Anyway, I think Iâ€™ve covered the basics about myself. 

I suppose I should jump right in. I am extremely... sad. Ever since I turned 13, I gradually have been losing my ability to be happy. I get frustrated from minor things and feel strongly perturbed by little inconveniences. I feel so lonely most of the time. 

And I feel horrible about feeling sad. Itâ€™s like I shouldnâ€™t be sad; I am 2nd of my class, have great friends, and a greatly-loving father. 

Itâ€™s just that no matter what, nothing seems to make me happy. I am scared of death, which has swayed me away from suicide before. But with my linear and steady decline in mental health, I really am being convinced I have nothing to live for. 

I just donâ€™t find happiness anymore. Iâ€™m always really sad. I have to fake my smile 95% of the time, and I feel so hopeless. I want so badly to be able to speak to a professional, but I donâ€™t know how to address the situation to my dad. Iâ€™m scared. 

If youâ€™ve read to here, thank you. I think I went off on a tangent writing this. If I was ever confusing, just let me know and I will try to clear things up.
