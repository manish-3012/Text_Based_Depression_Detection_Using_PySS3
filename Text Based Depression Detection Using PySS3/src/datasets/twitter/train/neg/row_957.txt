dark clouds aheadI just want to start by saying oh did my life pull a lot of wrong people and them life started going downhill during the last years. I don't want to get in detail but my actions caused a lot of negative situations for me and the people around me and I'm at a point where I can't go through it anymore.
The future isn't bright financially not to mention health and social.
I don't know who to turn to for advice so let me know what would you do in my position?
Can anyone offer advice regarding methods that are easily accessible and reliable?
