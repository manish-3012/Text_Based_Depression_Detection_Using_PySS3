I want to die buttomorrow I have to teach a class. I teach for the rest of the semester. and my Master's project proposal is due.

I'm fucking STUCK here. fuck this, you know?

just venting. don't give too much thought to this. there are people on this subreddit with more serious and pressing thoughts of suicide. 

edit: googled on the cost of staying in a hospital for suicide. so expensive. i'm better toughing it out.
