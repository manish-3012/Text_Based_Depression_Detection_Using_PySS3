please, save me.I'm sorry for the quality of my english, I ain't not a  native speaker.

so, nine thirty am, and I realised that today might be the day I'm throwing myself in front of the first bus that I see passing through the highway. I fell like this last few months have been a rollercoaster for me, and it's really hard to enjoy things the same way I did last year. 

fuck that, I'm not trying to explain my situation, I'm just making a request: please, convince me not to do that.
