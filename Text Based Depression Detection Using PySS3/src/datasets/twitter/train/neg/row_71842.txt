I feel like I have less than two weeks left.I have less than $30 to my name, and I have so many bills due in September. I apply for tons of babysitting jobs, and nothing. My actual job won't pay me until Sept. 29, and I can't wait that long. I can't ask for help. I mean, I could, but honestly the humiliation is too much and I'd rather die. I'm even looking into weird shit on craigslist but no one will reply to me. I'm done. I'm not hearing a damn word back about anything, and no matter how many studies, and odd jobs, and borderline-illegal jobs I apply to I can't even get a response back. I don't feel like I'm gonna make it. The only things I have of value to sell are my car and my phone, and I need those for my job. I just want to die.
