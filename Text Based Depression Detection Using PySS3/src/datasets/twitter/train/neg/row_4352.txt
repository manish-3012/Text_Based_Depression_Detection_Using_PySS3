I don't see the point.Life just seems pointless to me because I know that one day I'll die some shitty pathetic death and it won't matter if I lived a happy and successful life or if I sat in my room alone everyday. When I die, I'll just be gone and won't have any memory of my life and eventually the few people in my life will die and forget about me too. I feel like I'm just sitting around, waiting to die and wasting space. I would rather just get it over with now. I haven't talked to anyone about it because I don't want to seem like I'm trying to get attention or be dramatic. I actually have no idea why I'm posting on here. I'm sure there's lots of other people that need more help than me and I'm just wasting everyone's time like always.
