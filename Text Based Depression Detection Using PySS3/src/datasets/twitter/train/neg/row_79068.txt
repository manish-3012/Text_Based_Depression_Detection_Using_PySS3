I just want my family backI thought I had a perfect family. I thought my marriage was perfect. I wouldn't have traded it for the world. But it turns out my wife has been pretending everything is okay for several months and it has finally become too much for her. She is leaving me with no opportunity for me to try and fix what was wrong. She considers the months of her hiding her feelings "trying" and says we have already tried. We have a daughter that I haven't been able to control crying around. Every time I see her it reminds me that I'm not going to be waking her up or school anymore. The idea of losing my family is too much to bear. I don't hate my wife. I don't want to lose her. She's my best and only friend. Now she looks at me as if she's hated me for years and I feel so alone and empty. She was everything to me. I could talk to her about anything and I thought she could do the same but she was hiding how she truly felt. I just want to wake up from this and find out it was all a horrible nightmare.

I've wanted to die so much since she told me there was no way to fix this. I don't want to live my life without my best friend. She won't even just talk to me like a friend. I just want her to give me a hug and let me hold her the way I used to. Right now the closest thing I have to a friend is a 6 year old concerned about her daddy crying so much. I think if it weren't for her I'd have already killed myself. I planned to shoot myself yesterday, but I couldn't think of a way to do it without traumatizing anyone. The idea of my daughter or wife finding me and having to witness that made that impossible. 

I don't know what to do. I never even remotely thought this was a possibility in our marriage. We've been together for almost 10 years and they have been the happiest 10 years of my life. Not without struggles, but years I would never give up. I'm so fucking alone.
