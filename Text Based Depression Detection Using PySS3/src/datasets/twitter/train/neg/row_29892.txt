I can't do anything right.I can not get a job no matter what I do. Over 10 years of customer service experience and no one will even give me a chance. I was promised a job and I passed the interview through the phone and had to quit my other job to go to this one on the other side of the country and when I get there they tell me they gave the position to someone else. Now I'm jobless and even though I have nothing but good referrals no one will hire me. Even on places like Indeed and LinkedIn I get people contacting me saying they are in interested in hiring me yet when I call them they never call back.

I feel so worthless. I hate myself for being tricked like this. I just want to end it all to stop being a burden.
