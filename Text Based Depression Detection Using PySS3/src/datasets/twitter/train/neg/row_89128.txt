Going to kill myself tomorrow morning (unless you can think of something better?)I don't know what to say, really, I just need help. please.

I'm a 17 year-old girl from the midwest (USA). I'm a high school dropout and there's nothing very remarkable about me. I'm not pretty, smart, funny, or talented in any way I can think of. Even if you spent the whole day with me, you would forget me as soon as you woke up the next day.

I live at home with my dad. He hates me. We do not talk. And this is not an exaggeration, he literally does not talk to me ever. He's not abusive, he makes me food and buys me the things I need, but I know he's counting down the days until I turn 18 and he can kick me out. My mom abandoned me when I was 12.  

I don't have any friends. Again, you probably think I'm exaggerating. But because I don't go to school, I don't have a job, and I can't drive, I rarely leave the house. So I have very little human contact.

There's not a lot of hope for my future. I can't see anyone wanting a loser like me.

I think in another life I could have been happy, maybe even successful. But here I have nothing. And so, even though I don't want to, I'm going to kill myself tomorrow morning when my dad leaves for work. I know how to do it so it will be quick. 

I don't want to die, but I feel like I have no choice. Please help me.
