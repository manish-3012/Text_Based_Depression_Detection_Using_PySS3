I've moving closer, I'm afraid.Tonight I wrote out my suicide note. Took my gun out my safe and placed it on my temple. While I knew that I was still not near pulling the trigger, I feel myself drifting dangerously close, it's a matter of centimeters now. I'm worried that I'm subliminally going through the motions and that I feel so close to pulling the trigger. I'm not scared, I'm not sorry, I'm nothing - even worse. I see no hope. I feel no love and I don't hear anyone asking me to stay. Help? I'm not sure as much as I just wantedt tell someone, I'm so scared.
