Staying alive for my crisis counsoler?Short version:

I have a crush on my counsoler. But I'm ready to die. 

I can't stop thinking about how He would feel, all the guilt, blame and anger....

I just know that when this obsession passes, I won't have a reason to live. I need a better reason than a false fantasy to be here.

I feel like all my power has been taken away from me. I can have *suicide method* in my hand but I can't will myself to do it. I feel like a caged animal.

In the past before and during suicide I have experienced great happiness and freedom. I want my freedom back, at least the option...

I also wish there was a non creepy way to tell him thank you, and for him to know his impact. (Not my  feelings for him lol)...
If I do kill myself, I'll probably email him a goodbye hoping it would help? ..I'll be dead so what do I have to lose?
