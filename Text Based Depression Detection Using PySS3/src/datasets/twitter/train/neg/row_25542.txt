I can't take it anymore. If that's going to continue I'm going to die.Why do I persist. Every day is just more pain. What is the point of such life? I can't even think properly anymore. The last time I've visited a doctor she didn't know what was going on. Now I can't go to the doctor because of this quarantine thing. If nothing is going to change I'm out. That's enough.
