I'm planning on jumping off of a bridge tomorrowAll I see is catastrophe, everywhere I look there's no escape. I don't want to feel anything anymore. I don't want positive nor negative emotion, I want to be non existent. I don't want to see the future. I don't want to see myself a minute in the future or 5 years in the future. I don't want to grow older. I'd rather die young. I don't care about the trauma I'll be putting on to others, it won't matter to me because I wont see it, I'll be dead, I don't care about what I'll leave behind. I don't care about pain. If anything I deserve all the pain in the world. I hope hell exists so I can suffer eternally. I'd be happy to see myself in an eternal state of suffering.

I disgust myself every time I look in the mirror, I hope the worst for myself.

I hope I jump and then I change my mind after but realize it's too late and die anyway. I hope I don't die on impact either. I hope I drown
