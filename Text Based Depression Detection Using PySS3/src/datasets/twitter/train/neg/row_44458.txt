I'm fucking sick of having to debate who I am with people that will never understandI'm not a fucking 'dysphoric female'. I'm male, end of. Likewise, I'm not some sort of 'good trans', and I'm not a pawn that you use in your arguments. 

I'm fucking sick of being seen as nothing but a fetish to people, because that's not who I am.  I'd like to be seen as more than that, but I just can't deal with being not enough to be seen as male while wanting to be the furthest possible from being seen female. I tried to do surgery on myself last year because I couldn't handle the fact that I didn't see myself as male enough.

I don't want to have who I am chosen by me by people that think I'm a 'confused lesbian'.
