I can't keep doing thisMy wife left me on March 1st. We have a young kid. We were together for almost a decade.

&amp;#x200B;

She's said hurtful things to me in the past, but everybody says hurtful things to somebody eventually and I don't resent her. It was my fault she left, I would yell during arguments and I know that's a form of verbal abuse. I would get mad when she spent more than a hundred dollars without talking with me. I know I'm a bad person, I'm trying to be better.  

I've been seeing a therapist specializing in family/kid therapy every week for several months to learn how to be a better dad and a better person. I've made some improvements but not enough.

&amp;#x200B;

We've been seeing a couples therapist every week too. I'm not as bad a parent as my wife says I am. I'm just as bad as she says I am in general though. We had two good days a while ago, she let me stay at her house and accidentally asked if I wanted to move back. I knew she didn't mean it and a few hours later she said she regretted asking and just felt guilty. I've been sleeping in one of her cars. 

&amp;#x200B;

I pay child support "unofficially." She hasn't served me papers yet.

&amp;#x200B;

She's said she's done. She's exhausted. She can't do this anymore. I understand. She's happier without me and that is good, it really, really is. It took months to get here but I really do just want her to be happy.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not happy. I have no money. I have no kid or wife. She's my favorite person and I make her miserable. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've called the hotline over the past few months. One woman was really, really nice and did her best. I hope she knows she made me feel better for a few hours and that was really important to me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just needed to get this all out. I don't really have any friends or anything and my wife doesn't want to talk to me tonight. 

&amp;#x200B;

I hope anybody on here that's serious gets to be okay. I hope somebody gets to be full again. I just can't do this anymore.
