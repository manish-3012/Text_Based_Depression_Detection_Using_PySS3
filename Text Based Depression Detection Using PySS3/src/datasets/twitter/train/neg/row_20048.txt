Ok, i need some big helpI'm probably going to end it all in not a lot, so i needed some help for how.
I already choose the one, rope, but i don't know what rope to choose or the place to do it either, i have a nice little mountain behind my home that i used to go everytime when i was a kid, it's full of trees, so i tought maybe that place should be good, another thing is i don't know if i need to use like climbing rope or stuff like that, i only weight around 60kg so i don't know if i should use like normal jumping rope or shit like that so it doesn't break while i'm suffocating, thanks everyone for the help.
