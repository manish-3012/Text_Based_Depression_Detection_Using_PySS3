i dont want to hurt my family but i cant take it anymorei sit alone at my house everyday, sleeping, eating, listening to music or looking at reddit / internet shit.. ive thrown away so many good opportunities, no friends left and no partner, i feel like an empty shell of a person with no real interests or talents, no job, slowly dwindling through my small amount of life savings until i inevitably get kicked out and end up in more debt than i already will be come tax time.. to keep it short im basically delaying my suicide until everything is gone .. i know im lucky and should be happy , nothing too terrible has ever happened to me, my family loves me (split mother and father + sister) and supports me.. but ive never been able to be happy.. i hate who i am, my anxiety, my social retardation, my ego.. i hate the idea of having to work at a job i hate for 90% of my life.. i can't deal with the simplest of things... idk what else to even say im just overwhelmed by the shit person i am and need to vent before i do something stupid..
