Iâ€™m sorry my story isnâ€™t spicyIâ€™m at the end now. I wish my reason was something special. But itâ€™s not. And I know my post will die in fresh amongst many people who also need help. But I just wish we all deserved it. 

Anyways. Be kind to each other. This very well might be my last day on earth so if youâ€™re reading this I hope your life gets better every day, and I bid you farewell. 

Thanks reddit. For all the fun weâ€™ve had.
