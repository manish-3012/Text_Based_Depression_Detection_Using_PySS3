My brother is frequently thinking of killing himself, what do I do?He says he has been very depressed lately and hardly ever feels like he has positive emotions.  I spoke with him about a week ago and he said he was having suicidal thoughts.  I asked him how he was today and he said "not so good, really lots of suicidal thoughts last night.  I am getting time to talk to a friend tonight.  dont tell mom please."

I am chatting with him now about new movies and work.  Guys help, what do I do?
