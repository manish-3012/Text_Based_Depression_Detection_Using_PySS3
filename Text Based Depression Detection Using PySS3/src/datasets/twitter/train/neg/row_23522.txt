Unmotivated and LonelyWhen I'm at work all I can think of is all the stuff I want to do when I get home but once I get here I don't feel like doing anything. I'm also extremely lonely, it took me nearly a year to really get over my ex and I still miss having her or someone to talk to and spend time with. Everytime I think I'm over ending it all it comes back full force, I'm not sure what to do.
