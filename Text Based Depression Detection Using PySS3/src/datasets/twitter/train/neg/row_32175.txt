I'm already branded as a monster, so who cares?People hate me... People attack me... People harass me... they spread lies about me... They tell me and others to kill themselves.. drink bleach... 

.. because I'm pro GamerGate.

People hate me... they say I'm a traitor to my gender... 

And they get hailed as heroes fighting off the evil group of nerds that are worse than ISIS...


If I die.. no one will care.... some of them might even be happy...

...I'm already a monster... so I'm just better off dead...
