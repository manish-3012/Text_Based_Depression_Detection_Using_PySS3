I feel a profound sense of miserySo... college started up again this week and I [m20] dont feel ready. Now I'm a student worker so I also have a job at my school. My grades have been on a slow decline since I started. A couple semesters back I gave up halfway through the semester and fucked up my gpa. I tried to fix it in the spring because I was on probation but I wasnt able too. So I appealed and got everything back my job and my financial aid. Classes started up again and I've gone back to my job (my boss doesnt know about all this) I feel... miserable. Like feels like I used the monkey's paw and I lost my father, my son, and whatever the third price was I dont remember. Maybe I'm afraid I'll fuck up again or maybe im afraid that this misery will finally push me to killing myself....
