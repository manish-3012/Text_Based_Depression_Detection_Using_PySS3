I'm really been struggling with this...I need some advice. Straight forward and honest. I have just realized I have been lying to myself for a long time about my happiness and what makes me happy. I keep putting myself in risky fucked up situations and half the time I didn't realize its because I just don't care about myself and I don't even think I ever have. All I know how to do is to please others and give myself to others. This is all I know and I'm starting to rethink my whole life. I give so much and undervalue myself so much that I can't afford any things I need to survive. I have tried to reach out to people and seek help but... That is unfortunately unavailable. I have realized people have only ever asked me for stuff or kept me around to do things for them. I feel like I'm just a puppet. A human sized toy that let people manipulate her. Now I just need to k ow where I should go from this or if I even should? I don't trust any person around me because now I feel like everyone is just using me. I can't think straight and for months on end I have been struggling to sleep and eat and keep myself healthy. I am struggling more then ever to get out of bed and try and help the people around, the same people I feel like are betraying me with a smile. I don't feel like I can keep this up for long. I am constantly on edge and worrying about everything. I have struggled with depression and self harm on my own for six years starting at the age of 13. I have been through foster care, been raped and molested multiple times and more. I made a promise to myself if I could fix my life I wouldn't attempt again but I feel like this is a sign. I can't get it out of my head. And I don't know what to do. Please help.
