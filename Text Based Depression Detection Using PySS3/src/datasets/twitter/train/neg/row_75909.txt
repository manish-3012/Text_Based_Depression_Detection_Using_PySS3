Found my knifeI purposely hid my knife from myself because I was planning on using it to slit my wrists and die but I found it after a year by accident, Iâ€™m scared that Iâ€™ll do it but I havenâ€™t been tempted, Iâ€™ve been doing really badly lately and have been promising myself not to take it into the bathroom with me or I would probably do it. Iâ€™m really unstable and have nobody irl to talk to because they just thing Iâ€™m feeling down. I am feeling down but more than you could ever know. I recently started dating a girl who I love so much, sheâ€™s so special to me and I love her, I think sheâ€™s the only reason Iâ€™m not being tempted to kill my self, sheâ€™s so nice and funny and not the average basic girl and I love everything about her. But Iâ€™m scared if things donâ€™t work out Iâ€™ll drop into even worse state of mind and kill myself. I donâ€™t want to die but I also do.
