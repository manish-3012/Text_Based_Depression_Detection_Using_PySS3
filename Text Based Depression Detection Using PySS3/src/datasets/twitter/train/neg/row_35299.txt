VentingHey. 

I donâ€™t have anyone to say any of this to, I donâ€™t even know where to say this, I stumbled across this subreddit and idk maybe it belongs here, Iâ€™ll delete it if not or whatever. I have so much to say but I donâ€™t know how to put it all in words. 

Iâ€™m a 21 year old female. I have never felt loved in my life. My entire childhood and general adolescence I have experienced extreme bullying by a large group of people. Iâ€™ve been out of high school for 4 years, but the mental and physical trauma has left lasting damage. 

I honestly donâ€™t even know where to start. I feel like words canâ€™t even express the hopelessness and hate I have for myself. I feel as if I will never mean anything to anyone. I will never accomplish anything, I am a serial failure. Iâ€™ve never had a relationship, Iâ€™ve never been important to people I have considered my friends. I canâ€™t even say Iâ€™m an afterthought because to be honest, Iâ€™m not much of a thought at all. 

Meaning nothing to anybody is surprisingly exhausting. I donâ€™t think im ugly, Iâ€™m certainly not unintelligent, and I love my sense of humour. However, I have never met anybody who thinks the same. I donâ€™t know what I have to act like or look like or do to make someone want to have me in their life. I donâ€™t know how to be interesting to someone. Iâ€™ve tried buying my friends, Iâ€™ve tried everything. Just for one person to like me. 

I live somewhere where guns arenâ€™t particularly accessible. I love my family, I donâ€™t want to see them upset. We have had a lot of deaths in the family, close ones too, and Iâ€™ve seen and experienced the sadness of losing a family member. I cannot kill myself without the guilt of knowing I am just giving my parents a huge funeral bill. I am also afraid of not having all my loose ends tied. My desire to kill myself is great, I have wanted to since I was 12. I know I will never be of any significance to anyone or anything, and I think it hurts so bad because i know I donâ€™t deserve to be treated this way, yet I am treated this way with every person I bring into my life. Maybe Iâ€™m bad at finding people? Maybe. It always starts so beautiful and promising, but letting someone get to know me is always a mistake. 

I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m on here for, and Iâ€™m not asking for anything. I wish I knew what I had available that would give me the best result, but Iâ€™m too stupid. I donâ€™t want to hurt anyone but myself. I hate myself. I hate that Iâ€™m me. I want to be anyone else. I want so desperately to love and be loved and I know that is an unattainable goal. 

I know I am going to get â€œit gets betterâ€- itâ€™s always only gotten worse. 
I know I am going to get â€œbut youâ€™re so youngâ€- I donâ€™t have the energy to detail every trauma I have experienced, but they all have a pattern that can be summed up as â€œyou just arenâ€™t good enough.â€ I know that I am, and never will be, good enough. 
Any happiness that I get from socializing is from people online. However it only reminds me that Iâ€™m only likeable if youâ€™ve never met me. Iâ€™ve met some people Iâ€™ve been very close with online and they have PROMPTLY stopped wanting me in their life. 

I just want to kill myself, but I am afraid of failing and Iâ€™m afraid of all these loose ends.
