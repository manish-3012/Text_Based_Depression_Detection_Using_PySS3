Update on a post from beforeI posted a few days ago (link is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/i0fn01/help/))  
I "attempted" suicide 2 days ago and got help myself.   
I'm safe and in therapy now but I honestly feel no change. I would probably still attempt again but only at my lowest moments.  
I see all those people saying "I nearly died from suicide and now I see how important life is" but i dont see it still.  
Either way, it's an update to say I'm doing good and took advice to get help
