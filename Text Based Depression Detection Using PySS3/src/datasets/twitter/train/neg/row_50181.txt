I miss her so much.Not a day goes by that I donâ€™t think of her and cry. It may sound ridiculous to think of an ex girlfriend of only a year like this but I do. She showed me genuine love and care like no one else had. And for the first time in my life I felt truly happy. But love builds up slowly, and then falls apart fast..

She broke up with me just after our 1 year anniversary, over text due to Covid. I didnâ€™t get many reasons, and she hasnâ€™t talked to me since.. all of those amazing memories and times we spent together are gone now. But I wouldnâ€™t trade the time I spent with her for anything.

Iâ€™d trade everything I own to have her back, the longer I go without her, the more my suicidal feelings grow, she was the one thing keeping me going.. and now sheâ€™s left me..

I had a dream where I got back together with her, and then I woke up and spent the next few hours in tears...

I know youâ€™ll never see this but..

I love you, I still do and I always will. And even when you feel sad, alone or scared, Iâ€™ll still love you, genuinely from the bottom of my heart. And if I finally go through with my plans to kill myself.. then I can watch over you, and make sure youâ€™re ok... 

I love you so much..
