Why am I like this?My family is perfect, they love me, we're not rich but money never was a problem, grades aren't a problem either, so why am I like this?

Why I'm always unhappy and why do I prefer to spend the night alone playing videogames while I could be going out with my "friends" (they talk about me behind my back, but at least they invite me over to their houses)??

It doesn't make sense, everyone in this sub have a serious problem going on in their lives and here I am with everything I could've asked for having suicidal thoughts almost every day, why?!!!

In three weeks I'll be 18 and I'll probably spend my birthday playing videogames, yey, very exciting.

I really want to just end it all, but I know my family loves me way to much and I don't want to ruin their lives because I'm an ungrateful teenager.

I really don't know what I'm expecting by posting here but I feel like I needed to share it with someone.
