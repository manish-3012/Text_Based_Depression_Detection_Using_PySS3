I need to kill myself before next week.That's the only option. Iv'e fucked myself beyond repair, and I keep fucking up every opportunity to make it better. I have no passion for life or anything, and I keep failing college. Next week my parents will find out just how bad I fucked up, so before I end up on the street or anything like that I need to kill myself since I have no future. My life has been fucked since the beginning and I keep fucking it up worse. There's no coming back from this. I'm done. I know this will be ignored because everyone wants to die here, but I just wanted to get these thoughts out in case it's the last thing I ever put out.
