Please no more suffering I don't want to die, because I love my parents and sister so much, and  I'm afraid the under the 'open individualism' philosophy of personal identity that 'I' would just still be suffering, due to my actions  having a negative contribution to the net utility. I just don't want to  be held to account to the expectations of other people any more. I just want suffering to end. I just want everyone's suffering to end. The  positive contribution I make to the net utility by working (if any)  seems so negligible compared to what it takes from me. I just want to  escape. I always hated school, too. As a child I often woke up with  dread at the prospect of going to school and of homework. But when I  left mainstream school and went to an alternative school where I had more free time and did not have to be in lessons, life got  much better, and I had the time and energy to develop my capabilities. I  hate this world so much. I hate it so much.
