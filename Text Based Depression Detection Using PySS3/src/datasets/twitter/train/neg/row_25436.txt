I'm cursedI'm not particularly depressed, or anxious. I have food, shelter, and a bit of money. I wouldn't say I'm very socially awkward or anything, but I am forever and always alone. I'm 29 and it's been going on for almost 10 years now. 

I barely see any of my family expect for holidays, I have a couple friends, one who lives far away, and I don't trust, and another who is always busy who I see about once every couple months. I've been single my whole life. I've had nothing but casual flings with girls I've met online. Anyone who I was interested in for something real ends up ghosting me for some reason unbeknownst to me.

 For years I've just spent months at a time pretty much alone. I've tried picking up hobbies to meet people, but nothing ever sticks. I'm not joking I'm for real cursed! No one wants to be around me too long, no one makes efforts to talk. I have no connection with anyone, no one to do any activities with, I have no point of existing. This is not a life to live, it's pointless, and the loneliness is unbearable. I just want to be euthanized at this point.
