Should I go back to work a week after an attempt?Saturday morning I had the barrel of a rifle in my mouth, but ultimately backed out and found myself sitting in the ER looking for help. Since then I had been admitted overnight at the hospital and have been staying at my parents' house after my release. They expect me to stay until I get my shit together, and I'm essentially being babysat for now. A burden that's unfair to my family, even if they insist otherwise.

I have a doctor's appointment to get a prescription that'll regulate my hormones, have established regular appointments for therapy, and I honestly feel better at the moment. Then again, I don't think I've entirely processed how close I was to pulling that trigger. The event itself was fuzzy to say the least.

But this upcoming Saturday I'm scheduled to go back to work. I can take one more week off if I want, on Leave of Absence with 70% pay, so long as I speak to a therapist from my job and get the go ahead. It would be a good idea to have more time for the medication I'm going in for today to balance out (it takes a few days to take proper effect) and to have one legitimate therapy session in before I get back into the work environment.

On the other hand, my mother clearly thinks I should go, and I don't want to leech off of my parents. I also definitely don't want to seem like I'm taking advantage of my situation to slack off, something I'm worried my family and my boss might think.
Any thoughts, guys? I wrote down lists of pros and cons for each, and I'm still at an impasse due to the buildup of anxiety from the situation.
