I'm Done. Fuck you, God.I can't do this anymore. My life means nothing. I have nothing I am no one. I tried and I've failed. Life doesn't get better. I'm sick of living. I hate myself so fucking much. Fuck God for making me. Fuck my mom for not aborting me. Fuck this godforsaken existence that I am forced to live. Fuck you, God. Just let me fucking die already. 

Why am I such a worthless waste of breath? I've made up my mind I'm going out like Robin Williams.
