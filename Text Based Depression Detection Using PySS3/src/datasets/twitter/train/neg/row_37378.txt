Every time I try to talk about transitioning I get yelled atTrans people keep yelling at me that I canâ€™t joke about it. I feel so sick and wrong and I just want to talk to someone about it so I can figure out who I am. They always yell that I shouldnâ€™t joke about it. How do I find someone to talk to? Iâ€™ve been suicidal for weeks now and Iâ€™m so confused.
