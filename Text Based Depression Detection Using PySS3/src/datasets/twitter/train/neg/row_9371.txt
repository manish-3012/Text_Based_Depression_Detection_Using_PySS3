Scared of dying, tired of livingI'm fifteen, graduating from highschool in less than a month. The thing is, I'm not sure if I'll make it to my graduation day.

Everyday, it's always the same thing. It's all I can hear. "You're fat." "You don't try hard enough." "Worthless." "Ugly."

I've been staying in the same school since I was in preschool, so I'm a bit more sheltered than most teenagers. All my life, I have been hearing these words again and again on repeat. It hurts even more when my own flesh and blood says it to me.

My little brother is three years younger than me, so I try to understand it from his point of view. But no matter how I try, I can't fathom why he feels so happy when he calls me degrading names and makes me cry. He has even told me to kill myself a few times. I try to keep the tears in, but it only drowns me inside.

So I turn to cutting. At first, I didn't understand why people would cut themselves. Then I realized that when I cut, the physical pain blocks my emotional pain and for awhile, I forget. I let go. But it's only for awhile and then it comes crashing down to me again. Why did I do that? Now I will forever have these scars. Then I vow to myself never to cut again.

Except I did.

And now I can't even turn to my friends, because everytime I even try to talk to them, they're talking about something that I can't relate to, and I feel so out of place.

My dad and his lover don't really care. They'll scold my brother when he antagonizes me, but that's it. Now he's got the idea that it's okay to abuse me, since that's what my dad used to do to mom when they were still together.

Day by day, my cuts get deeper. One day, I might cut too deep. And sometimes, I wish I do. Then I get scared of dying.

But would it be really such a bad thing to die when it would only bring me out of my misery?
