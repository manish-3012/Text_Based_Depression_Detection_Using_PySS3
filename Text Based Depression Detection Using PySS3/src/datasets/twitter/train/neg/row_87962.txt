Lost a friend several years ago and his birthday is always the worst.My best friend in HS committed suicide about 8 years ago, about a year after we went separate ways to different colleges. Weirdly, I couldn't pinpoint the date he did it, but his birthday (May 4) has turned into an annual ritual of depressive drinking on my part. I don't know that it's healthy, but I do know that I miss him and I guess I just hope everyone here is doing alright tonight.

I'm fine, but it's a thing and I don't talk about it much.
