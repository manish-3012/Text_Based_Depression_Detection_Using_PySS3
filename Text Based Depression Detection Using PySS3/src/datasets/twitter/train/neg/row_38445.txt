I really don't know who, or what I'm living for [F23]I wish I had someone to go to for love and support. My family hates me,  they're incapable of asking me what's wrong and offering help or support. They blame me for everything and hold grudges. I am nothing more than a burden to them. There is no care or concern. I'm not where I want to be career-wise and I don't know if I'll ever get there. It's been years and years of trying and complete poverty and I'm tired of it. The only guy I thought I related too and I thought liked me ghosted me. This is my fifth rejection. I have accepted I will be alone. I have nothing holding me here. I don't have anyone who loves me,  not even myself. With covid especially my life is so sad. I sit at home and do school work all day.
