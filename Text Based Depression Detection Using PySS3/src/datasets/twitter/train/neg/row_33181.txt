No friends, no therapist. Homeless in two weeks.If you're always kind of on the edge..? Fight with brother/landlord. Can't stop crying.
Been calling around all morning for drop in counseling which doesn't exist. Not willing to get committed and can't afford the bill. Trying to make a plan but am undiagnosed adult autistic and I can't see all the things at once. No one to speak to and afraid to go home without a plan to show.
