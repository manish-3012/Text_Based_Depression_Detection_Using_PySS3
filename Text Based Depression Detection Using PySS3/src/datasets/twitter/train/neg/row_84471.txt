What am I doing with life?I just finished my first quiz for this semester, I'm sure I failed. I'm already in my early 20s still working on first year courses. By the time I get my bachelor's I'll be late 20s basically old. That's if I even pass through my courses as planned.

I already wasted so much time, bounced between multiple majors, haven't achieved anything in life, no outstanding career, there's not point in living. I'm not a successful person. Just a waste of space and air.

If I do poorly this semester I'm going to kill myself. Why live in doubt and misery.
