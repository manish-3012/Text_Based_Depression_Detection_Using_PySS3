I feel so guiltyNothing much happened in my life, except for in elementary, i never really had friends, like, nothing bad has happened, just i suddenly felt like everyone hated me for no apparent reason, although recent years it has progressively gotten worse, soon, I started planning, and last year, I attempted. And i think about sll this, and i read some of these posts, and i feel like such a terrible person, because these people actually have reasons, but i'm here, depressed because oh I'm failing, and i feel like i have no friends, wtf is wrong with me. I don't have any reason to complain, because you see stuff on here about people being forced to do stuff, or they just have shitty parents. Now look at me, my parents got me a computer, i am properly fed, i have good clothes, and they show me attention, and i have great friends. So why do i feel like this, what makes me anywhere close to feeling the pain of others.
