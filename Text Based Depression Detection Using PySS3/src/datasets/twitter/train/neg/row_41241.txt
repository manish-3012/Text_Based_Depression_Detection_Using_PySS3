I lost everything and I don't see any way forward.I'm not going to lie I have had suicidal thoughts before but they have never been as strong as they are now. I keep on hearing from people to keep pushing forward and not look back and things will get better but that's not true at all, everything has gotten worse for me over the past year and I dont know what's the point anymore. Everything I try I fail. I lost all my friends, the ones I love have all moved away or left me in some other way. In some ways it feels like my destiny to commit suicide. I have a large family with no tragedies which I know is rare, maybe I'm supposed to be that tragedy. I know if I owned a gun I would have killed myself by now but its my fear of failing to kill my self which is stopping me from doing it, I researched it a lot and it doesn't seem likely that I will succeed unless it's at gunpoint.
