I just feel like a worthless piece of shitI keep looking at my life and what it is and what it has been and I just feel like I don't matter to anyone at all. My life just feels ruined and stuck in a loop, I feel so ignored and alone. I can't even get help for anything. I should've just let my ex slit my throat I seriously just should've not screamed for help. I hate this stupid pandemic, I'm just stuck with narcissistic assholes that just treat me like shit. I wish these past ten years of my life didn't happen.
