Donâ€™t know what to do anymoreLetâ€™s go back in time to yesterday, I donâ€™t know what made me grab my rope and try to hang myself, I really donâ€™t know. But I did. And so there I was, content with my life for once and overjoyed but the moment I felt myself fading out I started freaking out until I finally had enough strength to free myself. I donâ€™t know why I did it, why I saved myself.

So here I am, sitting at 2;40 am on reddit after re-downloading it onto my phone  and I am terrified for my life as I donâ€™t know what I truly want anymore. I should be over what happened yesterday but my throat still feels constricted and it feels as if Iâ€™m still there...

I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. I donâ€™t know if I truly want to die or what snapped in me at the last moment.
