Suicide watch after a DUI arrest.I was referred to this subreddit, and it is highly applicable.

I don't mean to deflect, but I'm asking for a friend. He's a great guy, simply he carries a lot of baggage.

Some context to the current question: My friend is a former member of the armed forces for the United States of America. His experience was difficult to accept, and it's taken a toll on him psychologically. He previously was an excellent athlete, and now centralizes his lifestyle around marijuana, nicotine and alcohol.

We both attend a university in a "college town" and returned from our spring break yesterday afternoon. Last night, he drove with blood alcohol concentration over 0.2. I received a call this morning from his father asking me to ensure he doesn't act drastically.

Legal action will be required promptly, and I fear that the absence of his vehicle (impounded) will allow him to dwell in his thoughts to a fault. He owns quite a few guns, and his stability is my primary concern. I am staying at his household overnight, and he had some friends stop by throughout the day, yet I do not foresee this being a long-term fix. He has acknowledged the circumstances in a constructive manner, yet becomes frustrated when grasping the consequences of his actions.

In closing, he has great character, solely the baggage he carries weighs him down to the point that he wants to quit his continuation and he perceived his actions last night as justification. I told him he should not define himself by one night, and I was hoping to acquire some knowledge from anyone with personal experience to better provide encouragement.

I appreciate your consideration.
