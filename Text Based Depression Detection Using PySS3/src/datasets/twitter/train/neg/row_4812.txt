I have a bad habit of flirting with suicideWhen the house is empty I will scream and curse myself out. Whenever I try thinking about my future I will shut down my ideas expecting myself to fail. I am in my own way of enjoying life. Most days I try my best to dissociate so I don't have to feel honestly and it's not healthy. I like to make jokes to myself about death and replace lyrics in songs referring to maiming/disfiguring my body as a reflex to indulge in self hate. Worst of all I don't like talking about it. I prefer to suffer in silence so I am not a burden to anyone. That's how I see myself a burden. I want to change but I assume I will fail so I drift away from everyone close. Bleh... I said it. Trying to break the feedback loop...
