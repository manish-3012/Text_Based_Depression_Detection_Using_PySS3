I don't want to kill myself.I'm just not normal.  I have some sort of mix of the big 3 issues everyone talks to much about whether they have them or not, being OCD, Depression, or Anxiety.  My doctor recommended that I speak to a psychologist.  I just go to pick up the phone, and I can't schedule it.  I can't really do anything.  I think of 100 things that could go wrong, and I just can't.  It's the same reason I can't get a job.  I feel like a burden in situations like that and I just can't make the jump and get out there.  I've left my house probably a dozen times in the past 9 months.  Burden would really just describe me.  And I don't want to be like that.  How do I get help when I can't manage to get help?  I can't do this for much longer.
