But there is nothing to live forWhat is even out there for me? I want to get better, but I donâ€™t want to put in the work. Whatâ€™s the point when Iâ€™m too tired to fix this? There is not anything out there for me that doesnâ€™t leave me with a better option than just ending it all.

What should I even live for?
