Trying to hold onI thought many of the troubles that had made me suicidal the first time had passed-- I had made friends finally, my parents' marriage was improving, etc. However, my mental health has begun to drop again lately. Im not consuming more than 500 calories a day mostly (yesterday I only had ~100), I began cutting again, I can't walk without constant pain (preexisting ankle injury), my parents' marriage is in shambles, my family has a horrific amount of medical bills so our money is getting tighter, and I'm a worthless wreck that won't get anywhere in life. I'm probably just complaining about stupid stuff but now I don't really know why I should get up in the morning when nothing is improving and I can't even afford professional help. On top of it all I'm starting to question my sexuality which isn't what I need right now with the amount of stress I feel.  I was hoping this was all teen angst that would blow over but it isn't and I really don't want to live as a burden or annoyance to anyone anymore. I don't even know why I'm bothering you guys here...I guess I just needed a place to get my feelings out before anything bad happens to me.
