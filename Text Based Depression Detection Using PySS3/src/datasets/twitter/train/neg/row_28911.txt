I want this to end[14M] My life is becoming more bad everyday. I don't know what to live for. Even the things that make me happy in the past aren't doing their job anymore(snacks and phone). I don't see any future. I have some little hope left, but this hope gets destroyed everyday. My life is getting more bad everyday for some years.

I have no one in real life to talk, or friends. My parents says that why I'm sad and anger at me. I stayed for over a month(closed schools) in my room, sad and lonely. I mean, what to live for, just to be more sad? I have nothing to lose

I thibk about suicide, but the thing that keep me sane is fear of death. I mean, no one would care. I can't take it anymote. It's hard to see others with better or normal lives, as I never have a chance to have one.
