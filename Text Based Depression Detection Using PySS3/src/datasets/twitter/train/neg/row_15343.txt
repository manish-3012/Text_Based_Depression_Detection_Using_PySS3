Subreddit for Transgender People in GriefHi there! I have created a new community [r/TransWithoutYou](https://www.reddit.com/r/TransWithoutYou/). This community is for transgender+ (+transgender, transexual, queer, nonbinary, gender non-conforming, gender-fluid) people who have lost their trans+ partners and loved ones to suicide or murder. It is a place to share grief, memories, struggles, and even triumphs or accomplishments in your healing journey enduring this loss.

Please join us if you would like!
