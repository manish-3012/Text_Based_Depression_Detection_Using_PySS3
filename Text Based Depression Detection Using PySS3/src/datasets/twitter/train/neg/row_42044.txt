Tips for dealing with regret about not having gone through with it after you've been ready?Twice today i was ready to go. I've been close before but not this close. I tried sleeping after the first time but it just made things much worse, i was just extremely disappointed when i woke up. I had written goodbye and was about to send it to the person i was talking to (chatting with) and go do it, when something distracted me (my memory is a little hazy). I regret just having waited / talked to someone and not having done it when i could have, i still want to die / think there's no other option anyway for a list of reasons that would take a huge wall of text to explain, but i doubt i could still do it now. At this point i'm basically just waiting to get triggered again to then be able to do it, which shouldn't take too long considering how many things trigger me.

I'm still far from stable, although not acutely in danger even without tranquilizer at the moment, and would like to know if any of you have tips for dealing with the regrets / feelings after almost having gone through with it.
