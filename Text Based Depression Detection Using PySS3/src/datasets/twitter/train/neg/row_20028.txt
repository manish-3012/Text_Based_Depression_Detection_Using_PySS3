Living For OthersI am 27. I've been suicidal since I was 11. It's a near constant state of being for me. Today is the worst it has ever been. I truly do not want to live for myself. I am alive to be here for my husband, daughters, other family and friends that would suffer if I died. I cannot imaging living another 30-50+ years. I don't want to. 

And I can't tell anyone. My husband doesn't understand. My doctor breezed through my antidepressant refill appointment simply asking "all ok with your depression?". I said no it goes up and down and she just refilled it. I don't know how to ask for help. 

I'm just sad and that sucking hole I feel in my chest just keeps getting deeper. I just needed to put it into words.
