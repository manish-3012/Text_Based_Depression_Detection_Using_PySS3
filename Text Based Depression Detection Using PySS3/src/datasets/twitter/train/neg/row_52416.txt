reaching outwhat happens when you tell your family youâ€™re suicidal? mine is generally supportive of me and care about me but i feel like this would put them at a loss. they wouldnâ€™t know what to do and i donâ€™t want them to think they are at fault or played some role here. you definitely canâ€™t tell your friends, they wonâ€™t be there for you. i guess iâ€™m trying to ask for help but is there any help to give? also i have no insurance so i canâ€™t get meds and i canâ€™t talk to therapist. iâ€™m not sure what good it would do to tell my fam i really want to die and that i know how i would do it.
