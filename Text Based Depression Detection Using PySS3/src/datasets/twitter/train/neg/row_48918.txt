This is my note.This is my note.           
Dear Mom, Dear Dad, Dear whoever is reading this.           
I'm sorry.            
Iâ€™ve disappointed you and so many people. Iâ€™m such a waste of money. I canâ€™t even live like a normal person in this country.        
I know ever since I graduated high school with straight A's along with getting accepted into a top university, youâ€™ve expected that I will be the pride of the family. Iâ€™m sorry that didnâ€™t come true. Iâ€™m sorry I dropped out and didnâ€™t become the leader you wanted.        
You would always find me in my room most of the days for the past few years. I would be browsing the internet reading random things, drawing, or maybe play some games sometimes. It was one of my ways of coping through life and feeling a sense of comfort in this mess.              
All throughout school I would always feel like an unimportant background character who would always mess up and be awkward to talk with. Iâ€™m sorry I wasnâ€™t talkative enough. The only time I felt socially comfortable at school was at Grade 11 and 12. It was the only time I had close friends who lasted more than two years.         
You can usually find me being quiet or barely interacting in new social groups. I would harbor any negative feelings in my chest. At some points in life I would become so upset I burst into tears like the embarrassment I am. Iâ€™m sorry I wasnâ€™t tough enough.               
I am alone now. I canâ€™t find my home. I didnâ€™t turn out the way anyone expected me to be.             
Iâ€™m sorry I didnâ€™t become your top uni alumni.        
Iâ€™m sorry I didnâ€™t get into sports.           
Iâ€™m sorry I wasnâ€™t more social in school.         
Iâ€™m sorry for being sensitive.              
Iâ€™m sorry I didnâ€™t become a good example as a big brother.            
Iâ€™m sorry if I didnâ€™t fulfill your hopes.             
I feel as long as Iâ€™m alive, Iâ€™ll always be a taint of disappointment with no future.            
I donâ€™t belong in this country. I donâ€™t belong in this time period.             
I was never meant to be able to become an adult.                
Iâ€™m sorry.
