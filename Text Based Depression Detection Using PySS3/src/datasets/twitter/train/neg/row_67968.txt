I donâ€™t even know anymoreI got yelled by my mom for having a panic attack. I didnâ€™t do it on purpose I swear. She told me to fuck off cuz she assumes I hate her. I donâ€™t. And I couldnâ€™t even tell her that I donâ€™t bcz I couldnâ€™t get words out. I tried to calm myself down but I couldnâ€™t fast enough. I canâ€™t control what triggers them. Maybe itâ€™s possible but Iâ€™m sorry idk how to pick and choice when in happens. Iâ€™ve tried killing myself before but it never worked. I always tried to c it as a positive thing; as a way of the universe saying that I should have hope. I donâ€™t have hope anymore. I just make life harder fore those around me. I just really wanna die. Everyone would b better off. I feel so stuck and I constantly feel like a massive road block. Iâ€™m sick of feeling like a waste of oxygen and Iâ€™m sick of the people of love having to deal wit a piece of shit like me. Hopefully it works this time. Hopefully Iâ€™ll b gone this time and finally alleviate the pain of my existence for those around me.
