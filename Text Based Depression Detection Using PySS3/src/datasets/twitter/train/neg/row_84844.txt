No longer suicidalI'm no longer suicidal hopefully this feeling lasts and I stay feeling not suicidal. It's weird everytime I feel like this I look back on when I was suicidal and gain a new perspective its like everything I went through and thought about my life was a million times bigger than it was in reality.
