Lonely and in painMy bf and I of two years broke up earlier this week. It was supposed to be a mutual thing since we both had issues in our relationship that couldnâ€™t easily be solved. But now I just want him back. I canâ€™t stop thinking about him. Everything hurts. Just looking at him hurts. 

I donâ€™t have any other friends besides him at my college and maybe two friends I knew from high school. Iâ€™m so alone now. Life is just pain. Iâ€™m always in pain. He says I deserve better but do I? We still love each other but it wasnâ€™t meant to be... 

Iâ€™m so tired of being in pain. I canâ€™t make friends. Iâ€™ve tried. I hate myself for being too fucked up to love. For loving too much. Thereâ€™s no hope for me. My future seems bleak. I wish I could die.
