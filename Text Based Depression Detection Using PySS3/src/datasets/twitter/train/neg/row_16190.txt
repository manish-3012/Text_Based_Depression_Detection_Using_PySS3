A stupid lie....Honestly, I used to have girls attracted to me, I used to have friends, I was getting somewhere in life I really was but, some stupid rumors were the end to it all. I've been through shit in my life, I was m0lested at the age of 6, been picked on, been lonely and the girl who I thought was going to be my first girlfriend ever spread rumors about me....I've been living in paranoia and I feel like I can't even go outside in peace anymore.
