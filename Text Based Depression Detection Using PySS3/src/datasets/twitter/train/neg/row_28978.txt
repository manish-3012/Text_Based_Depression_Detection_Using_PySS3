Confident i failed my Math ExamHi everyone so I had a math exam and it didn't go well, we had only 1 hour and 30 minutes to write it up and I had to leave 4 MAJOR QUESTIONS blank
I read over the mark counting for the exam and if my math is right I'll be way under failing.


This isn't helping me. I have so much stress and shit going on I can't handle it all at once and life is just painful now.


It's not even the exams the way I'm treated by others no matter how nice I am. I can't do anything right.
