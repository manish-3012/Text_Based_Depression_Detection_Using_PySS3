I donâ€™t want to get up and start over. Iâ€™m tired..Well I hit a point I never really thought I would be at. Lately the depression and anxiety is really bad. Iâ€™m about to loose my job because itâ€™s crippling me. I pushed all my friends away, and I know thatâ€™s on me.  I feel like I canâ€™t talk to them because you are still very much involved in their lives. Last weekend I actually talked to one of the group. They mentioned that all my friends still love me and are really worried about me. I didnâ€™t really know how to respond. I ask why are they worried. Their response was that it seems like the last few weeks you have been feeling really low. Well I still am. I broke down the other day and called the line. You know the one. I think I felt even worse after that than I did before. It was just kinda dumb, they just talk and say they are proud and youâ€™re very strong for reaching out. Eventually I just got annoyed with it, lied and said thanks and I felt better. I didnâ€™t, I just felt even more depressed.. Iâ€™m not sure how to fix this, and I have spent way to many nights beating myself up for past mistakes that cost me basically everything in the last 12 months. I donâ€™t want to be able in that head space, I donâ€™t to try and pretend Iâ€™m fine all the time. Iâ€™m not, I spend a lot of time thinking about just ending it all. Went for a walk the other night and brought one of my pistols with me. I wasnâ€™t planning on coming back, I just couldnâ€™t bring myself to do it when the time came. I donâ€™t want to upset my family, thatâ€™s really the only reason I didnâ€™t. It just sucks being in this head space without much outlet and just completely miserable all the time... for what? Just so my family doesnâ€™t have to mourn me? Over the past few weeks even that seems to be fading for a reason to stay. If anything happens, just know I am sorry, I tried. I just canâ€™t handle anymore of life. Iâ€™m tired of restarting and getting back up. I think I have suffered enough for the last 18 years. Iâ€™m just done, I think this time is when I quit and just stay down.
