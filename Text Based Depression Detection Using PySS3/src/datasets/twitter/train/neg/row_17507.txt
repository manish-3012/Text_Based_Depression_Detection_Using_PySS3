.Well, I self harmed again last night. This wasn't spontaneous like other times, but I instead prepared for it. I got bandages for once and everything. I didn't cry while doing it, or even really think like I normally do. I was just somewhere else entirely, and to be honest, I don't even know where.

There was no crying until a few minutes ago. I feel like I'm at my wit's end. For the past couple of weeks, the thought of suicide has come and gone, but more of an intrusive thought if anything. But now, I really want to do it, the desire is strong. I feel like I did a couple years ago when I was last suicidal with no support and when I was suffering in silence. I hate that fucking feeling, and it's back. I feel like I can't talk to my mom or my therapist or anyone about this because I'll be hospitalized again, and last time I went to a hospital it only made things worse. I feel like if I don't tell anyone, I'm going to snap and commit suicide. I feel completely trapped by my own feelings right now. I feel out of control. Now I just want to self-harm again so I can go to that place somewhere else and not think about anything at all, and just kind of float in time and exist. I wonder how long I'll be able to preserve myself.
