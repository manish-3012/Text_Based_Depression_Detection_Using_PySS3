I've been down the suicide path twice already, and made it back both times. This is my story. I hope it helps.This is pretty lengthy. Please bear with me.

I'm a 19 year old female from Seattle, Washington. I was born in one of the worst neighborhoods in my city. Lots of gun violence, lots of drug deals, lots of gang activity, you name it. My parents divorced when I was four (or somewhere around then) because my father was abusive, so my mom raised us three kids by herself. I'm the youngest and have two older brothers.

My mother suffers from PTSD and bipolar disorder, both of which were exacerbated considerably during the ten years she worked in the juvenile detention system. She had a psychotic break when I was in elementary school and was temporarily committed to an institution. She quit her job and went back to school for four years to get a communications degree that means pretty much nothing in the economy right now. We've been living on an incredibly tight budget most of my life, with not a lot of money for new stuff -- or, even, for stuff we needed, a lot of the time.

Because I wasn't a very assertive child, I got pushed aside a lot when I was little. My brothers' arguments and appetites meant a lot of emotional and financial stress for my mom, so I tried my best to make myself small and stay out of the way as much as I could. It was an unbelievably destructive way to spend a lot of my childhood, because it meant I had to actively suppress a very large part of my personality to keep what little peace we had in the household. Furthermore, my family (my brothers, mostly) got used to me being the shy one, so when I tried to assert myself, they laughed it off and brushed me aside, dismissing me as â€œdramaticâ€ or â€œself-centered.â€

When I was 12, I had my first round of suicidal thoughts. My family wasnâ€™t taking anything I said or did seriously, which meant that I didnâ€™t feel I could tell them that the son of the pastor of the church we attended (who was at least six years my senior, I donâ€™t remember exactly) was taking advantage of me sexually and had, quite possibly, given me an STD. The shame and guilt of it was overwhelming, and the feeling that, because I was so young, nothing I said mattered anyways, drove me almost to the edge. One night, when everyone was sleeping, I went to the kitchen, grabbed the biggest knife we had, and brought it back to my room. The blade was against my forearm, poised to cut, when something made me stop. (I have a theory about this, but itâ€™s a little far-fetched and not really to the point. Ask me later if you really want to know.) I made it through that night. We still have that knife.

The rest of middle school/high school passed with nothing major happening. Money was tight. My brothers moved out, so all of my momâ€™s craziness was directed at me, which made it pretty impossible to be at home. I focused all of my energy on my school work, which paid off way more than I thought it would. I got into my top-choice school (Columbia University) early decision, was chosen as a recipient of the Gates Millennium Scholarship, and spent the majority of my first semester in college pretty convinced that everything would be much easier for the rest of my life.

Spring semester of my freshman year, one of my very good friends from home killed herself. Being almost 3,000 miles away from home and all of my friends, it was hard to explain to my professors why I wasnâ€™t able to come to class and why my work wasnâ€™t up to its normal standards. Before I got home, I learned that two girls in high school who went to my church (different church than before) also killed themselves. It was a rough semester, and my grades reflected that.

This last summer, my mother and I fought constantly because she was jealous of all the attention I was getting from our church congregation (sheâ€™s admitted this to me since). Being at home was mentally and emotionally exhausting, so I didnâ€™t get the break I really needed to cope with the events of spring semester. I left for school again in the fall, wanting nothing but to be away from my mother for as long as was humanly possible.

Last November, my mom was diagnosed with a rare and aggressive form of lymphoma that does not usually respond well to chemotherapy. I began having severe insomnia. My grades dipped again, and I finished the semester with a poor GPA â€“ again.

In January, another good friend of mine was found dead in an apartment complex in Barcelona. In February, we found out that his death, originally thought to be accidental, was actually being investigated as a homicide with the possibility of sexual assault. Not long afterwards, around the anniversary of my friendâ€™s suicide, a member of the church I attend in New York City was murdered as well.

I was back on the suicidal track. My grades were (are) suffering because of everything thatâ€™s happened, and New York Cityâ€™s I-donâ€™t-give-a-crap-about-anyone-but-myself attitude was (is) really, really wearing on me. The apathy for other peopleâ€™s suffering became almost too much for me to bear. I went through a list of people I knew, asking myself whether their lives would be completely devastated if I just wasnâ€™t around anymore. I didnâ€™t come up with anyone, and went to sleep, planning to come up with ideas for how I would end my life the next day.

I pushed it off for a few days, mostly because Iâ€™m really scared of pain. I had a cappella rehearsal a few days later, and we ran through the song where I have a solo during rehearsal. There was a moment during the song, when I had a break from singing in the song, where I looked back at the group. I was completely surrounded by music. I met the eyes of everyone in the group and knew, in that instant, that I had another family. I felt happiness and completeness I didnâ€™t even think was possible many, many days before, in the darkness and loneliness that was completely overwhelming at four in the morning. I had found something I truly loved, and Iâ€™d found people that were not only invested in making music with me, but also cared about me as a person.

I wish I could say that it was 100% happy from then on, that everything went back to normal, but you guys know thatâ€™s not how these stories go. I broke my ankle pretty badly a couple of weeks later, underwent surgery, and found myself confined to a wheelchair three weeks before the end of the semester. My attendance, already spotty because of the depression issues, became such an issue for one of my professors that he asked me to withdraw from the class. Getting to class has been pretty tricky because our campus is just barely wheelchair accessible, so Iâ€™ve missed the last few class meetings for my remaining classes. Iâ€™m 99% sure Iâ€™m looking at academic probation for next semester, and my broken ankle means I donâ€™t get to exercise as much as I have been this year, so thatâ€™s going to cause some health problems that are just too much for me to think about right now.

But Iâ€™m not here to bum you out. My point is that really, really, *really* crappy things have happened to me, and Iâ€™ve survived them. Only just, but I've still survived.

My point is that I see that the apathy that is pervasive in our culture is toxic â€“ fatally so.

My point is that my story is not the same as yours, but I hope itâ€™ll give you some hope that there is, in all probability, a light at the end of the really, really dark tunnel youâ€™re in. And, if you feel that there isnâ€™t a single person who thinks that whatâ€™s happening to you doesnâ€™t matter, I will tell you that **thatâ€™s not true.** I know that it matters. I know how much it hurts when people say it doesnâ€™t matter.

Please hear me: it matters. **You matter.** Each and every one of us matters. And Iâ€™m going to work as hard as I possibly can for the rest of my life to convince as many people as I possibly can that thatâ€™s true.

**TL;DR -- I love you.**
