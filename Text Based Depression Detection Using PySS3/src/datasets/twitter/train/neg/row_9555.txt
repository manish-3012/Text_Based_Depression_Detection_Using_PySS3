Just a thought....It scares me to actually think about people whoâ€™ve came here before they committed suicide.... Even though Iâ€™m a stranger to everyone else sometimes I feel like I can be held responsible for maybe not saying the right things or responding at that moment. Once again I donâ€™t know any of you, but as another human I donâ€™t have to for me to express that I love you.
