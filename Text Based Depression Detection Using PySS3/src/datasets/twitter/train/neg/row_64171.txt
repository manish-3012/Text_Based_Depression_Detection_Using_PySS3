"i wish i could be a shut in""i wish i could stay at home and lay in bed all day"

no, no, you reeeeally don't. pinky promise. there is nothing fun about it. i haven't been outside in almost two weeks (im too scared to go outside anyway), i've lost all the people i care about, i've gained ten pounds, im hurting myself more and more. it doesn't matter what i do to try and fix it, im tired of failing. im tired of being on this earth, im tired of being a stain, im tired of being a useless member of society. 

nothing good comes out of staying inside all day, every day, for weeks on end.
