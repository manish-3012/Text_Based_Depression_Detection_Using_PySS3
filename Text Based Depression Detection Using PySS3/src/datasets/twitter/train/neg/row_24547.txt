SmileYou ever just look at yourself in the mirror? You smile at first but the breakdown is imminent. Tears rolling down your cheeks followed by that hysterical laughter trying to reassure you that everything is ok. No? Just me? That was months ago. Now I wish I could cry. I wish I could feel again...Those were the days even if they were sad ones. This numbness I feel now is worst than death itself to me. *sighs*
