I feel like I should have a bucket listBut nothing really seems worth the effort. I know I'm not going to live to 40, and there's a part of me saying I need to make the msot of my time and travel the world and make the most of my life before I end it but... What's the point when nothing actually matters? There's either nothing after life in which case it won't matter what I did because everyone will forget me anyways and I won't be around to remember, eternal life/suffering in which case lmao already there I guess and no bucket list will magically fix it, reincarnation in which case I won't remember shit, are eternal happiness in which case it won't matter what I did in life cause I'll be happy anyways. Nothing matters enough to make a goal or bucket list item or plan or anything. I'm just waiting to die.
