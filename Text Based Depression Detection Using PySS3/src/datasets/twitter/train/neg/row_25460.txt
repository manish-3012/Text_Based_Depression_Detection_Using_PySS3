Please help. I think I am going insane.This is a throwaway account because itâ€™s so far off what I portray to others I would 100% not feel comfortable sharing it on any other platform.    
So Iâ€™m currently a high school student and probably one of the most type A people out there (lol). I think my greatest flaw is taking on too much and always *just* getting by. Iâ€™m at the top of my class, have great extracurriculars and a good group of friends. Iâ€™m definitely very assertive, impulsive and occasionally aggressive but I always brushed it off as â€œyou gotta do what you gotta doâ€ and I joke around a lot to compensate. All in all I think Iâ€™m probably an average 18 year old.   

However in the last 3 or 4 months I think something has gone wrong in my brain. I kid you not Iâ€™m literally going insane, I get so angry I literally black out and and will punch holes in my walls and take plates and glasses from the cupboard and smash them on the ground. I often contemplate jumping out windows (and not as a joke, like serious) and ways I could possibly kill my self (especially when Iâ€™m angry). My nightmares have also been terrifying, I cannot recall the last time this year that Iâ€™ve slept through the night. Also my impulsivity has gone through the roof and itâ€™s so weird Iâ€™m like watching myself live from a third perspective as if I have no control over it. I say horrible things to my friends, I scream and physically fight with my parents, I eat way too much in one sitting, I make bad decisions, I use people, and the worst part is: I do not care.        

On the other hand, the only times I feel somewhat happy, itâ€™s to an extreme level. Like Iâ€™m on some sort of drug, everything is just moving so fast and I have huge energy spurts and everything is going great until it isnâ€™t. I donâ€™t think I have depression because I never really feel tired or sad. Just usually either really, really angry or really really happy. Itâ€™s exhausting. These last few months have been so incredibly difficult and I know it probably does not compare to some of the stuff people go through on this sub, and I feel absolutely stupid for saying this, but I just want to end it all.       
Iâ€™ve never experienced anything like this Iâ€™ve always been the â€œgood kidâ€ and have had extreme luck when it comes to mental health but in the last 3-4 months something snapped and now I have no idea how to deal with myself and I feel like Iâ€™m only getting worse. Iâ€™m honestly afraid of myself when I get angry and I have no idea what is wrong with me. Iâ€™m afraid Iâ€™m going to do something drastic when Iâ€™m angry as each fit gets progressively more serious and Iâ€™m not sure if I can live with this much longer.
