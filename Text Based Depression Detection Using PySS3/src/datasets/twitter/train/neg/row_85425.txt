â€œI never wanted to kill myself, just end a part of me. I never got a chance to heal myself, so itâ€™s a part of me. Itâ€™s me if youâ€™re wondering who Iâ€™m at war with, old version of me sitting by a doormat it bleeds. All over me.â€ -King IsoAs someone who has somewhat come through the other side of depression and suicide this song â€˜ediciusâ€™ by king iso really speaks to me. I say somewhat come through because that old version of me still comes around on occasion. I was at war with him last night as a matter of fact. Stay strong friends.
