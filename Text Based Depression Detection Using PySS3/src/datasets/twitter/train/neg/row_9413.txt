Birthday coming upI donâ€™t think Iâ€™m making it to it. I canâ€™t stop imagining jump of the bridge near me. I see it play out. The whole tape. I park my car. I look at the view of the cars zipping by. First my right leg and then my left. I can see my hands holding onto the metal bar and my back facing the traffic. I can see me falling from a third person view . I am sick. I canâ€™t unsee it. I donâ€™t want to do this anymore
