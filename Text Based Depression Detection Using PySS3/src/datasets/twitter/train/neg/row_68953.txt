I need one last push to go overGod damn things have not been looking up. I'm so much more worse off than ever before.

I need just one last push to go through with it. I don't have the courage yet but I'm trying to find it.

There's no way out of this situation except for this. I'm a massive fuck-up. My anxiety lost me everything and now it's consuming me.
