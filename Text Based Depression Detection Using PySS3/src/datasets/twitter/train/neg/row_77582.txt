to be real, no one actually cares and weâ€™re all in this alonewhich is fine because i donâ€™t expect anyone to put their lives on the line for me but i wish they would just outwardly say that so i can end this hopeless existence. no one and nothing can really help my situation and i donâ€™t have the ability to overcome everything that is wrong with myself and my life. nothing brings me any joy except drugs and i donâ€™t care about anything in the slightest. everything i do is only done to put on a facade of someone who has their shit together, but in reality i have no ambition or drive to do anything because at the end of the day, none of it matters. it is completely hopeless and there is no solution for me, and no place for me in a society like this one. i donâ€™t have any reasons for living another day and i guess iâ€™ll just waste away until i canâ€™t take it anymore.
