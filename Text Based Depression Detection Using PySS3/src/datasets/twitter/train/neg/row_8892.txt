Read this for a second.No, it's not a cry for help, I just want to lay out the truth.

I can say many things to you that you would like to hear but, the truth is that people are stop believing in themselves. They judge themselves by thinking how are they going to look to people, but that doesn't matter. The only thing someone else can do about your life is talk. They say that their life's a disaster, well there is know way of calculating that and if someone tells you that you ain't going to anything just smile at them and they will burn inside with their own anger.

I see positivity rarely. People look out for compliments and if they don't get them, they get sad and depressed. But I'll tell you what the biggest compliment is it is to have a positive mind. You'll notice that you feel happy even when you appreciate someone's work and get a thank-you in return.

Instead of focusing on what made you happy or what made you sad, just focus on what you're about to do to be happy and let those people around you talk about you again.
