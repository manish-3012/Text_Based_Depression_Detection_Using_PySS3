Preparations are doneIn my last post here I was unsure whether or not to commit suicide. Every day those doubts get weaker and have been preparing for this moment. My "tools" are sitting in the corner of this room but I'm still a bit scared to go through with it. Eventually I will do it though. Guess I'm posting here because  this is the only place where my voice is heard. 



EDIT: Thanks to everyone who commented. I need to get some things in order. I will do it this weekend
