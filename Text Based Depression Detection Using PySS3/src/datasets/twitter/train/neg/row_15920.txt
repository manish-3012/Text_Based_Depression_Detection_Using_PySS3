I practised tying the nooseMy group therapist said something a few weeks ago that crushed me. She told me all the validation, love, support, and care I ever needed and wanted from my mum was never going to happen. I broke down there and hid in the bathroom punching the walls and generally freaking out. 

One of my old friends had previously told me the same, but I didn't believe them then. They suffered with their own mother problems. 

I don't know why but something clicked when my therapist said it. It hurt so much. It hurt even more because I knew she was right.

Now it's pointless. The one thing I needed to feel whole, to feel human - no - to *be* human, whole, will never ever happen. I have no hope. I have nothing left. 

I am empty, devoid, desolate. 

I practised tying the noose. 

I put it around my neck.

I pulled it tighter. 

I pulled it tight. 

I took it off. 

I can still feel the ghost of the rope around my neck.

When I die that's all I will feel for the rest of eternity. 

The ghost of the rope around my neck.
