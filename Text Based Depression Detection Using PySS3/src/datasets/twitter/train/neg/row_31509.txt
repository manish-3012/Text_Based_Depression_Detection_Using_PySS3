New Year's 12/31Sorry - this is not an inspirational post.

I've been toying with the idea for months now that I'm going to try to kick the bucket on New Year's.

I've been beating depression back with a flimsy wooden stick since I was 14. I'm currently in school, have a job, have an LDR guy, have friends, moved out of a crappy state... I don't know what my deal is. I guess it's just because I had a really crappy childhood with poverty stricken/neglectful parents, there was drug use, sexual molestation... had a bout of SI.... the whole nine whatever.

I'm in therapy, and have been off and on for years. I have health issues, low energy, and social issues (I often isolate myself from friends, and don't talk to them when I need help. All it does is make people feel sorry for you, and that isn't what I want).

My therapy team is going to put me on Celexa. But antidepressants have done nothing but make me horribly sick in the past.

I don't know. I just get really tired. I don't own a car and have to take the bus in a smaller city where it runs like crap. Most of the kids I grew up with are all on drugs or pregnant - I'm the only one that moved and really tried, and I did it because I thought the world was prettier than it actually is.

I'm underpaid, but work very hard, and my room's always a mess.

I suffer from panic attacks, maladaptive daydreaming (look it up), MDD and bipolar disorder, to name a few.

But I'm tired. You know? I'm tired. I know I have a lot to be grateful for. But I'm fucking tired. I can't get interested in anything new - I listen to the same music and watch the same movies and I derive pleasure from none of it. And I learned how to make a noose recently, and I want out this coming New Year's.

EDIT: Please don't get on my tail about not having a lot to complain about. I know that already. But I hate being alone, and depression isn't picky.
