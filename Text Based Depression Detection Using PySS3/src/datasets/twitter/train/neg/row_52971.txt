I feel so broken. Everything is wrong.My roommates/friends don't want to help me, my other friends do but they can only do so much. I don't see my therapist enough because I have to work. 

I hear voices, and my friend says it's very unlikely that they are voices from a different dimension trying to contact me.. which is what I feel is true. It hurts that she won't consider it being the case, but I get how it may seem out there. 

I'm just tired of taking meds and being "mentally ill". I feel like a joke. I feel like my problems are the usual me now and no one takes me seriously. 

What's the point? I'm stuck in this place where no one sees the bigger picture of how I can do some good. I can help the voices I'm hearing, and they tell me to commit suicide, so I think that's the way to get to them and help. 

I feel important. And guilty. I can help the voices, but I'm blocking them with the medication. I'm just too afraid to stop the medication, everyone is telling me I shouldn't.

Things with work are increasingly stressful and I can't take a break because I need to pay rent. 

Everything is a mess. I'm sorry. i don't know what to do, I feel alone.
