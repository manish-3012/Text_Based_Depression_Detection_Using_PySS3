Still HereI don't think I will actually do anything but I am still here and definitely still suicidal. I woke up wishing I was dead and with my husband again this morning. 

I am still dealing with health issues. I scheduled all my doctor appointments and have been informed I have to have a biopsy next. I am still losing a massive amount of weight - the clothes that were tight at the end of January are literally falling off me and I bought those because the clothes I bought in October were falling off me then. 

I am in therapy and on Zoloft. I don't know that they are working. I still want to be dead and don't want to be in a world without my husband. I don't want to live a life without him. 

I feeling like I am going through the motions of life and not living. I go to work every day and am actually likely up for a promotion soon. I go out with friends at least twice a week. A hobby is turning into a side gig because I am trying to stay busy to stop thinking about dying. I have the uncomfortable problem of pushing off interested guys because, again, I just want to die and be with my husband. 

I don't know what to do other than hope I die by other means, like nuclear war or cancer but this doesn't feel like living. It feels like slow dying.
