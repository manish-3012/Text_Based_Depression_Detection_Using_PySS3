Don't know what to do with myselfI feel trapped in my parent's home despite being 18. I don't have college lined up for myself, I don't have a job, I can't drive, and I want to kill myself because there is nothing I can do without at least the help of my mother. All she does is blame me for the lack of trying to 'help her help me' when all she does is miss deadlines of shit that I'm needing to do. Yet, she doesn't want me to move out for whatever reason even if she's refusing to help me otherwise.

Was thinking maybe dehydrating myself until I die was a good option. It would look accidental. It's hot outside... I'm too much of a pussy for other options or simply don't have the materials.
