Why me, why us?Everyone always says suicides a permanent solution for a temporary problem, but that's the thing isn't it it's not always temporary . I don't want pity I never have I just want to feel, be, get better etc. 
I've wanted to die since the age of... well for as long as I remember.  I've never had the balls I remember my first thought of suicide I grabbed my moms pistol from her drawer when she was out and put the barrel against my temple I tried to squeeze the trigger but my hands were to clammy to keep hold of the gun. That might have been the one time I could have done it, but now it's too fucking late I've become even more of a coward. So I subconsciously and very strategically eviscerated any chance of happiness I can't even talk to my fucking family without knowing how much it physically makes them sick to be around me. They always had high aspirations that I'd figure my shit out and be successful. Now I'm a highschool fuck up, in so much misery all I can feel is the will to die but I can't so I experiment with different drugs, alcohol, cutting, etc to drown out everything at first it works then the effects cease to be helpful you need more more more until it's so expensive it's pointless. I digress I'm sorry to rant I just have no one to talk to I know this reads like drug fueled nonsense but that's the only
Time I can talk about shit I'll probably end up deleting this have a nice life if not
