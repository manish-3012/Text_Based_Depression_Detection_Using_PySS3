even a good life still isn't worth livingbest case scenario for the average human:

wake up at 6 am, slave away until (at minimum) 5pm, get home at 6-7pm, spend some time with your partner (but nothing substantial cause they also have no free time), go to bed at 10-11pm, rince and repeat for the next 50 fucking years. Literally nobody is enjoying life, everyone is frustrated and irritated and we all snap at each other, but somehow not wanting to live is a huge unacceptable taboo.

I just literally, genuinely don't get it. What is there to enjoy? most people don't even have the time for hobbies, friends, etc., we all just drink/drug our way through the little free time we have. it's fucking stupid.
