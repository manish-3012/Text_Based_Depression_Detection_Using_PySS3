I feel disgustingI am only 23 but I feel like I'm running out of time. I always tell myself that one day it'll all be good but it's not all good and what if I turn 80 and it's still shit and I will have wasted my life feeling miserable. That thought breaks me every time. A lot of times I feel unlovable and annoying and I feel like that's why I lose everyone in my life. I don't want to be alone. I just want to be loved. I sound like a 3-year-old and I am disgusted by myself. I am supposed to be a grown-up and here I am whining and being useless. Maybe that's why people leave haha
