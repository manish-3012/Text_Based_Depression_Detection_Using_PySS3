My girlfriend is planning to kill herself and I need help.I don't want to post too many details here in case she sees this, but I will pm anyone who wants to help with more information. I really appreciate it.

I'm in high school, and so is my girlfriend. She's been a victim of many rapes and crimes since age 4, and struggles with ptsd anxiety, depression, and severe anorexia. She is the sweetest, kindest girl, but I can't concvince her to eat more than a little each day, and I can't convince her to stay alive. I need advice. I'd rather not say anything to her parents or any authorities RIGHT NOW, simply because she has no plans to kill herself immediately, just sometime down the line in a few months. But I want this to turn around right now. Please, tell me what to do. If any of you people have an interest in helping me and what more information or want to discuss things, please pm me. I'd appreciate it so much.
