Why live a miserable life?Iâ€™ve wanted to kill myself for years, but always talked myself out of it. I though that maybe things would get better, but in a decade things have only gotten worse. 

I have nothing good in my life, no purpose, no direction, no will to live. Thereâ€™s nothing to look forward to, there will only be more misery and pain. 

So whatâ€™s the point? Iâ€™ve got nothing to live for and any attempt Iâ€™ve made to make my life better or more bearable has failed. 

Iâ€™m just a broken failure. Why go on for decades like this when the pain can end tonight? 

The arguments donâ€™t workâ€”thereâ€™s no one to miss me, things wonâ€™t get better, I donâ€™t have value just because Iâ€™m alive. I think the only truly happy day Iâ€™ll have in my life is the day I die because Iâ€™ll know I wonâ€™t hurt anymore.
