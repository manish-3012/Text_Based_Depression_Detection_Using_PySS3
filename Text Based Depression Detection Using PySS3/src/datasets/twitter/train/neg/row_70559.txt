It seems like every day I'm just a little closer to actually doing it.I've been thinking a lot about suicide lately, I'll have good moments where I feel like everything is fine, but then it all just comes crashing back down on me. And everytime I start thinking about it again it feels like my ideas are just a little more separated from fantasy. It doesn't take much to set me off anymore, sometimes even something like a bad interaction at work or some asshole harassing me online just crushes me these days.
