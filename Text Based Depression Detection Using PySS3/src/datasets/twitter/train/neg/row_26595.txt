Explanation neededExplain to me why any of this matters. Our species doesnâ€™t have the legs to make it out of the solar system, and in a while the sun will collapse and everything will eventually return to ~0 K nothingness. So why does the (very) brief life of one sentient being matter if weâ€™re anchored to this stupid rock anyways? Its kind of cruel, actually.
