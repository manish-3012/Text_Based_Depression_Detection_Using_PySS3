I feel so worthlessI want to ask for help and reach out but I donâ€™t want to cause other people pain or make their lives harder. I feel like Iâ€™m not worth the hassle anyone would have to go through. I wish someone else could have my life because I have loving parents with steady jobs, but Iâ€™m so worthless and a waste of time. I always do things for other people, even if theyâ€™re asking a lot of me, because I donâ€™t value myself at all. I just want someone to help me, but I donâ€™t want to cost my parents time or money because Iâ€™m sick. I just want to die so I can stop messing up other peopleâ€™s lives. I wish no one loved me so I could just disappear without hurting anyone. I know the way Iâ€™m feeling is messed up, but I canâ€™t get myself to do anything about it. How do I break the cycle of feeling like this
