Not sure if i can do what i want toA few weeks ago i tried my first OD, with 16g (32 pills) paracetamol. I now have 63 pills left from what i was planning as i have just taken one. But the taste and movement of it inside me is making me feel physically sick and i don't want to waste the rest of the pills.

I should probably man up and take them all
