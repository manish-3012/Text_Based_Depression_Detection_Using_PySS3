I have never felt this low...I just need some helpI don't feel like I have anything...I'm not good enough for the program I'm in. I have no money. I haven't been able to find a job. I'm hideous and fat and I can't do anything right...there isn't a single thing I like about myself. I feel like a burden to everyone around me. Being alive is too painful...I'm not strong enough.
