HelpI can't quit crying. I can't feel good. Or normal. Or happy. Not for more than a few seconds. My business is failing. My girlfriend loves me more than I deserve. My friends don't call anymore. If I died today, everyone I know would still be okay in a week or a month or a year's time. The suicide hotline hung up on me twice today. All that is stopping me is fear of postmortem ridicule or accusations of selfishness. I don't want to let everyone down any more than I already have by dying, but that thread is fraying fast and leaves me nothing to cling to when it breaks. I have squandered the best parts of my potential and what is left doesn't really matter. Who will actually remember any of us in 100 years? Or 50, even? even this post makes me ashamed that I am just another mid twenties depression case making a cry for help, mistaken for a cry for attention. I am a good chef, but I am not a good man. I am not deserving of anything, and there is nothing I can contribute to the world that someone else can't do better. In the long run I see no reason to stay alive. As it stands, I feel like I am wasting space better used by someone with an interest in staying alive. I know who it would hurt, and how. And I feel bad about that. But they all have healing mechanisms, and will be okay without me. I am not okay with me.
