Having stronger thoughts of suicide...Some days I honestly think everything in my life has been pointless and insignificant. I'm 25 and I'm in my first year of university but I can't seem to get my shit together. Doing poorly academically, my girlfriend broke up with me because of my depression, and I'm the black sheep of the family. There's no place I can call home. Everyday I get stronger thoughts about suicide and how I'm morbidly planning it out.


Sometimes I just honestly don't give a shit and just want everything to end. My family doctor is aware of my depression and treats me with medications. It works, but when my doctor told me that suicide would only hurt the people around, that's the whole point of my frustration with almost everybody -- though of course I pretended to be polite and reserved myself. Yet I'm here to find a reason but I just don't have the fight.
