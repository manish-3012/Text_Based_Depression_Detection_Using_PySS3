i feel uselessmy parents are getting a divorce. ive been staying with my mom since Tuesday and i leave Saturday, i have seen my dad a total of 3 times. he apologized to me for everything but he felt trap with my mom, he said he felt like any time he did anything he enjoyed he was making my mom upset because he wasnt doing stuff with her or something. my mom is so upset. i have never seen her this sad. tonight is my last night here and i feel so useless. my mom feels like my dad hates her and my dad feels like my mom hates him. i just wish they would talk. i wish they could be happy. i wish i could do something, but i cant and just want to disappear. i dont want to do this anymore. life is such shit. everyone says it gets better but it hasnt. something always makes it shitty. i dont want to do this anymore.
