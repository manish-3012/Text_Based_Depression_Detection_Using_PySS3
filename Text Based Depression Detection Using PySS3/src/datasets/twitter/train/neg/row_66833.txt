I lost my dad late September last year and then my childhood friend a week later to a double murder suicide... how do I grieve accordingly?Maybe it's the wrong thread to post this in. Working 40-60 hours a week before, during, after and currently. Anything to keep the hands and mind busy. Not even looking for advice. Share similar experiences maybe?
