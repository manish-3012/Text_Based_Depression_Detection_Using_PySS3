Got broken up with on Christmas...I don't even know. I feel dirty and used because they promised we were back together and were going to work on things, had sex, whatever. They know I can't afford my apartment without their help, but they still said they were moving out, even when we were technically together again. I can't talk to anyone, or go out for dinner plans I had with friends (he went there and left me alone, crying, knowing I was suicidal), and I don't want to ruin anyone elses nice Christmas by being sad. He refuses to move out til January because he paid rent for this month. 

I'm so fucking lost. I'm not going into details, but I can't even manage to kill myself properly. I guess I just want someone to care about me today, because this is a whole new level of numbness.

I have to move out, and the only place I can go is 3000km away, in the middle of winter with a dog and not enough winter gear to survive. The bastard even told me they were going to buy me a coat for Xmas, and then announced they were leaving. Ugh.
