I need someone to talk toI am 17 years old almost 18 and I feel as alone as ever. I believe I have had depression for over a year now because since then I have though about suicide. There are many things wrong with me and many things that lead me to this conclusion. The things I feel worse about is the fact i'm a compulsive liar. I've told so many lies I wish I could just take back. Prom is coming up and I've told everyone I have a girlfriend for months now and everyone believes me. Not only that I told everyone i'm rich, I have a job, and many others things which aren't true. I don't know what to do or how to fix it and I want to but I don't know how. I cry about it every time I think of it and the only way I know how to stop it is killing myself. I've told some of my close friends that I feel like killing myself and they just don't believe me. Maybe they know i'm lying and this could just be another case of the boy who cried wolf. That is only the first of things that are bothering me. I started wanted to kill myself as I said a little over a year ago because the girl of my dreams rejected me. I've never had a girlfriend but people at school think I do and have had a few because of lying. I want to tell everyone the truth but I know if I do I could lose any friends I have which right now I need as many as I can get. Another huge thing is my future. I'm a senior and it's 4th quarter (2nd half of last semester) and I haven't even applied to any college yet. I've tried a few times but I need my sat/act scores and I asked my school for them numerous amounts of times but I have yet to hear from them. I'm shy and scared to tell my parents or anyone close about any of this anymore. What can I do? Where do I start? I need someone to discuss all my problems with. I tried to talk to a councilor at school but I can never spit it out face to face. I just need some advice.
