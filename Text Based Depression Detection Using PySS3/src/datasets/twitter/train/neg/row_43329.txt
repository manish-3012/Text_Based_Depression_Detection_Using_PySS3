A girl jumps off the bridgeand no one is around to see or hear it. Did she jump off the bridge? How many days or weeks will pass before someone realizes she is missing? 

I'm not jumping off the bridge. I don't like heights, and I'm afraid of being afraid. But that's silly because what is fear in death? I suppose I don't really want to die. 

Just death and being anonymous in the world is a strange idea. Because it really would not matter to many people if I killed myself. I only know about 20 people in this school, and no one really knows me well. I don't think they'll be sad as much as they'll be shocked because suicide tends to be unreal. A lot of people will be like, "She? Who was she? Oh, an engineer. Oh weird. Yeah, my room mate said she was in his English class and she was in my friend's Chem class too."

I remember when my brother was 14, he once told me that he had a dream that I killed myself, and it made him sad. I don't really remember what exactly he said, but it made all the difference to me at the time and at times like now. 

Right now, I really could use a friend. Maybe if some stranger just sat down next to me and started talking about something mundane. It doesn't need to be anything really. I just want to make sure that I still exist, and I'm not just nonexistent and watching things happen around me. 

And though I want to just give in to this and let this consume me, a part of me wants to see the future play out. A part of me wants to get out of this sadness and create something beautiful and worthwhile and meaningful out of my life. I tell myself, I can do anything, and I can save myself from myself. Because I know that no one else will do it for me. No one else is going to put aside their own problems to solve mine, so I need to solve my own. 

And so maybe it is that I'm afraid of being afraid or that I'm unwilling to mess up my family's life, but fuck this sadness. I'm going to choose to live.
