Can you stop telling me it gets better?Iâ€™ve tried so hard to believe I was just going through ups and downs but in reality my life has just been consistently getting worse like it has the past 2 years. It doesnâ€™t matter if Iâ€™m â€œyoungâ€ because Iâ€™m 17. When I turn 18 Iâ€™m just going to be a kid with more responsibilities. Iâ€™m still going to be treated like a kid because my age has â€œteenâ€ in it. I know how people want my life to be. They want me to go to college so I can get a degree and get a job for the next 40 years until Iâ€™m old while having a meaningless marriage bringing kids into the world so they can live a meaningless life too and then Iâ€™m abandoned in a nursing home until Iâ€™m dead. That isnâ€™t the life I want to live. But what do I know? Hardy har har Iâ€™m just a kid I donâ€™t know what real problems are
