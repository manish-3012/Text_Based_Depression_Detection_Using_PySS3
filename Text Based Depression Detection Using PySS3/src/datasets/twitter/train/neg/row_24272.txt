right back where I want to beHi, my name is Ellie, and I'm 13 years old. Oh, and yeah, I know everyone here is going to think I'm too young to even know what suicide is, but please, please hear me out. I've been struggling with depression for almost two years now, except that dark period briefly ceased when I started to take Prozac. It worked fine for a while, but about a month ago, I decided to stop taking it. Why? Because I hate being happy. When I'm happy, I'm silly, I'm stupid; loud and obnoxious, I'm not as creative as I used to be, and I am infinitely less articulate. My symptoms started to show up again last Tuesdayâ€” and damn, do I feel good. Now I'm just waiting for my depression to peak once again so I can just finish it all. I don't know exactly why I'm reaching out for help... Maybe some part lf me really does want to get better, but I just thought I'd get it off my chest here. Therapy doesn'twork, hospitalization doesn't work, I was sexually abused when I was nine and I just don't even see what the point is anymore. I've grown up to hate myself, men, and just the world I live in.... please help?
