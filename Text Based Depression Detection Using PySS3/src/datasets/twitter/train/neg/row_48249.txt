Poem a Day pt 4So todays edition isnt really a poem, but i wrote this earlier about creating art, and i think that people might appreciate it. Thx for not hating me.


â€œThe music youâ€™re writing already exists. Your job is just to listen to where it wants to go next and coax it from out of the space between imagination and reality, and into the sound waves that surround you. A â€œblankâ€ canvas is already full, your mind is just the reverse white-out.â€
