Self-esteem is beyond repair, ugly, socially awkward and no motivation: is there even a point to go on?I don't think I'm worth any of your time, but if you happen to actually click on this, thank you. If no one reads this, that's ok too. I just really needed to vent.
  
 
about me: I wouldn't say my childhood was shit, but I was bullied like mad as a kid (loner, had balls thrown at me, pushed against stuff, etc). My father verbally abused me about my weight and my lack of 'feminity' to the point where I was suicidal from my elementary school years to college. I'm not the prettiest girl on the block (and I've had people call me ugly to my face, thank you high school) and I'm so socially awkward, it's ridiculous. And to make it even worse, I lack motivation to do anything. Especially anything that makes me stand out, as I want nothing more than to hide somewhere dark and small for the rest of my life. 
 
 
And then there's my personality. I have a tendency to judge others. I try not to, but because of my longterm habit of judging myself to ridiculous expectations, I can't help it. It makes me hate myself even more, but I can't just shut my head up. I know it's because of my insecurity, but i don't know how to fix it. I don't even want to bother with relationships, as I'm not even worth it. Throwing all those issues on someone else? Pfft, I shouldn't even bother.
 
 
And I've always fantasized about just ending it one day, and these days it just looks so damn appealing. I mean, is there a point? Does it ever get better? How do I even begin to change myself when everything's been this way since as long as I can remember?


TL;DR: I'm a fucked up, fugly female with so many issues and a ridiculous amount of insecurity, I should probably just off myself before I ever end up procreating. What do?
