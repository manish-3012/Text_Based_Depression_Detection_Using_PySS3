Somebody please talk to me :(I was on anti-depressants and seeing to different counselors for about a year.  In January I moved out of my parent's home after a bit of a fight.  I thought I didn't need the pills and counseling so i stopped.  I had been making it by with manageable amounts of depression until about a month ago.  I missed out on some major scholarship opportunities and have been beating myself up about them since.  I'm a senior in high school and am going to be going to a state university next year.  I'm going to have a job during school and still will amass over 10k in student loans if i manage to finish early.  It doesn't even seem like a big deal even to me and I know that its just money but I've been bawling my eyes out for the past hour and a half. I'm scared shitless for some reason_x000D_

  I have no close friends and my father who I would usually go to help for is out of the country and unreachable.  I spend a large majority of my free time on reddit and just want to talk to one of you guys.  I'll talk about anything really, I'm just scared as hell and don't know what to do_x000D_

Also, I made an appointment with the counselor but don't know if I should start taking the anti-depressants right away again (I have a bunch left over).  I just want everything to be over so that I dont have to deal with everything.
