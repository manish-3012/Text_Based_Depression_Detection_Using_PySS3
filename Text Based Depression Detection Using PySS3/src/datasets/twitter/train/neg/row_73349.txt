I wish I could end my life but I donâ€™t want to hurt my familyI try to make it short as possible 
As of 2 September 2019 Iâ€™m 16 years old I keep on failing my exam I being I goddam disappointed to my family, they love I know that but they just want me and my two siblings to be successful right now my two siblings are young not doing any exam. Me I want to be a police officer I want to help people and protect people. 

Since I failed my exam for the first time I lost a big part of me. And this year Got Dâ€™s in my exam. Now Iâ€™m losing my mind I want to hurt people (not my family) but just strangers and sometimes I enjoy watching people suffer it puts a smile to my face and then I suddenly I think to myself what the hell iâ€™m smiling for , I want to kill myself more than ever but I have a wonderful family so I donâ€™t have the balls to do it, I canâ€™t let them lose another child again (he did not die of suicide) I have huge amount of anger in me.

I never really had a best friend, have friends but I know after I leave school I most likely wonâ€™t see them again Iâ€™m disparate to get at least one friend someone who will always have my back, someone I could laugh with , have fun with but. 

 I have feeling that person I want as best friend I doesnâ€™t even existed And yeah I never had a girlfriend most likely itâ€™s because really talk to them and my personality was mostly likely shit, like most people and donâ€™t want to be rejected but anyone also I hate failing in anything , each time I fail in anything it feels like Iâ€™m losing my mind become crazy 
 
I get mood swings a lot, sometimes I think Iâ€™m going to be successful in life but other time I feel like Iâ€™m going to be a massive failure in life. I donâ€™t know who I am anymore feels like itâ€™s two different people in me. 

Thank you to who ever read this far I doubt anyone will have any real answers for me, but I just wanted to try. Hopefully I  could come back later after a couple of years and give you a update.

Have a good day
