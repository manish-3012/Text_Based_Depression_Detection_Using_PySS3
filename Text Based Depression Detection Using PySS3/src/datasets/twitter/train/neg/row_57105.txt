A journal entry: December 10th 2019*Ive been having so many dark thoughts recently i dont know what to do anymore. I will cry randomly throughout the day hoping that something bad will happen to me so i dont have to feel this way anymore. A freak accident is better then ending it myself because everyone will question why i did what i did this. The burden that would fall upon my family is too much and i can't do that to them, but I also feel terrible telling them everything is "fine". Every day these thoughts manifest in my mind more and more. I dont know how to approach my family about anything because I dont want to inflict mental anguish on them or make them think they did something wrong. Thats simply not the case, as all this has been because of my indecisiveness and lack of purpose in this world.*

This was something I wrote down 6 months ago, crying in my room because of a full blown addiction to Oxycontin and major self-worth issues. Ive been clean now for almost 2 months and am doing better then I have been in years!
