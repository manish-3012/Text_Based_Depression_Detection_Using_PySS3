[20/M] It's getting harder to get out of bed each morning.I remember the first time that i resorted to self harm was when i was 14. I felt hopeless and like nothing was ever going to change. The next year, i remember even writing a suicide note, with the intentions of ending my life. My parents found it, and we had a talk about it, and I went to counseling. Things started to get better, even though i wasn't very open and counseling didn't last very long. 3 years later, I had a cyst removed from my tail-bone, and i wasn't able to even sit down for about two weeks. I spent most of that time on painkillers and sleeping. I kept taking them for a while, even though all the pain was gone, cause it made me feel a little better. But every since that surgery, i've always felt down, and i was never as happy as I once was. Everything seems dull and uninteresting, and suicidal thoughts are daily. Today, I relapsed on self-harm, which I hadn't done since i was about 17. I don't have many friends anymore because I barely leave the house. I don't have a job. I don't have my license because I get too anxious when I drive now-a-days. The problem I have with all of this is there is nothing wrong in my life. I have both my parents, most my grandparents are alive, even my great grandparents. My parents aren't struggling with money, and my two brothers are doing well and are happy as far as I can tell. But then there is me. I just don't have any motivation to do anything anymore, and I've come to terms with myself and I'm comfortable with leaving this world at any time. I frequently have dreams of dying. The only reason I haven't gone is because of how badly it would affect my parents. I really wish I could just get better. I just don't know what to do anymore. At least posting like this helps a little.
