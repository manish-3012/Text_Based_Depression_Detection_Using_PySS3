I need a little helpI post comments on here to help other people but tonight I need help. Id perfer to not go into too much history of my problems. Tonight I am feeling completly overwhelmed with thoughts of suicide. Ive had a long 12 hour shift helping other people and I have to go to my next shift soon. I was wondering if someone could send me some positive comments/ thoughts to get me through this. I havent had urges to hurt myself this bad before.
