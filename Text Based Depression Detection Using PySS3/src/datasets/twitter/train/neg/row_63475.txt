24F I'm sad and exhausted but hey there's a silver lining I've been isolated for years and opened up to two people earlier this year, even though I knew I wasn't ready to have friends. One friendship ended in June and the other ended on Sunday. This isn't even the biggest stressor of my life but wow was it a cherry on top of everything.

Finally starting a job soon and will have the freedom (?) to pick a method soon. I'm just so tired of feeling like a freak and being rejected.
