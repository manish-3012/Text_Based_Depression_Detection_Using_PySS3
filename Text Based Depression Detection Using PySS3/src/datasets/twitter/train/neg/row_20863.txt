the feeling of never being a first choice is killing mei used to be, at one point. that friend is gone, with someone else now. iâ€™m now in the weird plane of just existing. iâ€™m no oneâ€™s favorite. for most, iâ€™m a third, fourth, fifth choice. occasionally iâ€™ll see how unloved i truly am. iâ€™m comic relief. iâ€™m the humor in the friend group. iâ€™m not allowed to vent, be sad, be even remotely upset. i have to be â€œfunâ€ or else iâ€™m useless. they pretend to care. â€œiâ€™m here for youâ€, they say, â€œyou can always talk to me.â€ so why do you turn me away when iâ€™m crying out for help? why do you make fun of my pain, why do you ignore me? i canâ€™t cope with this. iâ€™m embarrassed over how little iâ€™m cared for. it didnâ€™t bother me for a while. until someone brought an acquaintance to the friend group. she heard me speak, words thrown into the air for no one to catch. i was suddenly hyperaware of how little someone cared, because there was a witness. i kept my mouth shut. cobwebs have grown in my throat. my mouth is sealed shut. i do not want to be here anymore. i hope god will forgive me.
