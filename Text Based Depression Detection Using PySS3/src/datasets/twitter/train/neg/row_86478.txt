Think Iâ€™m able to do it now.Wasnâ€™t able to do it for years and years. Last time I got this close was back in 2015 when i had a whole box of pills I was gonna take, and I just couldnâ€™t do it. Well last week I stayed up late getting drunk and I had a box just sitting there, put them all in a cup and I realised there was nothing stopping me this time. Last time I was too scared... what if it doesnâ€™t work? What if it gets better? What will I be missing out on? Well this time, the fear is gone. Only thing that stopped me was the realisation that I can go out and get more, and really cut out any chance of making it out alive. So I went to the pharmacy and used an old prescription to pick up some new pills, added them to the collection. Itâ€™s enough to kill me now for sure. This is gonna be a lame comparison, but you know that episode of family guy where brian talks about having a gun in a safe, just in case it ever gets too much?.Thatâ€™s where it feels like I am, right now. I know next time things really go to shit iâ€™m just gonna do it, and now that I know that things can actually end I feel like Iâ€™m really living and like my life really matters -living is a choice now, so continuing on feels so much more meaningful now that I know Iâ€™m not more or less forced to do it anymore. 

All the same, how long is it gonna be until my next meltdown when all it takes is a particularly shitty day to push me over the edge? And all the same again, what does it matter when Iâ€™ve got nothing to lose, anyway? What have I gained in the past four years, after I realised I was too chicken to do it back in 2015? I donâ€™t know. What am I losing if I try to call it quits? I donâ€™t know again. Part of me really want this to end, part of me wants to keep trying. How do I pick whoâ€™s rational? Can I know? I feel like itâ€™s a leap of faith either way. I do it, and lose the chance that things could get better. Or I donâ€™t, and run the risk that things will never get better. But I feel like Iâ€™m on a time limit of all of a week before I have another bad night, and get drunk enough to really want to go for it again. I donâ€™t know what to do. I think Iâ€™m just gonna try and wait it out and try and go on living with this new respect I have for living, and hope for the best one way or another.
