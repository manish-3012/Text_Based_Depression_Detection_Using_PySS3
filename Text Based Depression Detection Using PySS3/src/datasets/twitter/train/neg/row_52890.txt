15M my suicide attempts working(Throw away acc)
When I was twelve I took 58 tablets of paracetamol and I was pretty much fine. I told my parents and we went to the ER, but I just vomited a couple times and then I was good

Iâ€™ve tried many night to suffocate myself in my sleep with a pillow, and yet I always wake up.

I tried to overdose again when I was 14, I took like 30 of a tablet I donâ€™t remember and I didnâ€™t tell anyone, all that happened was my stomach really hurt and I was super hungry for a week after.

I donâ€™t have the balls to actually cut myself, but if guns were legal in Australia I would have been dead for 4 years. 

Recently I have had no drive to do anything but just lay in my bed and watch videos. I donâ€™t deserve life. Imagine someone who is fighting to survive from Coronavirus or some cancer or whatever, and they have 100s of people who love them, they love their self, but they end up dying. And then theirs me. Who doesnâ€™t want to fight or do anything. Why not give them life and take it from me.

If itâ€™s not clear enough yet I hate myself and I want to die
