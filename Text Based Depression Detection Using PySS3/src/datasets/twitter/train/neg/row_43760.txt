I'm patheticI really feel like a pathetic waste you know? Like even the reason I even want to kill myself is probably the pettiest thing(s) ever. People here are going through some deep shit in life and I'm here sad because a little thing in life didn't go well. It just makes me feel like killing myself even more. But the thing is, I don't even think I ever will because I'm a coward. I don't want to seek help from anyone in real life because I know they'll just assume I'm joking because that's the kind of guy I am or they'll just push me away. Furthermore I'm way too embarrassed to anyway. Which is why I'm posting annon on this subreddit because none of you know me. Maybe you guys will be here to accept my little rants about life which make me feel how I do even if they're the tiniest problems ever. Or maybe you'll just ignore this but who knows? I just feel alone and pathetic :(
