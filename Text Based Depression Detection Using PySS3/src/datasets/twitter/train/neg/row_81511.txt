Iâ€™ve set the date for my suicide, and I feel so much relief knowing itâ€™ll be over soonNo more pain and anxiety. No more living as a failure of a human being and a joke. No more burdening my family.

I feel like a huge weight has been lifted, the prospect of living like this for years and years and years was terrifying. But now thatâ€™s gone I feel so much better.

I just hope my family understands afterwards, Iâ€™ll be drafting a suicide note this evening and working on it until I do it. Hopefully that will help somewhat in letting them know itâ€™s not their fault and that I had to die.
