Please please I just need to dieThere's nothing for me here. No more family, no one that really cares or loves me. I really feel so alone and desperate for someone to talk to, to hug and to go have fun with.
I'm stuck in a cycle of work and sleep, and I don't do much else.
I'm so so tired all the time.
I want someone who makes me feel like I'm worth something
