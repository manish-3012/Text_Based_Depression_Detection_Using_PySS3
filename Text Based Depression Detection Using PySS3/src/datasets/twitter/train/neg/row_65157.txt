I donâ€™t understand......why creditors are so unwilling to work with borrowers...

Like, I didnâ€™t know I was going to lose my job a month after taking out the loan. I knew it was a possibly, but everyone was telling me â€œdonâ€™t worry about itâ€ and â€œitâ€™ll be fineâ€. Taking out the loan was part of my contingency plan in the event that I did lose my job. You know, consolidate debt, reduce monthly expenses, ect. I didnâ€™t know that 8 months later, I would still be unemployed and my unemployment benefits would run out before I found a job. I didnâ€™t take out the loan planning on not paying it back.

So, why canâ€™t they work with me? Just tack on an additional payment at the end of the term and enjoy the NSF fee and additional interest. Instead they tell me I have 2.5 weeks to come up with the money. Itâ€™s not impossible, but it puts me in the same bad situation next month.

Iâ€™m going to talk to someone about a job tomorrow. If I donâ€™t get it, this will be the final nail in the coffin.
