Amateur musician here. I had been talking to one of my few legitimate fans. I think she's killed herself.She was talking about suicide, about how the track she was working on (she was a music producer too) was going to be her last. She wasnt comfortable opening up about any of it other than telling me she was going to do it.  


I didnt try to pry. I didnt really try to stop her. I just kept reassuring her that I was there, no matter what help she needed. Words like these across the internet dont have much weight but I... IDK.   


She didnt let me listen to her last track. Said that I could only listen  to it if it did get released on one of the big labels she'd submitted it to (DubstepGutter, UKF, Monstercat etc.) I told her very honestly and as gently as I could that her music was nowhere near the standards of those labels, plus she needed experience, branding, management etc.  


She didnt have any of it. She told me she deleted it and she was "going away."  


Its been 5 days since she last came online.  


I dont know how to feel. I would never, ever tell anyone not to kill themselves if its their last resort.  


But... I cant help feel like I killed her. That if I had just said "yeah great job!" she'd still be here.  


I dont know... Is music really more important to me than her life?
