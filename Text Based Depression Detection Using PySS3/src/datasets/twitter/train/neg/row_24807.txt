I will kill myself if I make another mistake.I am tired of life. Tired of being tortured by the so-called "hope". I hate the situation that I am in right now. Tired of being alone, tired of struggling from PTSD, tired of failing to overcome over and over. I always tried to act strong in the past, saying to others that I don't give a shit. In reality, I'm just a 16-year-old who is going through fucking hell. I have cried and begged others to help me, but all they do is pity me and talk behind my back. If I fail to overcome again, I'm just going to end everything. I wonder when everything went so wrong. Life is so fucking unfair.
