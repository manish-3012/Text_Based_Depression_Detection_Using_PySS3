I'm absolutely nothing but an inconvenience to everyoneFirst of all, I'm 98% sure I am autistic. Yes, I know, nowadays, seemingly **everyone** self-"diagnoses" themselves with ASD or whatever else, but hear me out:

I have had 3 adults in the past, all of whom have had previous experience working with autistic people, that they strongly suspect that I am on the spectrum. My motor skills are so poor that I can barely even work retail jobs. Whenever I'm told to mop the floor, fix a machine, change something, or do basically **anything** that involves coordination, I'm completely hopeless despite giving my absolute best effort (an then there's the whole customer service thing). It took me until age 13, age fucking 13, to be able to sufficiently tie a shoe. Believe me, I try so damn hard at all of those things -- all of them, but I just can't ever, ever, ever get it.

In the past 3 years, I have had **one** friend, and by "friend", I mean acquaintance that I spoke to every time I saw him between classes. I can't interact with anyone, I can't perform my job correctly, I can't make friends, I can't give out social cues, I can't do shit. However, I have never been officially diagnosed because whenever I talked to my parents about it when I was younger, they assured me that I was not "different" or "odd" in anyway.

And as the title says, I'm just starting to feel like I'm nothing but an inconvenient waste of space to everyone around me. I'm absolutely useless at performing tasks, I have to rely on others to do them for me, I always accidentally say the wrong things to people, I always chase away potential friends with my apparent (but nonexistent) "lack of empathy", I have no independence, and I just feel like I do nothing but make the lives of everyone around me worse. I compared myself to a mosquito; nobody wants to have me around, and I'm just an annoyance. I feel like I'm that person that they roll their eyes when they see or that they want to avoid, and frankly, I don't even see the purpose of even being around at all if that's all my entire existence is.

I've tried to put these thoughts behind me, and for a while, I was doing good. But recently, I was curious so started to browse the internet for what non-autistic people think about those on the spectrum, and it really confirmed my belief that it would just be better if I disappeared. The responses I found right here on Reddit:

&gt;It's an entitlement thing, imho. Autistic people are often praised for their intelligence (real or imagined) so they don't feel too bad about themselves, but it can also make them really full of themselves. Yeah, maybe I don't know shit about trains, but at least I can figure out how put on deodorant. [+11]

.

&gt;TBH, I've never met an autistic guy that wasn't a giant fucking weirdo with awful hygiene. [+14]

.

&gt;My brother is on the spectrum and I don't think I have the patience for a romantic relationship with a man who was. I would get so irritated so quickly at his outbursts, I'd get embarrassed when he'd act out in front of my friends (he has twitches/compulsive moment and he will still sometimes throw tantrums.) [+15]

.

&gt;Difficulty is not inability, and I find most men on the spectrum are not, actually, hopelessly incapable - they just throw their hands up and quit when things are hard instead of knuckling down and working on their social skills as skills. [+41]

So there you have it. It was back to feeling like a mosquito again. I honestly don't know how I'm supposed to go on anymore, and I feel truly, sincerely feel more and more helpless each day.
