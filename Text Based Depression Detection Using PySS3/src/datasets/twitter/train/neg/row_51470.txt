here to talk about how I really feelToday is my 21st birthday and Iâ€™ve been thinking about killing myself all day. I just donâ€™t know what is going on anymore in life. I donâ€™t drink or do drugs. Iâ€™m currently on probation my life is mess. I just wanna take away this pain or at least dangle on the edge of the ledge and maybe hope a gust of wind comes and I slip and fall. I have no reason to continue life. Whenever I go and talk to my family and have on my fake smile they are always so negative to me even when Iâ€™m being nice and helpful and respectful. Imagine if they found out how I really felt. Iâ€™d probably get left out in the cold somewhere in the middle if he woods to freeze to death which oddly Iâ€™d be completely okay with that. 
It was fun while it lasted. 
Sorry everyone Iâ€™m getting sicker as I grow older and itâ€™s getting more and more difficult to deal with and Iâ€™d like to just throw it all away.
Whatâ€™s the point ? I donâ€™t have any reason to continue on there isnâ€™t a single person that could convince me this is pure fate.
I know my time is coming quicker than I see it.
Iâ€™m really ready. The only person holding me back is myself I could easily end it. I kinda want to hang myself so I can feel the fight between the half and half of crossing over to the other side. :)
