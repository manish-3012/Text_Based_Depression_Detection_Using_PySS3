Finally considering giving in.I have struggled with thoughts of suicide for a long time. I have been diagnosed with chronic depression and anxiety disorder for 5+ years and I have fought through that. But recently I found out that I am a joke amongst the only people I thought cared about me. 


For all the hard thing I have been going through these were the people I thought were my crutch. The ones who kept me level. And recently they accidentally linked me to a group chat in which they made fun of me and referenced the fact that they only put up with me because I have known them so long. They all hate me.

The only people I thought really cared about me, hate me. I have had LITERALLY every single person I thought cared about me in my life either abuse me (physically or mentally) or leave me because I am not worth it. My thoughts have not been on this subject for a year or so but I have the way out staring me in the face and I see no other option.
