Hey,.It's me againI failed the tylenol attempt 

I was hopeful since yesterday

Now, my dreams are crushed 

The girl I've always loved, hates me because of stuff That happened to me because of the meds I took

My frined who was the Messenger, bailed on me

I failed the semester 

Still Can't rest or stay still

I camt talk to the loVe of my life

My life is shambles because The hospital was too dumb to find the appendix 


I tried tylonol 50g but threw up most.of them 

Any ideas?
