My boyfriend woke up and decided I don't make him happy anymore2 days ago everything was fine, he said he loved me and he missed me.
Now he thinks he's not happy and doesn't seem to care.
He's the only thing I have. He's the only person I can be myself around. I love him so much and I don't know what to do.
I can't make it okay. I just want it to be okay. How do i make it okay again
