Howdy, I feel like I should say somethingI've been a lurker on Reddit for a bit now(I feel pretty guilty about not being more active) so this is a bit out of my comfort zone, but whatever, tonight I'm shaking things up a bit. 
I'm 15 year old sophomore and I have a shit ton of depression and unhappiness. It's been like this since around 8th grade when I got hyper self conscious and developed the wonderful curse of social anxiety. I'm in and out suicidal, so that's a bad time, but I don't think I will any time soon purely because I lack means. However, it's really getting annoying just because of how much my happiness seems to fluctuate. In one hour I'm quite fine, sociable, and I'd like to assume socially competent. The next, I can get really depressed and absolutely shut down. Then everything gets worse because I'm being less sociable, and it's a downward spiral of anxiety. Thoughts?
