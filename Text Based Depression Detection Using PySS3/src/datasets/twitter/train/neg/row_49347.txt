What's the point of living for other people? I don't get it. I'm suffering most of the day, most days. At this point I exist solely for the benefit of other people. I've been deeply depressed for a long time (crippling anxiety and depression), in debt and stuck overseas because there are no jobs at home. I can hardly keep work out here and my long term girlfriend is about to move away to a place where there are no jobs for me. I'm totally disconnected from a career path, have a spotty resume and really no concrete future ahead of me other than unstable work and sleep. I fantasize constantly about suicide. Constantly. When I tell my girlfriend, she only tells me about how sad that would make other people. Is this supposed to be the trump card to keep people from killing themselves? What the fuck is the point of living then, if that is what it has come down to? Maybe I will just slowly disappear instead.
