A guy who went to my school killed himself this weekend, and the way the school is reacting is making me angry.They do all the regular stuff like a memorial for the day at the common meeting place, and flying the flag at half mast. 

But they aren't addressing the issue, they are like:

"oh he didn't show any signs of being sad so there was nothing we could have done" 

they are only pretending to care but in a week they will have forgotten all about it.

They guy needed help he needed someone to care or life was just to much for him.
