hobbies, distractions, fun thingsive posted in here a few times in the past 6 months on different accounts trying to find ways to kill myself but i guess I'll take a different route this time coz maybe im not super super sad this time, im just completely numb &amp; dead inside. how do you guys stop yourself from killing yourself? what are some new things i could try for fun and for hobbies? some apps websites or irl things? im sick of not finding joy in anything but im also sick of trailing off into the depressing and suicidal side of things, i want to be different this time and at least try to live. thank you for reading
