I've been depressed for too long and don't know how to handle it anymoreI'm freaking out, it seems like everybody who would've been there to care about me is gone and nobody else can do anyting ot help, but I don't want to die. Fuck, I don't even know how to format or word things in this subreddit. The one thing I never thought would happen has happened and I don't know how I can tryst anyone again, but even then there's nobody there for me to try to.

Fuck, this makes absolutely no sense. Fuck me. I'm too young for this hsit.
