My gf is talking of suicide after already attempting it once and nothing I say or do seems to help. I don't know what else to say or do to help her. She went to group therapy and was making progress and then just quit. Now she refuses to talk about it and refuses to accept professional help. She has been making verbal hints towards trying again even though she says she wouldn't try it again. I don't know if I can believe her and I'm running out of options. What else can I do?
