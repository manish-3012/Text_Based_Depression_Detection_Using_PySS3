in the hospital after suicide attempthey there everyone...

so friday morning I took exactly 10,000mg of tylenol. Bad plan, impulsive, poorly researched (aka not at all) and pretty much has sucked endlessly since. It's now almost midnight on Tuesday night and I am ~you guessed it~ still in the hospital!!!

I'm pretty much over any pain and I've stopped vomiting and waiting to see if my liver will recover, basically being bored out of my own mind so if anyone wants to ask me anything or is curious about what this experience has been like for me, I'm ready to talk about the things that are probably (normally) rude to ask, the mundane details, and everything in between! 

EDIT: gonna get some sleep but i'll check again in the morning
