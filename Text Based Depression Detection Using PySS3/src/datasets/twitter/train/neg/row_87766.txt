I need to call the number.The problem is:

My mom said that tomorrow my behavioral  therapist would be screaming at me because today in a hospital before my doctor's appointment I had my wallet and school folder on the floor. My mom threatened calling the police on me today, but no one in my household did that now. Thank goodness.

On my wallet is my Florida State ID, my Wells Fargo debit card, a light/dark gray USB and some coins. Nothing else of much importance here. Nothing bad is on that light/dark gray USB.

On my school folder is some paper awards from my school to me, like my promotion from 9th to 10th Grade certificate from last year, my current report cards, my certificate that says that I'm the Student of the Month of 10th Grade for September 2017, and so on.

Anyways, more info on the problem is that my mom said that someone can steal my information like my bank account information.

I said "No one can steal my intelligence!" 

I don't want my behavioral therapist to be screaming at me tomorrow, so I have to call the Suicide Prevention number tomorrow.

Yes, I have a smartphone, it's the one I'm using right now. Yes, I do know my phone number. 

I need to call the Suicide Prevention number tomorrow so I would be in a safe haven instead of me being in trouble with my behavioral therapist.

Comments?
