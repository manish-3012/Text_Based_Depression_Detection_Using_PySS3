Is it worth committing suicide because I can't find a job and I'm legit unemployable wherever I go?Seems like all my friends who went through the same struggle as me for years all have good paying jobs now and I'm just completely useless staying at home with my parents just wanting some money. Fuck DOING MY HEAD IN.
