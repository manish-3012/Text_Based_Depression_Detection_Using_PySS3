Fucking throw away this post to hell I don't care, this post may break all your rules, but u know what, like I said throw this post away if u want but imma fucking type hell todayOk so long story super ass short, it doesn't get better, did u get ya folks, it doesn't, specially for freaks and losers like me,( ok no sympathy gaining here), it doesn't. You're anxiety, you're paranoia, you're depression, it doesn't go away, it just doesn't. What can you do??u can't even do shit about it. U can't, why don't u get it, I've wasted 5 fucking months toughening up , fighting against this crappy thing inside my head, but did it get any better??? Nooooo!!!! It didn't!!!!! I still freaked that day, I still freak now. Is it your fault????? Idk, but humans are assholes so I guess it's mine and everyone else's fault,. Imma walking corpse, so trust a corpse. I can't even fucking kill myself bcz my Anxiety won't even let me do it. I had a chance last year on November, and I should have ended myself then. I'm just, trust me when i say this, we're fucked. We're just fucked. Atleast I am fucked and I can't fix anything. All those who say talk about it, talk about it, holy motherfucking shit it still is a shitty crap life. And I KNOW I'M NOT ALONE BUT THEN WHAT THE FUCKING DIFFERENCE DOES THAT EVEN MAKE?????????? I'M STILL A LIVING DEAD!!!!!! ITS JUST ME ALONE IN THE END!!!! JUST ME???!! NO ONE ELSE AIN'T GONNA SAVE ME, AND IG SAME GOES FOR THE REST O Y'ALL. Normal people, bwahahahahah, count your stars man, I wish I were you. Dear god, (if u r any), if only I could tell you how dumb piece of shitty creation called humans you had made.
