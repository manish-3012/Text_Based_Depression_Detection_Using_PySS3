Family Members That Push You To The Verge Of SuicideFunny how a few days ago, I feel a surge of positive energy. I felt like if I got help and got professional treatment, things will change for me. I realised today that none of that matters in my situation. I get zero support from my remaining family members. They choose to ignore my pain or try to put more pressure to me to get a job etc. I feel hopeless and pathetic, to have to type here and beg for compassion and kindness from strangers. I was watching a documentary about suicide and how everyone expressed sadness for the deceased. But how many of them were there to help? To show support at times where you feel empty and there is nothing going for you? No one would kill themselves if they see hope, if they feel they can cope.

I am writing this to fellow family members who had to deal with suicide. Were you there when they killed themselves? Did you shun them and not take them seriously? Did you call them weak? Did you label them as losers? Did you try with all your might to keep them living and breathing for just another day? Did you try to make them feel understood and cared for? Did you judge them negatively when they don't even have energy to brush their own teeth? Did you try to make them happy for once?

I know cases vary individually when it comes to suicide. Some people still choose to commit suicide despite having support because the pain is to much to bear. 

But I don't plan on writing a suicide note. I just don't want any remnants of my life to remain. My parents are the worst people when it came to my depression. Shouted at me as well as ignored me. If they have to suffer after my death, they deserve all of it.
