Perpetually TiredI'm tired. 

Tired of being the one that gives endlessly and is always there...   
Tired of being the one to reach out... being the one to check up...   
Tired of all the memories of abandonment..   
Tired of losing loved ones without saying goodbye...   
Tired of being used and abused...   
Tired of chasing away the one who might have cared..   
Tired of the memories and flashbacks to the worst times in my life...  
Tired of feeling worthless, like a fuckup, like nothing I do is right, like nothing I say really matters... 

I'm tired, but I keep trying, even through a -long- nap sounds good right now.
