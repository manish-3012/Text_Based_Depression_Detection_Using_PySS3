my boyfriend broke up with me on my birthdayi feel so alone. my mental illness ruined another relationship. i was two weeks away from finally getting on medication &amp; getting therapy. i moved out of our apartment and i am now living with my parents. 

life just seems like a joke. love seems like a joke. i never want to trust someone with my heart again. i donâ€™t know how to handle pain like this. 

i wanted my birthday to be a happy day. we were supposed to get drunk and play mario kart. then i found him packing up my things. he told me to leave. 

i am so heartbroken and i am so scared to be alone. i feel like my life will never get better. why keep living if i feel so much pain.
