Hanging myself Christmas morningI was so certain things would be fixed by Christmas, but they aren't and probably never will be.  Not interested in "It gets better, just keep waiting." or "Things can't get better if you kill yourself", I just need suggestions of inconspicuous public places to hang myself as my house has no garage, no rafters--nothing to do it from.  Scenic would be a definite plus (i.e. not a parking garage or some shit), but I'd like to avoid climbing a tree if I can since I'm not particularly athletic.  PM me with suggestions.
