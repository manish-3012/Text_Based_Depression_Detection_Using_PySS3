If I tell the doctor I am suicidal will they put me in an institution?I have had depression and anxiety for quite a long time but I never got help before because I was afraid a diagnosis might keep me from getting into the military. Well recently a combination of things breakup with girlfriend, death of several family members, and the weather have really fucked me up bad and I've begun cutting to the point where I am becoming scared. And because of my anxiety I have few friends to talk to. I now wish to seek a diagnosis so I can hopefully be prescribed medication to help with this as therapy has never worked for me because I've always been too scared to tell the therapist I am suicidal for fear of being forced into a mental institution which I am aware is like an immediate disqualifier for going in the military. All I want is medication to fix this but if they're going to put me in an institution I'll probably just kill myself first.
