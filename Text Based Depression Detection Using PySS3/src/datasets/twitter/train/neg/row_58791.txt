16 yr old considering drastic measuresHello. (Sorry if my name offends anyone btw, I made it because I was playing a video game) I don't really know how to start this so I guess I'll just give you some background info. I'm a 16 year old male, I have a good body, straight A's, plenty of "friends", and a void that has been occupying my attention for a little over 3 months. Every day is the same thing, and endless cycle of monotony, I've built a character for myself that's always happy and every day I have to act out his person so others are happy. I'm not myself, I can't be an individual. I feel trapped as even my parents love this character I made, let's call it "John".  My mom has been spending more time on the phone than interacting with us. I don't know... I probably haven't done a good job of describing it so I'll condense it all into one point.  I'm tired of living the same happy go lucky lie, and tired of not being appreciated, so I'm contemplating ending it. I have made plans before and even gone so far as to open the case of my dads rifle. The only reason I haven't offed myself is because  of fear.
