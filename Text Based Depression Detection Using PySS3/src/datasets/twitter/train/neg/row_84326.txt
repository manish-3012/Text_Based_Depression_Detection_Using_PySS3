Celebrate the little victoriesA few months back I had a really bad bout of depression, to the point I spent all day crying, drinking and looking up methods of suicide.

One time returning home I just kept walking, right past my door, for hours just in the middle of the night, went to a bridge and really thought about it. I was there for a long time stood by the railings.

I eventually turned back and went to bed.

This was the night before an exam, an exam I failed awfully, I was usually a high achiever, I got the lowest grade in my entire year.

People laughed when they saw and would ask "why didn't you try" "why didn't you revise". 

But that day I won, I turned up, I was alive. It is hard for people to understand that struggle. Celebrate the small things. I never would have understood if I had not gone through this.

So remember that most people don't understand, how could they, it is not their fault. When you are so depressed just making it another day is a victory and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.
