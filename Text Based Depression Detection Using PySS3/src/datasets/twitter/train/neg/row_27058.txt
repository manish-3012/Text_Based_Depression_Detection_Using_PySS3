I don't see the pointI'm back here again, I don't see the point in going on.

I have panic attacks now at least every 2 days, I've basically taken a flamethrower to my entire life, I keep crying all the time, and of course I got divorced which is basically like yeah there was all this good shit in my life and I go fuck it up.

I feel utterly alone. I want to go jump in front of a train.

And what? Why shouldn't I?
