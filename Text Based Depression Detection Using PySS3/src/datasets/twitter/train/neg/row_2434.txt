thereâ€™s not a single part of me that wants to be alive, even a little.i tried hanging my self with a belt and it didnâ€™t work. i donâ€™t know what i was expecting. 

iâ€™ve been on hold for a psych ward for almost 2 and a half weeks now. Iâ€™m tired of empty promises and false hope. iâ€™m tired of the pain and being misdiagnosed. I would pay someone to shoot me right now. Thereâ€™s not even a .00001 percent of me that wants to be alive anymore. There truly is no point. none. I feel the ones making me stay alive are way more selfish than i am. I live in constant pain for my entire life 24 hours a day but i have to stay alive for them. itâ€™s fucking stupid when i donâ€™t even care about anyone. how could i care about someone elseâ€™s well being when i just want out? I donâ€™t give a fuck anymore. Iâ€™m so disconnected from reality iâ€™ll go out of this world with a smile and guilt free. Someone just fucking kill me
