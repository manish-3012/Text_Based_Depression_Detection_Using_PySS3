I'm tired of being aloneI'm 21 years old and I've never even held hands with a girl. I just don't know what the hell is wrong with me. I've asked my friends, family, and professionals and they all say the same useless bullshit. "Just keep trying." "Use online dating." "Keep yourself presentable." "You haven't met the right girl."

I've done everything I can. I've been going to gym. I keep myself clean. I socialize. I'm on half a dozen dating sites. Nothing works for me. No matter how much I try to improve myself, I'm just not good enough. I'm no better off now than I was years ago. There's just no point in trying anymore.

I hate myself. I'm a loser virgin who's going to spend the rest of my life alone. I'm never going to feel the warmth of romantic affection. I don't want to feel this pain for decades. I want just get it over with and die right here, right now.
