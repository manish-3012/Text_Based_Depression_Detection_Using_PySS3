does anyone else envy people with terminal illness?I know this is a very selfish and fucked up thing to feel, but sometimes I really envy people with terminal illness. in my mind it would be so freeing to know death is coming. 

at the same time I feel really sorry for them, because I know they would probably give anything to have another chance, to have a new and healthy body, just like the one I'm currently wasting.

I wish I could trade places with them, I really do. then my family could prepare, make arrangements. they wouldn't resent me. I could go out in a clean way.

does anyone else has these thoughts as well?

sorry if this sounds too selfish
