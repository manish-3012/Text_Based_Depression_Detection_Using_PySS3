Rational suicideI recently read Mitchell Heisman's [suicide note](http://www.suicidenote.info/ebook/suicide_note.pdf); his work has made me ponder on why I should continue living.

In essence, Heisman argues that life is meaningless and, because self-preservation equals self-destruction, suicide is the only reasonable choice, when biases have been overcame.

Are these arguments compelling enough so as to commit suicide?
