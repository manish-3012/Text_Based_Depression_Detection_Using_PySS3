Revolution instead of suicide? (First of if you think I'm a shit talking retard then you're probably right - in this case downvote this and ignore it) 
Every year about 800 thousand people commit suicde. Every 40 seconds. People are fed up by life. I am fed up by life. I don't want to live. But I don't want to kill myself either. I don't know about you guys but I'd rather see some fucking change in our world. What if instead of killing yourself and wasting your precious life you'd fight for a greater good. What if those millions of suicidal people would Band together and create a Revolution for better or worse? Maybe I have watched to many movies and read to many fantasy books. Maybe I am fucking stupid manchild throwing a tantrum. To think we could make a change - maybe it's just delusional. The System has to fall and it will fall anyway. I don't know when or by whom. But the world as we know it now hasn't even existed 100 years. Older civilizations have existed centuries. Each thinking they were the highest of them highest. Our World and capitalism is destined to fail. The education System is destined to fail. The concept of family has been teared apart. People aren't people anymore. Your life has no value but the Profit you bring for the economy.
