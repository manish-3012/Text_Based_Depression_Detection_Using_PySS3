I dont know what to doIâ€™m stuck in London on a school trip, Iâ€™m realising noone wants me around, I'm annoying and brash and bad with people and noone would want me, my friends all push me away and don't talk to me, and Iâ€™m feeling suicidal. Itâ€™s amazing how quickly its progressed - I started having small thoughts after my breakup a month and a half ago, its progressed so quickly, and now Iâ€™m full blown suicidal - not planning, but its all I really thought about today. I havenâ€™t got anyone to talk to - my best friend isnâ€™t really talking, and Iâ€™m feeling so so low. I had an autistic meltdown during a play today, and noone even noticed.

I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m writing this. No one cares. Please help.
