Who the hell DOESN'T want to kill themselves?Everyone I know experiences some level of depression or anxiety even if they aren't openly admitting to it; it's almost become more of the rule than the exception. I don't feel any pity for anyone claiming depressive symptoms anymore, because what it really means is, "I'm a thinking person that's self-aware enough to realize that being alive fucking sucks."

I've been thinking of dying for the better part of two years now and I can't imagine some of these people holding on for so fucking long. What's the point? Why stay alive? Just because you'd hurt everyone else? It's fucking stupid. I've had enough of this shit, and you probably have, too, even if you're trying to vouch for life.
