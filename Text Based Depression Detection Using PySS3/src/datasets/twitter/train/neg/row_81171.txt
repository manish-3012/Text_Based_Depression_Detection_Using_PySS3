Too sad to kill myself?I've been seriously suicidal for so long. I sat on my balcony for over an hour over a month ago ready to jump while I was texting goodbye to anyone I cared even the slightest bit about. Every reason why I pussied out of jumping that day has gone away, and I can't find a reason to not kill myself, in fact logically, I really feel like it's the best decision I can make without any clouded judgment. I was really seriously considering Friday - Monday, but today (Tuesday in my time) so much stuff happened that just made me feel worse and worse and worse. And I'm honestly too sad to kill myself. I don't know why, I don't know if it makes sense, it doesn't sound like it should make sense. Isn't suicide the end all move? How can I be so sad that I don't even want to kill myself. How did this happen. Has this happened to anyone else?

I'm sorry if the formatting is bad, I don't post very often and I feel like my brain tapped out on friday because I did something stupid to it.
