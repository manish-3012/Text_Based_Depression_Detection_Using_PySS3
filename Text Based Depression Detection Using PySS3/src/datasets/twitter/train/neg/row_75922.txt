unable to accept that human are horribleI believe wanting to learn brings peace. Sharing information amicably between each other is the surest path to happiness. Ignorance leads to confusion then resentment then hate.

But even with loving family members, the conflict builds into confusion and hate and pain... and when its reconciled, it often boils down to "omg im so sorry, i just didnt know even though you were trying so hard to explain it." We all want to be understood and understand. But our inept flesh brains and primitive psyches fuck it up so bad every time. Then I reflect on the conflict and see no lesson learned, just that we're continually wrong and fail and hurt each other.

Elevate that to the more volatile conflict between strangers, and it's horrifying. Humans may be able to grow beyond our stupid and primitive hate, our narrow world views, and our ignorance to science, but it will take so very long.... I know it won't be in my life time. I don't know if I can just learn to live with how we are. I just want to be good to others. When I fail, I hate myself. When they fail me, I resent them then hate myself, because I know better, but my shit brain ruins it.

Imagine how nuanced and clever psychology could be in 100 years.. and I just expect ignorant fearful people will push back on progress, delaying it even further. 

Humans are just the fucking worst. I fucking hate us so much..
