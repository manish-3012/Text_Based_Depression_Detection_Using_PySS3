Not sure what to say...I'm a bit unsure what to write. I guess really all you need to know is that I want to die. I've attempted before, but that was years ago. Different life.

My partnerof two years dumped me and has been doing cruel things since. Said I was too much baggage. I guess I can see that. I'm suffering from depression and PTSD. 

Tonight I had planned and seeing friends at a party, but it coincidentally was at her house and she forbid my going. Everyone I know was there. Laughing and enjoying themselves.

She cheated on me, or it appears that way.

I don't know what else to write.
