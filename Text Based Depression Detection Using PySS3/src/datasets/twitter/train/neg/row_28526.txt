How many of us would be better off if we just reached out?The truth, at least in my life, is that I have a lot of people who I could reach out to for help. In a moment of great motivation, I even reached out to strangers on LinkedIn and got responses (didn't follow up for some complicated reasons, but...). At the same time, I feel this overwhelming shame and don't want to risk the rejection, overwhelmed by the uncertainty of it all. I had a tough childhood that resulted in some persistent trust issues. I can't be certain that I will get help and have had some unfortunate outcomes (as I perceive them) that make me wary. My mind is always hard at work creating worst case scenarios. What I know is that if I'm honest with myself I have not exhausted all options. 

Anyone else feel this?

I've been suicidal since I was 10 and wonder how my life might have been different if I had opened up say to that fifth grade teacher whom I trusted? Or the school counselor? Or so many other people at different steps in my life. In those times, I didn't even see reaching out as an option. I didn't recognize that other people could do anything but hurt you, sad to say. I'm so exhausted.
