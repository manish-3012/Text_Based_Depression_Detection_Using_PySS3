Iâ€™ve been angry and sad with no valid reason, and I just want to end it.Lately Iâ€™ve just been angry with everything in my life and itâ€™s just too much. Iâ€™m sick of waking up and being pissed all day at NOTHING. Literally nothing in my life is worth being upset about yet Iâ€™m irrationally angry. I want to let it out but I donâ€™t want to hurt the people in my life. So Iâ€™ll just remove the one thing I can control, me. 

Hope the world is better without me.
