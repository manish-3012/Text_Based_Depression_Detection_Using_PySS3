I'm so selfishI literally don't care about hurting people anymore. I know if I end it people will be sad, of course I know that and I don't even think it bothers me anymore, I'm so numb to the fucking feeling of every emotion. Ive never had a more selfish thought but it's true. the fact that I am using logic to keep myself alive instead of the genuine desire not to traumatize my family makes it even harder not to loathe myself
