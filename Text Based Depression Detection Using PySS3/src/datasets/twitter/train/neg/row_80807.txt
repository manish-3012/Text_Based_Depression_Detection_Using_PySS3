People treat me like garbage and I feel like I deserve itI was just walking through the convenience store causing absolutely no harm, not bothering anyone when a random old man walks up to me, shoves me and yells "fucking bitch". Not only am I being constantly yelled at and mocked by my parents and teachers, but now complete strangers seem to hate me too. I don't know why everyone feels the need to treat me like complete scum. It makes me feel like everything is my fault. I'm a decent human being, I'm very polite and I don't hurt people. 


But I'm honestly so fucking sick of this. I can't even buy some fucking water in peace.
