My Problems are Too Great, and I can't solve themI'm 28. Unemployed. In unmanageable amounts of debt. Ruined my relationship. Left my apartment (with gf and roommates) with 3 months left on my lease. Now in a situation where I feel hopeless and can't solve my problems. Every day I do nothing, they are getting worse. 

I'm a coward, and I can't live with myself. I want out of the hell I created.
