How long can people be in denial for about the fact that feeling wanted by the opposite sex - and being in a relationship with someone - is a FUNDAMENTAL PART OF BEING A HUMAN BEING? I feel like no-one understands the pain of someone who feels alone, romantically and even socially isolated. Why liveWhy is everyone acting like having a partner, having someone to confide in, having physical touch, affection, sex (yes, sex does matter, ESPECIALLY thanks to modern medias overexposing us to love, sex and nudity on all fronts; music, movies, ect.) and the general happiness and confidence of having the abillity to get together with someone IS NOT IMPORTANT???

WHY? I am not an incel, I don't hate women, I don't buy in to the idea that girls are somehow some evil sluts who only want tall black muscled men or dogs or whatever, so why is it so hard for people to see that having a relationship and just BEING WANTED is important.

Other animals literally die of loneliness if they lack a partner. We have a fucking biological URGE to reproduce, ESPECIALLY when we're hormonal teens (which I kinda still am, only 19 - and please don't comment just to brush off my problems with a simple "you're so young", when nearly all my friends have been in relationships and our entire fucking youth culture is hierachially and generally based around it) and the fact that society is blasted with songs and movies of love and happiness.

I have aspergers and many of my other aspie friends feel the same. But even many of my less than conventional attractive NT friends also can't seem to find anyone, despite us being ourselves, happy, outgoing and all that shit. 

But why the fuck do some people like me have to work out, eat healthy, find hobbies (that is without mentioning that we do many of these things already) but we're just all ignored?

Honestly having proper human connections matter so much to me as an aspie it's been something ive been working on my whole life and to see so many people almost or outright DELEGITIMIZE my struggle with finding a partner and feeling like a capabale person is so fucking disgusting. It's making me contemplate suicide often and I'm just so angry. Why do some people have partners falling into their laps while the short kid, fat girl, anxious geeks and so have to SO MANY FUCKING THINGS before we can even be considered worthy of love and affection. I'm 5'9 and 158lbs, why should I be unhapppy with my body? I like it as it is, why change it, is it really THAT reprehensible? I have hobbies, why should I suddenly pick up now ones - and for whom? A girl that I MIGHT meet at these hobby places that MAY be interested in me if I play my shitty aspie hand JUST right? Jesus fuck no.

It's not worth living in a world where you have to become something you're uncomfortable with becoming in order to have a shot at finding connection and affection from a girl/boy. If the response to me refusing to go to extreme lengths to change myself is that "well, then you'll probably stay single", my response is "well, then I'd rather be dead."

This world is so stupid.
