Ive contemplated suicide since a very young age and struggle much more in my adulthoodThe most difficult thing is talking about it. I canâ€™t imagine anyone compelled to listen wants to be in that situation. To even begin conveying what another individual or ones self is going through is beyond words. The thought of describing why or how you or I ended up this way just brings more depression and anxiety to the surface. Even if you are taking steps to improve your own quality of life sometimes it just isnâ€™t enough, your just trapped with your own thoughts everytime something goes wrong or things get difficult.
I just wanted to share this. Iâ€™m sure there are others who arenâ€™t good with talking or feel unable to speak out on their thoughts..
