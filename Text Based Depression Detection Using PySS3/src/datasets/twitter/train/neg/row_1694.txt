Life is a game, that reaches to the point of quit...Have you ever played a game, and finished it long ago? And still play it till this day? If so, do you realize how boring it gets, and nothing to do? Yeah you wanna quit the game, and start new game. But unfortunately in life, you can't quit, and play a new game, but quit means death in reality. It's about time to leave this shit-hole. 

(Possible solution drugs) but if you fucking get caught... you will wanna die.
