Iâ€™m not sure what to sayIts just constant pressure and bullying from my family. Iâ€™m the youngest of 4 at 13 years old with 2 older sisters and an older brother. everyone says that â€œsiblings will be siblingsâ€ but itâ€™s at the point where Iâ€™m constantly put down by them, every day. Itâ€™s constant physical, verbal and emotional put downs and I donâ€™t know why they always target me. I love my parents but they sit by and do nothing to stop it. Iâ€™m so fed up and I donâ€™t want to do it anymore. School is an escape for me even though I see them sometimes at school. My mum knows I struggle with mental health but it feels like no one cares because nothing ever changes. Iâ€™m so emotionally drained and it wonâ€™t get better since my own parents wonâ€™t stop it despite me talking about my problems.
