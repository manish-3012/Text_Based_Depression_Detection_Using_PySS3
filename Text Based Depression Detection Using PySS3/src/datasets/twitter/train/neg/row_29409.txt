Everyday, even though I don't want to I think about itI'm 16, I know this sounds like a plea for attention but I don't know why sometimes i get random surges of feeling empty and leads to me feeling depressed. It feels like nothing can bring joy to me anymore. Then after a couple of hours the pain resides and I feel normal. Masturbation also seems to make this pain go away for awhile and numbs it.
