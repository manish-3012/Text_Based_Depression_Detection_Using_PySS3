ManipulativeEverything I do is wrong. I had a bit of a breakdown the other day and called someone telling them I wanted to kill myself and they told me I was being manipulative. I honestly just called them because I didnâ€™t know what else to do. I didnâ€™t think I was doing it for ulterior motives. But now I feel like I canâ€™t reach out to anyone because since I havenâ€™t actually gone through with trying to kill myself I am just saying how I feel to get people to give me attention or something. Itâ€™s really a frustrating position to be in. 

Iâ€™m scared of killing myself but Iâ€™m equally scared of living much longer. I feel completely empty inside. Iâ€™m writing this post because I feel as if Iâ€™m at my breaking point and I no longer know how to cope with anything.
