Letter to my WifeI have decided to end my own life. You canâ€™t bear the thought of living with me, and I canâ€™t bear the pain of living without you.

This is the best decision for everyone. You will be free from me, and free to live your happy and peaceful life. And I will be free from this pain that I am enduring and I will stop causing you misery. I donâ€™t want to hurt you anymore and I donâ€™t want to make you cry ever again, but while I am alive and breathing, I simply cannot let you go. I cannot live with this regret.

Please do not try to stop me, anything you do will just delay the inevitable. I have been considering this for many weeks now, and I have already made up my mind. This is the only way out.

I have a plan for how Iâ€™m going to do it, and it will be peaceful. Donâ€™t worry, I wonâ€™t do it here in the apartment. Some day in the next few weeks I will simply be gone, my phone will be off, and that will be the end of it. After itâ€™s over, Iâ€™m sure the police will contact you. I will definitely be gone before Valentineâ€™s Day. I just need a bit of time to figure out some logistics.

Please have some kindness and compassion as I live my last few days on earth. This is the best outcome for everyone. I love you, and I just want you to have the peace and happiness you deserve. I wish you nothing but the best in life. You are my beautiful wife, and my heart with be with you, always.
