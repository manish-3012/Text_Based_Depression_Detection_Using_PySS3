I just want to let you all know you can and will feel better. It took me 3 years to get over my attempt.Ill never get over the guilt I feel that it was almost me. I never told my parents about the letter I wrote, the noose I made, or that the only reason I am alive was that I forgot we were going on vacation together the day I was to do it. To them I was just sad.  It felt like a matter of luck I forgot what day of the week it was.   
I got home after vacation held my gun... put it down and made some phone calls. Therapist first. Then the dog Shelter to volunteer and repay them for giving me more time with my cat before she died. Finally I started a philanthropy commitee in my Fraternity and raised 100s for a charity along with blood drives.   
Ive changed. 8 mile runs 3 to 4 times a week, dog shelter every sunday as a volunteer, and Ill have a Bacheolers degree by fall. People came to my birthday unnanounced last week, and it really showed how much people love me.
People love you and you dont see it yet. It take 3 years but you will see it. Go plan something big for yourself.
