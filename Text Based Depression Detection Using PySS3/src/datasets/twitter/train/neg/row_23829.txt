No matter how silly this may sound, it's affecting me seriously. I just want someone to hear me out.I have suffered from panic attacks since my senior year of high school. I am now 19. My latest one started from a memory I remembered about two days ago. When I was a kid (around 4th grade), I remember that on my brother's birthday he invited a butch of our mutual friends over. One of my friend's younger brother came along, and while we were eating candy, I remember how some people were spitting out their candy and giving it to my friend's younger brother, and he ate them like nothing was wrong. So, I, in trying to get in, thought it would be funny if I wiped a lollipop up my bottom and gave it to him. Now, I actually don't remember giving it to him, infact, I remember NOT giving it to him. Yet, part of my mind is telling me that there is still a possibility I gave it to him, and if I did give it to him, then I am the equivalent of a rapist. Am I just thinking into it too much? I was just a young kid, after all. And this thought never really bothered me before... please, can some of you assure me that I'm still a good person? I have never done anything like this in my whole life, and I know that deep down I'm a good person. I just don't want to be responsible for a possibility of doing something bad when I was a kid to affect who I am today.
