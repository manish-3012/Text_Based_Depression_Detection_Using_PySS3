I'm going to do itToday I just feel so terrible. Like absolute shit. Maybe it's because my parents are emotionally abusive or because they're homophobic and I'm a 16 year old lesbian. I don't know. I just know that I'm tired of being in constant pain. I'm tired of it hurting to move, to breathe, to walk. I know I don't have it too terribly bad but I just can't deal with any of this anymore. I'm tired of the pain, the empty, the blackness. 
I feel so bad because right now my friends are blowing up my phone because they're so worried. And I feel bad. I know this is selfish. I know this will hurt them. But after a lifetime of thinking about what other people need, just this once I want to do what I need. I'm sorry. 
Words cannot describe the pain. 
I'm tired of everything. 
But most of all, I'm so, so, sorry. I didn't mean for any of this to end this way. At one point I had dreams, I had goals. I wanted to be an astrophysicist. But now I can't even get out of bed. 
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
