Iâ€™m 16 and I just want it all to end.I donâ€™t want to be here anymore I honestly donâ€™t even have a reason to continue. My family just assumes that I have a choice as to how Iâ€™m feeling and I just canâ€™t control it. I hate how I look I hate how I act I hate everything about me. I have no future. I effed up everything in my life, I canâ€™t pursue anything. I ruin everything I love my boyfriend heâ€™s a amazing but I just feel like no one would even care if I left I donâ€™t talk to anyone anymore. Iâ€™m just a waste of space.
