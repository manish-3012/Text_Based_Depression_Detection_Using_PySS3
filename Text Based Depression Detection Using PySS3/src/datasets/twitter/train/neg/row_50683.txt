Told my best friend I've had suicidal thoughts.It was kind of an accident - I didn't mean to do it. But the cat's out of the bag anyway. She asked me to be 100% honest, and asked me if I've only thought about it or if I've thought about actually doing it.

I ended up lying to her and saying that I haven't thought about doing it. I feel bad. I just didn't want her to worry even more.

She asked me to tell my therapist because I've never spoken about it before. I've been scared and I don't want to be hospitalised. I can also only afford three more therapy sessions so I don't know what's the point in coming forward with it at this point.

I feel like I might mention it at therapy today, but downplay it a bit. I don't think I'm a danger to myself currently. I'm not actively planning anything. I wouldn't do it to the people I love.

I'm just sad I worried my friend. I don't want to lie to her again about having talked about it in therapy without actually doing it.
