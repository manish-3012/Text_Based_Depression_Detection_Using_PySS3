Me, the biggest f up, ramblingI hate myself. I've actually fucked up my life. Shit was already hard and I made it harder about 4 years ago now when I self harmed and left scars on my face. Not cool looking scars, like really awful red scars that are still red. I obviously have so type of body dysmorphia. Along with that I'm anxious, depersonalized, depressed, stupid, lonely, suicidal and just all round fucked. I am not smart and wish I knew more about things. But I don't have any hobbies and weird interested. Not even in a weird nerdy way, just really strange interested for a 24 year old man. I'm also gay which I don't have a problem with. I've just been sick for a very long time and I'm sick of the dread I feel everyday. I might quit my job. I work at a health studio but can't handle the social interaction part of the job. I was very fortunate to get it as the owner saw something in me and had just moved back into the country after living abroad for a few years.

I just don't know how to be happy. It's really fucking awful and sad. I can't believe things have turned out this way for me. I'm sick of being angry and pissed off because I'm fearful and anxious. I'm a grade A fuck up who sure knows how to push people away. I would love to be able to go off grid in an RV, adopt a dog and just not have any worries and no one around me, expecting things from me.

I go through life everyday just fucking miserable, feeling like I can't relate to anyone. I'm honestly trying my fucking best but I also can't seem to get my shit together. Maybe for a month or two then everything goes to shit again. My mental health is very poor and it feels like more than just depression and anxiety. I'm gonna quit my job and just get some driving job. I did that as my last job and it was bearable. Every time I try to push myself though I just fall flat on my face.

I'm sick of being angry and bitter. I'm sick of feeling dread as soon as I wake up and not joy. How fucked. Probably some trauma in childhood but it was not even that bad. But probably fucked me a little bit. Honestly if any of you met me you would probably hate me due to the vibe I give off. I try very hard not to be passive but I just am. I want healthy relationships but most importantly I want to be mentally sound and healthy.

I wanna fucking die and tried hanging myself in my closet with a belt this week.

I'm not editing this and I know this will be a shit show to read but whatevs.

TLDR; I hate myself and want to die.
