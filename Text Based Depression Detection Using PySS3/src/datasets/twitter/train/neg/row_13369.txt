Alone againI thought I was over this shit when i moved out on my own away from my abusive family but it doesnâ€™t stop. I told my mother that they all treat me like i wont kill myself and she told me to go ahead. And when my other family members told her not to say that her only problem was that she faced backlash. I just got my first car ever and Iâ€™m thinking about driving it into a tree. 

Im only 20 and I keep trying to hold on to the idea that its gonna get better but when your life has been nothing but constant abuse its hard to keep that in mind.
