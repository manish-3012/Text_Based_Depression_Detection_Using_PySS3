I actually don't know what to do anymoreMy family found the cuts on my arm. They know they weren't an accident. They think it's cause of school but really I just want to die. I thought I was ready and I destroyed my finger by accident. I failed even at this. Even my family now wants me dead. I have never been this close to doing this. I'm in so much stress right now. They want me to change school. It's the only school with this class profile in whole country. I don't think I'll be alive tommorow.
