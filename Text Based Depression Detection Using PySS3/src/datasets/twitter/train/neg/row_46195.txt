What broke meWhen I first ODed and two days later I was in a bad place again. I texted my friend that I felt like I needed to be with someone cuz I felt like doing that day again. I didnâ€™t tell her abt the fact I ODed before. She told me to call an RA. Next day another friend came and yelled at me. Asking me why I triggered the other friend. I did not even know she knew I ODed and just wanted to be with someone. But he wouldnâ€™t take it. He has she panicked and was sad. He said the whole school knew about it anyways when I told him I didnâ€™t tell her about it. I was fucking there for them all the time when they needed me. But when I needed them once, I triggered them and I was the bad guy. I just needed someone to sit by me, nth more. Living with him next yr cuz it had already been planned. But the words he said to me still hurts my heart more than anything. Because I had considered him one of my most valued friends. And to say that to someone at their weakest point...heâ€™s just not for me. Writing this was so hard. Remembering it was so hard. He never apologised. I did.
