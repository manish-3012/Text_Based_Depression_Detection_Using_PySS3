i'm afraid i'm borderlineyou know what they say, "don't self diagnose" then wtf do i do? go get therapy? i don't want to tell my fucking parents, they will think i'm crazy. i guess i'll just wait until i turn 18 then i can get officially diagnosed. i don't want my dad to keep fucking wasting more money and time on getting me therapy. i know i probably am borderline. what do you expect out of a fucking idiot like me...
