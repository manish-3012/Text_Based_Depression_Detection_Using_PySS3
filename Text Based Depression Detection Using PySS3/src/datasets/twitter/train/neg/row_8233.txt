Thought I was going to die last night, and felt a sense of deep peace.I thought suicidal thoughts were gone.  But apparently I have just been doing a great job at pretending I can fix my life.  I have been self sabotaging my life for ages now. And I guess deep down I always knew I am the reason for it. Just me being lazy nothing else. 

Last night I thought I was about to die,  my body felt weird and even though I was trying to sleep I had a gut feeling I won't wake up.  I panicked but it took just a few seconds for me to start feeling relief.  I will be gone. It won't be my fault technically. I will pass away naturally and it will be he end of this chapter. Unfortunately that didn't happen. So here we are.  

I have one session left with the uni counsellor and I feel like she has ran out of patience for me. I can't keep putting this on friends, not like I have a lot. And my whole family is mentally gone at this point.  So I guess there's nowhere else to talk about this.
