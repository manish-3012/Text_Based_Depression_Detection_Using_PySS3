I don't think its reached this point, but i feel this is the only place I can talk.I've reached a state of self-perpetuating depression which is getting worse and worse every day. Today I finally broke down, and cried. I haven't cried in upwards of 2 years. I'm 15 and a sophomore, and not stupid, but am failing 2 classes. I get into a mood and I sleep, that's how I cope. Literally the only thing that sets me off is grades, which are shit. When I get depressed I avoid all forms of work which makes my grades get continue to get worse and worse, which in turn depresses me. I can't find the motivation to do work more than one day out of the week even though I want to fix this more than anything. My entire family is diagnosed with depression and no one will believe me, they pass it off as 'teenage hormones'. I don't know where to turn, like i said I am in no way looking to harm myself, even though I  have thought about it, I know I never will. Idk what i am looking for in this, i guess, i know its just a cry for help. JUST RESTATING NOT AT RISK OF SUICIDE.
