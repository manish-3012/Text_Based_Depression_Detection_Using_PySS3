Want to jump off a crossroads bridge by the end of the month...Everybody just makes fun of me because I'm a loner and it really doesn't help, whenever I try approaching someone to talk or try to be friends they just brush me off and call me a weirdo, some girl made fun of the way I walk/run even though I can't fix it on short term since I have back problems, I'm terrible at everything and don't see why bother improving because I know no matter what I do I will still get called names. 

I'm basically wasting all my day on my computer, I went to a party Saturday so I wasn't rude even though that was a bloody mistake because everybody kept joking about me and picking on me, I had to go home early and when I came home I swear I would have killed myself if I could.

I can't even cry anymore, and the only hobby I have (playing games) is starting to become a drag, my only friend is an online one and I feel like I drag him down and am just annoying him 

I don't even care about what happens if I die, I never accomplished anything of note and every time I get interested in something I realize I suck at it and don't know why I bother
