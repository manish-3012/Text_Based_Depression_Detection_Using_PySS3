i just got banned from r/pessimismmemes for 999 days because i'm too young and i "still have hope"lmao no i'd rather be dead than happy. i'd rather be dead than literally anything. i'm a lost case and the mod there thinks i might last 999 days.

also i'm 13, i dont violate the tos or anything this is just mod abuse ffs

im not trying to be mean to him but its kinda hypocritical because he makes half the posts there and i didnt break any rules, cmon man let me back
