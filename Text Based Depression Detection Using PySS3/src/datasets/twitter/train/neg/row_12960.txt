If I could die by clicking a button, I'd do it in a heartbeatRecently, the only thing I've been thinking about how unfortunate I am to not live in USA. Ease of access to pistols, shotguns and it's insanely common to be prescribed to some pills that you can OD on very easily.



None of that around here. No guns, extremely hard to get prescriptions. I've drawn a huge list of pros and cons about life and I'd just like a way out but unfortunately am not a man enough to do through a painful method. Wish I had some money, would definitely build an exit bag but can't do that without money. Wish I had a car, I'd drive into an empty wall/cliff. Nothing, just disappointment all around. 


Anybody ever think that if you could take your own life with just a click of a button, that a lot, a lot of people would do it?
