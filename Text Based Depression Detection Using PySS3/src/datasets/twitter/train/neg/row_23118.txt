Have you ever beenHave you ever been to the point where you know it's all really just bullshit? People say that if you kill yourself you're hurting others and yada yada. They say that because they think you make an impact in other people's lives. I don't do that. I'm a detriment to other people's lives. I hold others back from what they want to do. My old therapist said that I would really hurt the people closest to me, she had others who lost a loved one before and saw the pain. I really don't see that for me. I have a brother that I feel only says anything to me if my mom complains about my depression. And my mom has to try to fix me. I really feel like if I wasn't there, it would be better for the both of them
