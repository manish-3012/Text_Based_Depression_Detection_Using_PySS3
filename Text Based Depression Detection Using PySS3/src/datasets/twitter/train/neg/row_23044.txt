I hate myselfI hate everything about myself. I can not find one positive feature. Everything I have done anything right. Always fucking things up. I can not think of any reason for anyone, including myself, to want to be associated with me in any way. I have always had my fake smile up. But every happy thing i see, every happy couple, I die a liitle more. I just stay awake at night trying to think of reasons not to kill myself, and I cant. I just lay there hoping something will take my life since i dont have the courage. All i really want is someone to care. But that wont happen, so i have just accepted my life long lonliness as fact.
