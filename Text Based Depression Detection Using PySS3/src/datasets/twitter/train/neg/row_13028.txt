My journey to suicide is underwayI finally cleaned every single corner of my room yesterday and threw things out that I didnâ€™t want my family finding. Itâ€™s kind of surreal but I donâ€™t know what I expected. Step 1 to killing myself is done. Step 2 is to write my suicide poem/note (if I even do, Iâ€™m at the lowest Iâ€™ve ever been atm and i honestly donâ€™t think I can do it), step 3 is to get closure and kind of say goodbye to people whilst making them think theyâ€™ll see me the next day when in reality theyâ€™ll never see me again. Step 4 is to take a ton of pills, get high and drink, and slice my arms open from elbow to wrist. 

My journey to suicide is started and itâ€™ll soon end, along with everything else. Just a little longer and everything wonâ€™t matter anymore.... 

TL;DR: Iâ€™m almost ready to kill myself.
