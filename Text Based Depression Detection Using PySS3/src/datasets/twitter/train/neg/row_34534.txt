I honestly donâ€™t know if I can make it another day. My Mom passed and I lost everything with her.Iâ€™ve battled mental health issues &amp; self-harmed since I was 13. My Mom is the only one who made an effort to understand or try to help me. When she got sick, I dropped out of school to take care of her cause my Dad said she was a burden and my brother couldnâ€™t be bothered, despite him being the older sibling.

The things Iâ€™ve seen as her caregiver have given me PTSD. I still have nightmares, 3 years later. When she passed, I planned the whole funeral myself. I didnâ€™t get to heal because with my Mom went her income so it was up to me to find a more serious full time job than my last gig while getting back into school. But, I was diagnosed with bipolar last year and it became very hard for me to function in the work place so I had to leave my job. 

When my Mon passed, my two friends basically were nowhere to be found. I guess no one wants to be friends with the sad girl. My relationship was really supportive but recently my partner has been saying the same, that itâ€™s draining to be around me. I just hoped someone would be there but all Iâ€™ve got is me and itâ€™s so hard. I feel lonely and tired and defeated.

My Mom was so young. Her death, so cruel. She was my best friend in the world. She was the one I could always talk to and it sucks that Iâ€™m literally alone in the world without her. I go weeks without leaving my apartment if I can. I donâ€™t speak to anyone - no one to speak to. My family and I live 10 mins away from each other but no one has time for me. My calls get ignored. I feel like Iâ€™m struggling and itâ€™s obvious and no one cares to help. Or at least just extend a hug. It feels like Iâ€™m already dead, so why even bother?

Everything is pointless. I donâ€™t even enjoy just taking a walk in the park and being in the sun anymore. Iâ€™m scared to die but I know Iâ€™m not living. I have no one. No one to talk to, no one to call. It sucks being this alone.

I miss my Mom so much. I canâ€™t move on with my life, without her. Iâ€™m tired of feeling this way and I canâ€™t do it anymore.
