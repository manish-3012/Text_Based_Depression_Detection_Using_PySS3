I'm about ready to give up.Someone talk me off the edge.  I'm giving everything one more chance and here it is.  The only things keeping me above water right now are my two parrots.  Best friends are gone, one moved and I fucked up the other, and I keep screwing up everything I do.   couldn't even be successful in therapy.
