My brother killed himself and I am about to do the same thingThis is the short version of my story 
So I had an older brother. I had one. He was always depressed. He even tried to kill him self but he was stopped my parents. That happened about 2 years ago (I was 14, Iâ€™ve recently turned 16). One month later he somehow got my fathers gun, a shotgun. He then shot him self in the head. I rushed to his room and saw his exploded head. Since then Iâ€™ve never said a word and now im not able to speak anymore (im mute because of the trauma, its called selective mutism if you want to look it up.) and I am extremely depressed. Everytime I close my eyes I see the image of my dead brother with his head blown off. I have multiple panic attacks everyday. I donâ€™t want to talk to my friends or family(by â€žtalkâ€œ I mean communicate not literally talk.). I canâ€™t do this anymore. Im sitting with a knife next to me. I donâ€™t know if I should do it. 

Please help me
