I feel like I'm drowningFirst day of my new job and I absolutely fucking hated it.  Who knew bagging groceries was so stressful?  People stroll up with their carts full to the fucking brim of stuff, and then it all comes down to me and piles up.  I can't keep up with it.  They finish paying and then it takes me another 5 minutes just to get all of their shit bagged up.  And they look visibly annoyed.

Meanwhile on my days off I'm having to pack up and move.  I didn't want to fucking move.  I said no.  BUT WHO GIVES A FUCK WHAT I THINK?  Then there's pressure to get my license, which is stressing me out.  The thought of going out on the road for the first time makes me dry heave.  What if I mess up?  Just the thought of an embarrassing situation makes my heart start racing.  I don't want to do it.  But I have to.  I have no choice.

Oh, and of course my mom wants me to start going to college at some point in the next few months.  It's just too much.  I can't take it anymore.  Something needs to give right now or I don't know if I'll be able to hold out much longer.
