Date is set, mind is madeI've had enough of all this negativity that has infected me for as long as I remember. I can't take this anymore. I've hurt too many people close to me due to my mental instabilities. For years I put people through torment, through anguish, through pain. These are actual words and quotes. I get it, I'll never change. I've been a broken person since I was born. I'm selfish. I have trouble showing feelings. I can't give back for what has been given to me. I'm nothing. I just can't continue on with who I am. I completely lost all care in the world -- I am in so much crippling debt, I have an addiction to alcohol now, and facing a legal situation I don't want to care about anymore, or any of it for the matter, because I am planning to die, which is my greatest urge. It's all I think about now. Date has been set for Oct. 9. I really want to be in a place where nothing matters anymore. I'm done....I saw what I needed to see. This world is just not something I want to be in anymore.
