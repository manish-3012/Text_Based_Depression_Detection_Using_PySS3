I canâ€™t stand being in quarantineEvery day is getting tougher even with a mini routine and having people around. It feels like Iâ€™m a pest to everyone and nothing I do helps anyone. Itâ€™s driving me insane...

Fuck this isolation! I want my fucking life back, I want a chance to get a job and start moving forward again. I donâ€™t want to slip back into the darkest pit of my mind. I barely scrapped getting out alive before. Iâ€™ll die if I go back. 

Thereâ€™s no way I can keep this up till June or later.
