Am I Weak?Do you know the phrase: "Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem"? When you can't get a job in a dead-end town, that's a temporary problem, right? What about when you cut ties with your father because he'll never be satisfied with who you are? Maybe.

Maybe I need to vent. Maybe I need a way out. When I look at the pros and cons all I really have is a supportive grandmother and my girlfriend. They're probably the only reason I haven't committed suicide yet. I guess I am weak. All the other people with problems on this SR, what makes me so special, right? 

I hate it when I don't want any of these people to give up - random strangers or those close to me - but here I am wanting to give up. I know what its like to feel worthless, broke, alone, so why does life like throwing more shit at us? No one will care. No, that's just what I think. It's how I feel. I'm so tired of struggling. I just can't take it.
