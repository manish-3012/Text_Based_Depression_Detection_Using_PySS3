The BathtubI couldâ€™ve ended my life tonight... Iâ€™d been drinking a bit before and during dinner, and I decided to take a nice **hot** bath. I could feel the heat of the water in the tub and my blood boiling. I couldâ€™ve slit my wrists there and then and my life wouldâ€™ve been over. But I didnâ€™t... someone stopped me. One singular person popped into my head and stopped me from harming myself and ending my life. Letâ€™s call him â€œAâ€. Now â€œAâ€ has been a big part of my life and has recently decided not to be a part of it anymore, by choice... but for some reason heâ€™s the one who popped into my head and stopped me. I donâ€™t know why it was him considering the way things have been between he and I for the past 5 months, putting me through hell.  He doesnâ€™t even deserve to be the reason why I stopped.. but he is and I canâ€™t explain it... do I tell him even though he doesnâ€™t want to speak to me? If I should tell him how do I let him know? How do I get him to approach me?
