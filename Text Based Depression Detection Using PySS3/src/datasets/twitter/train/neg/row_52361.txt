I'm scared I'm gonna do it.I'm struggling so much right now. I've been experiencing manic episodes for a few years now and I truly believe those are what kept me alive. In those moments I was happy and lively and bubbly and well... manic. But now I'm stuck in a neverending depression and I can't find a reason to keep going. I got really sick earlier this week and realized there's not a single person I could call to take me to the doctor. I've been dwelling on that for days now. I have no one. No one to miss me. I'll be 26 this year. How did I let this happen to me. 

If my manic episodes have finally stopped and this is the real me I can't do this. No one deserves to have to live their life like this.
