I just wanted to live a happy lifeAll my life all I ever wanted was to be happy, I've my whole life suffered from a very young age with abusive parents and years of bullying. A year ago I got raped by my ex, he forced himself on me even though I told him that I didnt want to. I kept telling him to stop, I ended up kicking him off me..... I never reported him since he was the only person who I believed at that time cared about me but I was deluded and stupid. I have literal PTSD now and every day is hell, I can barely sleep and I keep waking up to panic attacks. Certain smells or just people with a similar hair style can trigger a panic attack, even people slightly touching me can make my entire body shiver. Sometimes during the night I can still feel his touch..... I want this to stop so badly I'm literally crying as I'm writing this.
