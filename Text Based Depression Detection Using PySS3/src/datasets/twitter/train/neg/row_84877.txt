One year and Iâ€™m still the same.One year ago today was my first suicide attempt, Iâ€™ll spare you the details but I only survived because I was â€œluckyâ€ enough that my friend knew basic first aid. Tonight I said goodbye to my friends and the woman that I love, I donâ€™t plan to make it to tomorrow. So this is just another goodbye, to the people of reddit, my second family.

So I guess this is goodbye.
