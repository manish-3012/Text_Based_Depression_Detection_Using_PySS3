Can't take the stress any longer!I'm 20 years old and have nothing to show for it. For starters, I've been recently discharged from the military, (only in for 8 months which is pathetic) and been having trouble with my depression a lot lately. Things are getting so bad where I will stay in bed all day, litteraly all fucking day! Not because I'm lazy but because I'm depressed, SEVERELY DEPRESSED! To add to my pathetic life I lost all my friends, money, and have no job and I've been out for 5 going on 6 months. The only thing I think about is suicide, not much else because thinking about anything else makes me feel worse about my sorry life. I don't have it in me to tell my mom or dad about my feelings because I feel like my father will turn to drugs again, and I alreday told myself if he ever did that I would put a gun in my mouth and end it all. I dont know what to do, I really dont. I hate talking to doctors about my feelings because I just dont like to. My life is slowly coming to an end and I've actually embraced it, because I have nothing to lose, litteraly not a damn thing. I dont know how to deal with anything anymore and I can't take living like this anymore, I just can't...
