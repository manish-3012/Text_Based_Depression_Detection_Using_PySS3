I have fully accepted that Iâ€™ll eventually kill myselfAlmost 22 with no real accomplishments. Nothing good is coming my way in the future either. Iâ€™m just living to breath air and nothing else. Itâ€™s all Iâ€™m capable of anyway. Sure, I can find happiness in frivolous things, but itâ€™s short term and it isnâ€™t enough to fulfil my life. Even when I am feeling good, I donâ€™t wish to end my life any less than when Iâ€™m sad. The type of happiness I experience only serves as a distraction from the realities of life instead of giving my life satisfaction. 

I donâ€™t know when Iâ€™ll do it, but I have fully accepted that I will commit suicide someday. Itâ€™s a matter of when, not if. Hopefully I can find the motivation to go through with it soon because frankly, Iâ€™m done.
