Wondering if anyone else can relate to feeling this way.I want to start by saying I would not technically consider myself suicidal, and I am not really looking for support.  I am more curious to see if anyone else feels the same way that I do, if other people would label me suicidal, or just what other people think in general.  I apologize if this is not the correct sub to be posting in.

I am in my late 20's and I have always had a strange sense of comfort knowing that I would eventually commit suicide, and that I didn't have to stress too much about what is happening today.  Every time I've hit a rough spot in life, my thought process has always been, "Is this it, or am I strong enough to get over this one?" and the answer has always been that I am strong enough to carry on.  

I've never had any explicit plans of killing myself, nor have I ever come close to making an attempt.  I just take some kind of morbid solace in knowing that if it ever gets bad enough, I will just check out.

This has not effected how I make my day to day decisions.  I still take care of myself, act responsibly and try to save for retirement. I don't run around thinking I have a get out of jail free card.  I just don't worry about the fact that I don't have one.

The biggest reason I don't do it, is because I wouldn't want to hurt my family.  I am an atheist, so I don't have any religious trepidations about going to hell or anything.

As I said at the top, I don't feel like I need any help, really. I am just interested to see what other people's thoughts are.
