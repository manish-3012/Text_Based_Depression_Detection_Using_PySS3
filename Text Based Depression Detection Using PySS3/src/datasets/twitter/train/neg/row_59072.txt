30Iâ€™m an autistic 26 year old, who pretty much canâ€™t find a good reason not to end it.  I canâ€™t think of a single good thing that has ever happened to me (made a post about this on another sub a few weeks ago).  Ranging from constant bullying, little to no friends, to still living with my fucking parents while both of my younger siblings have moved on. Iâ€™ve been telling myself for a while that if nothing good happens by the time I hit 30, then that will be the end.
