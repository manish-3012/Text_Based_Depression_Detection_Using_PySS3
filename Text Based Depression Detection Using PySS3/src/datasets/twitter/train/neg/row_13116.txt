I canâ€™t be asked to keep living. Iâ€™m ending my life tomorrowIdk y Iâ€™m posting on here but I guess itâ€™s because I have no one  to talk to. I hate myself and am a burden to others. Nothing I do will make me happy and I am miserable. My parents and friends donâ€™t care about me anymore after I told them about cutting and we have almost daily arguments.

I hate everything that I have done and my good-intentioned actions will only lead to me feeling worse. So why not die young and save everyone the hassle of ever wasting their time with me?
