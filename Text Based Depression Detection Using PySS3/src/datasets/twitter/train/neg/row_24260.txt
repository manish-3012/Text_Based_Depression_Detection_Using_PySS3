I canâ€™t take it anymoreI feel so useless. Iâ€™m 13 years old and have been so depressed lately, I havenâ€™t seen my mom in what seems like forever and Iâ€™ve just been mad at the world lately. I feel like I canâ€™t do anything right and life seems pointless, the only thing that really helps me get away from everything is basketball. But of course I am in a slump right now which only makes me more mad. I just donâ€™t know what to do and hate everything and everyone
