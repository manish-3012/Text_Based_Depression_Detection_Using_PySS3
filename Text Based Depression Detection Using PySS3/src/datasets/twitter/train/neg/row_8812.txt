I'll never get myself out of this.I'm a lazy sack of shit who won't fix his life, ever. I simply lack any discipline or drive to do so, and whatever good things I'll half-assedly worm myself into happening to me won't be deserved - I'm simply incapable of trying my best. I can't even take my fucking meds consistently or try and get therapy because it's all too bothersome for me; I want to live better yet I don't want to fucking try to live better. Worst part is, I'm too much of a coward to even go and do the deed - I'm dooming myself to a life of incredible mediocrity where I'll simply rot away without accomplishing a thing. About the only thing I'm good at is English language (I'm Russian), but that is something that I've learned when I still had the drive to accomplish things, to get better, something that is long gone. I'm honestly so incredibly pathetic that I don't even deserve suicide, many people have better, more understandable, and more grave reasons to do it, not just disgusting, apathetic mediocrity.
