He's going to give upMy best friend is suicidal.
The only reason he is here today is me. I am literally the only thing keeping him in this world, and that is only because he knows it would absolutely destroy me if he went.

I don't feel good about posting here, because I don't want to betray his trust, but I am going to fucking fall apart if I don't talk about it or get some help. I'm the only one to help him, but I'm nearly as fucked up as he is. I am not as hopeless as he is, nor do I feel like I'm in imminent danger right now. But I am incredibly, incredibly depressed and have spent a few hours the past few days seriously contemplating whether I want to live.

I convinced him to see a therapist, but he says he's tried and they don't work. I suggested he needs to try medication, because he has chemical issues that have been diagnosed. He doesn't want to do that because he doesn't want to change. He has no support from anyone except me.
The scariest part is when he tells me he doesn't even care. He doesn't want to try, he doesn't have any interest in getting better. He doesn't want it to. He's only not dead because he knows he would send me over the edge. He's also obliquely said that when I get better and can do without his help he'll go.

I have no idea what to say to him. He comes to me to talk and says these things that terrify me and I don't know what to do. I want to help him so much, I want to make his pain go away but I don't see where to even begin. All I can do is sit there and try to argue, but he just cycles between "I can't" "It won't get better, it never does" and "I don't even want to." And the hopelessness of his situation is dragging me further and further down into the pit, I can't do this alone anymore. Please help, Reddit
