Probably not suicidal, but finding life hard to liveHi everyone.
So I'm 24 and while I may not deem myself suicidal, I am having trouble finding reasons to live.
I'm probably upset over superficial bullshit, while others posting in this subreddit have actually been through horrors that I can't imagine living through. I really just need a little advice.
I'm from an upper-middle class background, stable home environment, etc, etc, no abuse or trauma to speak of.
I consider myself not worth knowing, even though my girlfriend thinks I'm amazing and tells me her friends are impressed with me.
I feel like I couldn't possibly be more socially-awkward. I just don't know how to converse with new people, establish common ground and keep a conversation going. Even with friends I've known for years, conversation is full of awkward pauses.
I hate sport, don't follow politics, don't pay attention to much of pop culture or celebrities.
I've been at my current job for more than a year and I'm stuck in a position of paying rent to keep the job and keeping the job to pay rent, with little left over for necessities.
I haven't made any friends at work in this time.
I graduated with a compsci degree and I've been working since I was 21, but I now sit at my desk passionless, without motivation, wanting to get the fuck out of there.
I've always been into computers, even from a very early age. This lead to me studying compsci once I left school.
Writing software is the only thing I know how to do well, but I have lost any passion I once had for my career and hobby.
I feel like if I just found a way to regain my passion, gained a little self-confidence and learned some social skills, I could improve my life, but I don't know how to do any of these things.
Thanks for reading. Sorry for being a giant pussy who is simply lost and not about to throw himself under a bus.
