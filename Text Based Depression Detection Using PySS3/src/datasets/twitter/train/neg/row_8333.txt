I'm tired.. And I want everything to end.Just like turning a device off and unplugging it forever.
Everything is fucked up. And I can't even write a few sentences right now. I've been staring at the screen for a few minutes unable to write a single sentence about what's going inside my brain. I feel hopeless. I feel I'm worthless. I need to talk but I can't. And that's fucking stupid. Lots of mixed feelings. I'm planning how I'm gonna kill myself and when I'll do it. I don't know. I just felt the need to talk here with someone, anyone but even in doing that I failed and wasn't even able to write something. I'm not feeling good.
