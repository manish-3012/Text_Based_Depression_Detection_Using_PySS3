How much is too much? I feel like I am at the point where I find out.Between the surgeries, losing my dad, the constant pain, the diabetes, work and bills 
I just don't know how much more I can take. I do not have anyone close to me to go out and hang out with and talk. My wife has depression as well so if I unload all this on her it is not fair to her.
I almost did it last night, thought about just taking the whole vial of insulin and just going to sleep. Thought of taking the full bottle of muscle relaxers as well, may as well have some fun in the way out, but the grand kid woke up and I chickened out. 

They say the ones who don't reach out are the ones who wind up dead, but they also say the ones who do are the ones who are just looking for attention. So I don't know maybe I am just attention seeking but I want to see my grand kid grow up but I don't think I can take much more.
