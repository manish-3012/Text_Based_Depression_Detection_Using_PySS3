breakup? family guilt?the person who i thought was absolutely perfect for me just broke up with me yesterday. it came absolutely out of the blue, and they said it for reasons that i didn't know were problems/reasons they've never brought up before. i know the advice is generally "get back out there! plenty of fish in the sea", but i'm so fucking ugly and antisocial that i felt like this was really my one chance at being in a happy relationship. i became pretty codependent for the time that we were together, since they were basically the only thing in my life that made my depression abate for periods of time

i feel like i'd be putting a gun to my head right now and pulling the trigger if i didn't have family members that would be sad. does anyone else feel the same way? i want so badly just to be done with all of it but i imagine my siblings and parents reactions and i just know i'll never be able to do it
