Everything is Falling Apart I originally posted this to r/depression

I am a 22 year old male, and I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I always felt a bit out of touch mentally with everything which could be to do with my autism that I was never told about, which I found out through some lost files after both of my parents died. On my 19th birthday my mum was rushed to hospital because of a brain haemorrhage which was totally out of the blue, and then she was quickly diagnosed with stage 3 brain cancer. I was always close to my mum as my parents were separated all my life, I loved her more than anything in the world and we would spend so much time together so this crushed me. She then passed away on Christmas day after spending the whole of new years till Christmas morning in the hospital. My mum had found a partner previous which she married when I was 17, making this partner my step-dad. I have two younger brothers and we were left with nothing in the will. We didn't even get a will hearing. My mum had won a lot of money previous which went straight towards a big house and then there were a lot of savings, she would have done anything she could for me and my brothers cause she was an amazing person.

This step-dad then became extremely manipulative and emotionally abusive towards my middle brother and alienated him from me and my youngest. I was working full time during this period also. Once my younger brother left (Half kicked out/half could not cope being in the house with step-dad) after his whole room being destroyed by step-dad over supposed lying, all the abuse came on to me and I couldn't see it at the time as he was the only adult figure I had in my life. He drank excessively, destroyed cars through drunk driving that my mum had paid for, told me there was no money left despite him constantly buying designer clothes, making me cook the same meals every night after work, belittled me and calling me pathetic and stupid. It was every single day I was being ground down and I hadn't grieved over the loss of my mum. I then ended up in a positive relationship with who is now my ex, who helped me to get out the house understand the manipulation i was put through etc.

To cut this short, I was not allowed to come back into the house for bullshit reasons such as it's him living his own life. Me and my brothers have not seen any inheritance or support whatsoever. I broke up with my girlfriend because I thought it was the right thing to do for my mental state but even if I wanted to get back with her things would be a mess and I would have totally lost the respect of her family and it is also incredibly difficult to even move to another flat cause of fucking money and paperwork. I also have university now but I can't even finish my year cause of this virus, and it requires me to work with other people for my last modules which is impossible to do according to the brief. I've had a package thrown at me by step-dad's new fucking wife who the police is now involved with and I havent got any response back from any solicitor saying that this case with contesting the will is just a mess.

I've lost hope in humanity, this world, the law, and education which i was enjoying right until the outbreak. Police are murdering people in America, police can't fucking do anything in the UK that's positive. The government are full of hypocrites, and there is no support whatsoever in my situation. Not to mention that I have not stopped working despite this outbreak cause I'm a supposed key worker, I still can't afford to even feed myself cause it's minimum wage. This clapping bullshit is absolutely pathetic. So basically this outbreak has not changed anything for me in terms of work, and uni. There's absolutely nothing I can do, cause having money is what this world measures success as.

Society and this planet is a fucking joke, and my life has been one cruel fucking game. I'm done with living and getting kicked by fucking everyone

Each day since the post I can't stop thinking about my ex. Guys flirt with her constantly and it just eats me away inside. I've talked to her about it and I've left voice messages telling her how much I love her. I even went on a suicide hotline and the signal was too awful for my to hear the person.

I've written my suicide notes today.

I feel like nobody will ever love me unconditionally
