I posted the same post earlier, but nobody saw it. So here it is again: Iâ€™m in my early teens, and my biggest fear is telling people that I am having suicidal thoughts.I'm in my early teens, and my biggest fear is telling people that I have suicidal thoughts.

Because I'm afraid they'll just say that "I'm just going through a phase" and that "I'll get over it and move". 

I don't want the people closest to me, the people that I can trust, to just tell me that I'm going through a phase, and I'll grow out of it. I don't want to feel even worse.
