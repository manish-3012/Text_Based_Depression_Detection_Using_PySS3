I'm just... Tired of trying...I don't know if I can hold on anymore. I feel like my entire world is slowly crumbling beneath my feet and I can't make it stop. It's starting to feel like there isn't any hope anymore and like nothing is ever going to change. What's the point in working myself to pieces if I'm never going to get anywhere? Life would be so much easier if I could just disappear and start over... 
I'm tired of failing, tired of never being good enough, tired of clinging to hopes that always fall through. 
I lay here in bed with piles of unfinished homework, a car that's falling apart, no money, a job I can barely handle, sick for the third time this year already... I just don't see a reason to keep going anymore...
