Holy Fuck I'm Sick And Tired Of This ShitI'm beyond caring, I hate the world we live in anyways.

\- Tired of being a fucking wreck, PTSD, Depression, Anxiety, full works brought to you by bullying and child abuse!

\- Sick of never getting what I want, ever. I'm fucking serious, it's like always being hungry and seeing other people eat full plates but all my food is in a glass box.

\- Done with being a failure. Yeah thanks for all the mental illness, even though I ran myself into the ground working in high school I still failed. That's depression for ya.

\- I CAN'T STAND the loneliness anymore.

\- Oh and I'm pretty ugly too, so fuck that

Dad hid some vodka but I know where it is. Imma go have some maybe, I know we have Tylenol and hopefully NyQuil (probably not), but hey it may still kill me. Either that or I'm gonna just get drunk. Later gators!
