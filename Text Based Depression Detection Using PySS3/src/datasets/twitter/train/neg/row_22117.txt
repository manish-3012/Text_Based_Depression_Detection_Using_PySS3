[Long] I don't see what else I can do besides dyingHi, I would really love to lay this all out as short as possible but it is still going to be a bit long. I am very serious about and capable of ending my life. I think this will be my last time I talk about it. I am male, 22, Canada.

**Backstory**

I am realizing now that I have been depressed most of my life. Shy and anxious in kindergarten, all of elementary school no friends and spent every single recess hiding in the corner of a doorway alone, high school was a shock and I drank a lot and nearly failed, ran away from home, parents divorced, hospitalized, took psychedelic drugs, attempted suicide. Then I went to a rural college for a dumb program, I was very isolated and wasted two years, in so much pain, so alone, very bullied, so ashamed. Worst two years of my life, it honestly felt like 10 years in prison. Then I traveled far away and I went to a transfer school to finish the degree. It was finally an opportunity to start fresh and I had an exciting and decent time. I spent 2-3 years totally on my own, supporting myself, never seeing family except Christmas, I tried so many new things and I was kind of happy (Off of the excitement of life adventure, but still had the same issues), I made two acquaintances. Then I got a new job which was exciting but my schedule was insane, weeks straight of 12 hour days in remote locations, inconsistent schedule, my two friendships rapidly fell apart. I was working with a really non-physically abusive awful insane man who totally ruined my mental health, alongside the lack of a support network and isolation and lack of sleep, overwork etc. Getting suicidal again for the first time since moving to this new place (2 years) Then I took shrooms for the 2nd time in my life and had a really bad trip that made things much worse. Then work ran out and I was VERY suicidal and I have guns for hunting.

**Recent events**

I called up my dad and oldest sister and told them everything about how bad I was doing (Except for the suicidal thoughts), I drove 4000km to get home (End of November 2018). My whole family is amazing, very caring and supportive and I love them. This is the first time I have spoken to them about what goes on in my head since seven years, and even before I only spoke minimally because I had to because I was hospitalized. When I got home, I was really depressed to be unemployed and to have left a place I love and acquaintances behind. Only to be back to my childhood home that I hate with a passion. Here I have my moms house in an urban town and my dads house in the same urban town and then my dads cabin up north. I hate the urban town so much (Bad memories/I love the outdoors), I went to live in the rural town alone. I tried finding a job but the economy sucks and reliant on tourism, it is winter and no one hiring. Mental health getting so bad and again I am alone with my guns. Again, I call my oldest sister and we decide it's a good idea to go to town with family. My oldest sister is really mature and wise and so helpful (I have 2 older sisters, no brothers). So I live one week at each parents house. Again I am getting worse and worse and worse. I tried an antidepressant for four days that my doctor prescribed. It REALLY fucked me up, I could not sleep, eat, do anything, no energy, I got tinninitus and hypnagogia. Before these drugs, I was (and still am now) pretty productive and can get a lot done. My doctor told me to stop the meds. Then I signed up for a mental health program at local hospital, finally got in. It is 6 weeks, 4 hours per weekday, all voluntary, they teach CBT/DBT etc, it's been pretty helpful, I just finished week 3 today, I try and I participate a lot.

**Choices about the future**

There is a college program I was very excited for that I applied to and was accepted to, it's only 1 year and then another 1 year program that adds on to it if I want, but the college is 2500km away. I was very excited about it at first but now I am depressed and unfortunately have lost most of the excitement, though I still think it's a great program. At the end of the day though, I have 3 weeks left and I have applied to a few jobs but still don't have one lined up. I need to get a job between March and September to save up money for school and also to get out of my parents houses before I lose my mind.

**The issues**

The same problems that have plagued me throughout my life, are still there. I hate who I am, I feel I am so uniquely selfish, so weighed down with guilt. I have been learning about myself in the last few months and I have learned how I am not evil, I have learned how incorrect my thoughts are etc. At the end of the day though, I don't really ever change my thoughts, I know I am incorrect and insane, but I still want to hate myself, I want to feel bad and I still feel so guilty. I feel like these issues aren't even the problem now, I just genuinely don't give a shit about living and just want to die. The program is coming to an end, and if all of this work still can't help me, then fuck I really am screwed then. I had 4 therapy sessions and the therapist is VERY helpful (I have tried maybe about 6 therapists and this is the first one that is actually helpful) but he costs $220/hour and I am unemployed and cannot afford it. I believe that if I could see this therapist for 4 hours a day for half a year, then yes I could be cured because I am so mentally engrained in my fucked-up-ness that that is what it would take. In reality, all I can do is 3 more weeks of group therapy and maybe 1 or 2 more therapy sessions that I can't afford, so I am really not going anywhere to improving. I just want to stop living off my parents and get a job in that northern town cabin and then go to school and be happy and live forever after. But I can barely apply for or hold jobs the way I feel, I am not caring about the college program now, my life is not safe.

On top of everything, I can't handle being alone, but I also feel like I can't stand being around my parents, I am constantly judging them, yet I can't get by without being around other people. I am finding life is pointless, I am greatly pessimistic about my future, I think the career choice is unwise, I think I will never be a good person or be happy or have friends or success. I have no drive to live anymore, the pressure to move out and get a job is building every day as this program comes to a close. I still don't have a job lined up and even if I did, my mental health is still fucked and I can't fix it myself and no one can fix it for me. Even if I get a job up north, if I was mentally healthy it would be awesome and I would love it and would enjoy the outdoors, but I am not healthy and I think I would have way too much alone time in the woods with my shotgun and it's very likely I would die. If I work in town I will be so miserable because I fucking despise this place and have no desire to assimilate here.

I am very unstable and really not safe (Even though my firearms are 3 hours away up north). Today I drove to the gun shop because I wanted to just buy a $400 shotgun and blow my head off, I cooled down enough by the time I arrived that I decided to wait until next weekend instead. I am visiting up north next weekend with family and can bring my shotgun back with me instead of buying a new one, that gives me 10 days to finalize my decision, though I feel I am no longer on the fence and am pretty much committed to doing it now.

I don't see another way to fix this and I don't see a life I want to live. I have tried working, I have tried taking a break to heal, I have tried natural remedies like eating healthy, exercise etc and I have tried pharmaceutical drugs. I have no interest in more pharmaceutical drugs as they are really damaging. I have not killed myself for years and years by just chasing goals and thinking if I just finish school, just get the job, just do this or that then maybe I can make a friend and settle down and be happy but nope. And I still won't be able to settle down for at least 3-4 more years if not more. I am done emptily chasing goals, I want friends so badly but can't when I am moving all the time between rural towns across the country and when I am so mentally unhealthy and can't connect to others because of self hatred.

**What living would likely look like**

At this point, I think it would require cancelling college, wasting many years of life, telling my family, having my firearms removed and sold, being stuck in this shitty town, being constantly supervised and worried about, costing my family tons of money and hurt and stress, sacrificing my brain on the altar of big pharma experimenting with many drugs having me addicted and ruining my brain and health for life and STILL not feeling better but just being so forced to live that I will have to yet again pretend to be okay for the sake of others just like I did in my first suicidal crisis when I was 15. So what is the point of all that, I genuinely think that suicide is the most logical option and I don't even really have 3 weeks to do it, I have more like 1-2 weeks. I really really don't want to hurt my family, it would completely destroy their lives forever, but what choice do I have between A. Die and so do all of my problems or B. Live in shameful misery as a disappointing major stress and drain on my family that has to fake being happy like before

**Conclusion**

If you read all this, I seriously really appreciate it. I know there isn't much you can say. I respectfully request to please spare me anything that isn't something I can actually tangibly do to get better. Please don't mention the following: therapy (Can't afford), telling authority (Locked up in a hospital and it makes life worse), drugs (months of experimenting with fucked up drugs that ruin your brain, I don't even have months to play with different drugs), suicide hotlines (all they can do is call the cops and don't help much), telling my family (Doing this would eliminate suicide as an option and force me to live in misery, I will not allow the option of death to be taken away), platitudes, empty vague unspecific non-help. Also, I am not worried about messing up the suicide, I have done the research on how to not screw up and shotgun through the mouth is like 99% successful. One other thing to note, I have no one to lend my firearms to, also I don't want to sell them as I like them for hunting and people would be very suspicious and wonder why I don't have them anymore when they know I love hunting/target practice. I actually really love a lot of things about life/the world/other people, but I cannot experience the world the way I am

**Note about drugs:**

About drugs, I have never tried marijuanna and I don't believe it will help. Yes taking psychedelic drugs can be (and was in my case) harmful, I know that, it was dumb. I don't want a debate about antidepressants, yes they work for people. The "chemical imbalance" theory has been overly proven to be bullshit and yet we trust doctors who promote this mindless narrative. They don't cure you, it just "helps" at the cost of very significant side effects (in my case were very serious), issues for life with the side effects, huge amounts of people can never sleep, fuck, or think the same again and suffer major dependence issues where the drugs have created a chemical imbalance rather than solve an "imbalance". So I would rather be dead than taking these fucking bullshit drugs that will be just used against me if I am ever found out

**Thank you very much!**
