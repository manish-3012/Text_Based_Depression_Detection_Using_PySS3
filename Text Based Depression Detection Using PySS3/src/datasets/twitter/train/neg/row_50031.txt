If I kill myself, my narcissistic family will use the "tragedy" as a way to garner attention for themselves.My mother will post things on social media like articles concerning suicide and then say stuff insufferable things like "Take it from me..."

My siblings will as well. I can see my brother holding assemblies and using my suicide as a way to promote his own agenda. That disgusts me.


Cheesy shit like that. I'd rather just had never been born than used as a way for my family to propagate attention for themselves.
