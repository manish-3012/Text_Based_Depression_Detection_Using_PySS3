Have anyone elseâ€™s suicidal thoughts gotta worse after an attempt ?I had 2 failed suicidal attempts about 2 months ago and every since then I been thinking about it a lot more now, like now that I know I can do it maybe I can be able to finally end my life. Did anyone else have this happen to them?
