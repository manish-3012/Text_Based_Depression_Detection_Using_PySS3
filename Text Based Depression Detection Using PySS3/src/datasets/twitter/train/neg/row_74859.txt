Itâ€™s always on my mindThe thought of wanting to die is always in the back of my mind. I ended up lying to a text crisis counselor that I felt better. In reality, I was texting the counselor for an hour when she said â€œweâ€™ve been talking for a while now, do you feel better?â€ She probably was just trying to ask how I was, but I still felt really bad about it. I felt like I rambled on for too much and she just wanted to stop talking to me. She did tell me some things that helped me clear my mind at the time, but the thoughts came back today.

I really wish I was dead. Iâ€™m scared of harming my self or attempting suicide though. All suicide methods seem really painful, and to be honest they really scare me. I just donâ€™t want to be alive anymore. The world has no place for me at all. I feel like Iâ€™m suffocating in my mind. Iâ€™m not sure how much longer I can take this. It has been 4 years now and I still feel depressed and suicidal. Iâ€™m not sure what to do anymore. Even when I try to do things to distract me like school work, video games, or watching youtube videos the thoughts keep on coming back. I am also into my first year of college and I canâ€™t talk to anyone. I am a complete social fuck up. I donâ€™t want to join clubs either, nothing really interests me anymore. I only play video games to pass the time, and even then they donâ€™t feel as fun as they used to be. I just want to die. Life hasnâ€™t even started yet and I have almost lost all of my ambition to reach my goals of raising a family and getting a good career. I hate myself with every fiber of my being, so thereâ€™s no way in hell I could get a girlfriend let alone a wife to have kids with. 

I feel so lost. Thereâ€™s so many others going through much worse situations than me yet I still feel depressed and suicidal. I donâ€™t deserve to feel this way at all compared to what others have been through in life. Iâ€™m just a spoiled piece of shit.
