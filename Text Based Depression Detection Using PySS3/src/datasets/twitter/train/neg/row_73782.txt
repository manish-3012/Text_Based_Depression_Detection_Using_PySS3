Even the people I love had enough of meBeen struggling w depression for a long time... this week my mom told me she had enough of my breakdowns. My boyfriend told me he needed a break... and friends say theyâ€™re â€œhere for meâ€ but theyâ€™re really not. I just want to disappear. Living is so much work and Iâ€™m exhausted.
