I've advanced to the highest level I can. I'm no longer happy and am ready to kill myself. I've gone as far as I can in life and what frustrates me is there is no way of achieving anything more than I have now. I really don't have that much anyway. I'll never be able to afford but the bare basics in life and sometimes not even that. I see all these things I want to do experience and all these people I want to hang out with but I can't because I have to work so hard just to have a place to live and a way to get to work. I saw all my friends get married and have families and I know that's something I could never have now. I think about all these ways of getting past it but I'm just reminded of all the doors slammed in my face. I'm constantly reminded of how all reasons of why I can't go back to school or what I couldn't join the military. 

What I have now is not satisfying. I have no one left alive to share life with anyway. Everyone I cared about is dead. I feel like I was left here a lone with no where to go and nothing to do. 

The only thing I can be proud of is the fact that I tried. I reached out for help too. It's not like I just sat here and let all this happen. There's just no way to move forward in life. Even the professionals I asked for help from failed in their attempt to help me move froward in life. 

Since I can't achieve anything more than going to work and going to bed, I'm going to kill myself. I just wanted to leave this up on the screen of this computer at work so someone will know why I didn't come back after lunch.
