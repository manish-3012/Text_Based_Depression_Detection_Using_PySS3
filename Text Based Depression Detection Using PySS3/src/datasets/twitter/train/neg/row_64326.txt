Why can't I do this?I don't know where to begin...

I feel like I've been stumbling through life since I was a child. I've never really done anything, other than read the occasional book or play a few video games. I've never been able to really focus and complete any of the MANY projects I've started over the years. I get excited with an idea, filled with passion, and then it never goes anywhere.

Friendships and relationships just don't seem to work. I've screwed up with every group of friends I've ever had, and not in some momentous crazy way; they just didn't like me. Every time I would come to a place where I realized this and then I just felt terrible about it. About myself and about the fact that it seems like I just don't have the ability to be a normal human being.

I've smoked pot and that quickly became a vice, although now that I'm out of money the habit has died quickly. My family is angry at me for screwing up, doing poorly in school and just plain doing nothing with my life.

I'm 21 and I've done literally nothing. Why can't I do this? I don't really have any answers...

Today was the first time I really thought about it. I just... I dunno. It's never been an option before but then I thought, if this is gunna be the rest of my life... do I really want that?
