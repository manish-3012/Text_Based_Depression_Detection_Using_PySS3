Psychiatrist Told Me My Suicidal Breakdown Was A TantrumSo I had an appointment with my psychiatrist today and told her that I had a huge break down last Saturday which lead to a lot of suicidal thoughts and very nearly many attempts. In turn, she told me that my 'breakdown' was really a 'tantrum to get attention' and that I sound 'spoilt' and 'am clearly unappreciative' of my family having to deal with my mental illness. Now all I can think about is clearly I don't deserve any kind of help, I'm just overdramatic, I'm not sick, and I'm a huge problem for everybody around me. Aren't these people supposed to help?
