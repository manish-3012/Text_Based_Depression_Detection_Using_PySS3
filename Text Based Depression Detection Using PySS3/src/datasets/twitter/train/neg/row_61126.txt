I'm probably gonna step out of my house in less than a week.I''m 16 and at the end of my rope. I obliterated the heart of the only girl who's ever loved me. And I'm at the point where I don't care about people worrying about me. Everytime I try and think that it'll be better, it gets fucking worse. I'm gonna start thinking about what shit to pack, print out my map and step out. I'm fucking through.
