Stronger and more talented people have committed suicide.I have been battling suicidal wishes for about a little more than 10 years. Depression and anxiety, for as long as I know myself as a person (29 and soon 30).

During this time, I have seen strong and talented people commit suicide. From famous artists to my own father. If these people eventually found as conclusion that they should end their life, I wonder what are the chances of me surviving this. I think it's likely that I will get to that point too. Have gotten pretty close many times, and the way I'm planning to do it, there is zero chance of surviving anyway.

I had heard that suicidal thoughts were stronger while close to personal tragedies and on people starting antidepressants and on young people. I've gone through those phases, and it's just gotten worse. My fears about failing in life have actually become true. My family is shorter and shorter, my friends are gone, I live in  complete solitude in an empty apartment, filled with filth that I don't have the will power to clean, I eat barely nothing, sleep terribly, hate my job (where I am abused everyday), and think about suicide every five minutes of my waking hours. It is a nightmare scenario that I predicted years ago.

I know that there are people like me out there. It would be nice to meet them, I guess. It would also suck. Life is obviously full of happy and sad moments, but something went wrong for us. I think in previous times we would be dead very soon, and now we are blessed to live this torture over and over while receiving here and there some glances of how life was supposed to be like. But those glances are teases, they don't last long, and it's always a question of: is life worth living for those tiny moments?
