I was hopeful but now I'm sure I'm going to kill myselfHi I'm 15 F freshmen in high school
I've been wanting to end my life since I was 8 years old because of continuous bullying which lasted till I was 11 
After that the suicidal thoughts never left but I developed more mental health issues like an eating disorder and social anxiety (the bullying also plays a part there)
Wanting to kys so much is pretty bad itself all the pressure that comes with highschool to keep my grades up just worsens all my conditions 
I joined a new school for highschool and everyone is a dick to me here I am mocked all the time and it really isn't helping with my mental illness
I have never told any of my friends and I'm really at the lowest point ever. I'm afraid I might actually kms if I don't do anything. I have my ex who I want to get back together with and I feel he is the best person to open upto if anyone but I'm scared he will leave me because of all this baggage please help me I don't want to die
