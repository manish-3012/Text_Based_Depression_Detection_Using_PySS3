Reposting this for the second time due to ir getting fucking removedOver the last couple of months I've noticed how little friends/people around me to talk to I have. Back in like 2015-2017 I used to have a shit ton of fucking friends that found me hella funny and shit but over the last couple of years I feel like I've became way more immature and unfunny of a person and most of my old friends left me and my parents don't really seem to fucking give to much of a shit about me either. I don't really have anyone that I think I could lean on or talk about me problems and shit that cares about me enough to do so bedsides maybe like 1 person who lives hella far away. Im just kinda sitting here browsing Reddit and shit for like 12 hours a day with literally no one to talk to. I open up like Discord maybe once a day but there's only like 2 servers on there (one is hella inactive and one is just one for me to send myself stuff, i either left or got banned from most of the other ones). Even all the edgi girls at school and shit got people to talk to about their shit and laugh about at the end. I don't really blame most of my friends leaving me, I'm just fucking cracking unfunny joke after unfunny joke and it's really fucking cringey. Back in the day people used to see me as one of those epix clever funny people like Pyrocynical or whatever the fuck online and irl but now people just see me as a hella cringey unfunny cunt this format was hella shitty. I know this post fucking atrocious but I'm a horrible explainer and I didn't want to write like 10 paragraphs and I wasn't really in the mood for doing it but i felt i needed to do it eventually.
