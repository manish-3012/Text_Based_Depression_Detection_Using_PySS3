Is it possible to be sad over nothing?For the past couple of days, I've been feeling sad lately. Sad to the point of thinking that suicide is literally the best option. I keep depreciating myself over nothing. I keep thinking of problems that aren't there. Today, I have cried more than once throughout a year. Whenever people ask me what my problems are, I just can't explain it. 'Cause there is no problem, I just wish that it would be somehow easier to explain it to someone.
