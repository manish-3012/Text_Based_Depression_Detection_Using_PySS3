If I Tell Her, Will She Think I'm Pathetic?There's one woman I love, shes my best friend, she doesn't romantically love me back, and that's fine, we are still really good friends. But I want to tell her how I feel, what I have planned, just because in this cold mean world, shes the only one I feel I can trust.

She lives up in Canada, I live in the western part if the U.S., think of her as that cool kick ass rocker girl in high school, she has the makeup, the hair, the attitude, the looks, the suave. But shes in college, she has her own super stressful family issues, she has friends, so much to worry about.

I'm worried that if I try to talk to her she roll her eyes, sigh, and say, "Really? Dude, I have more important shit to worry about."

Realistically I know she would never say that, but she might think it.

Jm worried she'll see me as pathetic. 

Everything I've done, improve my lifestyle, work harder and longer hours, lose a ton of weight, all of it was for her, I love her, but more importantly I admire her, I look up to her, she inspired me, and until recently, was the sole reason why I kept going.

She is the greatest friend I have.

And I'm scared I'll let her down, I'm scared I'll show her how week I really am.

Im, hard set on my plan and although her not loving me back sucks, (alot) it isnt why I'm doing it.

I just hope she knows that she really was my world, she really was my inspiration, and I want her to know she changed my view on life.

I also want her to know that what I'm going to do isnt her fault.

What do I do?

Should I tell her? Should I talk to her?

If she told me not to I wouldn't, but I dont want to burden her with my emotional shit.

I love her too much for that.
