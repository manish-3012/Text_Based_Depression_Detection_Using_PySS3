My alcoholic family is ruining my life and my friends seem to hate me. Help.Iâ€™ve been diagnosed severely depressed for years. But between all recent events, my alcoholic father who calls and texts nightly about how Iâ€™m awful and a disappointment, my alcoholic sister who manipulates me but wonâ€™t let me see my nephew, and my â€œfriendsâ€ who Iâ€™ve made very aware of my current mental state but continue to never text or want to hang out or NEVER LISTEN and cut me off. I need someone to talk to so bad. Iâ€™m at the fucking edge. 
I donâ€™t even have a job or hobbies anymore. I lay in bed all day and wish I was dead.
