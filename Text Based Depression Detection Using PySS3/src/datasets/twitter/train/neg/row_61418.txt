Fighting the thoughtsFor the past 10 months I have had suicidal and violent thoughts most days. Some days it has been very intense thoughts, other times more in the back of mind. I ended up in a dangerous mixed episode when I was on an SSRI and stayed on it in that state for 4 months and have not really recovered. I started Lamictal, but it isn't better yet and I am discouraged. It is bad right now, especially the violent thoughts of wanting to harm myself, and not caring where it goes. It is also impulsive at times, like I found myself holding an open bottle of pills a few weeks ago. I had been having this urge to take them and see what happens, but didn't logically want to, and then I was reading a book, stopped and 10 seconds later was holding it. I had to fight myself to put them down. I feel like I am in a battle with myself, and each self destructive or suicidal thought takes so much energy to push down that I am getting tired. I also sometimes lose insight, like right now I am having a hard to separating the rational and irrational impulsive side of my mind. I don't plan on doing anything right now, but I feel like I can't fight this forever and it feels hard right now. I am just really tired and discouraged, and feel like a terrible person who shouldn't be here. Just needed to get this off my chest. I don't really need to be talked out of anything, I just feel alone and kind of scared of myself. Thanks for reading.
