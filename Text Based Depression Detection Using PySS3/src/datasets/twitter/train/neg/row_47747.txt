Too lateMy 20's are coming to an end. I have no friends, no relationships, no career and plenty of debt. My brain is too weak for our current world and systems. I've been diagnosed with ADHD, social anxiety, depression, and insomnia not that excuses my worthless existence. Everyday I think about my early 20's and all the stupid decisions I made, all the opportunitys I wasted. I dropped out of college at 21 and isolated super hard. I never dug out of that and lost everyone in my life. 7 years later it doesn't feel real, it feels like it's only been 2 weeks since I haven't done anything in 7 years.
