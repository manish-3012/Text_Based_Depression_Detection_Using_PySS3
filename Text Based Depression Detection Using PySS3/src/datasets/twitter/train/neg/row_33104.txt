I need helpIâ€™m only 21 and have had 3 partners. My second partner, a guy I was seeing, gave me Hpv. The warts. Lovely. Next guy I date accepts me and the hpv, and I think things are looking up. Nope. He gives me ghsv1 bc he didnâ€™t know he carried ohsv1 (herpes). I feel absolutely disgusting. I am so embarrassed. I feel like a leper. Iâ€™m 21 and am always careful and I havenâ€™t even had sex with my current bf yet bc I was too stressed out about the hpv.

I am on humira for Crohnâ€™s and absolutely petrified that I will not be able to clear the hpv virus. I worry about it constantly.

My family doesnâ€™t talk to me about it and I am too embarrased to tell my friends. Iâ€™m terrified to even talk to anyone of the opposite sex. 

I just keep telling myself what am I going to do? Who will ever want to come near me let alone love me? 

I feel so gross and alone
