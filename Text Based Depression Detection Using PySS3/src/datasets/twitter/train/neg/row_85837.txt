No way out! I don't know what to do.Like the title says... I feel like I've hit a wall, I can't do anything, and if something miniscule goes wrong, that matters to me I start to spiral, and now I feel I have crashed.

I study Medicine at University and it's stressful, but it's a lot of pressure from family and so... =( Recently I missed a test because my clock was running wrong, and then I just broke, I've been apathetic for 2 weeks and I don't know what to do, I don't... Know.

Today I've been crying all day, I'm a guy, so it's pretty pathetic too.
I feel that I should go talk to someone, like a psychiatrist, but it's... Maybe I'm too proud or some shit, but I probably need the help...
