I'm sorryI've heard that so many times from yesterday and today that it should be written on my soon to be headstone. Maybe I understand, the two people that say these words don't live in town with me. One lives in Australia and the other New York. They have no connection with me. I may have bonded with them over World of Warcraft, but clearly that doesn't matter anymore or if it ever did. They don't seem to connect the dots that I'm going to off myself, but maybe they don't want to see it. But maybe it's right, I shouldn't burden them with my problems. One has a boyfriend and son, the other a husband and two kids. Life moves on for them.

So I write this to whoever...I tried. Maybe I should say, I'm sorry.
