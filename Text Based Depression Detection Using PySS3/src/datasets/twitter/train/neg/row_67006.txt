I hate how my parents talked to me after I told them I was suicidalI got into a fight with my parents and reveled to them that I considered suicide. I don't know why but the just went on a hour long lecture  about how its "selfish" and "cowardly". They continued insulting me and forced me to say degrading shit about myself. I am so sick of it. I know its cowardly i know the people i leave behind will get hurt too but i can't help but think like this.  any time i have a opinion that they don't like they'll shove theirs down my throat. I wished they'd just fuck off and die.
