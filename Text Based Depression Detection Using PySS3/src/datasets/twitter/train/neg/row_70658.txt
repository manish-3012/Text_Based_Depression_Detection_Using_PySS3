Just end it.The last 3 years of my life have been the worst I  have ever experienced. My father blows up on me and my family and yells, and yells, and yells. I am hated by nearly everyone in my grade. I am alone and have only 1 person to talk to who my parents are trying to isolate me from. I'm hopeless. I am afraid of my future. I failed almost all of my classes last year, when I got straight A's before. I'm ugly and no one will ever love me.  I have attempted suicide and was too much of and idiot to drink enough alcohol and take enough pills to end this. I realize I am a dumbass and could have ended it quicker if I just thought to smash a lock and get a shotgun. 

It has been a never ending shit storm of pain and suffering where I just want to leave it all behind.
