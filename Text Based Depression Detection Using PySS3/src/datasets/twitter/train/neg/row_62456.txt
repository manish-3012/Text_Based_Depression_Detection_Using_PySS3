What's wrong with me?I've never really tolled anyone this, but the past few days have been bad. Looking at me from the outside you'd never know that I'm the one who has put a gun in my mouth on multiple occasions. That's for a good reason though. Five years ago I sustained a serious neck injury robbing me of everything I'd ever dreamed of. I had a scholarship to the college for my althetics I had a 3.8 at a prep school. I finally had started opening up. (I didn't really make friends with people at my school). Going from that to failing out of college, and now having trouble at a junior college because of my stupid self. I never drank, and rarley smoked weed. Now I'm at the point where my bestfriend says I have a substance problem. What he doesn't know is being drunk is the only time my restless mine feels at ease. I know it's not healthy, but honestly there isn't much else that let's my mind rest. (ADHD&amp;DSYLEXIA) I know I'm not stupid I just feel like I'm doomed to be this empty she'll of what I was. I think really the only reason I haven't done it is because of my girlfriend for three years. Which is why it sucks when I constantly try to find ways to drive her away. If I didn't have her I wouldn't be here, but lately I feel this isn't even going to stop me. People think I have my gun for home protection, but it's really for the opposite. Sorry for the long read, and any spelling errors.
