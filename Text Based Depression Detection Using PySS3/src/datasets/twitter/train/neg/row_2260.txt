Iâ€™m just tired.Itâ€™s one of those days where I really donâ€™t feel like things are going to get better. Iâ€™ve been struggling with bi-polar disorder for almost 10 years, Iâ€™ve been on so many different cocktails of drugs itâ€™s impossible to remember them all. Iâ€™ve spent thousands on therapy, and still I find myself sitting in the dark tonight wondering why Iâ€™m even here. 

Over the years Iâ€™ve isolated myself from most friends and family and I donâ€™t think anyone truly knows how bad Iâ€™m feeling (with the exception of my psychiatrist and therapist). 

Iâ€™m just so tired of fighting, tired of trying to get better and really just want to slip away in my sleep.
