So, here I amI donâ€™t know how to feel. Unfulfilled? Saddened? Stressed? Itâ€™s more than that unfortunately. Itâ€™s a psychological impairment I canâ€™t rid myself of, itâ€™s every thought that plagues me. I thought I could get better. I tried. 
Iâ€™ve been working on friendships and relationships, and I do quiet well for myself, I do have relationships, but nothing long term. Iâ€™m just not cut out for it. 
I was hospitalized twice a while back, the one year anniversary is coming up, and itâ€™s amazing how nothing has changed. Iâ€™m right back where I was a year ago. Only this time I donâ€™t wanna jump off a bridge. Iâ€™m depressed, I have been for much of my life, but suicide doesnâ€™t seem to be the answer this time around. Kinda saddening actually, it was a way out, and Iâ€™ve cut it off. 
So I ask myself, why? Why bother living? I donâ€™t know, I donâ€™t see a point in living, but death requires a degree of effort. 
Iâ€™m still suffering from low self-esteem, urges to self harm, violent emotional episodes, depression, paranoia, anxiety, I still have it all. And I donâ€™t want to live with it anymore. I smoke a lot, that seems to help. In a way, itâ€™s a kind of prolonged suicide, knowingly putting poison into the body. 
Iâ€™m sick in mind, and I know it. Thatâ€™s the worst part, knowing youâ€™re fucked up but not being able to change it. Ignorance is bliss, regardless of how you view it. 
I may take my life, but that will be a while yet. For know Iâ€™m just going to stop eating and smoke, maybe reach out to friends, but in the end, it doesnâ€™t matter. 
Iâ€™m sorry.
