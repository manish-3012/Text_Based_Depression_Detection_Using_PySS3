I'm going to do it. Shooting for Walpurgisnacht - April 30th.Unfortunate associations with Hitler's date of death aside, it's also the day, in German Christian folklore, when the line between worlds is thinnest.   


I'm going to check into a local motel using my tax returns. I'm going to give myself three days - one day to write letters, one day to enjoy myself, one day to mediate and prepare psychologically.  


I am a violent criminal with severe, undiagnosed personality disorders, probably relating to my father's suicide. I am 31 and have not taken care of myself at all. I chain smoke, do not exercise, eat garbage, and have no skills or education, and a criminal background which precludes me from pursuing virtually any line of work. I have no friends, but have made a lot of enemies. My life is garbage.
