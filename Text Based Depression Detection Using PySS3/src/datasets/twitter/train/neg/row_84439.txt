Probably should kill myself.Everyday I keep telling myself I should die. I know I'm a fool and fools have no place in this world. I'm almost 25 and I have nothing to show for it. I want to try school again, but I'd probably screw up again. I don't have any friends. I've never had any real physical contact with another human being. But what bothers me more than anything is that I'm just bored of everything. Nothing seems to excite me anymore. There's just no drive for me to go out and do anything.
