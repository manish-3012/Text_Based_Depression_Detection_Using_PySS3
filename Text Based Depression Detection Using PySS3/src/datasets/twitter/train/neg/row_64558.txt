I have never wanted to kill myself so badlyI have never wanted to kill myself so badly. I helped the woman who broke my heart, that I still love, find a religion that I hate because the people who follow it hate and/or don't accept me. I want to kill myself so badly. 

I want to do it now more then ever because the pain is so unbearable. I only want to destroy everything. I don't want to be thanked for leading somewhere there. I want to kill myself, I am ready to do it. I hate myself. I hate myself so much. I don't know why it hurts so bad. All my life I followed Islam only to be thrown aside for being mentally ill and Bisexual. I was deemed a problem and a monster and I hated it from there. I hate all religion. I hate "God" for doing this to me. I hate myself because I'm not accepted. I want to kill myself.
