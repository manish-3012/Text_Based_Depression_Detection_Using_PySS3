Is anyone else afraid they'll always struggle and never see the day where they aren't depressed and anxious 50% of the time?For me that's the one thought that goes down the suicide spiral. What if it never gets better. 

Of course right now my cat is all up in my face trying to get my attention, as if she knows how I'm feeling, but like I've lost motivation to do anything until the last minute and anything I do think of to do I get halfway through it and get demotivated, and that's not like me at all... I'm not myself, and so far I've been a loser instead. I want that to change but things just don't stick, treatments don't always affect things in the long run. Sometimes they seem completely useless. Like I like my new therapist but I forgot to go this week. $17 no call no show fee, and I have to try to reschedule but I keep forgetting to. My ADD is getting to me, my depression is getting to me, my social anxiety makes me happy to be at home but I get lonely when my cat doesn't lie down on the couch next to me when I ask her to... My job interview on Friday went really well, but now I'm second-guessing myself as to whether I can really do the job I said I could do. I've done it before and I should be fine but what if I'm not ready to start working again after a month and a half off? I should just show this whole post to my therapist when I see him next, or email it, or something. Oh and also my husband and I have to figure out taxes. Ugh. When will this end?
