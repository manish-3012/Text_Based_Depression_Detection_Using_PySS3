I donâ€™t know what to sayI just canâ€™t stop this feeling of just wanting to die almost my entire life.

Iâ€™ve been such a parasite to everyone in my life.

It started whenever I was 13, I forced myself sexually into my younger brother. Donâ€™t ask me why I did it, I donâ€™t know why and I regret it so *so* much. Iâ€™m so sorry Gabe, I donâ€™t know why I did it.

After that my father hasnâ€™t liked me since, and my parents had told other parents whom told their kids to stay away from me.
In addition to that their older kids that were older than me beat me up on a regular basis, one time I was strangulated within inches of my life, I had blacked out and donâ€™t remember what happened.

Every since then Iâ€™ve had jobs off and on, never able to keep a job for a long amount of time.
Due in part to this it has completely destroyed my resume and I canâ€™t hardly find a job anymore.
Besides that I have terrible scoliosis which disables me from working just any job, they have to be jobs with little/no lifting involved.

I found a girlfriend but wish I hadnâ€™t, all it does is make her upset whenever Iâ€™m feeling suicidal sheâ€™d be so much better off without me. I love you Shyera but you need better than me, so so much better than me

I had to stop typing this halfway through because Iâ€™m crying so hard I canâ€™t even hold my phone 

Iâ€™m sorry everyone
Iâ€™m so useless
