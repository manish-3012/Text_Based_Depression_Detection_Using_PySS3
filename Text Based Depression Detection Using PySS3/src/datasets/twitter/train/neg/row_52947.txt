I feel empty. I don't want to live but i don't want to neck myself.All i want is to live. To be happy. My life is so slow and nothing is happening, so i may as well kill myself. Its one day after another and nothing is happening. I am so fucking angry and sad that i feel nothing. I want a job, I want to move out, I want to finish uni, but i can't because i'm too young. Time to me is torture and it's chipping at my already dead soul like a cancer. I want to live my life but if i can't i'm going to neck. Please reply if you have any ideas on what I can do.
