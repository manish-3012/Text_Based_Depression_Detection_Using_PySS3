Im tiredI got over my depression and anxiety. I still get waves of sadness sometimes but my ocd is still bothering me. I have intrusive thoughts. They suck. Theyâ€™re exhausting and i cant stop having intrusive thoughts. I read a post on instagram that was talking about a guy who also had OCD and he shot himself only to end up fixing the part of his brain that was affected by OCD. I dont care if that story is true or not but if only I had a gun. I dont really want to die. I want to live for once in my life. My life is actually really good and I love it. Its the OCD and these thoughts that I have to manage everyday for who knows how long. I want to live but im tired. To other people OCD may seem like nothing, but to the ones affected by this and intrusive thoughts often associated with this its hell. Its a fucking prison and i just want to stop the constant strain in my head.
