Whenever I see someone posting about offing themselves here I think "no don't do that, that's so dumb"When it comes to me tho I seem to completely forget everything I notice about other people's story.
Like someone can talk about how it wouldn't affect their family and i'll think "of course it will you dumbass" but actually couldn't imagine anyone being sad about it for more than a month.
What the fuck is wrong with me?
