I'm at the end of my fucking ropeOver 18 months of looking for a full time job since the last one. Months of struggling, food stamps and stress. I got a temporary part time job for the summer that ends in 10 days, and I'm moving back in with my goddamn parents in the absolute last place in the world I want to fucking be (I love them, but they live in what is essentially a third world fucking country nestled within the Southern U.S.) 

Last time I was in that hyper-rural hellhole, I got so depressed from the social isolation I tried to fucking kill myself. I'm worried I'll do it again.

I'm applying for jobs in a frenzy, but it's gone nowhere in the last 18 months. Probably submitted my resume for over 800 job openings, I don't think anyone ever gets jobs from these fucking job boards but I keep trying because I have no connections.

I'm desperate. I would do anything to have some fucking stability back in my goddamn life.
