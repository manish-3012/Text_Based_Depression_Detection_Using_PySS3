I shouldnt want dieIt hurts i just wanted my dad to love me but he won't. He's never going to and I'm never going to get the one thing i ever truly wanted. I shouldn't care, its be easier if i didn't. I can't sleep i keep waking up crying. I should be happy, my sister took me in. I'm not. I feel like a burden. She says I'm not. She's extremely nice. But I'm sad all the time. Passively, I've always been sad. When I tried to hang myself, and failed, my dad told me to go kill myself at school instead, and that i dont have problems. I've wished i was dead since i was little, i felt like i was a waste of space, and i couldn't do anything right. I had one reason to feel important. I told my dad about this, and he chose to tell me why that actually wasn't something important. Basically"hey, you just told me the one reason why you didn't kill yourself as a child. here's the reason that doesn't matter, and you should have just offed yourself"
That was couple years ago i can't forget about it. My entire life has been me trying my best to make him proud and its not gonna happen. I shouldn't care. He's physically and mentally abusive. I know that. It still hurts. I just want to be happy. I can't stop crying. I won't kill myself, my sister would be sad. Itd probably hurt my nephews. I dont want my brother in law to have to deal with any of it. I dont want to think about it. I wish i could just be hit by a car or something. I'm a coward. I shouldn't feel useless. I'm loved. It still hurts
