AloneI had a boyfriend for over 2years and we went to a festival together. He told me he had doubts about us while i was having the best day ever. He told me he liked a girl from his work, that i am difficult to deal with, that he doesn't know what to do anymore. Yesterday he told me was looking foreward to the festival and we were holding hands and laughing all day and then he broke up with me. He told me a billion reasons and i just cried and cried.. then left.
i have been crying for a few hours, hugging his sweater... i am nothing without him, nothing. 
I wamt to end it, but my mom keeps checking on me because she hears me crying.. idk what to do... i want him to call me.. i miss him..
