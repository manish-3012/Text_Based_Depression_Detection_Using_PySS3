Iâ€™ll take any opportunity to kill myselfI moved, finally have access to a gun. I donâ€™t own it, donâ€™t know how to use it. Itâ€™s an opportunity:) If that doesnâ€™t work iâ€™ll just down tylenol. 

People think everythingâ€™s okay because iâ€™m pretty, and smart i guess. Doesnâ€™t work like that :/ 

I hope my boyfriend knows i took a bullet to
the head, maybe heâ€™d know that saying â€œDonâ€™t let things get to your headâ€ doesnâ€™t work sometimes
