All I do is fuck things upI've been a fuck up my whole life. I don't think that will ever change. I don't know how my wife puts up with me and I don't know if she will much longer. I'm worried that I will fuck up my kids too. I'm a terrible husband, brother, son, friend, relative, father. Why keep dragging everyone through the mud with me? Why bother to give myself the opportunity to fuck up other people's lives?
