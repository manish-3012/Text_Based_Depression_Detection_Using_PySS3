[Thanks] SW, thanks for helping me see another day.I had posted a couple of weeks ago shortly after my (now ex-) wife divorced me and my stepdad had passed. Since then, I have talked a lot and cried even more. I have also qualified for patient assistance from the big pharma companies that make my antidepressants; first shipment should be here next week!

[*voice breaking*] Thank you, r/suicidewatch for helping me through the darkness; I don't think I could've made it without your help, along with the help of many others.
