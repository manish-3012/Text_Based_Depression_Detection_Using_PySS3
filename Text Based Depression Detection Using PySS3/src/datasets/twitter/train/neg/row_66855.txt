Bye.I'm just so fucking done with humanity, people, myself, life, depression, anxiety, insomnia, diabetes, all my fucking meaningless mental disorders that doctors had to analyse me to figure out. I'm done. With everything. I've been done for the past few years. I've nothing to contribute, I'm a fuckup. I'm better off dead. Not like it matters anyways, haven't done anything worth anything, no true friends, nothing to lose, no one to hurt. Perfect. Only reason I'm alive now is music. And even that has gone kaput for me. Good-fucking-bye everyone. Had a terrible run, hope yall end up better than me lmao. Cya in hell.
