Lost my last drop of happiness.I were dating girl from the internet since we were about 12 years old. We developed a good relationship, and I also realized that I'm monosexual(as monogamy), and I just can't love someone besides herself, and that's not because we had abusive relationship where she were like "HOW DARE YOU LOOK AT THAT GIRL?". But we (kinda) broke up, because she realized that she loves guy, that she knew from the first grade of her school. That broke my heart and my life.  The thing is, we never met IRL, and I told her about everything I feel, and she can't believe I want to kill myself. We still love each other, just not the same as before (not worse, just different), and she agreed to have sex with me and cuddle before my suicide, as my last wish. She will came to my country in about 2 month (when there will be autumn weekends in our schools.) I just feel so bad about this... It's so painful to see relationship, that lasted 6(!!!) years to break, and have no place to go after.
This is not the only thing why I want to die. When we were dating, it was a common thing to want me to kill myself because I felt like I never intended to be born in this world, or at least in the country I live, and I also feel so bad because I always(k, most of the times) fail at anything I try to do, so, this relationship was only the last drop of my hope and happiness. I feel so thankful for all the support she gave me. 
I want my death to be as silent as possible, to avoid getting her harassed by my parents, friends(like two people probably), and anyone else, and also because some people won't understand me. After all, its not about me...

I'm so jealous I can't just ignore that because of monosexuality and my lack of any woman friends... So sad I can't rewind time like in life is strange, or at least have some chance to fix anything... 

She was my last drop of happiness.
