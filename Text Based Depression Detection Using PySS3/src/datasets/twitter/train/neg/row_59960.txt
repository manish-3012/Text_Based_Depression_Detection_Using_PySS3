I See no other future for me than death.First things first, I'm sorry if things get really confusing, my head is still a mess. 


I just want to expose everything that's corrupting me inside: 
I'm 17, I'm in the last year in high school but it does not mean I'm gonna graduate at all. Before I tell what's wrong, let me tell you how I was and how I got in this situation. 
When I was a kid, I was one of the happiest kids you could ever met. I was supportive, cheerful and full of energy, but with time my life went downhill. I joined an arts course in high school, in hope I could become a well known artist, but one of the subjects became my main concern, Geometry. Since 10th grade, I've been struggling to get at least a single good grade in that subject, but it never happened, and that leads us to the present day. This is the last year, most of my friends will go to college and I will be here, finding myself in a situation between life and death. I lost my passion, and I don't know what to do anymore. I'm kind of antisocial, that one subject is impossible for me to complete, and i have almost no experience in working. I'm just stuck in life. I have nowhere to go, and then there comes the suicide part. I don't want to live anymore, the only thing that could fill the void in my life would be graduating high school just to make my parents happy, but it won't happen anytime soon. I know I'm a pussy, I know life has no meaning, I just don't want to be a burden (more than I already am) to anyone. 

There you go fellas, hope I have enough courage to kill myself one of these days.
