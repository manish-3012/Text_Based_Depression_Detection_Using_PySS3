I have a friend who I care about more than anyone who I think has been hinting that she wants to commit suicide. I plan on writing a letter this weekend for her to try to help her. I'm looking for advice as to what I should say to her.I don't have time to write a proper paragraph so I'm just going to do bullet points. This might be lengthy, so I'd appreciate anyone who reads it all and can give me any advice :)

I realize this sub if mostly for support, not advice, so if this belongs in a different sub, let me know. Also, is it a bad idea to cross post this to other relevant subs?

**Background info for context** (if you'd like to know anything else, just ask)**:**

* I'm a 12th-grade male in high school, she's 10th-grade
* Met her a little over a year ago
* The first few months of our friendship were the best months of my life and she was my best friend at the time. After those first few months that unfortunately went away and things have been rocky and dramay ever since. I'm not going to explain all of it because it's a lot.
* It's always been kind of an unbalanced friendship, I've always appreciated her and cared about her much more than she does to me (which I don't blame her at all, no one really likes me). I have always loved her (as a friend) more than anyone, even at the times she's hurt me, hated me, refused to talk to me, etc., I've always loved and cared about her through all of it.
* Yes, I only love her as a friend, I have never had feelings for her beyond that at all, ever. However, she doesn't believe me, she thinks I do like, but I've told her probably hundreds of times that I don't and she doesn't believe me no matter what I say. Usually when I talk about this to other people in real life they don't believe me either and it really frustrates me because I'm telling the truth, but hopefully you people will believe me since I have no reason to lie on here since it's kind of anonymous. And I'm 99.9% sure she's never liked me.
* I remember her mentioning a while ago the she attempted suicide before, but I don't think she told me any details besides that.
* She's mentioned that she used to cut herself and has scars, she said that she stopped though (she said this about a year ago). She could have been lying that she stopped just to stop me from worrying but I have no way of knowing, she also might have told the truth but maybe started again.
* Her life at home seems pretty toxic. She says her family members call her a slut among other horrible things, like her mom calls her a pun of her name replacing part of it with "hell", basically calling her the worst child or child from hell (hard to explain because I don't want to give away her name). She has told me that her mom has gotten her drunk before and has drugged her food before as punishment. And she's also told me that her old sister hits her, which I don't know how bad that is because everyone's siblings do that I think, but idk.
* She has been through a lot of terrible and traumatic things in her life already that no one should have to go through, especially so early in her life. I won't list everything here because even though I don't plan on her seeing this post or anyone is my real life to see it, I'm still a little worried that someone will find it, so I don't want to talk about those personal things about her here out of respect for her. Since it's relevant though, I will say that several people that are close to her have killed themselves, which has of course affected her. One kid in our school last year committed suicide who she knew (I didn't know him unfortunately, but I am still hurt that he killed himself). She also had a boyfriend who killed himself years ago, I believe that one affected her the most.
* Her and I are on "okay" terms right now. She never really talks to me anymore, kind of avoids me, but it's been worse, and I can still write her letters. I kind of avoid her too, even though I'd like to talk to her or at least say hi to her every few days, but I don't think she wants me too, so I don't.
* The last time I had a conversation was about three months ago where she finally talked to me after basically blocking me from talking to her for like 5 months. And she apologized to me for "everything" and I apologized to her as well (sincerely of course). She basically said that she just wanted to stop our "feud" (that's what she called it, but it was a one-sided feud, meaning she was mad at me, but I wasn't mad at her, so I wouldn't call it a feud), but she still didn't want to be my friend. And that really disappoints me because I care about more than anyone, but I respect that she doesn't want to be my friend because I know I'd just be a burden to her, and I wouldn't want to be friends with me either, so I don't blame her.
* Also during that conversation, she seemed to hint at being suicidal. One thing she said was that she "wouldn't be here" if it weren't for me, and that sounded to me like she was saying she would be dead if it weren't for me, but later she said that she just meant that I helped her grow basically.
* Another thing she said was that she "starting over", which I'm worried might be a hint at suicide because I can't really think of what else she could mean by that. I thought maybe she meant she was going to get totally new friends or something but as far as I can tell I think she still has the same friends, and she changes friends and relationships constantly ever since I met her, so even if she was changing friends it wouldn't be anything new for her. 
* She also said several other things that worried me but I don't remember them all exactly and also it's late for me and I'm trying to finish this post because I'm really tired so I don't want to list them all.
* She seems to think very negatively about herself and thinks she's a horrible person, and I remember her saying one time that all she does is hurt everybody.

So it's been about three months since that conversation and since then I've been trying to write a letter to her to try to help as much as I can (the reason I write letters instead of just talking to her in person is because I'm extremely awkward and I barely talk at all in person, so I express my thoughts to her by giving her letters.) I've been procrastinating on writing it and stuff, but I think about it everyday, and I worry that I'm taking to long and what if she's kills herself before I write it, and I've been worrying about it every day for the past 3 months. I want to finally write the letter and get it done by monday, so that's why I'm here asking advice.

**Things I could use advice on:**

* I actually plan on killing myself in a few years and I feel horrible about it because I feel like anything I say to convince her not to kill herself is hypocritical because I plan on killing myself. I have told her before about me being suicidal and she's reacted with anger towards me (which makes me feel horrible). I don't plan on talking about my own problems to her anymore, but should I? Also, should I feel like a hypocrite for trying to convince her not to kill herself?
* Also just want to mention that this post isn't about me, it's about her, and that's all I'm worried about at this time, so please focus on her, not me. After I get this letter done for her I will probably start focusing on myself for a while because I am the most depressed I've been in my life right now. But like I said, I just want to focus on helping her for now.
* What are some things I should/shouldn't say to her? (I will do some googling on this one, since I know it's probably a common question)
* I plan on being 100% honest with her, only saying things I actually mean genuinely. She doesn't really trust me though, how do I convince her I mean everything?
* I have more questions, but I need to sleep now so tomorrow I will edit this post and add more.

If you've read this far, thank you so much and I would appreciate any comments!
