Should I give in?So at school, a few of my friends told me that someone had a gun, and was threatening to shoot up the school while we were there. I ended up telling a police officer. Later that day I found out that I gave false info on the person who had the gun, so I tried to fix it but my teachers told me to stay out of it. When school let out that day, I recieved messages from the person that I said had the gun but didn't. He said that he hopes I kill myself and he wants me to cut my wrists. He said that if I ever get pregnant, he hopes my kids die. I'm 15 and already have major depression. I'm scared to go back to school because of him. Should I just give in and kill myself?
