Not sure what to say for a title...Well, what to say? Things look like they're going well on the outside. My grades are great (lowest is an 80), I'm college-bound, and know exactly what I want to do with my life. 

I want to end it. I'm transgender and keep the closet locked at all times. My family can barely accept my pansexuality, let alone this.  The closet is killing me, and I'm not sure I have any way out. There are a lot more things happening right now, but that's a different story for a different time.

In any case, I appreciate those who took the time to read this at least.
