How do I go about dealing with poor mental healthThis is going to be a long post so if you read all the way through, thank you. 

The past two years I have been struggling with anxiety, depression and bouts of suicidal ideation. I was doing okay this past semester, but these last few days have been really rough on my mental health, and I planned out a suicide attempt which made me realize I desperately need help. The suicide hotlines are useless, and I was just denied online therapy. I am a low income student so I of course do not have insurance, and because Iâ€™m only taking 6 credits this semester, I donâ€™t qualify for my schools mental health services. I just donâ€™t know what to do. I canâ€™t afford any sort of therapy (Iâ€™ve checked every nearby therapist and theyâ€™re all over $100, even with sliding fee scales), and I donâ€™t qualify for insurance. I just feel lost. I donâ€™t have any family or friends to fall back on, and this particular year has been awful on me. Do any of you have some advice? Iâ€™m trying to get into law enforcement after graduation (not policing), so Iâ€™m scared of being diagnosed with any sort of mental illness. But at the same time, I feel that therapy and possibly medication would really help. However I donâ€™t even know where to start on that since I canâ€™t even pay for the initial appointment. Any advice would be helpful. Sorry for the rant, and thank you for reading.
