i need reliefi wasn't made for this earth, i'm too sensitive and too weird

i'm being used for money, advice, you name it, i don't have a single friend. i always wanna help people and no one reciprocates. i try not to let this world make me jaded, but i feel my heart breaking/hardening.

i have PTSD, schizophrenia, and a whole other host of mental/physical issues. 

i'm homeless and in a respite and have been for 8 months and no one is doing anything to help find me a place to live. 

my family and providers are tired of hearing me talk about my issues. my therapist doesn't help at ALL nor does my psychiatrist. 

i'm 21. i've tried to kill myself 16 times, the last one almost worked. i'm thinking about hanging/shooting myself.

i'm just so tired.
