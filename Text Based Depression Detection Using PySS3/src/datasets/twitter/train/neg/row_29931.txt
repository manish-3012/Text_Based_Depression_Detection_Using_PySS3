My father and I are in our billionth fight.My dad and I just get into fights whenever he sees me. I have borderline so I can't really control myself around him. I try.. CBT, DBT.. It doesn't work with an irrational person. He told me to wash my car today, before the sun rose. I said ok. He comes home and asks why I didn't wash it after starting on a narcisistic rant about HIS day. I said I didn't get up before the sun. He said that he meant 7am. Ok, I just needed that clarified. He starts SCREAMING, and asking if my windows are cracked (to let the heat out) and I rush to go do it. He starts getting in my face screaming about it and how terrible I am. I slap him just to get him away. We're outside and he starts shoving me towards the ground so I flail my arms out. Now I'm outside, he just told me to kill myself and that I don't care about my mother. I'm so fucking done.. I don't know what CBT or DBT could help me right now. My therapist is busy, my friends aren't ever there for me (what friends) and my mom took my dad's side.
