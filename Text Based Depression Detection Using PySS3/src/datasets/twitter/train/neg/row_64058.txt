I just want someone to talk toTonight I really hit rock bottom. I don't know why. For the last few months I've really been just. Sad. Sad doesn't even describe it. The only time I'm happy is when I'm talking about my wedding. I'm getting married in 4 months. Holy shit. It's really flat out scary. I felt a lot better when I dropped out of school. I'm not even sure if I'm doing it right. My fiance, well he just seems like, he's sitting at the computer watching some movies and snickering. While an NBA game is playing in the background. 
Tonight I was ready to give up. Our washer/dryer isn't working. And I couldn't figure it out. And I got so frustrated. And started crying. Laid in the bed crying and he came over and said, it's just a fucking washer. I couldn't bring myself to tell him, it's not a fucking washer. It's everything else. I feel like I'm lying to him. 
Reddit, this is my first post. And I really hate starting off this way, but I really just want to be happy. And I feel like the only way is to just be gone. I feel like he wouldn't care. And he's all I have. Besides my dog. Who spent more time with me than my fucking fiance. Our house is to small. I can't get away from him. Shit I'm sitting on the bed and he's sitting in the "living room" and I could spit in his fucking drink. 

I just want someone to say it's going to get better.
