Ready to goHi...I would like to talk with someone who won't convince me to not commit suicide. I have been depressed ever since I was little and severely struggling  for almost 10 years. There is just too much wrong and I can't just keep going on like this. I have done everything the system has you try from meds to therapists to psychwards. I have tried alternative methods to some degree with not much relief and lack of funds and resources, etc have prevented me from trying holistic methods I am more drawn to. I am tired and just don't see it ever getting better. I am ready to go, just not sure how to do it. Life isn't worth living when I am basically hardly able to live at all. I feel dead already. The pain is excruciating. I won't be leaving anyone behind as I don't have any family or friends who I make enough of an impact on to really hurt or who really needs me. No pets or kiddos. I dont feel I am being selfish. I am in deep pain and many don't understand that. I have been a warrior this long and just running in circles. I dont want to try to kill myself and fail and wish I knew how I could manage to do this successfully.
