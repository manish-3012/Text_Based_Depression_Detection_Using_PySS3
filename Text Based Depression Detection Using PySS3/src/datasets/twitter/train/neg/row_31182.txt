I told my bossIâ€™ve been having suicidal ideations for a couple of weeks now. They come and go, some days are better. But some days it becomes dangerous for me to drive to work. 

Today I told my boss. I was so scared that nothing would happen. 

But she told me that my mental health is important, and that she would make sure to have my tasks covered so I can take some time to try to help myself. 

I have no idea what to do with the time off I will have. Iâ€™m pretty scared that Iâ€™m going to take time, put strain on my coworkers, and not feel any better. 

Is it possible I wonâ€™t ever be better? How can I live like this?
