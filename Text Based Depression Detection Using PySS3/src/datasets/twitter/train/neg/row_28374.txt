Does anyone else feel like this?Hi, I am here wondering whether anyone else feels the same way as I do. 

I seem to go through phases where I want to kill myself so urgently and then the next day, or sometimes a couple of hours afterwards, my mood suddenly changes and I ask myself, "Why on earth would I want to kill myself?". Then after that I feel like I want to kill myself again and after that I don't want to kill myself. It seems to be a regular cycle that I am going through. Does anyone else ever feel like this? Thanks.
