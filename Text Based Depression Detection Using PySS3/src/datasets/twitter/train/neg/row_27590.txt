Not sure where to post this... (x-post from /r/heartbroken)I just saw a video on g/w of my ex with another guy. I feel so terrible right now. I had a rough time with the breakup, and seeing this makes me think suicidal thoughts. I was doing what I can to get over her, but it hasn't been going that well. I always hoped things would work out in the end, as I'm still deeply in love with her. Now I have nothing. I feel like shit. I don't know what to do anymore. Seeing that video has scarred me. No, I won't post the video for you assholes who are going to ask. I can't stop shaking.
