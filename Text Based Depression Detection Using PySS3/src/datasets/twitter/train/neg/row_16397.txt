I'm not suicidal, but extremely depressed for multiple reasons and see no way outI'm sorry to take up your time in this very important subreddit.  I almost don't want to post this because I feel that my reasons might not be as extreme as the others'.

I recently returned to college (sophomore).  I just suddenly felt like utter shit for several reasons.  One reason is that I'm begining to realize that i have no friends.  I have people that i hang out with, and I know plenty of people around campus and it seems just fine.  The problem is that none of them are true friends, and they only seem to be getting farther and farther apart.  I have a few groups of "friends" and recently i've introduced several of them to eachother.  What has been happening is that they have been hooking up and fucking or whatever, and then feel awkward around me and try to hide everything from me.  I let them know that it is fine, but they still do everything behind my back and there have been a few that simply stopped being my friend all together. It is weird to me. 

I also feel just numb to everything.  I've gone to parties and gotten high and everyone around me is having a fucking blast, but i can't get any happiness.  I-I feel completely numb, I'm walking to class and meals just as a fucking robot.  I'm hollow.

I haven't had a girlfriend in years and years, and do not see anything of the sort happening in my future, and if it does, then i will probably still feel numb to the situation and not give a shit and end up ruining shit.

My waking life is filled with negative thoughts that i can't stop.  This is causing an even worse downward spiral.

I don't think I'm suicidal based on me respecting others' feelings at this point, but i really see no end to this.  I feel like the remainder of, at least college, will be me in this state of mind.

I'm sorry to have wasted your time.
