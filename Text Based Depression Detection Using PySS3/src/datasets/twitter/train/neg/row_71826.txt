I constantly debate on dyingI know I shouldnâ€™t but itâ€™s very hard being alive an existing. I was bullied and abused as a child so I developed depression and ptsd. 

I am doing better, I go to school, work and try to be a high functioning person. But Iâ€™m a severely high functioning depressed person so no one notices. 
I am 21 years old, female and itâ€™s so hard not having stable parents, or family or friends to rely on. 
I have been left to fend for myself and I have trouble connecting with people. If I get sick no one is there, if I graduate no one is there, if I come home no one is there. 

I just think I donâ€™t deserve to live anymore. What did I do wrong to be so unloved.
