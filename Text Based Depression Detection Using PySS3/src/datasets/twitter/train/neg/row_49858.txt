Hospitalized for suicidal desires?Hi there. 
I am 17. 
I confessed a bit of what I've been feeling to my mother.
She wants to take me "to a hospital."
What will it be like? How long do they force people to stay? 
Has anyone experienced this?
I can't really get out of it... Maybe I can run away... but that won't really do anything. I am too "depressed" too "sick" too myself... I often get strangers asking if I am okay and if they can help... Is it so obvious that there is something wrong with me?

She said that one of the reason therapists have never really helped before was because I "played little games with them" ... "manipulative" ... etc. Um...

Tell me what to expect? I'm scared... I'm scared that they won't understand or that they'll look down on my problems and that they won't be able to help me and that it will be terrible and I'll want to die even more when I get out. I need to recall my abilities to pretend... pretend that I am getting better, okay, etc.

Also, I can't really kill myself properly with my current...umm tools. My plans required a bit more time. So I can't just die before it happens... unless I get inventive.
