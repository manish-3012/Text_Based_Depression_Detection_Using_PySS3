Nothing workingDidnâ€™t have any friends coming out of high school that I would talk to outside of school. Decided Iâ€™d focus on improving myself and looking at what Iâ€™m doing wrong. 

Lose weight and put on muscle.
Improve appearance.
Talk more and be more confident around people
Volunteer in the community.
Go to college.
Join a club.
Try to be less of an asshole to other people taking to them.

Nothing Iâ€™ve tried has worked. Still feel completely lonely despite having family who cares, but I donâ€™t talk to them about anything emotional. Canâ€™t get any professional help because if I have that on my medical record my career is pretty much over, which is the one thing motivating me to go on because it gives me hope itâ€™ll change something. Resorted to working at my old job just to have people who talk to me even though itâ€™s only at the work place.

Everyday itâ€™s just go to school, work/volunteer (with people older than me), work out and sleep. 

I wish just one person would hit me up to hang out or talk.
