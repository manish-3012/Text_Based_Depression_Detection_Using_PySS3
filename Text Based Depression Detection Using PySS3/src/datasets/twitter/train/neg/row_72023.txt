I think I might finally get it over withThere's a hardware store not far from me. I've thought of going there and finding a thick rope. But also I know the instinct to struggle will kick in. I wish I knew what I could take right before to relax. My work situation is hopeless and toxic. I am completely alone in this world. If I died in my apartment, it would probably take months before anyone tried to reach out (and the only ones that would reach out would be my landlord checking on rent).
