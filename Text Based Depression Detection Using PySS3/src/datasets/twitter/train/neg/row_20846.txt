I don't know how much longer I can willfully live in this society of sick people.The reason I have been considering ending it is because I know everyday there are people that don't want humanity to progress and do things like rape, homicide, and abusing their kids EVERY DAY!!!!. Two of those people are my parents who emotionally abuse the sh\*t out of me and once when I verbally fought back my dad hit me really hard. It does not make any sense. I don't see any reason not to end it because eventually everyone will die and nothing will matter, so why live if not everyone is going to work toward our species progressing and evolving????
