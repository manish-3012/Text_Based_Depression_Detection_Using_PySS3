Hey guys! I don't know if anyone remembers me. But here is an update.Hey guys! I posted here 3~ years ago. And then again 5~ months ago.

 And I'd like to update you!

 So in the 3 past years I've got my shit together.

 My parents relationships have healed. In the past 5 months I have been clean of doing drugs because it was a problem.

 I got a girlfriend too!

 And I know this seems like a stupid braggy post.

 But I'd like to thank all of you for saving me.

 Without you I wouldn't have gotten any of this!
