I wish one person in my life would recognize how much pain I am in every day so that they can live without griefThe only reason I have not killed myself is because of my loved ones. I look at suicide bereavement forums and know that I would never want to put any of them through the ordeal of finding my body or planning my funeral. I don't want them to suffer. But I suffer every day for them, and they will likely live their whole lives without knowing or caring. I wish that one person would take me aside and acknowledge my pain. I want a shoulder to cry on. I want someone to tell me that they know how hard it is, but I'm doing a good job anyway. I want to die so badly, but my guilt is keeping me alive.
