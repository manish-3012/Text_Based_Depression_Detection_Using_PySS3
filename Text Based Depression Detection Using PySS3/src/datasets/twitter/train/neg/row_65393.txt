I've been writing suicide notes, and I'm not sure if they are serious.It's weird. I often write them to calm down, I'm a strange way. I use them to re-evaluate the situation. I usually do one, to one person, and then realise that killing myself would not benefit them and I'd feel.extremely guilty and not write notes for months. This is the second note running I've written notes. And I've written several. I'm covering everyone important to me. While I know I am not actively seeking this yet, I also know that my brain may subconsciously be preparing itself for what is to come. I'm convinced I won't reach the age of twenty (I'm seventeen). I just want to be normal. I want to kill myself, but not yet. The time isn't right yet. I have razors coming for self harm purposes, but accidents happen. I think it's best I prepare. I'm sorry for ranting here. Thank you for listening.
