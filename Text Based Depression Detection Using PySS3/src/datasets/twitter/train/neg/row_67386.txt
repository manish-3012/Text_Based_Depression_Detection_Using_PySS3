hey, i guess i need some helpim depressed, im taking all those pills and it helped me a lot but sometimes there are these days, i call them dark days. i wake up and i know that im not going to school today, im not strong enough to look at these people who laugh at me and make jokes about me, im just really tired of it. I talked to a girl, im very shy so that was one of the most challenging things i've ever done. We met in a sushi bar and she left, i tried to text her but she blocked me everywhere, im a worthless piece of garbage, also sorry for my english but im from a small european country. today i was really close to commiting a suicide but im just too weak to do it, im scared of life and scared of death.
