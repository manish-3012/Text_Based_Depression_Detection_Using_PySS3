My online girlfriend is feeling suicidal, help me please.I am so desperate in need of help that I came here. My online girlfriend just told me she has been feeling suicidal recently and that everything has gotten difficult. I have experienced depression in the past, and gone through plenty of suicide attempts and thoughts. I am scared because I donâ€™t know how to help her, she canâ€™t tell her parents. She is stubborn, and feels like she doesnâ€™t deserve nor needs the help because she wants to help herself. I donâ€™t know if she has self harmed recently, nor have made any attempts to kill herself. She doesnâ€™t have access to a gun either, but Iâ€™m sure thereâ€™s other ways she can do something in her house. She mentioned that she feels this way every so often but itâ€™s gotten worse by the stress of school and online work, and that stuff really pushes her over the edge. 

Weâ€™ve been together for half a year now, which doesnâ€™t sound like a lot, but she helped me get out of a toxic relationship and saved me from my suicide attempts as well. I want the best for her, but I feel like my past emotions arenâ€™t helping as Iâ€™m getting thoughts that Iâ€™m responsible for everything, and I feel my negative thoughts stirring back up. I had already felt quite sad recently, but with this information I know that I canâ€™t come to a logical answer nor give the best advice at the moment. I understand I canâ€™t do everything to help and listening to her and everything is helpful, but I want to do more, just to prevent her from doing anything, but Iâ€™m clueless. In my time of need, I went to a therapist, but she doesnâ€™t have that option. I hope there is some good souls in the world that maybe can help me and give me some tips on how to help. She had helped me get through my hard times and I donâ€™t want to let her down. She means the world to me and I donâ€™t know what to do. Anyone, just anyone who reads this, please help me. Thanks.
