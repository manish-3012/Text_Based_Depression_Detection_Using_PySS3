I canâ€™t end it all, but Iâ€™m hugely tempted (being kind in a cruel world)â€¦**TLDR:  Been a nice girl all my life, but severely depressed due to a family history of it.  Had a bullied childhood â€œschool experience,â€ grew up to dating losers - one who divorced me and married his mistress, and another who gave me a permanent STI.  Hate my life and want to disappear.**

Iâ€™ve been severely depressed and suicidal since I was about 11 or 12.  Itâ€™s in the family blood, tons of aunts and cousins are just like me.  Desiring suicide, depressed on the couch all the time, etc.  My personal experience derived from being a â€œshy, kind and nice girlâ€ from the beginning and never being able to shake it.  I had the typical nerd experience: Openly talked about while I try to ignore it and play it off by smiling like everything was okay,  having to fight my bullies to make them leave me alone, always seen as awkward, hung out at the â€œback of the schoolâ€ or in a teacherâ€™s classroom, etc.  What really made it even harder is that I was actually a â€œpretty girl,â€ very tall (about 5'10), and Mom made sure I always dressed nice and had my hair done. So some of the girls who couldnâ€™t afford to get nice clothes or their hair done would put me down daily. I hated confrontation so Iâ€™d do the whole â€œsmiling and laughingâ€ thing to avoid another fight, I had 4 already since elementary :(

Though my Mom kept me looking nice and loves me dearly, she also shaped me into her â€œclone,â€ by being just as strict as my Grandmother was with her.  I could barely go out, and when I did ask she basically scolded me for doing so.  Sheâ€™d always say â€œnoâ€ and then a few hours later would say â€œyes.â€  I HATED when she did that, it was such a mind f**k.  I had one sleepover when I was a junior in high school, and both my Mom and Dad cussed me out like a sailor while they made me clean the house spotless, as if I did something horribly wrong.  I guess they were happy afterwards, since that sleepover sucked and my friends were assholes to me during the nightâ€¦

So anyways, her strict upbringing and my â€œinherited shyness and emotional instabilityâ€ lead me to be pretty damned awkward most of my life.  Not to be conceited or anything, but people always told me I was smart, good looking and had potential, but I never saw it until my late thirties really.  In middle and high school, when the boys liked me and approached me, I was so shy that I would give off the "aloof" and "bitchy" vibe, so most guys ended up hating me, or treating me like crap.  I didn't mean to be like that, if anything I was EXTREMELY lonely for a relationship, but it is what it is.  So when I started dating as an older teenager, I was so lonely and desperate to find love like Iâ€™d seen in the Disney movies and Saved By the Bell, that Iâ€™d date losers.  I â€œsettledâ€ for the awkwardly nerdy and weird. I thought theyâ€™d be easier and â€œmilderâ€ to deal with, but boy was I WRONG.  When I first met my ex-husband, I thought he looked really unattractive, plus he had a VERY smart ass mouth, but I let him â€œgrowâ€ on me because I wanted to have someone, and he seemed to be head over heels for me.  I gave him 15 years of my life, and after the birth of our son, it lessened my sex drive and he **dumped me for his mistress from work, whom he MARRIED** rather quickly and didnâ€™t even let the ink dry on the divorce papers.  I knew NOTHING about it until a few weeks after we signed the papers.  What's even worse is that my â€œnice assâ€ agreed to have 50/50 custody, so my son can have his Dad in his life. Do you THINK Iâ€™d actually say â€œyesâ€ to the 50/50, if I knew that his whore of a â€œwifeâ€ was going to be my sonâ€™s STEPMOM?!  Now itâ€™s too late, and Iâ€™m wallowing in misery :(

So during the divorce process up until now, I've had a boyfriend whoâ€™s a truck driver.  Also nerdy but used to be alot of fun.  He loves me and all but heâ€™s also made me feel like a depressed zombie for the past 2.5 years.  Why?  Because heâ€™s always on the road, and I canâ€™t see him more than 1-2 times a week, plus he doesn't "push" enough to make things better.  He is also a divorceeâ€™, and has so much baggage he canâ€™t get his life straight.  I was so damned naive from the beginning of the relationship, that I didnâ€™t see his baggage from the start, and only looked at love and the fact that he said he wanted to â€œmarry me.â€   Mind you it wasnâ€™t a proposal or anything, he just said that super early and it made me hang on.  I hung on despite all the jerkish things heâ€™s done:

-Texted a half naked pic of us to his coworker to â€œbragâ€ he says, then his friend in turn forwarded it to his ENTIRE jerkish coworkers, etc.)

-Got arrested and almost jail time for fighting with this guy (who I later found out he did the first blow out of anger)

-Kept putting off me meeting his family since he had â€œso many girlfriends in the past that did nâ€™t lastâ€ he said

-And now the Coup De Grand: ***He gave me an STI,*** and I recently found out that itâ€™s high risk.

You know, high risk:  Meaning it possibly can cause me cancer later on, and it's the kind you canâ€™t get rid of.  It lays dormant in your body, so you never know if it will ever come back!  Plus I have to have surgery in a few weeks to get rid of the precancerous cells it caused. To me, my love life is over.  Our relationship is really crap now, and even if I did find someone else, once they hear about this theyâ€™ll dump me for sure.  

Now Iâ€™m 50 pounds overweight, and am so depressed that I can barely clean up my house, or shower, or wash my hair.  I smoke weed to zone out and pass the time, but that doesn't make the painful memories go away.  My boyfriend says he loves me endlessly and will be there for me during the surgery, but Iâ€™m not getting the support and sweetness from him that I need right now.  And heâ€™s gone most of the time, so to me itâ€™s not a â€œrealâ€ relationship anyways.  Also, I think Iâ€™m still having the â€œPrince Charmingâ€ fantasy in my head, expecting guys to be so loving and sweet, but in reality most of them are jerks(no offense to the nice guys out there). 

I think when I was younger, I went for the geeks and weirdos because I figured theyâ€™d be â€œeasierâ€ and would appreciate me more.  But now being overly forgiving, giving too many chances to these a-holes has pretty much ruined my life.  Plus I miss my son so dearly when heâ€™s gone. Iâ€™m alone most of the time, and just wish I could be put in a â€œcomaâ€ every time he leaves me, and then be reawakened when he comes back and brings me his wonderful beam of light and joy into my heart.  

Heâ€™s all I have to live for.  Now I donâ€™t even think itâ€™s safe for me to get into another relationship ever again.  Iâ€™m trying to accept that Iâ€™m too awkward and â€œdifferentâ€ to really be with someone, but itâ€™s hard to give up hope.  I donâ€™t think that Iâ€™m a horrible person, rather I feel Iâ€™m too nice of a person, and the rest of the world canâ€™t handle that.  Or they CAN handle it, and take advantage of my naivety and ignorance until I'm used up.  So Iâ€™m stuck in a horrible life, miserable and afraid to even reach out to the world anymore.

Iâ€™ll end this with a Bible verse I received today:  â€œTherefore, Godâ€™s chosen ones, holy and loved, put on heartfelt compassion,kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience.â€ - Colossians 3:12 

...that description is pretty much me in a nutshell, and I canâ€™t help but be this way.  But look how itâ€™s ruined my life. :( **tears**
