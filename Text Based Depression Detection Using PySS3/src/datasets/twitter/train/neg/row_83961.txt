Final rejectionThis is a weird and kind of long one. Iâ€™m a sex worker, dancer, and Iâ€™ve been out of a job since covid. Yesterday I got a group text saying a friend needs some girls for a payed Vegas trip. She asked us to send photos. Well today I learned she texted 6 of us, but they only want 5. I knew I wouldnâ€™t get picked. I always get rejected. Iâ€™m not ugly at all, but since childhood Iâ€™ve always been rejected. Found out today all my friends were picked and I was not. I was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder at 17, but I had been treated for bipolar since kindergarten.  Iâ€™ve tried to kill my self over 10 times since I was 7. After today I can never see my friends again. Iâ€™m the kid who gets picked last now. I know this may sound dumb, but Iâ€™ve had so much rejection I canâ€™t do it anymore. It had all clicked and now Iâ€™m researching helium suicide. It feels like the only way to finally get some peace
