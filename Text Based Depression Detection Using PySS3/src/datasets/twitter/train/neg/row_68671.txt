You KNOW you're in trouble when even Xanax isn't enough to stop your anxiety...I've hit a new low, I'm afraid. I've been trying to help myself for months, seeing a therapist since april, and i started medication a couple weeks ago. I was also perscribed xanax for "acute anxiety" but even taking 3 pills at a time I still feel anxious. I'm starting to think that there's no escape from my anxiety except suicide. I have to admit, the one nice thing about the xanax is when mixed with alcohol it's pretty much a guaranteed painless death. The idea seems to be more and more freindly as the days drag on...
