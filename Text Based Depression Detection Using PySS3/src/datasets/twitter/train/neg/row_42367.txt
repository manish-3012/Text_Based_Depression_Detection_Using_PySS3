I tried to kill myself last nightI don't know if it even would count as an attempt because I didn't get very far but... It's the farthest I've gotten and the fact that I still haven't talked to anyone about it makes me feel like I still am planning to go through with it. I did just what I planned last night, I had gotten really high (which made the depression turn to numbness and I didn't care about anything), and was on my way out the door to the train tracks across the road, was about to put my headphones in when my dog just stood there and gave me this look.. I knelt down to say one last goodbye to her and then I just started crying. I broke down, I couldn't stop. She started licking my tears like crazy and panicking because I started hyperventilating like mad. I couldn't go out there like that, so I just sat in my room and cried it all out. Decided I wasn't gonna be able to do it that night. I'm starting to consider just buying a bunch of sleeping pills and taking them all but I did research and it's... scary stuff if it doesn't work. It's just scary in general because of the length of time it takes. My best bet would be the train, but that would probably take even longer because I don't know when the trains come. I'd just have to wait. I'm kind of stuck at this point..
