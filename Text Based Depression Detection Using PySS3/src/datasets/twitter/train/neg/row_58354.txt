I'm at war with myself and I'm losing still, maybe it's time to just give up.I am alone. I have no one or anything left, and no reason. The world is crashing down on my shoulders and I can't keep hiding like I'm ok anymore. I just can't do it. It's too much. I've been fighting depression for so many years and somehow I've managed but I have exhausted myself so much lately and everyone else is so tired of hearing me complain about how sad I am that they all left me alone to die. I'm pretty sure everyone wouldn't really give a shit if I died since no one gives me any time of day anymore. The worst part about my life is that I know I'm too weak to actually kill myself and I have to keep suffering and suffering, and that I'll get up tomorrow and act like I'm a perfect student, daughter and person when in reality I lost myself behind so many fake smiles a long time ago. I just want to feel like someone cares about me. I'm sorry my post is long. In case you didn't get it, I'm alone and I need to express myself. :(
