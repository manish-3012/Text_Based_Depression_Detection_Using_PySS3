Has anyone gotten out of feeling like this?Lately the urges to end things have been getting stronger every day. I feel like a disappointment to everyone. I was not enough for my boyfriend whom after 4.5 years together told me he had an affair, and had been for the last 5months, which completely shattered me. This was in May. I was not good enough to finish my master thesis due June 2020, which made me disappoint my parents, especially my dad. Now I am still trying to finish the thesis, but am struggling really hard with it. I do not have time to hang out with any of my friends, and have to disappoint them every time they ask. My supervisors on my thesis were really excited to receive the results from my work, but all I am is a huge disappointment to everyone, and I think everyone would be much better off without me. I just wish I was never born, so I would not have to disappoint everyone AGAIN when I decide to give up on this life.
