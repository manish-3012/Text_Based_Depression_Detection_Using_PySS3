Waiting for a trainA train that will take you far away from here.
I hear Rachel weeping for her children, and she will not be comforted because they are no more.
I see in the headlights the ending of the Kali Yuga. This terrible simulation finally unplugged.
I see my great aunt weeping for her father, torn to pieces on the tracks, the bottle smashed, his sacrifices in war for naught. His face once young and hopeful, then distorted by mustard gas, then numbed by booze, now absolutely unrecognizable. And I the same...her last true joy in life, her last thing to hold on to, snuffed out by fate.
The holy ohm, the eternal good and eternal evil, too much for one man.
