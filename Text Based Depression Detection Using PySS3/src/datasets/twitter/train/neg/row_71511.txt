I give up.Just that, no whining about it.

All days I wake up to find anything to make me feel different, but at the end of the day, I feel like there's a void inside me, and nothing ever could've filled it.

I have yet to find a point in being alive, I can't be meaningful to my family, I can't be useful to the society, I'm just wasting air, time, opportunities, and everybody's patience aswell.

I can't continue.
