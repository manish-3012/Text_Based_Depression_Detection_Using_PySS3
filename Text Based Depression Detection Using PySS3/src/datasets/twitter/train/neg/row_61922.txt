I feel itâ€™s my duty to kill myselfI am unwanted. I have a partner who a few weeks ago admitted that 90% of the time he doesnâ€™t enjoy my company and actively avoids me. I work shift work. Since I started this job, I havenâ€™t been able to hang out with my regular group of friends as much. Theyâ€™ve moved on. They have new in-jokes, new interests, I just feel like a stranger in their company now. My parents disowned me a few years ago. I truly feel the entire world would be better off without me. Iâ€™ve put an enormous amount of effort into my relationship, and if my best is still not good enough, where is there to go from here? Heâ€™d be better off without me. Heâ€™d have more time, heâ€™d have less bad days, heâ€™d go out and take drugs with his friends... no part of his or anyone elseâ€™s life is enriched in any sense by having me around. I owe it to everyone to disappear. I waste space, I waste oxygen, I make others feel bad. This is the year. Itâ€™s one thing to coast along invisible, but completely unwanted, undesirable and uncared for... I canâ€™t do any more of it.
