How do I ask for help if I'm afraid to make a scene?I'm worried that if I tell my family that I'm suicidal, they'll freak out. They most likely will freak out. I've been keeping it a secret and trying to secretly text the suicide hotline and such, but it's not helping. I haven't even told my therapist yet. I want to see a psychiatrist, but my parents have been stalling, and when I tell my mom that seeing a doctor is what I really need, she calls me impatient and selfish. I have nowhere to go, no trusted family members, and no trusted friends. I don't know what to do.
