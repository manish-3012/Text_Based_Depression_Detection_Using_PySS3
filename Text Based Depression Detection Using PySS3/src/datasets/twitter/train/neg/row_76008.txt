To all those who feel like they should be doing great because they are supposed to have a great lifeIt's a lie.

I have been feeling like this for too long, and I keep seeing it in multiple SW posts. Don't get lost in that lie.

You may have a great job (I do), or do studies (I do) and be successful at them (I am), have a family, friends (or whatever you call the people you interact with everyday), and still, there is an emptiness inside you, thoughts that eat you inside out, and for some reason you just can't seem to be happy/satisfied.

This is normal. No amount of material assets have ever made anyone happy. You can be happy with barely enough to eat if you have people who love you around you, or any other reason to keep going. You can be stuffed with expensive food in an expensive apartment playing expensive games on an expensive computer, if nobody around you understands you, you have every right to feel miserable.

And then when you stop feeling guilty for being "materially priviledged", realize you are part of the "emotionally poor", and work from there. There is hope if you let go of the thought that "with all you have, you ought to be happy". That's not true. There is so much more to life than this. I know it because I have lived what "more" there is to life, and I have lost it, and I am looking for it again.

Don't give up.
