I don't care if it hurts anymore.I just need to find a moment when I can be alone and I'm gone. I already have it scheduled. It's going to get done today. I can finally leave my piece of shit dad, I  don't have to be compared to my siblings and I don't  have to go to bed remembering being raped for 3 fucking years of my childhood. I just want to fucking die. I've never felt the appeal this much until now. I hope this is the last time I ever have to visit this subreddit. Goodbye.
