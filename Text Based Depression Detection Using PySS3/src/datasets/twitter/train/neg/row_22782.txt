Suicide is Very TemptingI've struggled with depression for a long time. Lately it's been getting worse. A lot worse. Life is getting too difficult to bear. Here's a list of shit that's been bothering me. I know it's pathetic to let this shit get to me when there are kids starving in Africa and rape victims and all those people who keep on fighting no matter what happens to them, but I can't help it.

1. So there's this girl and she loved me and I loved her and I fucked it up because I'm socially retarded. At this point it's unsalvageable.

2. My passion is writing and that's what I feel like I'm destined to do, but I suck at it and there's no way I could make a career out of it.

3. I can't motivate myself to do anything anymore, which means I'll be fucked in the real world. 

4. I have no friends. As I said earlier, I'm socially retarded. I've alienated everyone I know. 

5. I'm very ugly. Take my word for it. I'd post a pic, but I'm afraid someone I know who uses Reddit might stumble onto this and freak out.

I know I can't kill myself because it would fuck up my little sister emotionally for life and she doesn't deserve that and I don't want to do that to her, but it's hard. I've spent the last hour thinking obsessively about how I'd do it. I'm on some strong pills for anxiety, as well as sleeping pills, and it wouldn't be too difficult to overdose on those.

It wouldn't even hurt. I'd just drift off and it'd all be over. 

But I guess that little part of me that knows that killing myself is a fucking stupid idea wants you guys to talk me out of it.
