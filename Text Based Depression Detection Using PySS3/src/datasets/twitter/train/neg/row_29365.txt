Just ranting.I lost my mother to cancer after 5 year last year, and last month my cousin killed himself. I can't go on like this, I can't keep feeling like this for long, I feel like I'll do some dumb shit soon and I'm scared for my family. I've always been a piece of shit and I don't want to do another thing to hurt them. I don't  know how I could be happy, I took anti depressants, worked out, socialized to a certain extent. Religion didn't help me either. I don't even know why I'm typing this.
