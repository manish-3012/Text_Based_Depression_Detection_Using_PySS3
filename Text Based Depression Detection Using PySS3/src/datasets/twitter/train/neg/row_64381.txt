AgainI find myself back at this place. I no longer want to live. Every day means nothing to me. Life loses meaning when you have nothing to live for. When all you have is deep pool of self loathing that is bottomless. A heart that longs for companionship. I just don't want to be alone anymore....I'm so alone...and dead inside.
