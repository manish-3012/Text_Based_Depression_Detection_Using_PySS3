This is my last resort. Would appreciate any bit of advice.Iâ€™m a 16 year old female who suffers from severe emetophobia (fear of vomit) which causes anxiety, depression, panic attacks, the works. I also suffer from OCD and really violent intrusive thoughts that never seem to go away. Iâ€™ve talked to my parents about getting help, like therapy or something but they said no because â€œtherapy is brainwashing and doesnâ€™t workâ€ and â€œmedicine is badâ€. I donâ€™t go to public school and I have no way of seeing my friends (I canâ€™t drive and Iâ€™m not allowed at other peopleâ€™s houses). 

These mental problems have just been getting worse. Iâ€™m planning on killing myself tomorrow. I canâ€™t keep living like this. Itâ€™s too fucking much. Posting this is my last resort for any advice or help. 

Thanks for whoever took the time to read and comment.
