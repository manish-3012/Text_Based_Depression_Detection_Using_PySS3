About to fail college and feel like itâ€™d be better to dieI lost my dad over the summer.  I was a fool and this got to me and now my GPA is LESS THAN 1.  Itâ€™s going to really piss my mother off when she learns and Iâ€™m definitely gonna fail out and Iâ€™m going to need to go on academic bankruptcy.  I really want my degree now, itâ€™s become an obsession.  Itâ€™d be so much easier if I just took my own life, despite me not wanting to do so.  The only reason I would is because the alternative is pissing as many people off as I could.  Seriously Iâ€™d have to go crazy to fix this problem and nobody will wanna put up with it.  They will hate me once Iâ€™m done.  My mom doesnâ€™t want me to off myself but Iâ€™m afraid it will come to that.  I donâ€™t technically want it, Id rather have my degree, but my obsession for it is turning me pure evil.  I have no hope left for college do I?
