I'm tired of people telling me to "consider therapy."Listen. No amount of therapy will change my height. No amount of therapy will make my dating pool even remotely decent. No amount of therapy will change society. Nothing.

I'm fucking sick and tired of this shit. REALLY sick and tired of this shit.

I will have to accept that I will only stand up to 5'5". I have no choice. There is no way to cope with that.

I'm sick and tired of my friends, colleagues etc talking about relationships and getting laid with me having nothing to contribute to. I'm fucking done with that. I don't even feel like going outside as many users tell me to do just due to this shit.

Guess what? I've done that since /u/geoffreyarnold and others told me. "Go outside dude." I'm fucking tired and depressed of this shit.
