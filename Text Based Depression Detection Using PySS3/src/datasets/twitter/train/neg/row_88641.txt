All alone with the suicidal thoughtsI think Iâ€™m making peace with having to end it. Iâ€™ve gotten to that point where i canâ€™t make decisions about what to do and the will to take care of things I need to do seems to be gone. I live in terror about my future because Iâ€™m alone and lack support in my life. Estranged from family, no kids, no spouse. For a long time I stayed alive because I thought enough time after a heartbreak and I would be fine again. Iâ€™m ok over the heartbreak now and thought now Iâ€™m ready. Iâ€™m not doing it over heartbreak but because my situation is very difficult and I feel fucked in every direction. The heartbreak is still there I guess. I miss him so much ðŸ˜¥ but if at least other aspects of my life were not so messed up I could deal with the heartbreak easier. Itâ€™s just compounding everything I guess.
