My depression is on overdriveIâ€™m so fucking depressed I asked my mother to not schedule the plans for my birthday because she keeps saying how expensive itâ€™ll be. It would be one friend of mine my sister and my mom and her boyfriend. I just feel so tired. Iâ€™m so tired of living so tired of trying I just wanna slash myself open and live in the pain. I feel like even though Iâ€™m normal on the outside Iâ€™m just screaming and screaming and fucking screaming for help but nobody cares at all....
