I'm not neededI was just reminded of this by someone. I'm not needed. She (not the someone. This is somebody else) doesn't need me. She has a boyfriend. Other friends. Family. Me existing/not existing wouldn't make a difference to her. Well, except that me existing would make her feel worse because she could be having a nice day and then she'd have to think about me.

This is true for everybody I know. They all have replacements for me. They have other friends. I'm not good at anything either. I'm a failure in life. So I don't have any particular skills that would make me useful either.

I don't want to hear about how nobody really needs anybody, and we should form our own meanings in life. Or I don't want to hear about how I'm still needed by my parents or something... I'm tired of platitudes. I'm tired of hearing the same shit over and over. I don't know why I'm posting this. I don't know why I post in this subreddit. It doesn't make me feel better anymore to know there are others out there who feel the same way as me.

I'm worthless. I hate myself. She doesn't need me. In fact, my existence could make her day worse. That's true. I'm glad that someone reminded me.
