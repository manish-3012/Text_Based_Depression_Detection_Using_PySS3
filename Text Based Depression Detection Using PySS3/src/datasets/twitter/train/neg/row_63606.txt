After much contemplation, this is clearly my only option.Things have been going downhill for a while now and I just can't ever remember a time when I wasn't so nervous and sad. Nothing seems to hold my attention or make me happy. Nothing interests me. I try to be a happy person and I'm usually pleasent on the outside I just don't know. I've never tried to put all in words. 

I moved 1300 miles from home less than a year ago with my fiance of 7 years to try and make my life better. I thought everything was going to get better and now it's even worse. He has left me for a girl he met at work ten years his junior. Now I'm here in a forgien place, alone and depressed. He took everything while I was at work and left me with no explanation or even a note. 

I have no one.  I have no way to even go home. My parents are dead. For fucks sake, I don't even have a bed to sleep on. I don't even have food to eat. Litterly, I have one potato and an old can of green beans. I feel so pathetic that I can't even feed myself. That I'm actually thinking of trying to go steal food. I don't fucking know. I clearly am not going to be able to come out of this hole. I've lost my job as a bank teller now because I couldn't even pay to fix my car when it broke down. 

I'm thinking about trying to go via insulin. I've heard that a non-diabetic person could kill themselves by injecting enough insulin so that's what I'm going to do. I was going to go with just shooting myself but I'm so pathetic that I can't even find a way to access a gun. Does anyone know any more about the insulin method? I just want it to be quick.
