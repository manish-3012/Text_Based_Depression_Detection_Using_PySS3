From Isolated Gay Loser to Aslyum Seeker.I am 20 from Barbados, male, and I am gay, which is illegal here and gays are the most highly persecuted in this country, we can work, and live but here is no protection, as we run the risk of imprisonment, myself, I have basic education and have been unemplyed 3 years in isolation from fear of persectution if I come out and knowng I have no qualifications it will only worsen, living in fear of being persecuted, I have finally considered the idea of becoming a refugee and seeking resettlement asylum in the US or, Sweden, Germany, if only I could be helped, I would be very thankful.


edit: I hope if I receive asylum where I can be protected, I can pursue ambitions and not being a burden on anyone.

I may be pissibly a refugee since my country is not severly persecuting me, but the fear of no protection from being persecuted by groups within the country that ofers no protection and has laws against homosexuality, should be enough. Still I cannot find anywhere to start , I cant find anyone willing to help me immigrate to a safe country, that I can then apply for asylum in, nor can I find application for resttlement asylum which is migrating from here to te other country, and through the embassy how I wil even make i through, having being a NEET, I dont think ill find asylum, nor will it find me, I don't think there is a way.
