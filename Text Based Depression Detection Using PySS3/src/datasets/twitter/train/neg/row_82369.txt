I'm done.I can't keep going anymore. I hate myself, I hate how I look, and I hate how broken I feel, and how broken I am. I can't sleep, I just stay up shaking, and crying. 

I've seen a therapist, it didn't help, I'm not sure why. I hate my life, and I'm 19, and I know that's young. But I'm short, unnatractive, unsociable and this wasn't what uni was supposed to be like. Everyone I got close to hurt me, and I can't keep doing it. 

I rely on other people to keep me okay, but all I get from them is hurt, cause I get too attached. 

I know it'll happen at some point, I don't know when, but probably when I have enough money to buy alcohol, I suppose that'll numb it.
