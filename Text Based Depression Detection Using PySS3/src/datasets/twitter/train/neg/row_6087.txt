I just think I need people to talk to right nowThe past few days have been stressful, bad things keep happening, I've got blisters on my face, my grandmother is not doing well, and just overall I've been steadily declining myself.

I'm just feeling hopeless and my mind has been getting hard to deal with, this isn't my first post but I just can't make myself OK, I just want to be OK and not worry and be in a dark hole for a while.

I'm just so fucking sad and scared it hurts.
