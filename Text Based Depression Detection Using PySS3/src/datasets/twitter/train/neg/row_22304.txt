life is meaninglessI've felt this way for several years and it just seems to get worse as time goes on. I constantly feel like I'm just going through the motions of normal life and it's slowly killing me. At first it was that big things like getting married or getting a job seemed pointless but now I feel such apathy and hopelessness about every part of my life from school and friends to family and a career- it's all meaningless. I'm going to university in September and moving the the other side of the country and I should be excited to get away but I'm not, I'm just moving my problems elsewhere. I find it so hard to TRY and be productive and kind to people and even do simple things like shower or eat when it's all pointless anyway. I know everyone will say 'oh but you're only 18 it's just angst you won't feel like this when you're older' but that's not really helpful, if anything older people just settle for a life of humdrum and mediocrity which honestly sickens me. I think about this 24/7 and it's pushed me to the edge wherein I honestly feel it's better to die than to live like this. I ditch school frequently because of this feeling, have lost a stone from feeling it's pointless to eat and haven't cut my hair in months because even that is pointless, and I'm a boy so it's shoulder length now. (I know it's ridiculous but I'm just trying to really show how all encompassing this feeling has become)
