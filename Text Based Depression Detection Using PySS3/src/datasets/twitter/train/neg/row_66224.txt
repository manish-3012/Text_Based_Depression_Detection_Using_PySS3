I have no reason to go onI'm in so, so much pain. Mental and physical. I've been lied to and thrown away by family, friends, medical professionals. There is nothing in this world that can make me feel joy. It's been like this for more years than I can remember anymore, and it's not that it hasn't changed, but that it just gets worse every day.

&amp;nbsp;

All I wanted in life was to travel, but even when I was finally able to go to one of the world's most beautiful places, all I wanted to do was kill myself. I have nothing left. I have nothing to gain.
