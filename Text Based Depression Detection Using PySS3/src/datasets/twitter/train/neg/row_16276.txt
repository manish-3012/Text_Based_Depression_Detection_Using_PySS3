I want to be done. I dug a deep graveOver the last year and a half I have dug my grave oh so deep. Only 21 with 2 DUIs, no car, homeless in less than a month, court at the beginning of the next month, ive become an alcoholic and can't stop drinking to get rid of the pain and memory that I fucked everything in my life up. And to top it all off just found out I may have gotten my gf pregnant or could be her other ex she cheated on me with. She's nonstop lashing out at me right now and constantly reminding me I should just end it and she doesn't need me to raise the kid. My family hates this girl on top of it and didn't want me associating myself with her. I am so terrified and know I deserve everything I have on my plate for putting myself there, but my chest hurts, I feel so nauseous, and just can't stop crying. I want to just give up and end it all. It may be temporary situations, but I just want to be done. I'm sorry if I came off whiny, but I don't know what to do anymore.
