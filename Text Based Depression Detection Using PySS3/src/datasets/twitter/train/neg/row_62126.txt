I hope hell isnt real.My life is shit.. All I do is hurt the ones I love.. All I do is fail at anything I try.. I couldnt possibly type all the shit that went/is going wrong in my life..

In the end is death, for everybody.. So whats the point of living? Whats the point of trying? Why make a difference. When youll just die in the end.

Help me Reddit.. Why does it sound so appealing right now to die?
