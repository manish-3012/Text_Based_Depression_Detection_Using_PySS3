I have to end itMy life is in shambles. Everything I touch or decide to do goes so wrong. I need to get the balls to end my life. I need to die. I need it so bad. I'm going to do this life stuff anymore. I can't deal with these ups and downs anymore. I desperately need to get out of this world. It's all my fault.
