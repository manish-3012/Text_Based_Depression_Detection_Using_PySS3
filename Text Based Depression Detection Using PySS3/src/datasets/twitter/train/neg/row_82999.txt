Feeling vulnerableBeen through some trauma and I can say 2019 is the worse year of my life. Probably it is for a lot of people. Ive been forced into therapy and my therapist asks if i have suicidal ideation. I cant talk about it cuz of the risks of putting myself into a situation where they could potentially take even more control of my life is too great. I dont think they believe me when i tell them i dont cuz they said that my experiences would lead them to think its likely. Well i do think about killing myself every day and night. I dont actually want to but i do visualize pulling the trigger quite frequently. I think through the motions in my mind and repeatedly tell myself i should just fucking die even though i dont mean it. I have a lot to live for and i think ill get over this. I dont think i need to talk about it cuz what can they possibly do?? All that can happen is i can get fucked over by revealing too much. Have any of u been screwed over by revealing thoughts uv had that u  werent even going to act on?
