Alone aloneI(19m), am asexual. I was alone all my life, no one cares, no one will. I'm a mess of a human. Have a past of sh and recently moved to uk. I suck at life, i just cant deal with everything going down.. I'll be honest with myself and tell that i dont want someone to have sex with, i never had any feelings like that towards any female or male. I just want someone to understand me and accept me, to hug me and tell me that it's gonna be alright.. How pathetic of me to wish to have happiness.. I'm so stupid and dumb. No one would want to be around someone who is like this, who has nothing to offer and provide. I struggle with social anxiety and depression and maldaptive dreaming. I suck at human interaction so its very hard for me to improve. I feel like theres too much to fix at this point. No turning back. Constant pain everyday... I fear abandonment even tho there is no one to abandon me. I dont know what to do
