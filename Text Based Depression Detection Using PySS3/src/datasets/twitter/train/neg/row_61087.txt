I want to disappearI feel so stuck. No matter what I do, Iâ€™m never good enough. I had a solid plan for myself, for my future but my asshole father is stopping me and it makes me want to die.

My mom said that if I tried to kill myself again, I better succeed because she canâ€™t be arsed to deal with the police again.

I just wish that things would go my way, for once.
