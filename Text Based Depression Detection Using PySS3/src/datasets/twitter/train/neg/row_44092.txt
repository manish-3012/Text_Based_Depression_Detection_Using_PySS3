my depression keeps coming back.I was really really depressed all through high school. Now that i'm in college, with a great major and a great boy friend, things are alot better. Now i REALLY have no reason to be depressed, but i cant seem to help it. sometimes ill be fine or even happy, and then out of no where ill be right back in my full blown depression. any advice of now to escape the depression in the moment, and how to avoid it in general?
