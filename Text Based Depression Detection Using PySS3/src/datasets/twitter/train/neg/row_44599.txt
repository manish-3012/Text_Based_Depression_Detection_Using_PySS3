Im dyingAlthough i wasnt able to do an instant death. Seems i am still killing myself either. I cant handle reality sober. I drink nonstop. 4 packbeer. Few hrs later another 4. A few hrs later another 4. All through the day. Even during the night. Barely sleep. Maybe a hr at time. I wanted to get out of this rut. To aim to be better. Had the goals. But still the same. I gave up constantly over the years. Didnt try hard. Was to my lowest. Then what did. Destroyed me. Think the alcohol is taking a toll on me.
