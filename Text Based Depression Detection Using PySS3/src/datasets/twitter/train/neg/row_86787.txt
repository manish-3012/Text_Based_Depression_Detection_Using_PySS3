Suicidal ideation and mindfulness.Are there any objective truths that we know of as to why ending ones own life is â€œbadâ€ or is that a duality that we ascribe to it as a subjective social norm? should I not worry and decide to end things while Iâ€™m in a clear state of mind. 
I took up therapy and meditation a few years ago to help with depression and PTSD. While theyâ€™ve helped me beyond anything I could imagine, I no longer associate with dualities, self image, my experience of life is much deeper and enjoyable, while this has helped me and I only regret that I didnâ€™t learn these things much sooner in my life. I only see more clearly that suicide is a more than justified way out for some; Iâ€™m 32, have alienated my friends and family, no relationship, have no real means of financial stability or an education to rely on, I spent 9 years in the military and struggled to stay off the streets for about 5 years after that. The issues I have with the life I have created I have dealt with, I accept responsibility for where Iâ€™m at, but our society does not reward or work in tandem with the objective truths mindfulness uncovers, compassion is looked at as brainwashing and wonâ€™t get me a Job that pays enough to keep the heat on. I feel like this is the clearest Iâ€™ve thought about suicide, thereâ€™s no emotion of sadness, or some freedom I think would attain from it. I simply just want out while Iâ€™m at least able to feed myself.
