Good morning to all: an anonymous suicide note.I know you guys get these all of the time, and you deal with them swimmingly. In fact, you've helped me on a few occasions on different accounts. For that, I thank ye. But I am tired, exhausted. Almost two months ago is when the *serious* depression and thoughts occurred. She cheated on me and left me and now she has moved on and doesn't regret it. I tried reaching out and letting her know how serious this was and she didn't care. Well fuck her then.

It all started about 11 years ago when my father died, and it has collapsed since. I am a skinny, ugly person. Inside and out. All my emotions and thoughts crush me. I wish I could make you understand, random stranger. In a way, I know you do. But I am making a choice. You won't talk me out of it, but you could at least give me a suggestion for my last day. Should I tell everyone that I love them? Write notes or send videos?

The antidepressants aren't helping, the therapy isn't helping, and not many people are here to save me... or even act like they want to. I've been going insane. I feel at peace knowing what I'm about to do. Life was beautiful, I hope yours goes a little better than mine did. I love you all, thank you for everything.
