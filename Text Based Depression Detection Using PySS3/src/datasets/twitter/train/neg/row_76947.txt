I wish more people didnâ€™t see suicide as an inherently bad thingI donâ€™t want to die to make anyone sad, or to make anyone elseâ€™s life difficult. 

Iâ€™ve just accepted that this life isnâ€™t for me. 

And Iâ€™m the only one thatâ€™s inside my own head. So why should I have to live with that 

More people should just accept that for some people, theyâ€™ve just naturally reached the ending of their story. 

And they should have the choice when that ending happens.
