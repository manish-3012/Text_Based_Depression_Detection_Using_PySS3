TiredLife canâ€™t be numbing yourself with various drugs and behaviors until you canâ€™t take it any more and end it. I just cut myself at least 10 times and oddly. The sting isnâ€™t too painful anymore. I almost want to roll my bloody arm in the concrete to see what more damage I can do. Iâ€™m numb. Iâ€™ve given up even trying to live life. Iâ€™m tired. I tried to not be alone. Tried to be friendly. Just canâ€™t seem to accept Iâ€™m meant to be dead inside. Meant to hurt every other second of my blessed life. My own apartment, food in my stomach. But whatâ€™s the point. A girl couldnâ€™t love what I am. Iâ€™m codependent. Bitter. Distant. I maintain a blank demeanor because I donâ€™t know better. I literally canâ€™t relate to anyone. Iâ€™m probably not human. In a human body. Iâ€™m through complaining. I need someone to bounce suicide ideas off of. None of my â€œfriendsâ€ will help me leave with some sense of peace. Any takers?
