Can't take this anymoreAll I wanted was some help for depression.. instead the antidepressant messed up my dick and 9 months after taking basically one pill. My sexual function ain't the same.
Ironic? bad luck? What a pathetic way to go.. but really, i miss the 100% of sexual function too much, I thought sex was about the only redeeming thing in life and now it's been messed with. What a stupid age where "doctors" and pharma are murderers, i wish to reborn in an age where we don't allow this to happen. I want to die because of it.
