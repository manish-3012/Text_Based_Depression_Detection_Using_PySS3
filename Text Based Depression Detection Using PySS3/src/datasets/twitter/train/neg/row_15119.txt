I know someone who is planning to end it. How can I completely anonymously help?Title. My friend has "set a date" and is planning to end it then. How can I anonymously help without being asked who I am, and why I know about it. I feel like 911 will ask my name, and I really don't want the information to get out, because I can't deal with it anymore. It's been overwhelming watching his descent, and I want him to realize his potential. I was thinking the police directly rather than an emergency number, but I'm not sure.
