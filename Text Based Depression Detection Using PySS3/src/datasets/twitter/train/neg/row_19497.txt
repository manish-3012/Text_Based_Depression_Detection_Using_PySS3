Agitated Depression - Desperately Need Help - Unsure of What to DoI have bipolar and am currently only medicated on adderall for my ADD. I've gotten to the point where for the past month I feel like I am almost always completely in a state of agitated depression. I have tons of energy but I hate myself and I hate life and I hate most of the people I use to care about. On top of it I have a really terrible, unsympathetic exfriend who has been subtly manipulating those around me to make me feel like the bad guy for having a different opinion than her. While that may sound paranoid, I only have this paranoia because I have seen her do it to multiple "friends" when they have a falling out... So between working regular time (25-30 hours) under a turbulent boss, dealing with going to school full time, taking care of two cats, cleaning the house by myself, and trying to handle my emotions, I am ready to explode. I just want some stupid meds to help me not to have a full on psychotic meltdown and try to kill myself. Going to the ER will add financial stress that will, in the long run, not help the current issue, but I cannot see my new psychiatrist for another 20 days. I legitimately question if I can hang in there that long. My thoughts keep getting darker and more self-harmful. Please help me, anyone.
