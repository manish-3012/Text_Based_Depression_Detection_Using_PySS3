All I do is push people awayAnd I keep hurting myself and others. What kind of life is that? I hope I rot in an early grave. I deserve absolutely nothing from life. Everything I do receive is blindly given. People don't understand how I feel. And I can't tell them, because I don't know how to explain the severity of it. I have no one to talk to, and even if I did, it wouldn't work out because I would just push them away. I'm the lowest scum on earth. Someone please shoot me.
