My new nightly ritualThis is my new plan. Hold a gun to my head for an hour and list all the ways in which I'm a piece of shit and deserve to die and all the ways in which the world would be better off without me.

I'll do this every night at the same time until I can finally get over my cowardice and pull the trigger.
