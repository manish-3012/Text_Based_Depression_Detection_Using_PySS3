Hi everyone. Please can you comment any encouraging words to help me carry on. I'm in a really really bad space right now.I have no one to talk to. Well the one person I have isn't helping at all. All I need is some encouraging words. Just something to give me a little motivation. Right now I really really want to kill myself. But I can't. I'm too weak. So now I'm just sitting here hurting so much I can't breath. Please just help me. I feel so alone.

Sorry for bothering everyone.
