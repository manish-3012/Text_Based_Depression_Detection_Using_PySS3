I have not found any type of happiness in the last 8 years.I am fat, ugly, and useless. College is so stressful and I can't take it anymore. I want to commit suicide but I don't own a gun.  


The last 8 years of my life has been a never-ending road of depression and sadness. I try to do well in school but always end up average or get tired and lazy. In February I tried to lose weight to ask out a girl for my final year of prom but what do you know happened? My appendix burst and a pandemic started. I have been all alone in my life constantly at home and have not seen anyone. My final years of high school have been empty with no friends. My father is always travelling away and my mother is constantly working. I barely got into college and it was a program I despise. It is something my parents forced me into it. Even then my dreams to excel in life always get cut short.   
My professors treat me like shit and don't believe me when there are technical issues with technology in an online school. I just want to end it all this stress. I feel I won't have to worry anymore. I have gone outside for the last 10 days figuring out ways to die swiftly.  


If I could rewind time and go back to when I had the freedom to change my outcome I would.
