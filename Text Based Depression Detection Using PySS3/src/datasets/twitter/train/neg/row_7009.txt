i just want to go away
i guess itâ€™s not inherently that i want to die, but i just donâ€™t want to be me. i just want it all to stop. iâ€™ve been holding on to that â€œlife happens. things will improve.â€ for long enough to know that isnâ€™t true for everyone.

when youâ€™re biologically unattractive, piss broke and dominated by anxiety, you tend not to do very well.

iâ€™m so fucking sick of myself.

i just wish i was someone else.

iâ€™m so tired of being lonely.

iâ€™m so tired of crying all night.

iâ€™m so tired of living this life.

i cant do it anymore.
