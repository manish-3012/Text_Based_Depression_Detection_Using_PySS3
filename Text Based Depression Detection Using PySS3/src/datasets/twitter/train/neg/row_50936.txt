I wish I had some sort of illness or disease so I could die without having to kill myselfi don't wanna be alive, but i also don't want to take my own life- does that make sense?

i feel like if i kill myself, a bunch of people (my husband, my parents, my brother, my best friends) will all feel like they could have prevented it. i don't want them to lose sleep thinking about times when they could have reached out.

also my parents, brother, and best friends all think i'm living the life right now, and i don't want them to know that i've been struggling. i don't want them to worry about me. i think it'd be easier for them to accept that i was enjoying a life that got cut short, rather than i ended a life that i wasn't actively living.

-------------

with that being said, my husband's been nagging me to go see a doctor about this weird mole on my body. i've been putting off scheduling an appointment in hopes that it's actually melanoma and becomes less treatable with time.

the more i think about it, the worse i feel. here i am, willing to throw away a perfectly functioning body while there are people out here who actually have terminal illness and are putting up a tough fight for their lives. i wish i could understand what they're fighting for.
