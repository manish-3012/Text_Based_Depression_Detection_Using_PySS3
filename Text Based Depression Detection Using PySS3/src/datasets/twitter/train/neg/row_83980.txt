Iâ€™m killing myself through voluntary dehydrationI canâ€™t find how long itâ€™ll take but Iâ€™m guessing 3 days for me. Before I started I ate ~400 calories for 2 days and purged and took laxatives. I Looked how long itâ€™ll take to die and I keep getting very different results. Iâ€™m afraid itâ€™ll take up to 5 days because I am a physically healthy teenager. I am currently 30 hours in and I am in pain, probably from the laxative abuse and purging. Pfft of course itâ€™s from those things. currently I am experiencing headaches, my stomach and chest hurt, and I get dizzy standing up. I keep cramping in my stomach and I feel physically bad but honestly this is the happiest Iâ€™ve been in a long time. I feel guilty for doing this but finally itâ€™ll end
