No Hope for TomorrowMidnight will strike soon, and it'll be tomorrow. Ah, tomorrow, what a terrible day. I wonder what will happen? The same old thing? Maybe the same old thing, but with more problems. Perhaps the same old thing with more problems that I have no money for.

Boy, oh boy. I wonder what will come the day after that. Christ, why should I bother. What's keeping me going anymore. I don't really know. Another day, another month, another year. All of it dragging on. All while I can barely remember them. 

What's going to change tomorrow? I win the lottery? I find my purpose in life? I meet the person who I would love for the rest of my life? It didn't happen for years, and I doubt it'll happen another several. Maybe world peace would happen! What a load.

Maybe, just maybe, something good will come, and it'll be absolutely wonderful. Then tomorrow will happen, and it's all gone. Nothing left, but fading memories. Back to the usual song and dance.

Look, I don't know what to tell you folks that you probably haven't heard before. I'm tired, I'm lonely, I don't know what I'm doing. I'm not sure if I will.

One day, I'll make some bread, say my goodbyes, and this old fool will die a coward's death. Only then will tomorrow never come again.
