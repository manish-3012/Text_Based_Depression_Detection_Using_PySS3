????I'm thinking about getting a motel room and hanging myself. I'll leave some extra cash behind for whoever has to find me.

I don't understand reality. The guilt traps, the duality, the hatred, the anger, the love, everything. I just want to put my hand up and say NO MEANS NO!! like in those anti-rape videos and dissolve the whole thing. Fuck, I'd even settle for a temporary respite from myself and the world at this point.

We could be doing ANYTHING but we're forced to do THIS THING and I'm not sure I understand. I surmise it might be some kind of cosmic punishment but how does that even make any sense? People accrue more and more behaviors to be punished for the longer they stay here. It's a trap, I can't see it any other way.

I got drunk last night and told my mom I hated her because she won't let me die. It's true that I'm frustrated, but I don't hate her. I think, I was thinking, at the time, that any friendly attempt of severing our relationship would fail so I'd have to get aggressive. So the damage was a lie but -it was still done-. I hate this so much, I don't want to hurt her or anyone else. Guilt is fucking me up for not just this, but everything. She just wants everything to be okay just like I do, but I see futility in her path and I'm sure she sees insanity and delusion in mine.

I have to do it now, because otherwise she will put me on antipsychotics, which I can't stand the idea of. I am not going to fall to a system I hate just so I can be her lobotomized companion that doesn't have feelings (that may be unjustified) she doesn't like or that ruin our relationship. That is taking it too far.

Also I can't stop fucking hallucinating insects vomiting and eating each other. I think this is where I'm going to go when I die because I have been so disrespectful. I'm afraid that once I get there, I'll never get out. 

I want it all to end. I want to wake up in some elven woodland town and realize this was all just a nonsensical nightmare.
