I just need to get this off my chest to people who wonâ€™t judge meitâ€™s been an awful week. iâ€™ve had problems with depression and anxiety before, but this week has been so overwhelming for me that iâ€™m not sure I can push through another day. I had a terrible breakupâ€” a relationship of almost four years to a guy I wanted to marry, and today I had a massive blowout argument with my
mother (who I still live with) and now sheâ€™s kicking me out in 30 days. she relocated the whole family to southern california, and now I need to somehow find a place to live with no credit, no car, and with a $16/hr job. If you know southern california, you know iâ€™m fâ€™ed.

these problems probably pale in the light of what most of you are facing... but I feel so overwhelmed that I donâ€™t know if I can even survive tonight. I have contemplated and even planned suicide before but never went through with it. there is no feasible way for me to continue being alive. I literally cannot
afford to be alive here in 30 days. I have no car and no place to live. I have no friends in this state because of the relocation. Even then, i donâ€™t have many friends to begin with. 

the fear and overwhelming sense of dread I have are completely taking over. i can almost physically feel the depression and urge to end my life in my chest. I am so scared of being homeless and i feel so alone. I have been contemplating the act for hours. 

I probably wonâ€™t go through with it. There are no medications in the medicine cabinet I can feasibly use, and i donâ€™t want my parents to have to clean anything when iâ€™m gone. I canâ€™t put them through that along with my death. 

I guess iâ€™m just posting because i canâ€™t say this to anyone else. iâ€™m so terrified. i am so alone.
