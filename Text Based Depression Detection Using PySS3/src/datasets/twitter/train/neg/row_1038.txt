Am I truly suicidalI would say I am usually a pretty happy person but suicide and death seem to be in the very back of my mind. I usually don't notice it but there are times where I've had a bad experience and I automatically start thinking about killing myself. Sometimes I imagine different scenarios in my head and a lot of the time they get really dark or bad and I kill myself. These thoughts don't appear too often though and like I said I am usually happy. Am I actually suicidal?
