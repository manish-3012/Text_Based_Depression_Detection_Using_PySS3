Do you ever feel like your reason isn't enough?Title.

Most of the posts on here are people talking about how their gf dumped them, they are homeless, their friends abandoned them etc. and while that is absolutely horrible, I envy them. (Not to shit on people's life)

Because in my mind, they good reasons to kill themself. My life seems like wonderland in comparison yet I also want to die, but now I don't have anyy good reasons other than "I'm depressed" and "I was bullied" which were horrible to me but seems like nothing to other people. I want their life, I want my family to hate me, anything to give me a good reason.
