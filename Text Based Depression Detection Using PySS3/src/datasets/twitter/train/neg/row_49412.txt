Thank youI just want to leave my last words somewhere, so anywhere is fine. Not going to share any stories or reason, I'm just going to leave my jumbled words of thanks and apologies as words that'll remain somewhere for a while. I just need to get this off my chest so please stop reading if you're trying to make your life better.

First of all, mom, dad, and my wonderful siblings, thank you for everything. Thank you being the driving force and light that kept me going. You were all the reason why I trudged on to this day. Thank you for all the memories and for everything... I am proud to share the same family blood as all of you. You are all strong, loving, and bright... I hope you can all forgive me one day for everything and carry on without me. I'm sorry that I couldn't be a better son or an elder brother... I just can't carry on anymore. I'm tired of living a life of escaping this dark world of mine only to spiral down again. I'm too weak to fight this mental disorder of mine. The madness has caved in. I'm sorry that I've lied to you all over and over again to continue my path of self ruin. But please understand that you can't help someone who aint looking for it... My words will never be enough to express my gratitude, love and apology so my reason for leaving you all doesn't matter... cause in the end, I'm going to off myself. So thank you, I'm sorry and I love you. I'll never forget everything you've done for me, even if hell takes me. Good bye, my loves.

Next, my wonderful friends. I'm sorry that I distanced myself and cut myself off from you all. I know that I'm just a shadow in your memory now but I still want to apologize for not being there for you all. I was just too weak and caught up in my own sh\*\* to think from your point of view... and no matter what I say, it won't matter now... so I'll keep it simple. Thank you for all the beautiful memories and the good times that I've shared with you guys. J, C, N, G, L, T, D, J, R, and M... and I'm sorry that I'm too weak to find/see you all. I'm sorry for being such a horrible friend. Thank you all, I love you and I'm sorry... if the universe allows it, I hope we can all meet again somewhere... but I know that's just wishful thinking. Farewell, my brothers and sisters.

As for this world, thank you for allowing me to experience this animation, happiness, pain and suffering. Thank you for teaching me. Although it was short, I've lived a quarter of a century and that is enough for me. This world is beautiful and bright... too damn bright for a worm like me. Thank you and I'm sorry that you passed the baton onto worthless scum like me.

As for the person who read this far, I know you still want to live. I may be an egotistic and selfish person, but I know you are all strong... stronger than a stranger like me. It might sound arrogant and worthless coming from a guy like me, but you can do this. You can fight this darkness, there is a light. This world has shown me many times that there is a light at the end, I've felt it. This world is so damn vast, my friends. I'm just too weak and a pathetic coward to continue. I can no longer feel anything. Not through a hug or from forced laughter. Not from words of encouragement or going outside with you guys... just my inability to even care. This may sound over dramatic and stupid, but I don't want to live a hollow shell for the rest of my life. It's like I've unlearned everything and was torn apart from this world. This life just aint for me, so I'll let natural selection do its thing... Thank you all for being part of an infinity that makes this beautiful world go round. Yeah, I'm not good with words so I guess that's it. Good bye, world.
