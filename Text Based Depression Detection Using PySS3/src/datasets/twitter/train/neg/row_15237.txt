hii'm not really expecting anyone to really be able to help me, but i just thik it would be goood for me to talk about how i'm feeling in case I do something silly. i'm finding it really hard to function like this, i'm right in the middle of my exams and assignments and all i'm doing is crying.

I don't really know how to tell people how I feel, and I posted in the depression subreddit yesterday, but today it just really hit me how much I am not okay. Food doesn't taste like it usually does, I am really struggling to perform the simplest of actions, i'm even finding it difficult to think clearly. I dont want to kill myself, I just want to die. 

i'm not expecting anyone to respond or reply, but at least I can say I've tried to do something
