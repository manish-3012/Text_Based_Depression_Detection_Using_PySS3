Would anything even happen if I shot myself?I know, I know, I know, that sounds ridiculous and delusional. Iâ€™m not even going to ask you to hear me out, because I donâ€™t expect anyone to agree with me, I just wanted to get these thoughts out. 

Right now it feels like I have no impact on the world. I drive for Uber but am technically unemployed, Iâ€™m very socially isolated, Iâ€™m very depressed so itâ€™s hard for me to enjoy any activities that are supposed to be recreational. I go to the gym sometimes, I read sometimes, I talk to my parents, I pet my dog, I sometimes talk to friends, I meditate occasionally, but I never really feel entirely â€œall thereâ€. I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m living in some sort of simulation or something, but I certainly donâ€™t really feel human anymore. Itâ€™s very hard for me to connect to others, or to even want to make connections, in the way that I used to. 

I feel like Iâ€™m living a life of very little consequence, and Iâ€™m really very tempted to push the boundaries to see if anything is really real. I have no desire to hurt others, I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m that far gone, and I donâ€™t think I really bear that much animosity towards the world, even though I donâ€™t feel like Iâ€™m a part of it. My thoughts have been turning to self-harm and suicide, since those seem like the easiest and most obvious ways to test the limits of existing. Iâ€™ve cut myself before, to get out emotional pain, but I havenâ€™t done that in a while. When I think about suicide itâ€™s hard to believe that anything would change if I put a gun to my head and pulled the trigger â€” Iâ€™m not 100% sure Iâ€™m even alive right now.
