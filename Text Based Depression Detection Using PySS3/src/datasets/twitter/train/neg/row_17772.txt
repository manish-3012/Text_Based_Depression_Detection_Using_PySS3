What happens during and after voluntarily seeking emergency mental health help? Crossposting because I need itI'm ready to die. But I dont want to. I just deserve to. I dont have money to call a doctor and make an appointment though and I'm out of time. I'm currently freaking out at work. I dont plan on making it home tonight. If I go to a hospital and they need money right away then theres no point. If it'll fuck up my background for the rest of my life then theres no point either. I know I sound like a picky beggar but I'm lost with nowhere to turn. I fucking hate my society where this shit is so hard.
