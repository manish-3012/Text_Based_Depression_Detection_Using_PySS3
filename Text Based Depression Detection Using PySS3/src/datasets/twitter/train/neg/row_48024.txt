I just can't live life feeling like thisI lost my job nov 2018 because my depression was taking me over. And it completely shattered me. Ive been in a state of denial and like a zombie since. Pretending everything's ok and been lying to everyone saying i got another job ( i feel emmense guilt for that.) And I have barely left my room in like 4 months. So i havent paid rent this month yet. And now my landlord told me sunday that I have to move out. I have relatives here. But You know i fucking did this to myself. I hate what ive become. I CANT bare to tell them what ive done. Im a piece of shit. I have not told a single person as im too ashamed of myself. People reading this are probably thinking oh this person is a lazy piece of shit just get a job. But truth is I completely have given up. I have no fight left. I dont see happiness in the future. It seems impossible. Im ready to just die. Theres no purpose here for me.
