I just donâ€™t think I can do it anymore.Iâ€™ve been getting better at loving myself, but then time and time again like clockwork some ridiculously trivial problem will come up and I just drop right back down to that familiar place that we all learn to love. Itâ€™s unhealthy though, to constantly be at that point, and so Iâ€™ll cry it out and try again. I get constantly reminded of my past by friends and family and itâ€™s not their fault.
