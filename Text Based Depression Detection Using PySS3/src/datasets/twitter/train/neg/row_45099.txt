I think im readyWhen i survived the suicide attempt back in jan. I was given a second chance. I used it to see my best friends. I used it to have a lot of fun. But, now im basically out of money, out of options, and nothing is going my way. I had an amazing time, but i think its time to end it all. I used the second chance very well. I was going to suicide last night, but i got lost and had to go back to y friends house. So now im looking at today!

Edit: yeah pretty sure if i cant make something work out in the next 4 hours, im just going to dose.
