can someone hold me accountable to not diemy lifes been destroyed but some hopeful strand still wants to be here. this is the 3rd year after my friend committed suicide. im finally older than they were when they died. i think i attempted suicide on the 14th or 15th after. i thought i was good and kind once. i want to be good and kind again. i want to be worthy of loving
