Am i the only one who feels like wanting to die but is too afraid of self-harm?I do have a partner that really loves me and cares for me, and so does some great friends. But more often than not, i just wanted to end my life. I just couldn't do self-harm because i've a very low pain tolerance and that i always wondered what if i do that and still get to live? if only i own a gun, i would've ended my life sooner but then it's too expensive from where i am and that i needed to get licensed. I was thinking of medicine overdose as an alternative but chances are i'd still get to live. Apart from that, i didn't want to be a burden to my gf and her family by letting them shoulder the expenses in case i die.
I'm so sorry for posting this. It might not be approved or be removed but i have no one else to talk to about this. Some of you might say that I should discuss this with my gf or with my friends, but like I said, i didn't want to burden them with my own issues as they already have theirs. Besides, some will just ask "why, what's wrong?" but then what's next? I feel like no one will understand and people are too busy to even check out on me and the worst things are that others will think i'm just being overly dramatic and that this too shall pass.

I just want the pain to end. I want everything to end. But it's too damn complicated and idk what to do.
