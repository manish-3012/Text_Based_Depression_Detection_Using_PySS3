I donâ€™t know what to doI feel so lonely these days and i donâ€™t know what to do.I have to often deal with my suicidal and deppressing thoughts.I canâ€™t tell anybody,because i feel like they would call my crazy.I love my family and i have feelings for a girl and i would like to tell her that i like her,but iâ€˜m too scared to tell her.That is my biggest problem in my life:I am too scared to tell her or tell my family about my suicidal thoughts.Iâ€˜m grateful for everything that i have,but i feel so f*cked up and it feels like it eats me up from inside.I donâ€™t know what to do.I would be very grateful for help.
