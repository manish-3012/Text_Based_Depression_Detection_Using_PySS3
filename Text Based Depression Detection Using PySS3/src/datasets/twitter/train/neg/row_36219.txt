My job makes me feel fucking worthless and like I can't do anything right. Maybe I'm just too stupid to work/live in today's society.It's Monday again. Spent the whole day dreading going to work tomorrow. Don't want to sleep because I don't want to wake up. I seriously fucking hate my life and don't have the courage or the strength to change it. I just feel like I'm so shitty at my job, like I'm literally not worth fucking anything. I stay late everyday but feel like I still don't get much done. My experiment failed again, so I have to do it again. Next week, I have to give a presentation and I literally feel like I would rather die than give it. I fucking hate my job and it makes me want to die everyday, but I hate myself because I don't have the willpower to apply for others and change my life. I don't feel in control of my own life and I hate myself for it. 

Why isn't physician assisted suicide legal? If it was, I'd probably be gone the week it was legalized, tbh.  

Seriously wish a car would hit me on my way to work (I think this pretty much everyday) or I would just randomly have a heart attack or something. I'm scared of killing myself, but I don't see the point of living if everyday feels like hell. And I don't see any way out, because I need money to live, and I need a job to make money. Too bad every fucking job makes me feel like I'm fucking nothing. I'm just too fucking stupid to live, I guess. I can't do simple calculations or follow simple instructions. Everyday I think about how I can't fucking do it. I can't do life for another 60 years. 

Every day is a living hell. I want to die. I don't give a shit about my job and I don't even try anymore.. don't give a shit about performance reviews, meetings, anything. I'm apathetic in a way that I never have been before.
