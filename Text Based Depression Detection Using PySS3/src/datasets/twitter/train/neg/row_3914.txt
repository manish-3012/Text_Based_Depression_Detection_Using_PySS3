I want to kill myself because I am a 22 year old virginWhat hope is there left for a 22 year old male virgin like me? People view male virgins as lesser beings, inferior to them.

It doesn't matter that I'm smart or above average looking, all that matters is that I'm a virgin and that means I am undesireable and that no girl would EVER want to date me.
