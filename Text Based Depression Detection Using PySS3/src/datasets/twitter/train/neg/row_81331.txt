I have no idea what my brain is doing anymore.I've been getting back on my feet lately, and even got my own one bedroom apartment after spending some time living in a motel. Not by choice, of course, housing in this city is extremely scarce, and the only reason I got this apartment was because the landlord had a big enough heart to disregard my terrible credit score. I'm 2 credits away from obtaining my Grade 12 diploma, albeit a little late, at least I'm getting it, and hopefully moving into a very competitive Paramedic program for college. 
The thing is, I don't know what my brain is doing. I'm achieving everything I've wanted to. I should be on cloud 9. And I am sometimes. But out of nowhere my brain blindsides me and I take a flaming nose dive into the biggest bouts of depression I've ever experienced. But it only lasts a few hours or at the very most, a day. And then I'm fine again? My best friend is suspecting Manic Depression, and suggests I get the ball rolling with a Mental health Referral, but here in good ol' Canada, that process can take anywhere from 6 months to a year. That's why we've been having such a mental health crisis recently. People go to the hospital for suicidal ideation  and even actual attempts, and they stick you in a room for a few hours before you get to talk to a nurse for 5 minutes, and then you walk out of there with a piece of paper with crisis hotline numbers on it and that's it. No further help. 
I keep wondering what's up with my brain, though. I've been diagnosed with Depression In the past but this is new, and a lot worse.
When I dive into those bouts of depression I tend to have extremely vivid and intense suicidal ideation. Like if I looked at a spoon I would try to find a way to end my life with it, and then after a little while, I would be okay.
I just wanna know if I can fix this. I hate medications, they just zombify people....
