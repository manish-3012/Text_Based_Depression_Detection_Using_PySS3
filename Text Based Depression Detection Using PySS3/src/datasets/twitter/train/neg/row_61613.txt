My parents donâ€™t realize that they arenâ€™t helping.When i tell them how much it hurts and how much i hate living and how i canâ€™t deal with whatâ€™s going on around me because of it, they sometimes reply with â€œWell itâ€™s going to get harder than this as you grow older.â€ and hearing that makes me want to die even more. Right now thereâ€™s nothing making me happy nothing i enjoy everyday is pain and it doesnâ€™t get better. If itâ€™s supposed to get worse than this, then whatâ€™s the point in living?
