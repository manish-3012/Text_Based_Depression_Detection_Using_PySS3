I'm wasting my summer, my life, while everyone else parties and has fun.Menial tasks feel like boot camp, small mistakes are new reasons to kill myself, the slightest hint of happiness is fake so I must self detonate into an oblivion of sadness and existential despair, I spend all my time trying to make others happy (without ever receiving appreciation. In fact, I usually get yelled at for not trying hard enough) and never get the slightest sign of reciprocation. Would it seriously *hurt* you to say "Hey, are you okay?" without getting angry if the reply isn't "Yeah, just tired!" Why do you believe I'm tired all the time, it's not possible in a healthy person. 

I digress back into my rant about here.

I thought getting two new dogs would make me happy, you know, the whole "yay! Touchable happiness!" shabang, but no. They are killing me. I don't want to deal with them, but I want them to be happy. And no one ever notices the fact I can't function, let alone function for two tiny rage monsters. I just want the pain to go away, but I still have this puny string of hope dangling in front of me keeping me from ever doing it. Telling me I will never be able to achieve the things I planned. But at the same time I know I won't be able to achieve half of them and the other half are difficult, and I know I'm weak and will give up. In so many ways give up.

You can see where I started getting emotional and my writing got worse. I went through and spell checked a lot of things (hard to write and cry), in case anyone actually read this.
