My school made me do a protocol doctors visit and he talked me downIn high school I was severely bullied and had a very difficult time socially. I was accused of being an alcoholic (never drank), sociopath (wasnt), and physically abusive to two girls (again, I was not). This gave me severe fear of abandonment issues in college. Its unique for me to actually have friends and I have a fear they dont like me and I am a burden because I have been conditioned for 18 years to believe kids my age hate me. It also triggers suicidal thoughts.

The other night I got extremely drunk (legally on a semester abroad, I am only 18) to try and prove to a girl I had a high tolerance. All I remember is being in my room at 3AM with our university paramedics, security, a head RA, and two staff members from my school back in the US. I donâ€™t know what happened but apparently I was telling my roommates I was going to strangle myself.

I was required to go to a psychiatrist the next day and he said that what people said back home must have had some truth to it because people donâ€™t make stuff that harsh up and he also said all my friends will leave me if I ask for their support too much. I have another therapist, but because it was an emergency I had to see this other one, and he decided to tell me all of my biggest triggers are true. I have never felt so hurt in my life.

He just ruined all of the therapy I have had and all of the progress I have made and I donâ€™t know what to do. I think I might call a hotline and just talk tonight or will listen to music. Im not suicidal right now, but I do have severe mood swings and Im genuinely terrified. I have never had issues like this in the past (even high school) so I donâ€™t know what to do. I have no methods to cope. I think talking will help.
