I just can't anymoreYesterday my power was turned off because I dont make enough money on unemployment to pay my bills. It will be my fault that my partner will be homeless by next month and its killing me. 

I have played the game the way I was told. I worked as hard as I could during college, engaging in classes and research projects. I even won a few awards and graduated summa cume laude. I have sent out 627 applications in the last year for positions that I'm well qualified for and have been rejected or ignored for all of them, not even a chance to interview. 

Your always taught if you just play the game right things will work out, but it won't. No one cares. Nothing you do matters. All of your hard work is pointless. I don't care anymore. I'm done. I'm sick of being a worthless leach no matter how hard I try.

 I feel so guilty every time a bill Is due and we can't afford it because I know it's my fault since I'm the one who is unemoloyed But I don't know what else to do. I don't understand what's wrong with me. 

I'm just so tired. I regret ever getting involved with my partner because I know I have been nothing but a negative impact on their life. I tried my hardest but I lost. I'm out of time and the only way out is a contest of wills between me and gravity, but I'm sure I'll lose that too.
