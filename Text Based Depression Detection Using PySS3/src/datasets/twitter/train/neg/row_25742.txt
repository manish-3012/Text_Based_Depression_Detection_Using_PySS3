It's just curiosity by nowI'm 20. I've been depressed since I was 13, suicidal since 17. My life is pretty decent - I have a stable family, no money problems, in college with good job prospects. I keep feeling that I want more than this.
I keep feeling that I need perfection. Perfect body, perfect mind, perfect people around me - it's not gonna happen. Figures.
But it's more than that - I keep wanting hope, at least, for something better, like love, beauty, things like that. But I know that there's nothing like that that's the way I'd like it. Everything is done so we get something pleasing, no difference between one night stand and a love of our lives. Everything we do is for the sake of ourselvess, and it's something I can't accept. I want to have all of this, but pure, not for me, or some other kind of pleasure, but just... I don't know, the way you could think of love after watching a movie. Without this meaninglessness, and egoism, and just as good as we all want it to be. But it doesn't work like that.
I should just get over it and take it all as it is. I know that. But I'd rather off myself than go through life that is so broken, not just for me, but for everyone, and I think I will.
I'm leaving for summer vacation with my family soon, and for some reason I'd like to save myself the pain of it and do it before that. I won't, mainly due to the lack of means, but I think that I'm getting fully ready now, after all those years, to finally go through with it.

Sorry if I'm ranty, but I never could tell anyone any of that, and I'd like to take the chance to blurt it all out here. Thanks for paying attention.
