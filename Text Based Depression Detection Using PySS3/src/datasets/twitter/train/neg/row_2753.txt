Why do I get to liveFreshman year my brother got arrest and then I went into high school and I became scared. I didn't have friends that I could talk to and I HATE talking to my parents so I had no one. Then I started to have trouble finish papers and then it grew and I felt panicked. I froze. Last year I got all C's and I hated myself. So I went to go see the school's shrink and she said I had depression. I didn't do anything about it and stopped seeing her. My grades got worse and then I failed a class and even started cheating and stealing. This year I was doing poorly in the beginning and then I started to lean on people more and started to do better in my classes. I still can't write anything by myself but my grades are up. I thought when my grades were better I would not hate myself. This is not the first time I have wanted to kill myself but the feeling is so strong. I am having a recurring thought that won't go away, "Some one in my class should die. Its only fair." Why do I think that. I have thought about it intensely. My teacher said that lean on people a bit to much and this would be way to much if I told anyone. Why do I get to live?
