I completely lost everything last year and I see no hope for my futureEvery single day I think about killing myself, however, I can't pull it off because I know it would make my mom distraught. I am in my mid-twenties and I had everything; a loving community, a girlfriend, and a future career. Suddenly, because of some mistakes on my part, I lost all of it in a span of one month. Now I am living with my parents and I am working at a grocery store. This is shameful for me, I traveled the world with prestigious internships and I was on the fast track to be a professor. I graduated in the near top of my class in college and was praised by many academics.

Now I am just a washed up loser who has no future. My old community is going along without me and I miss them so much, however, I know I can never go back. I burned to many bridges and I will be going back with my tail in-between my legs. Because of my selfishness I ruined my life and the only thing that keeps me from blowing my brains out is my mom. Now every day I look at my mistakes and think about how things could have been. I just want to end my life, nothing would make me happier, but I know what it would do to my mom.
