I think I'm readyI've felt suicidal for a while now and I think it's time.  Been depressed and have social anxiety for a while and people say I'm emotionless. Also I'm ugly and short and never had a gf. I'm 20 and about to go back to college but I have less than a 2.0 GPA and my parents are forcing me to take my classes online instead of in a classroom because they think it will be easier for me to imrpvoe my grades, which I disagree. I go to a large public state school and I'm going to be really lonely if I can't meet people in college. I just don't want to deal with it and I'd rather just kill myself. I don't really see a future for me and the only people who would really care about me are close family and they would probably get over it eventually. I spent most of my summer playing video games to try and distract my depression, but its still there. I'm too scared to ask for help.
