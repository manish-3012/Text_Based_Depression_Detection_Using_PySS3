i can't think of proper title tbhso, i have never done anything useful for about 2 years now, i have not been outside my apartment for 2 months now, i even developed some kind of fear of getting outside, i have no friends, i have been in 2 relationships...the last of them was in 2015, both of them used me as a rebound actually, so no real interest towards me. i was prevented from studying science and forced to study management (long story), and i have been failing miserably in it, i should have been graduated 2 years ago but my numbers are catastrophic, and i don't give a dime about it, i never wanted this field. my mom knows all that and realise how miserable i am, so she pays me for food and internet, though she is getting iffy by time and (even though she has good intentions) but she is actually 
part of my problem because she helps me with what she finds best, not what i find best...which is not getting me far and make it  worse

i actually have nothing, even if i committed suicide no one would even care no friend no lover no one even my hobbies are so hard for me to practice, i feel i am getting mad if did not end all this, i'm useless burden to myself before everyone who cares about me, whom in turn are not much. had other people lived instead of me, they would have fared far better than me
