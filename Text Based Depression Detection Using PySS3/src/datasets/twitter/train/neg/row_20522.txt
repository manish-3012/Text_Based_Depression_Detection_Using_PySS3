Can someone chat with me?Hello friends. I really need someone to talk to. I can't  talk with my friends irl because I'm faking different personalities and have huge trust issues, I know it's wrong. But right now I'm in a very dark place and I feel all alone. I can't do anything, tried to push myself to do exercise and go out but I can't. I start to cry even thinking about doing things. I dealt with depression for a really long time but I found ways to keep it under control since 1-2 years.
Now I feel like it's all coming back, I feel scared and broken. I would probably feel better if I can talk with someone who understands, I've been writing and deleting posts since morning but.. here it is. If you wanna chat, about anything really hmu. 

For the ones who also struggling right now: i try to remind myself I'm having a bad moment, not a bad life. Its hard but I suggest you do too and I hope you will feel better soon, sending you all my love.
