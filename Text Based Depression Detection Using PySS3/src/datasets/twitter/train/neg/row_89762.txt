I want you all to do what i do...Hold on to whatever feeling is keeping you from committing suicide and never let it go. Maybe it's fear, maybe it's that you know you don't really want to die, or maybe you just can't leave someone like that. Whatever the reason, make it the reason why you don't follow through every time you feel that horrible feeling. Sending positive vibes and love to all of you guys that truly understand what it's like to have suicidal thoughts. Tonight, I'm having a really rough night and I'm going to remember to hold on to that feeling that keeps me from doing anything I won't be able to take back.
