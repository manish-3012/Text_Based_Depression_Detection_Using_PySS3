1-800-Suicide made things WORSE. I had a problem that was completely my fault. I was lying in bed feeling sorry for myself and I really needed someone I could talk to instead of just dumping on reddit, so I called the hotline, thinking I should try it. I didn't want them to send the police-- the suicide I was contemplating wouldn't take place till tomorrow night-- so I was careful not to give the operator my address. Eventually we got to talking about getting a counselor. She found so many results in my zip code that she told me she had to narrow by address. By this time, I figured I'd told her enough times that I was inside my bedroom which was in a house with lots of people in it enough that it would be fine. 

Five minutes later, my dad knocks on my door to tell me the police are here. 

So now my parents are both livid at me, telling me I could have talked to one of them, (could not actually have talked to them-- they're an involved party and I told them this and they won't listen) and wondering why the hell I "lied to the operator and told her I was on the roof." Never once told her I was on the roof. We were to the point of discussing counselors before she got my address! My parents don't seem to realize that I was seriously going to kill myself. 

Not helping: 14 year old little sister had a friend over for a sleepover. One of the cops yelled at my sister and scared her and her friend. And of course the friend called her mom and now her mom knows. They also flashed their stupid high beam lights all over the roof so now the whole neighborhood knows. I don't care, but my parents are holding it against me. 

The sad part: the operator really helped me and put me in a good place before the police showed.
