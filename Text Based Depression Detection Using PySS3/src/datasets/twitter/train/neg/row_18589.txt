The urge to stab myself is persistent.\[19M\] Life has been getting difficult. With watching my parents divorce to seeing all financial support being taken from us, to realizing I may end up homeless before the end of the year due to lack of income. My depression is getting worse with each day and this is the most suicidal I've felt in a long time. I'm afraid of hurting myself and hurting those around me. I'm afraid of leaving my boyfriend alone if I ever go through with something. But the fear of being evicted, of living off of scraps and god knows what is suffocating.

I've always coped with self-harm / self-injury. This is the only way I know how to cope as nothing else ever helps distract me. But lately scratches and cuts aren't really helping. I've been having vivid dreams of stabbing myself, over and over and over. Every time I go to the kitchen I'll pick up a knife and just hold it before putting it back. Sometimes I'll hold it against my neck or wrist, near where I know vital arteries are, but never pushing.

Ultimately I guess I'm just sick of suffering. Sick of having the worst outcome, sick of waking up every morning knowing it may be the last time I'll ever see my bed. I don't have a lot going for me, my mental illnesses preventing me from doing event he most mundane tasks. I don't want to bother my boyfriend or friends with my problems even though they've told me time and time again they will do anything to help me. But every time I'm left alone I can't stop getting closer and closer to stabbing myself, the fear of the knife being dull or missing where I'm aiming becoming more distant thoughts than actual concerns.

You know that quote from Winston Churchill? How he needed something between him and a speeding train at a station to stop himself from jumping on the tracks? What I wouldn't give to having something between me and a sharp piece of metal...
