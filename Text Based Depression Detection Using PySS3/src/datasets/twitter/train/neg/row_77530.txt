I'm just tired of the choicesOk, so I'm kinda young to be around, I'm 14(eight grade) and after I finish this year I have to choose between some high schools and specializations, I was confused about those specializations and then I found something that actually focuses on English that I love, everything would be perfect and I think I can get grades good enough to enter there. After researching some more and asking questions on forums and friends most of it was just negative. There's another option where I can work in IT after I finish high school and university but I have to do Maths, where I'm just bad at. I started mediations at Maths and I feel like I got a little bit better and then the teacher gets me to resolve some problem and I just screw up everything. If I get to the English related specialization I doubt it that I can find any work outside of my country. I just don't know what to do and I'm afraid that I'll just fail all the exams and my parents would probably just throw me out of the house as soon as they legally can. I'm just afraid of all of it, I want to go and work in IT where it pays good but I can't go there because Maths or go to the English related thing and then just finish University and end up working in a McDonalds. I'm sick of all this, my teachers keep telling me that I'm a good student if I try. I've been trying since last year but I just can't get good at anything. I keep screwing everything up at school which then ends up in my parents scream at me and end up in a huge fight like always. I just want to suicide so I can end all this shit, my dad wouldn't probably give a shit anyways. I can't do anything good at all and I've been bullied at school for 3 years and everyone just keeps making fun of me because I'm shy and I just shut up while they make fun of me, if I'd call my parents it would just make everything way worse than before. I just want to end all these choices, bullying and everything.
