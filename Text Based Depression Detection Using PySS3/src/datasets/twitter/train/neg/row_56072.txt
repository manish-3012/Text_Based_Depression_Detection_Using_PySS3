TonightWell i got pretty much everything figured out this time. Just waiting for the sun to go out before I head to the woods. I hope I won't back off at the last second like everytime. Thinking about it, I wish I was smart enough to find a way that ends me up in a hospital bed so i can be taken seriously but i can't come up with anything. At least by going the definitive route everything will be over soon.
