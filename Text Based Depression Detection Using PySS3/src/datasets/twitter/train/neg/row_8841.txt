Help pleaseI lost my bestest friend to a car accident yesterday. He was previously in coma for 3 days and I never even thought about leaving the hospital. I posted it in r/depression because I had nobody to express my feelings to.
So an hour ago I was literally standing on a chair with noose around my neck and it tightened up and I started panicking that if I fall off of this chair I will seriously just die. And the life saving instinct was stronger than willing to join him wherever he is now.
I'm still in shock that I nearly died at age of 16. Bet my friend wouldn't be proud. After all, once he made me promise I'd become a truck driver with him one day and we'd work for the same company, maybe open ours one day. People said focus on the good times you had together. When I did I immediately started missing him too badly. So please, help me get back to normal. What do I even do? Is there any way back to being who I once was?
