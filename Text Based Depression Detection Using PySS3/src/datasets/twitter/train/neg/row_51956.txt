Decided to post my word vomit.Sry if there are grammatical or contextual errors, didn't really check.

For their entire lives, everyone has a choice. To keep on doing what you're doing, or to stop. To take the next step, or to stand still. To live, or to die. Most people aren't aware of the choice, because they donâ€™t even see the latter as an option. It was the same for me. But the scales have been tipping for a long time now, and now theyâ€™ve tipped all the way. Sure, it might be â€œthe shallowest thing youâ€™ve ever heardâ€, but not for me. Iâ€™m not made for this world. To survive, in a world like this, Iâ€™d need to fundamentally reshape who I am, but I canâ€™t change. I wonâ€™t, I donâ€™t want to change. So this is really the only way to stop living like this. 

So, Itâ€™s decided. Iâ€™ll kill myself. Before that though, I need to get used to the fact that Iâ€™m gonna die. Iâ€™m not yet sure how Iâ€™m gonna do it, probably jump. Itâ€™s fast and easy. I was thinking of ODing on pills, but I donâ€™t want to survive and have my brain be fucked. 

I donâ€™t want to die, I want to see TES6, to go to Japan, hear the new Area 11 album. Get a girlfriend. But just like Iâ€™ve gotten used to the fact that Iâ€™ll never have friends; never meet someone who loves me not because they have to, ill get used to the rest as well. August, probably.
