I hate life with a passionI just wanna die.. i dont ever see myself being strong enough to get through this life. I have to do everything all by myself and i know most people can do this but i just cant anymore. I dont want to live i dont want to get old, i dont want a family and kids, i dont want to experience anything in my life. Im just done. I hate living. 
Ive been crying all day now, just think about it. I wish i could find an easy way out, i wish the virus would take me, i wish someone would kidnap me and murder me. Anything out of my control, because i cant do anything. Im so fucking depressed and done. And im all alone all day everyday and i have no one and i dont care to make new friends or anything. I literally dont care about a damn thing anymore. I dont give a fuck to be honest. Let me have this one thing, id give anything just to die. Obviously i need to find my own way out of life, i just need to figure out the easiest way for me because i dont want to endure pain, i dont want to. If i could just get enough money to get some hard enough drugs to od on.
