Really want to kill myself but I canâ€™t tell anyone irl because I donâ€™t want to be sent to a mental hospital againAll I think about is killing myself but I canâ€™t talk to this about anyone. I kinda hinted at it to my therapist and she immediately forced my mom to take me to the ER. That was a couple months ago. I stopped therapy and seeing my psychiatrist because I was kinda angry at my therapist for doing that. They basically said â€œwe canâ€™t help youâ€ and kinda gave up on me so I just went cold turkey on treatment. 

I was expecting things to get worse, but honestly they just stayed the same mostly. So much for treatment... Iâ€™m done with it. Iâ€™ve been through it all: inpatient, partial hospitalization programs, intensive outpatient programs, therapy, psychiatry appointments, meds, everything(except for residential). I just havenâ€™t been getting better and itâ€™s been years. Iâ€™m so tired.

Iâ€™d talk to a suicide hotline, but last time I did, they sent the police to my home so Iâ€™m not doing that again. I feel like I canâ€™t talk to anyone without them locking me up in a psych ward.

Iâ€™ve already been to the psych ward and hospitalized for depression multiple times. I donâ€™t want to go through that again. Everyone says I should go back to the psych ward, but honestly screw that. I refuse. Iâ€™d rather die. If I go back, itâ€™d be like the 10th time. 

I havenâ€™t been doing my schoolwork either. Iâ€™m so behind. My mom wants me to at least take the GED test, but I heard itâ€™s not as good as an actual diploma. I donâ€™t know what to do. I wasnâ€™t planning on living this long and I donâ€™t think I can take it much longer.
