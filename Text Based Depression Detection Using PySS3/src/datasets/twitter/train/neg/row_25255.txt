Gregor SamsaAs I type this, I'm sitting at my warm home with loving parents the next room, having a couple of friends I can contact any moment. Just so you know I don't have any serious problems.

I don't feel I deserve to be loved. I feel like an absolute trash fucking up everything, bothering people around. Making them just slightly uncomfortable, as noone gives a fuck anyway. I feel like the best I can do for this world is to kill myself. I won't do it whatsoever as it seems to take some courage to do it after all, so don't fear. I feel like a terrible friend or son or a human being. I feel like avoiding my friends and prentending everything's okay simply not to tire them with my young lazy cunt's character. I feel like Gregor Samsa waking up one day, discovering the truth about himself.
