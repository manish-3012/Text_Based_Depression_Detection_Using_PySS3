so yeah this happenedhello,
        so yeah i have come to the realization that i enjoy the sensation of dieing after 3 failed OD attempts last year and am now biding my time till i have the oppertunity to do it again this time hopefully right.

not entirley sure why im posting this i guess i need to see it written down. ive not had a bad life.. not a good one either but not bad... filled with regret from past mistakes missed oppertunities but most of all filled with self loathing and a long running exestential crisis. i wriute this completly sober so i know its not alcohol exaserbating the situation so take that crisis team! i think what ill miss most is my  cat and ofc my SO not that she hasnt been the cause of a fair bit of tension but then again it has been 8 years so i guess thats to be expected OH and ofc my best friend James he has put up with soooo much bullshit from me over the 19 years ive known him he's a saint! 

sorry im rambling now. i guess i wanted to get my thoughts out there into the world and see what comes back. im not using a throwaway because im beyond caring and no-one knows me on reddit anyway i guess ive become a bit of a loner like that. well ive taken up enough of your time so ill be off. its been a pleasure peace out and keep on rocking!
