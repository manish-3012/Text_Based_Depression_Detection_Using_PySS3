Feeling extremely downI've felt so depressed this past couple years and I'm just done. I started my chemistry course a week ago and it's the course that decides if I'm accepted into the program I want or not. My work is giving me more and more hours and between that and the schoolwork I'm getting completely overwhelmed. I know it's just one course and I know most of you have it much much worse but I also have an undiagnosed pain in my abdomen that has ruined my life.  It's always there and I can never sit still and feel comfortable. Just want to hear someone's advice or anyone who has experienced balancing work and school while battling depression. I think about suicide most days and have for the past year and a half. Thank you so much. Also I'm 20.
