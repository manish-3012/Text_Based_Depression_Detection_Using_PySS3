Out Of OptionsTL;DR: At the age of eighteen I moved in with my online partner to escape an emotionally abusive and fucked up family situation. Things went okay for the next few years, but tbh it became apparent pretty quickly that the relationship was very unhealthy for both of us.

It's gotten to the point where we're finally breaking up, but now I have literally nowhere to go. My SO's told me that they want me out of our apartment ASAP, but I lost my job a week ago and have nowhere to go aside from going back to my abusive family.

Basically, I put all my eggs in one basket, and now that that's fallen through I pretty much just want to disappear.
