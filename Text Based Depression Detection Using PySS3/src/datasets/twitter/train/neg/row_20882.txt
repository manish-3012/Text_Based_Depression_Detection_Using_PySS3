What should I do?I cut myself deeply in my ankles. I can see yellow tissue. I probably need stitches. But if I go to an urgent care they will ask how it happened. I was just released from the hospital a month ago and was involuntarily committed due to suicidal thoughts. I don't want to go back and I can't put my family through that. What can I say how it happened?
