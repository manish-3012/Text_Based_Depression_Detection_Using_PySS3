I left my jobIt wasn't a very good job to work. I just don't know what I'm going to do to keep my life together, on the one hand my mom is good at keeping down a job, on the other my dad is bad at it and always was. 

I feel like I want freedom at work, not to be watched and treated like we are in high school, and yet that's how companies treat people, like cattle, like toddlers, whatever not like people with a subjective mind.

What does someone do? I've had such a rough go of getting out of college and IDK why. Am I lazy? Am I crazy? I have heart problems, I feel pain in my chest and I can't afford health insurance. 

I applied for Medicare but I still haven't heard back from anyone. I am so tired. Please I just want this all to end.
