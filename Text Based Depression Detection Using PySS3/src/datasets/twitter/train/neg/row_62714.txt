Is this really where I'm at now?Here I am, just sitting here... Again, just wanting all of this shit to end.

I'm worthless. I have little too no value in anyway, to anyone. I have no skills, I'm useless as all hell, and I'm fucking fat, and ugly, and I'm probably failing all of my classes, so why bother?

I've never seen myself as a good person. I'm a fucking idiot. I don't know anything practical, and I'm pretty much just a baby in a man's horrid body. Why did I even get this far?

People try to tell me how I'm good at things, but it's all just hollow lies. They tell me just how smart I am. Okay, explain sub par grades, and possibly failing college? They tell me just how handsome I am. Really? Why is it that no girl would *ever* want to fuck me, and the one girl I actually thought I loved, wants my best friend. And not just likes him, but want to make passionate love to him. So I can't even do that right. 

I only see myself in this fucking horrid little hole, not working, living with my parents, or on the street. None of my dreams are real, and I can't accomplish anything that I would want to do, because I'm just that fucking stupid and talentless. 

The only time I don't feel like this is when I..... Who am I kidding, I always feel like this. I don't feel like anything will stop this. 

And here I am, I fucked up. Everyone had high hopes for me, and I'm nothing but a fuck up. I suck as a person, as a man, as a son, as a brother, as an uncle, as a boyfriend, and as a friend.

Why didn't they wear a condom that night?
