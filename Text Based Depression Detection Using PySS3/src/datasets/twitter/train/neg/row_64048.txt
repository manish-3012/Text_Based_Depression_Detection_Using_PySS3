Only 19 and I think I will OD tonightI know so many people are going to think that Iâ€™m posting this for attention but welp I think Iâ€™m going to od tonight. I have 40 extra strength acetaminophen on my bed right now(why 40? I already tried 20 and I woke alive). I tried EVERYTHING, someone in my family raped me when I was 7, my mom dismissed my mental issues ( went as far as to force me to lie to a psychiatrist when I was 13 so I didnâ€™t get an exact diagnostic, she told me they will lock me away and call me crazy). Now Iâ€™m 19, about to drop out of college, Iâ€™m only going to my French class because my mom is going to ask me â€œwhat Iâ€™m doing home donâ€™t I have school ?â€
My dad died when I was 9(he died in 2010), I hate my life, I donâ€™t have anyone ( no like really, I have no one to talk to, the only person that matters to me is my 10 years old sister). I stopped replying to my texts 1 month ago, I have a therapist but I keep telling her that Iâ€™m not suicidal so she canâ€™t actually help me, I had an argument with my mom so I donâ€™t talk to her and itâ€™s been a month, I hasnâ€™t talk to my brother in 5 years). The only person who make me not wanna do it is my sister but Iâ€™m soooo sad right now that all I want to do is od. I know maybe the future have something for me but I canâ€™t fight anymore I just want a hug, I want my dad, I want someone to tell me â€œeverything going to be okayâ€. The only light that was forcing me to stay is slowing dying too. Itâ€™s scary and I donâ€™t want to stay here anymore. I have been hospitalized two time already and Iâ€™m only 19 pls tell me something Iâ€™m scared for myself pls donâ€™t tell me to call 911 or go hug my mom because I wonâ€™t
