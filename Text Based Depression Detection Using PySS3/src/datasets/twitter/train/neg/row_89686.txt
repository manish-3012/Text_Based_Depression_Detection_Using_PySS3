I haven't been feeling good this year. Why is life so unfair for the most of us?So, rewind 2 or so years ago I was doing perfectly fine. I was depressed, but hopeful. I had the energy to look towards my future. I entered college, made lots of friends and the love of my life. 

Then, I got depressed. I went on Zoloft, and then things took a turn from there. 2 years later, lost the love of my life, friends, everything. 

I'm too scared to really do anything about it. It's not easy to commit suicide like people make it out to be. We all live for ourselves, why would I want to lose my life while I'm so young? I'm turning 23 soon and I'm female.. and because I lost someone I was with for 2 years, I feel like I'll never find it again or happiness. I'm failing out of school, and I'm addicted to smoking pot even though I don't want to. I'm gaining weight and looking really bad lately which doesn't help. I don't know what to do.

I can't even find enjoyment in videogames and I suck at writing. I feel like I've ruined my life and this isn't it.. like normal people out there know what they are doing and I'm stuck in this endless loop of sadness and depression. I'm tired.
