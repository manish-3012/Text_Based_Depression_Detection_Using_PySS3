Sat in a ditch by some train tracks. Apologies for typos my fingers are cold and I'm on mobile.Just skipped school, put on some headphones and went for a walk down a train track. Hid at the side once I realised I was on the wrong side and could see a train in front me haha. Still there in a ditch. I don't know what to do. 

EDIT: About five minutes after posting a driver saw me. He stopped the train (procedure?) and I ran like shit. I'm now hiding. I have a really recognisable uniform, bag and hat I was wearing so I took those off; I'll probably get caught because if that fact when I passed the crossing but fuck it. I think I'll wait a few hours then go home. But I actually felt alive. Not happy. But at least I know I'm not fucking dead already.
