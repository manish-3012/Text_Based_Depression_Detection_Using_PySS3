I can't do this anymore and I really need to go. Please, please give me a painless option.I can't do this. I've lost everything. The one person who loved me left suddenly after four years and has cut off contact. Oh god I miss him. He was the only one who could soothe me, who cared whether I lived or died. He left just before Christmas. I love him.

Every day I feel like a zombie, like I'm watching myself play a part in a play. 

Work has become stressful and the daily panic attacks will be back soon. Everyone there thinks I'm an idiot because I blurt out the stupidest shit, but I'm really just so sad. I watch myself acting like an idiot and want so much to die.

I try to talk but no one listens. They don't want to hear that I want to kill myself. What sort of answer could you offer someone who tells you that? "Well, you shouldn't think that, you'll be fine." NO I WON'T. I've had these thoughts since I was 9, now I'm 27.

Please someone give me a way out. Please.
