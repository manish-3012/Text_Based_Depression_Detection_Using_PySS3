Urgent help needed! My friend, who works on a railway, is feeling suicidal. Hi everyone,

My friend who works on a railway is feeling suicidal. He's drunk at the moment (about '9 pints') and says he's been sick all over his room. He says he's 'fucked in the head', and he says he knows he's going to go track-side as part of his job in a few weeks, and says it'll be so easy to just kill himself then. This was on a phone call a few minutes ago I made to him. I told him to please not kill himself because he means to much to me, is one of my best friends and that it'd ruin me if he did anything. I also gave him the Samaritans phone number and told him if he feels like it again, to just ring the number.

I didn't know he'd get this bad. He had been pining after this girl he liked for about a year and a half, and saw on Facebook that she's now in a relationship with someone else. This completely destroyed him, and he's been moping around ever since. He's deleted his Facebook, too. I don't know what to do. I've been texting and calling him, letting him know I'm always there to talk. 

I think it's also 2 other things driving his suicidal thoughts: I'm sorta-kinda seeing a girl (I mean, literally, just after 1 date), and I think he thinks he's never going to meet anyone (he's always been single) - and you know how warped people's thoughts can get - this thing with the girl I'm hanging out with might not go anywhere, yet he probably thinks everyone else is normal and he's messed up. The other thing is that his job is all male-focused and he never gets to meet girls. He doesn't really have any social hobbies to speak of either. He must feel so, so trapped; yet obviously a relationship isn't all that is good about the world. 

I really need some advice and help. I couldn't bear to see him go. :(
