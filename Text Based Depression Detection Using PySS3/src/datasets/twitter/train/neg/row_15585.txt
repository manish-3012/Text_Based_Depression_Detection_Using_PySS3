Heartbroken and lonely. Thinking about killing myself.I got dumped by a woman I was very much in love with. She won't even speak to me anymore. I did nothing worth being treated this way. It came out of nowhere. I wasn't perfect, but I wasn't bad either. I never cheated or got violent. The worst thing I did was be a little unattentive. She was fucking someone else almost immediately, maybe even just before she dumped me. She said she loved me and wanted to marry me. Then BOOM! Fuck you. No contact. Won't take my calls. I never got a warning or second chance. I have tried very hard to move on. 2 months later, no one will date me. No one. I have been flaked on, and friend zoned over and over. I have reached out to girlfriends from the past. No one. She still won't call me back. She's never home anymore. I think she is living with him now. I don't know who he is or what he does or what he has that I don't. She wants to be married, and I know that's what she's working on with him. I just don't care about living anymore. I was so happy with her, and now I just feel worthless. No one else will have me. I hate feeling this pain all fucking day long. The loneliness and sadness have just consumed me. One day she loved me and wanted me to marry her, the next she's with someone else and won't even speak to me. This is the worst I have ever felt in my life. I have tried so hard to meet someone new. I just can't. No one wants me. I hide my pain well, so no one knows just how much I am really hurting. I am approaching 40 and I have no kids. I have money to live on, but my career is falling apart, and I need to start over at some point in the future if I am to go on. I am a good looking guy, but I can't shake this pain enough to be attractive and confident. My father is dead. My mother is in poor health and lives in another state. I just hate life and feel like dying.
