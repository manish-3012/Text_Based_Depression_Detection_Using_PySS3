I decided not to kill myself last night. I donâ€™t know what to do now.I donâ€™t know what to do. I had more nightmares last night, so Iâ€™m running on 3 hours of sleep and I feel really depressed still. What do I do now? Nobody wants to be around me. I want to be alone, but I also donâ€™t want to be alone. Iâ€™m starting to want to die again. I havenâ€™t showered in like 3 days and I feel gross, which isnâ€™t helping. What do I do now? I feel lost. A part of me wishes i just drove to the bridge like I planned on last night. I feel like a failure.
