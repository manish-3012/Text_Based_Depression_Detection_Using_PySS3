Im confusedI'm sick of living, the closest thing I have to a friend is a girl 1/3rds way across the word that I met online. I'm 18 and that's been enough of living for me to not want to anymore. I smoke stoges but I just looked it up and on average it takes 20 years for smokers to develop lung cancer, which is longer then I've been alive. The only reason I don't try to kill myself again is because my family says that it's selfish to do so which I get, like their plan was to be old and have a son to talk to but to me it's more selfish to bring me into the world and I reach a point that I'm so sick of living I would rather die then see if life gets better and say no stick around because it's selfish to make me go through this with out you, that's like dragging your kid out because you wanna do something but don't want to deal with finding friends. My only plan for the future is to go into the military so that in 30 years I can retire and just fake that I'm ok to get through and I have no cares anymore. I just realized the reason in impulsive is because I feel like nothing matters I'll die tomorrow but idk where I got this idea. Idk where to put this or who to talk to so I figured I'd put it on Reddit and see what people say. Don't give me the cliche don't do it speeches I've heard them all before but if you choose to just put your opinion. Thx
