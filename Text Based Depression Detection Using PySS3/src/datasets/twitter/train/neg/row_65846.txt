I hate life!Iâ€™ve struggled with on and off depression for a very long time, 3 nights ago was the first time Iâ€™ve ever seriously considered killing myself and Iâ€™m scared because since then itâ€™s all I can think about, life is meaningless and I basically just hate myself so why not end my own suffering? They do it to animals why not me? Iâ€™ve been thinking about receiving help but I have too much anxiety to go forward with it, and Iâ€™m scared my mom will tell me I donâ€™t need help and Iâ€™m not depressed like she did when my sister went for help with her anxiety/ depression. Everyday is a battle and Iâ€™m very very slowly losing, I used to smoke weed as my escape but lately Iâ€™ve been so bad I get massive anxiety attacks when Iâ€™m high so now it looks like I have no escape but death
