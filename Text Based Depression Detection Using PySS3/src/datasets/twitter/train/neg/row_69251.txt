I'm done for.Basically the past 3-4 years of my life have really been hell. I've been diagnosed with bp disorder in the last year which makes alot of sense after alot of the things I've experienced in my life. Because of this illness I've literally lost everything. I'm 26m and up until a couple years ago I was quite functional. The disorder got worse and its really just destroyed my life. I have no interests to do anything other than sleeping, drinking, hooking up with girls and making bad decisions. It's really sad for me to think about because at one time I had tons of hobbies, a great future, and a prefect girl. Everything is gone now. I was forced to move back home which isn't going so well. My mom is furious about me sleeping during the day and is irrate I don't currently have a job. I am quite talented I've never not been able to find work and make good money. It's really the illness that's holding me back I absolutely hate it. She's threatening to kick me out of the house "sooner than I think" is what she said. In the past couple years I've tied probably 100 nouses and have been very close to ending it. I'm tired of battling life and my family was the only thing holding me back. Now I could really care less and the thought of peace is very appealing. I may do it soon like tomorrow. I've obsessed over this so much I probably have 20 spots picked out just at home. I might wait till they leave for work and just get it over with.
