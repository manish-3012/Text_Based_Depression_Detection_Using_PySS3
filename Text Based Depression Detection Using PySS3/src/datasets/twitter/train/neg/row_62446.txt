I just don't know anymoreEverything seems to be falling apart around me and so many of my problems are just getting way out of hand. I feel like a burden to everyone I'm even in the presence of and I can't seem to fix my brain no matter how hard I try or what I do. Living seems more and.more like and endless spiral of pain and I can't help but think that it's just not worth it anymore.
