Looking for support and finding none...Daily suicidal thinking is a huge problem for me. Not finding any support even among people from whom I thought I could was baffling. 

I have been suicidal every day of my life since I was probably 8 or 9... I am turning 31 next month. I have had well over 20 hospitalizations, and every day the suicidal and self harm thoughts plague me. 

Wanting support, but then not getting it is possibly the worst feeling. Wow... I thought this was going to be helpful for me... I suppose I was wrong.. 


Anyway.....


Bye
