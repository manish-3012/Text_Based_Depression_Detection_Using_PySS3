I didn't feel it.I'm an emotional wreck and in all honesty I dont exactly know why. It's probably because I'm not taking my prozac. But does 40mg really make that much a difference. I felt like carving into my arm. So i pushed my knife into my arm just leaving some deep marks but not cutting. Then I'm here using the point/tip of the blade which I swear wasn't sharp to just doing a flicking motion across my arm. And now I have 3 nice little cuts. But I didn feel it. I didnt notice it actuallyt cut till blood came out. I'm a mess and I'm actually hurting myself I dont know what to do right now.
