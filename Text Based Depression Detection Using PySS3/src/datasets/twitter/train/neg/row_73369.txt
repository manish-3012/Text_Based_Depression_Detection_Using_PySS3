I donâ€™t want to be aliveI got traumatized from childhood/teenage abusive experiences. Every time Iâ€™m around people I get flashbacks, which makes it extremely difficult to hold down a job. Iâ€™m barely holding onto my job right now. My friends have left me. Iâ€™ve tried therapy and medication and itâ€™s helped but I donâ€™t know that Iâ€™ll be able to hold down a job or have meaningful relationships. I can barely get out of bed and feed myself with all this pain. Thereâ€™s no point to being alive. I want to die.
