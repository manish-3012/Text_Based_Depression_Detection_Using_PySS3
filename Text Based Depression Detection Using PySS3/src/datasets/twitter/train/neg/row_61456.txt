Peace out.âœŒðŸ»


I never thought Anxiety depression,  could ever cause so much uncertainty or pain in my life. Always questioning if Im not doing enough, always looking for permission to be  breath always thinking I am doing something wrong. 
     I donâ€™t love myself, I never have, I put myself in positions on purpose just to get me to actually pull the plug on myself. 
    Iâ€™m just tired of trying to make others happy. I canâ€™t live with the manipulative state I went through. 
        â€œI was looking for a reason to die.â€ 
      I was pathetic, attention seeking, for all the wrong reasons. 
             â€œI once thought I could make it, turns out I just gave up on myself. â€œ
    
        Iâ€™m tired, drained, Iâ€™m ready to let go.â€
                            â€œIâ€™m done.â€
