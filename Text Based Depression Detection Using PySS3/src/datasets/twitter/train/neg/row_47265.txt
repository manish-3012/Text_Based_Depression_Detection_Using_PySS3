My birthday always makes me feel horribleIâ€™m tired of being a burden to my family. I wasnâ€™t even supposed to make it here. I feel like Iâ€™ve somehow cheated. I had a suicide attempt months back where I was relocated to the icu at the big city hospital where I stayed for days. I couldnâ€™t walk. Using the bathroom was the worst. All sorts of heart monitors. I remember ripping them all off of my chest when I woke up. I screamed and cursed. I was so angry to have woken up. I had one wish in the world, and even that was being taken from me. I remember mustering up the courage to call the two friends I had. One declined my call. The second made an excuse to hang up the phone. I remember my family not coming to visit. My family has been stamped with thousands in medical bills since. They all pretend it didnâ€™t happen. In reality I donâ€™t think anyone wanted me to wake up. Iâ€™ve been trying so hard. I donâ€™t believe there is a friend out there for me. I need this time to be successful. Please.
