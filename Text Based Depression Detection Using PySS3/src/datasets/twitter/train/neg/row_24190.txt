I am a bad day away from ending this shitI'm fucking trapped. I'm 20 years old living with my parents without a license or car, I work a dead end job I'm too afraid to quit, I have no talents and all I do anymore is play wow all day and feel sorry for myself. Today I pushed the last friend that gives a shit about me away over a stupid argument.
On top of all that bullshit is my mind telling me I should be a girl. I can't make up my mind because I'm indecisive and still hold the delusion I have a future as a male despite not seeing myself with a future at all. It's a constant war in my mind and I can't take it anymore. I want to be a girl but I don't want to be seen as a disgusting tranny. There isn't anything for me in this life, all i do is suffer and get pushed around. I'm really at the end of my fucking rope.
