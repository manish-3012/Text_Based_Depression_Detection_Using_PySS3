I am suicidal because of schoolGonna make this short.
My depression has dropped my grades so low that Iâ€™m even more depressed. I feel like Iâ€™m worthless, stupid, and Iâ€™m not going to get anywhere so I might as well end it now before it gets worse.  Weird thing is I feel like this is my destiny. Like another poster earlier said - while some people know someday theyâ€™re gonna get married, or have kids, Iâ€™ve always felt like my destiny was to die.  I donâ€™t see the point anymore
