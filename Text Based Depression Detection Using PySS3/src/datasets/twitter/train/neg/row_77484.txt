It gets easier to shut myself away every day.I just want to start off by saying that I don't feel particularly suicidal right now, but I fear that that may change much further down the road.

Last Spring I received an email from my prospective college saying that I had been denied admittance. At the time it just seemed like another bump in the road. I thought "okay, I'll just go to community college for a couple years and we'll take it from there." But as the summer came closer, and my high school career came to a wrap, I felt myself becoming more and more detached from reality. I had received a fabulous two year scholarship to a community college, was going to live with my parents for free, and I had a decent part-time job. I thought I had the next few years set up well, but I still couldn't get over the numbness in the back of my mind.

I can tell that my friends can see it too. They tell me that I get more emotional now than ever before, and I find myself making up excuses just to not go out with them. To me, a night laying in bed and falling asleep for hours on end seems way more appealing than going out with my friends and finding fun things to do. I long for the days where I had limitless amounts of energy, and would often go for a week without more than 3 hours of sleep at a time. I long for the days where I lusted for a partner, instead of just casually glancing at attractive people. I long for the days where things interested me. Now it seems like nothing holds my interest for longer than a few days. If that.

I'm not really sure what to do. Or if I can be "fixed." Just looking for some outside perspective I guess.
