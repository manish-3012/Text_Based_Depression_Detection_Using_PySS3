sure, â€œeveryoneâ€ is isolated right now...but everyone else has their friends and family to be in some kind of contact with to keep a little sane. iâ€™m single, totally estranged from my family, and canâ€™t convince someone to be my friend to save my life. i got sick 2 weeks ago and live alone and itâ€™s kind of made me realize if i died no one would even know until my landlord came looking for my rent. i work 2 minimum wage jobs just to get by and I hate both of them, I think Iâ€™ve just been miserable for so long that other people can tell something is wrong with me so my coworkers donâ€™t really talk to me. Anyways, both of my jobs shut things down in weird non traditional ways while I was out, so unemployment agents donâ€™t even understand how to help me apply for benefits. i wasnâ€™t living particularly comfortably before (like i donâ€™t even have internet in my place) so to think about what sacrifices iâ€™m about to have to make is pretty terrifying. Doesnâ€™t really feel worth it to even try to get through this. I feel subhuman.
