Iâ€™m losing it...maybe I have already lost itThe thought of ending my own life has been on and off my mind properly for at least 2 years now, and Iâ€™ve reached some point during those 2 years were I was trying to get help but I felt so pointless because I really felt like nothing was going to change how I was feeling. And to be totally honest with you nothing really has changed how I feel or taken my mind off it. 
Iâ€™m struggling with day to day life and everything constantly feels overwhelming. 

I also feel in the eyes of everyone I do nothing right everything I do or say is wrong or stupid and none of them actually wanna spend time with me. Or want me here and thatâ€™s fair enough why would they want me here when I donâ€™t even want to be here. 
Iâ€™ve always been the outcast in my family the one everyone picks on but there are so many other things going on in my life that Iâ€™m seriously contemplating not being anymore because there no worth or point for me here.
I donâ€™t wanna do this no more I donâ€™t want to keep living in this world where nothing makes sense and no one wants me here
