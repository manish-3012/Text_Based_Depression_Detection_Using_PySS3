I've contemplatedso long story short I've had a really shit year and I've contemplated for the first time (21m)). sorry about the long post and weird typing. typed this while emotional mess

long story:

this year started with my father dying and he was my closest friend and confidant and my main person id always go to for help. we like I said, he died this year and being me I internalized it and didn't take it to well, my only help was my girlfriend( now ex but ill get to that). during the whole funeral situation, my family basically had a come apart and my mother wasn't invited, my family on my fathers side just acknowledged it and said shes not wanted here. now my parent were split for 11 years at that point but I did not think it was appropriate and I got into an argument with them about it and it just went to shit at the funeral none the less. well that's the first part

&amp;#x200B;

second was the fact that I lost contact with my intire family. basically my aunt(which caused the funeral ruckus) never contacted me after the funueral and so we lost contact with my dads side including gma(get to that in a minute). on my mother side I lost contact beause of my mother and her being a bitch, I mean at this point our relationship was already strained but the ruckus broke and we had a falling apart which included her intire side of the family. so basically I was left alone with my ex and her family. I couldn't stay in contact with my contact because around may she started really getting demenshia bad and she had time where she wouldn't remember me which broke my heart so I couldn't talk to her anymore without falling apart.

&amp;#x200B;

third: my emotions and goals: it wasn't until recently that I had my shit together. basically I don't really have ambition ions I kind of just drifted which included my emotions, I didn't have any really just I'm there. I'm getting better now but its taken 7 years just to get to this point now. I go from job to job and have no happiness or sadness.

&amp;#x200B;

fourth: my friends: my friends have been shit with one dropping rent on me and two taking shit care of their dogs and me having to look after them (living together) not to mention the friend I have to help me with relationship issues she just dropped me like a brink when I asked for help.

&amp;#x200B;

finally my ex/girlfriend: this was just last month but in reality has been happening for a while. we have been discussing for about a month about moving in and the problems we have so we decided wed work on them together. well obvi that didn't work and now we are broken up, mostly. we plan on attempting to get back together if we can fix the issues that are wrong with both parties and that's fair with me. the only problem is that the we went from talking all the time  to no time. I thought id be fine cause it would be me at the therapist fixing my issues but it gets worse each day and my feeling towards her get stronger and stronger. I got hit by a train were I think of her every night and every day. I'm scared and jealous that she might find a better person in our selected  time. my heart acks all day especially being at home most of the time being I work from home now. we are talking this sat about what needs to be fixed to continue the relationship. I believe that's all so far

&amp;#x200B;

it happened  twice and both were a day apart, I thought of loosing her and never being with her again and just the emotional bubble I have inside me that probably has burst. and nobody to help me through this

&amp;#x200B;

the only thing good that happened was my doggo and my therapist helping me but I seems to late
