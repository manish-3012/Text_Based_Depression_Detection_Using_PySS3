i wonder how long i'll lastit's been like, a week? who knows, time feels eternal now -- and i really don't know how i am going to do this. I am in a good position, i don't live alone so i have at least some time per day when i am not in my own head -- but fuck. it just seems like this will never end. and that my unemployment will never come and i'll run out of money. the worst case scenario for me isn't bad, it's just moving in with my brother! both of us would hate it, but it wouldn't kill either of us. its more thinking this won't end, and fearing what will come as it goes on and on and on, how are we possibly going to have an economy left after this. i'm too cowardly to live in a developing nation type environment. and too old to start over. i wish it would end, one way or another.
