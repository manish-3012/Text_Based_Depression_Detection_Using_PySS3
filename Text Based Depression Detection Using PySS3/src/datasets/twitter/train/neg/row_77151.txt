Military conscription is pushing me to kill myself.I'm about to join the army. It's obligatory where I live. Every cell in my body is rejecting this, and every single one is telling me to end my life. For the first time, I'm weighing options to put an end to this misery. 

I'm a doctor. I save lives and I'm against violence and war. I wish I fought this. Imprisonment is far better than this. 

I wish I can run and run and run and never come back.
