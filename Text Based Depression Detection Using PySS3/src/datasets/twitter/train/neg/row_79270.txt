No reason at all to live.I don't have anyone that depends on me, and I don't have an important job to do. I know this is unpopular but, you shouldn't be alive if that's the case. Seriously, what's the point? I suppose it took me a while to realise I didn't matter. Really close to killing myself, suicidal thoughts in my head all day and night. There's two people in the world that stop me from doing it. When I think about them I grit my teeth with despair, cos I feel trapped here while they're still around I'm not sure if I can do it.
