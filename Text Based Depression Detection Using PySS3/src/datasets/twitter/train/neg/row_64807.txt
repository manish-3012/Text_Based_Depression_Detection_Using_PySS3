Everything makes me feel worse.I have no idea where to start. I've read a few posts and I'm not even sure why I'm posting. I'm a 21M and I've had no serious issues or abuse other than a dad with anger problems. My parents divorced when I was in kindergarten but I've always had contact with them. I remember always being somewhat depressed since about mid elementary school which is K-5 where I'm from so maybe grade 2 or 3. I don't remember anything changing or traumatic happening to me then. I only really had one or two friends in elementary. I was never heavily bullied or picked on. Of course it happened once or twice. But up to today, I still feel like I don't want to live. I hate this world. I hate how selfish everyone is. I see selfishness in the greatest of people that have horrid effects on others indirectly. I have a supportive family and I hate it. I love them so much and they love me but I just want to die. What's wrong with me. I think my life is perfectly fine yet I still want to die all the time. I've been on anti depressants since I was 15 and I've always had the thought in my head how not existing would still be nicer than the inability to feel happiness even when things are nice. I feel horrible reading other people's stories who seem like they have every right and reason in the world to be depressed. Why am I so ungrateful? If my life is appealing to someone struggling I'd gladly trade places. For some reason I always feel like I deserve to suffer. Like my soul isn't fit for this life. As if someone else's could do so much better in my body. Ive even told my doctor how if it were legal id request doctor assisted suicide.
