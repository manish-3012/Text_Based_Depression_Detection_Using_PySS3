I don't know what's wrong. Lately I just feel like I want to die. Life isn't that bad right now, I just got  a new job as well as hooked up with this amazing kid. But for whatever reason I just can't look at any kind of pills with out thinking about how many it would take to overdose. I know how I would do it even, I just can't for whatever reason. Every night I hope to go to bed and not wake up. And it's gotten to a point where cutting doesn't help ease the pain anymore. I don't know what to do. I can't tell my shrink the truth, I'm afraid of what will happen.
