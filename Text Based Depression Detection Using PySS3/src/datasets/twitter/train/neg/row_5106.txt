sorrysorry to every friend I made the mistake of getting to like me just so they could drop me around a year later like how it always gets to happen. sorry to my ex that we never tied things up right. sorry that i put all this hurt on someone else i just need someone to read it i hate that i need that. i cant deal with it all any more. its just going to keep happening
