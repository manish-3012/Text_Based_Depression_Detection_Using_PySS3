I feel so helpless and aloneI'm terrified to talk to my parents about my suicidal thoughts.  They know I'm depressed but I don't think they have any idea how severe it's been getting in the past 6 months.  I think about suicide almost every day and I started cutting 2 months ago.

I desperately want somebody to notice and reach out, because I'm too pathetic to do it myself.  Sadly I think I do too good of a job at hiding my feelings.  My parents never see me cry unless we're arguing.  I never seem sad around them (unless once again we're arguing).  So I understand if they can't see it.

I wish they could though.  Because I'm scared I'm going to do something extreme soon.
