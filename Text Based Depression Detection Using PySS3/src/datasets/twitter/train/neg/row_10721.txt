Thought I Was Getting BetterHave been suicidal for years now. Almost went through with it this year but went to a mental hospital instead. For a while everything seemed to be looking up. Tossed out my note even.

Now it feels like I'm falling back in. Committed self harm for the first time in years last night and keep thinking how much better off this world would be if I weren't in it. I'm a burden to my friends and family and don't think I can handle letting them down more. I know suicide would be rough on them but long term I think theyd be better without me. 

I dont know. I'm so tired of feeling like this. Like, am I ever going to be happy, or is this it?
