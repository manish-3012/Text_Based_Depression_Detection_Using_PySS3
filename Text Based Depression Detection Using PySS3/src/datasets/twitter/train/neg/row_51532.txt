I think about killing myself every dayI'm 18 years old, and I had to go through with an unwanted pregnancy when I was 17, when I wanted an abortion. My family threatened to stop supporting me if I gave him up for adoption, but I was able to give guardianship over to my aunt and I moved back home. Here I am, 7 months later, thinking about killing myself every day. It ruined my life, my body, my sex life and I just wanna fucking die whenever I look in the mirror. I took Xanax last night before a bath and I tried to drown myself, but I'm still here because I thought today would be better but its not. Its never better.
