I feel like a burden. I've threatened suicide numerous times, I've posted here before. I'll post here again. Life is just a whirlwind of shit, isn't it?I feel like a burden to everyone around me. I cost money, and I apparently tear relationships apart. I'm jobless, penniless, and an alcoholic. The trifecta. I just don't find joy in life anymore, but no matter how down I get, I just can't bring myself to get that noose, or that overdose ready, or what have you. 

I'm worried that I'll live everyday of my life wanting to die, but never having the courage to go through with it. Is that a life worth living? I've fucked my mind up on drugs, I'm on all sorts of meds. I hate myself. I have a talent, I say to myself I have a talent. Who is good for? No amount of drugs or therapy can relieve this mess. 

How many messages have you read like this? I'll post again, don't worry. I'll die from alcohol poisoning or get hit by a car. All I know is that won't be intentional. That's sad, though. Living to wait for death. Oh god. God dammit.
