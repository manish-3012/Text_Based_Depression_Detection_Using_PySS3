When you have it all and want it stillI'm supposed to be happy.  Got a great life at 40 , job working for myself, supportive wife, cats, and my parents are still in good health in their70's, nice house &amp; Mercedes etc. 

I won't ever do it, but the thoughts of putting my gun in my mouth and pulling the trigger are frequent today.  Been crying non stop for hours. I've been sober since New year's, used to be a pothead, but trying to be a better man and all that bullshit. 

So I guess even when we have everything that is supposed to make us happy , the evil thoughts can still creep in like a poisonous gas that makes us feel like we can't escape.  A feeling of utter loneliness remains, and sometimes I just wish I was dead see if my wife and I could be free of my shit.
