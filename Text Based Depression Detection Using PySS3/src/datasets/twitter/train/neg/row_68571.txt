Done with the effortWhen I was born my right lung collapsed, I was rushed to another hospital and placed in NICU. My mother couldn't hold me for 3 weeks. My very first moment in this world defined how I lived the rest of my life. Half assed, never giving it my hundred. I don't know if I was trying to live or die at birth, but everyone else wanted me to live. So I did, through modern medicine I lived. Every major decision in my life I have never made on my behalf, it was usually whatever those closest to me wanted. My dreams have always been some nice sounding idea that never ignited a fire inside of me. The only thing I have ever felt burning passion for were those I loved. But what happens when my love for people runs out? Every social encounter I have had has been eating away at my capacity for love, wether it be with friends, family, or lovers. I am finding less reasons and people that I should keep trying for. My mother betrayed my trust, my father betrayed my trust, my step father, my older brothers, my lovers and my friends. I keep telling myself, "Oh things will get better.", "They do care, you are being unreasonable.", "Just hold on, if I can long enough maybe then I'll change.", or "Even if you were/are alone, you can still make it.". Then I ask "What is making it?". Having a four bedroom house, nice car, a wife, two kids, two dogs and a cat? Or is it giving back to the world? Maybe it's just carving out my own little spot in the world? The answer I come to each time, "Making it is reaching death with no regrets.". Well my one true regret in this life is not taking my life sooner. Why keep living to make more mistakes when I could finish the job half of me started at the beginning.
