The pandemic is making me want to dieI'm not going to commit suicide, I'm too much of a pussy and besides I couldn't do that to my family yadda yadda yadda.... 

But goddamn do I want to die. I feel like everyone's just pretending that Zoom calls are a substitute for real human interaction and they aren't. I'm in a university town all alone, completely isolated in my house while also dealing from insults and abuse from the town itself that thinks all the students are just partying and spreading COVID.

I can't do online classes for another year. I can't have seven assignments and five quizzes due every week because my profs are worried that we aren't keeping up with the course. I'm behind on all my lectures and I just feel like school has become about meeting deadlines and googling material that I didn't have time to learn.

I already have no friends here and now there's no chance of me making any. I am so lonely and so tired. I just want to disappear.

I can't do this for another year. There truly is no point. I can't take the "new normal".  I feel so hopeless.
