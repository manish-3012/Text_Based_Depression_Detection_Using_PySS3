Dude at my office committed suicideI never knew him but itâ€™s interesting seeing how people react. 

I wish I wasnâ€™t so jealous of him.

Hope heâ€™s at peace. This life tends to drain every part of you until thereâ€™s nothing left. I hope he knows I donâ€™t blame him at all. Mind sick is arguably the worst kind of sick. It eats you alive.
