I need your opinions.I'm not asking for your pity, just your support.

I just don't know what to do anymore. Everyone at school (I am 17 y/o) thinks I'm stupid and oblivious, but I actually do know things. I'm just too afraid to speak up about anything. 

Whenever I try defending myself, I get tongue-tied and will say things kind if backwards. I have really bad anxiety. I'm pathetic.

I lost my mother freshman year of high school, and I still get so pissed off at her even after her death. She made life a living hell for me. She told my entire family I cut myself, along with many lies, and would put me through unnecessary mental hospitals and therapists.

I'm starting to cut myself again. I've been wearing bandages and bracelets constantly to cover them up, but it's about to get to the point I can't.

I believe in God, but I'm starting to wonder if *he* would actually allow me to go to hell if I killed myself. I guess there's only one way to find out.

I've already planned my suicide, I just haven't gone through with it yet. There's literally no reason for me to live. I can't do anything right and nobody likes me.
