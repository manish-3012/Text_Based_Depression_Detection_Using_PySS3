I wish i could kill myselfI just don't want to go on. I am damaged so badly that i fuck everything up. Every time. 

I envy those who aren't parents. The fact that i am a parent is why i dont have the luxury of suicide. I think about it a lot though. Sometimes i think that my daughter would be better off without me but then i remember that her father, my ex, is an unreliable, raging narcissist who neglects her. My own family is damaged and toxic. No, i have to go on. She's almost 15. Too old  to forget me. 

Fuuucckkkkk!!!!!

This makes me so damn depressed. How do i go on. Im only 35. Death by natural causes is most likely a long way off. 

I got married a few weeks ago. I should be happy. He's a great guy, tries hard to make me happy. Doesn't expect much of me. But i don't know how to be happy. All I've ever known is rejection, abuse, neglect. Loss.

This makes me react so badly to things. Everyone else gets sick of it . He will too eventually. 

I just wish i could die. If not for my daughter, suicide would be the noble action. I don't enrich anyones life. I am stressful and depressing. 

If only my daughter's father was a better father. I could make it look like an accident. I've watched enough crime shows and listened to enough podcasts that i could make it look accidental.

I love my daughter so much. But i often wish she'd never been born. Ive had 6 miscarriages but somehow she made it. She'd be better off not here. 

Ive been to therapists. Im on anti-depressants, which help to the point where i can 'function'. But im still just so fucked up. I ruin everything. 

I can see why there are cases of mothers killing thier children, as a mercy killing. I would never do that but I can see how it happens. You fuck your kid up so much that you are both better off gone. 

So here i am, messed up, suicidal yet  unable to bring myself to go through with it. 

I hope it's ok i posted here.
