Is this a normal response when opening up about being suicidal to your partner?I've been with my (28F) boyfriend (30M) for 2 years, LDR and we only met a few times. We were supposed to move in together but due to covid, we're not sure when we can. All of my depression symptoms have been slowly crawling back, and things keep getting worse because we dont even spend much time together because he takes care of his dad who has cancer. 

Every day I keep getting more and more silent, but he just says everything will be better later on and we just need to be patient. Today, I opened up to him about me feeling suicidal again, and having suicide ideation thoughts. "What about the people who care about you?", he asked. I told him I genuinely don't think anyone wont be able to get over me. My parents and him would be sad for a while, moreso my parents, but eventually, everyone will move on, I dont matter that much. I've tried to exist well and its pointless. He said if thats what our relationship means to me, then ok. I asked is that your response? Ok? He said "Yes well what do you want me to say? Youre precious to me and I care about you? You already know that. Nothing I say will matter to you.". I made an excuse to leave and closed my phone. 

Is this normal? Shouldn't he actually say that though? Now I feel even more suicidal that I was feeling and really worthless.
