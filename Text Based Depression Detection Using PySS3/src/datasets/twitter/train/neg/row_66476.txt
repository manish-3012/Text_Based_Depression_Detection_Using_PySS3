Constantly thinkingMe and my ex broke up a few months ago and ever since suicide has been a constant thought. Iâ€™ve made two feeble attempts since the breakup, once with benedryl and the other with floor cleaner (literally burns your stomach for days) the only thing keeping me together right now is our daughter. Last night on my way home from church I bought a garden hose and ductape. My plan is 1. Donâ€™t tell anyone this time 2. Just rig the garden hose from the exhaust to the window and ductape it sealed. Spend my last few hours wheeling. I can go after work, Iâ€™ll leave an hour or two early and no one will look for me.
