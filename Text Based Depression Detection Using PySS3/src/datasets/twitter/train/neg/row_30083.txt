I hate myself for everything.I just made the person I love the most cry, I feel so upset I just want to die, but they're crying because I said I want to die, and hearing the pain in there voice made me feel so bad and idk what to do, I'm pretty sure they aren't going to want to talk to me after that experience I just ruined someone's day, and I feel so useless and worthless I doubt they even care about me, I'm pretty sure they just pity me for no reason and I bet they only talk to me when they have no one else to talk to, I just want to die, but my dumbass said "don't worry I won't die" i should have just wrote a suicide note, tell them how much they mean to me, and finished it I'm so upset, I feel I just lost the only person who I really loved even after crying I don't feel better at all I hate myself so much
