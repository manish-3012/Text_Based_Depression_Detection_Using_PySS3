Nothing changesI used to be a drug addict and dealer. I hated my life and everyday I hope I would find the drive to kill myself or overdose one day. I thought it was my rock bottom. Now I'm sober and somehow managed to get to a job the pays extremely well. But I still want to die. More now than back then. Every single day for most of the day I think about it. I look at myself in the mirror and I want to put a bullet through that person's head. I'm scum and I don't deserve life, love, happiness, friends and family. I can't keep on like this for much longer. I already have for far too long.
