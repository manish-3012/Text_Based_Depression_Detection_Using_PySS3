Leaving on vacation tomorrow, coming back bankrupt, ending up homeless within two months, starving to death about three weeks after that.  Or I could be merciful and kill myself.[Here is why you don't like me and will be calling me a selfish asshole soon.](http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18g4h0/going_on_a_vacation_i_cant_afford_with_a_rich/)

Today is the last day of my girlfriend's Bar exam.  Tomorrow we go on a vacation I cannot afford, paid for in full by me, which will bankrupt me.  I've paid my rent and student loans for next month already, so the pocket change I will have left over should be enough to get me through to next month, at which point I run out of money and start defaulting on payments.  When I am in default, I'll either go through the eviction process for as long as it takes and drag it out like the leech reddit wants me to be, or (hopefully) I will do the right thing and evict myself and find a bridge to sleep under while I wait to starve to death.

My girlfriend?  She will enjoy her time on the trip.  Afterwards, she will either learn she passed the Bar and is rich, or that she will have to take the Bar again and is *still* rich.  She will also still have her job and company whatever the outcome, and still earn over $150 thousand per year with an *additional* $100 grand or so per year from the interest on her family trust.  With or without me, she'll buy a new house this year *just because*, and after I'm dead  (and probably while I'm under the bridge and not returning her calls) she'll find a partner who's either as rich as her or content with being her poodle-with-benefits.

But *thank Christ* I'm not about to *kill myself* or anything crazy like that, huh?  Then I'd miss out on all the [birds and shit](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/18wf2w/jesus_christ_guys_you_are_not_helpful/) while I'm under the bridge wondering if I should eat my shoes and eke out a couple more hours of misery.

Or I'll just hang myself from the hotel balcony while she's asleep.

**Q.** You are a selfish asshole.

**A.** Oh boy, this again.  Reddit loves trundling out the old chestnut of, "You're a selfish asshole because you bought your girlfriend a vacation that it turns out you couldn't afford after all and now you're going on it with her even though you don't want to and know that it will bankrupt you and ruin you, because you know she wants to go." I've never gotten this mindset.  I'm sure one of you fine people could explain it.

**Q.** Why are you even posting here, you asshole?

**A.** Because this is /r/suicidewatch and I am suicidal.

**Q.** Why don't you just leech off of her like the asshole we all know you are, you asshole?

**A.** Wait, I thought I was selfish; I'm confused.  You think I'm selfish, but not selfish enough?  Am I understanding you right?

**Q.** Have you talked about any of this with your girlfriend, you asshole?

**A.** Yes.  That's how I know she wants to go and know that she will never understand what it is like to worry about money, to *not* be rich, to *not* have $15 million in a trust fund and over $250,000 more coming in per year, to not be able to live off the interest of her interest.  And how I know she thinks I'll be a perfect ~~stay-at-home boyfriend~~ **pet** she can get rid of when she gets bored, despite knowing that I would rather die than be anyone's pet.

**Q.** Can you ~~ask anyone for help financially~~ find victims to leech off of for a bit, until you've bled them dry?

**A.** Like who?  My deadbeat alcoholic dad?  My mom on disability?  My dead grandparents?  My aunts and uncles who steal from my parents and each other?  My friends who are struggling to pay their own bills and don't have a dime to spare?

**Q.** Why are you being so hostile, you asshole?

**A.** Because I respond in kind to Reddit's bullshit.

**Q.** ~~Do you want to talk?  You can PM me.~~ I want to sext with you.  My dick is sooooooooo hard and I want to [tie you to a radiator and grape you in the mouth](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nobiQh8i1Pw).

**A.** If you have anything to say to me, say it in this public forum.
