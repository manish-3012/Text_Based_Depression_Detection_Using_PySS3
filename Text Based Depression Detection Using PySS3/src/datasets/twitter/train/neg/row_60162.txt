Iâ€™m not sure what to doIâ€™m a teenager living at home and Iâ€™ve gone through some relationship trauma including having my name in a girls suicide note after she had a failed attempt. Iâ€™m seriously fucked up and in another relationship and I donâ€™t want to impose my thoughts on my partner. Thereâ€™s also school to worry about on top of it all. Iâ€™ve thought about suicide many times but Iâ€™ve never taken action. Iâ€™ve been to counseling before and Iâ€™ve asked my parents to go again and they wonâ€™t let me unless I tell them whatâ€™s wrong. I donâ€™t want to tell my parents that love and care about me that I want to kill myself. I donâ€™t want to talk about it with anyone I know personally because of the fear that theyâ€™ll care too much and feel as if they canâ€™t help me, which is a situation Iâ€™ve been in. I donâ€™t know what to do so I decided to post my thoughts to the anonymous people of reddit.
