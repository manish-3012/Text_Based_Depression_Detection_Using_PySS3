Anonymous post, sorry if its graphic because I get specific at times.its a friends birthday today but yet im sitll getting thoughts and such but since its her birthday i dont want to go ranting to her tonight for support so thats why im here instead, lately suicidal thoughts and such have been beating on me, this happens a lot "normally" but at times it just hits harder than it should every month or 2 months and i hate it. i know that i wont do it yet because im not ready so there is no need to worry too much, but i have been harming myself lately and it feels like cutting has been the only thing that helps, it gives me a stimulation that nothing else does, i dont cut deep but deep enough to where it bleeds a bit, i like the feeling of the scratching on my leg then slowly watching the cut develop as blood starts to come up. i know its something that i probably shouldnt be doing but it feels like the only thing i can do. ive been doing it for probably around 2-3 weeks and its come to the point where im losing area on my leg to do it because i do it so much. what i hate about my issues is its not cause of trauma, its not cause i have a bad life or anything, i just hate the person i am, i hate everything ive done and i still mess up and it makes everything worse. doing stuff like this i kinda hate doing as well because when i dont talk about something for a bit then i actually take them time to write out and talk about it, it seems like so much ive been letting out but i dont even specifically set out examples. i feel like no matter what these issues will never go away and the more i think it the more i even give on up help. ive had some small talks and hits to people and here that ive been feeling this way without blatantly saying it out because i dont want to freak people out by saying i want to end my life at times like now because you think way off what i intend because even if i want to and want to act on it, the only reason im still standing is cause i have promises for people and still have people i need to make up to.
