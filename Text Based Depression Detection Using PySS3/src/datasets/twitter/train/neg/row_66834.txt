I cant change myself anymore. It's over. Only a couple of days until my Death/Birth Day.I just cant change. I lay in bed, do nothing besides watching a bit of anime and sleep.
I got some awesome responses from redditors that tried to help and i really tried to change myself. But i cant. And i dont want to anymore if i really think about it.
