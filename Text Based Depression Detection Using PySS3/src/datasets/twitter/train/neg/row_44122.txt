Anything to stop feeling this way, I may just do it.Ahhh I get worse and worse, whole life same problems. I am excited to start a 6to8 week outpatient program next week, even though im ashamed and guilty and emberrased about it. But really its my last hope, if it cant fix me then nothing can. 

Thankfully my shotgun is not easily accessible (3hour drive) because i feel so bad i would end it right now. Tbh nothing matters right now except making this stop, i want to rip my skin apart to get away from this. The only reason i live is for the sake of others. I dont enjoy life, its a struggle, painful, shameful for me, i cant stand it or myself. Death wpuld give me so much peace and im seeing it as the only solution. This outpatient program is my last resort, i will try hard but if it doesnt work i am seriously blowing my head off
