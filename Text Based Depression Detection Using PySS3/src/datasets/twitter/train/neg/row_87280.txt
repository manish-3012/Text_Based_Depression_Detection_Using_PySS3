I want to learn more about life. I feel so empty, sad, worthless, idi*t and frustrated even before this lockdown happened. I experienced all kinds of bullying in my entire life. I don't know how to fight back. I was depressed for 4 years and when i was finally able to get a job I lost it too because of bullying and a threat to my life. I can't speak or fight back to whoever is trying to overpower me because of feeling and thinking that I might gonna die if I fight back. I hate it. I hate it so much. And now, I was able to go outside again this lockdown happened. I want to take my own life but I can't because I hate the feeling of getting hurt and I dont have enough courage to do it. I feel so worthless, furious and sad, all at the same time. It feels like my head is going to blow off. I don't have anyone to share all my problems with. I want to know more about life and learn many things about it. I already spent 6 years of my life doing nothing. I want to do something productive but I can't push myself. It feels like everything I do is pointless. I'm 24yo living in 2x3 meter apartment. I can't stay sane during this lockdown especially my neighbor isn't listening to whatever I say, they keep on insulting me and kicking the divider of my room. I already reported it but nothing happens probably because everyone was busy fighting covid. It's really hard if you have no one beside you. How do I get strength and courage ? what is life really ? I still need to wait for 25 days for me to get outside again. I will definitely move out of this apartment but how can I prevent anymore damage that my brain is sustaining through enduring all this pain and sadness. Just by thinking that it will be permanent damage it's making me crazy.
