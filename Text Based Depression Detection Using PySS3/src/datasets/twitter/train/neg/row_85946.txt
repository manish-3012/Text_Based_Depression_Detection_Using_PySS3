I'm alone. I'm alone. I'm alone.I'm alone.

I really am. I'm going to vent because I might kill myself if I don't.  The urges are so strong. I've not slept in nearly 80 hours. My eyes are open and I can't close them. He had a headache and felt sick, but I was crying and very obviously suicidal because I said it to him... yet he still went to bed. I am alone. I am broken. My heart is beating so fast, my head hurts and my tears burn my skin. I haven't cried like this in *years*.. I need a friend. I have no one. I'm anti social. I'm stupid and ugly and a stress eater.. I don't weigh very much because I can't keep my food down. I keep buying animals to keep me grounded. I love each one but it's becoming a problem.

I'm reckless.
