I wrote my suicide noteNot that it matters. For the last 2 years, I got only confirmation that my death won't matter.

I don't even know why I'm posting this. Maybe for attention? Maybe I'm looking for a reason to keep going?  I don't fucking know

This post isn't even important. I know I'm too much of a pussy to actually kill myself. And I can't cut, I promised my girlfriend I wouldn't hurt myself. But I found a loophole, sleeping pills don't hurt

This is worthless. I'm worthless. It's all just so fucking worthless
