Iâ€™ve started to get happy at the thoughts of my suicide.Like Iâ€™ve had suicidal thoughts for ages now and they used to make me feel like shit. Then I just had a sudden realisation that maybe I should be dead and the whole reason I am feeling like this all of the time is that I am meant to be dead. After that I started to feel happy about the suicidal thoughts. Like Iâ€™ve imagined my whole suicide, like my parents finding my body hanging in my room, all of my friends finding out, my mum fucking crying at my funeral, the whole thing,  and it made me fucking happy, itâ€™s the only thing that really makes me feel happy now.  Which just shows how fucking selfish I am really.
