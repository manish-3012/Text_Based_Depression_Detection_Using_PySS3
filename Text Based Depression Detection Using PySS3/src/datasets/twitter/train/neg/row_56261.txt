I hate myselfHi,

My boyfriend is the kindest, best person I have ever met. He has always supported me through my anxiety and depression. Yesterday, he broke up with me because I have been emotionally abusing him for a long time. I don't know how long. He is my first boyfriend and the only person that I know I will ever love. I lash out and blame things on him when it is really me who is at fault. I want to die. I have already self-harmed myself. All I want to do is be a good person and make him happy like he deserves. Please help me.
