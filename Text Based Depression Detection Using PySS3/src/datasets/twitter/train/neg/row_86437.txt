Why on earth would it matter if I wasn't here?One person? There are over 7billion others and most of them are better than me. Who'd miss me?

Even if it did matter to someone, family or whoever, why does it matter to me what they feel? I can understand in a clinical sense that people love and care about me, but I feel absolutely nothing back. I don't love a single person. I don't even love my dog anymore.
