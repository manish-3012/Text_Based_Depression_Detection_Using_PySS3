Trying to think of reasons to stay aliveHey everyone, I know there's a lot of people worse off than I. I just don't really have anyone to talk to. I have a few friends but I don't feel comfortable expressing just how bad I feel because I don't want to burden them or stress them out. Like everyone else, I'm really just not willing to go on in life. I'm young, only 24. Most people might say that I have so much more life remaining, and they could totally be right. I could be rich and famous and extremely successful and happy in the future. But who cares? What's the point? Why struggle for the chance to be happy when that ultimately will be pointless? Sure, my loved ones will be upset. This is kinda fucked up, but if I wasn't alive I wouldn't have to feel bad for what I've done. I'd be dead as shit. I'm ugly, somewhat overweight, lazy, annoying, I'm sexually confused, gender-confused, I have a cringey fetish, recently no job, single, and my social skills fail when important. I don't really like the attention so I'm posting this anonymously. I'd really like to find reasons to bother going on. Thanks for reading.
