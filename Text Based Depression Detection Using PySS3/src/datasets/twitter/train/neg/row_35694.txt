My experience with Psychogenic DeathI completely gave up on myself in September because of a depressive episode. Body started deteriorating and all I did was watch. I did nothing. No TV, no reading, no exercise. Nothing. With the true intention of wanting to die. My body is in a horrific state and there's no turning back. I lost the will to live and my body started decaying in front of my eyes. I'm slowly dying. Recently tried to overdose on Tylenol as a way to end my pain sooner. I know suicide isn't the best option but it's my only option. 


TL; DR : gave up on myself back on September and my body started decaying. My immune system is horrible now and there's pain everywhere. I want to die.
Psychogenic death is real and it's very scary.
