Birthday seems the right dayIâ€™ve never had a happy birthday. As a kid, it was all about my birth giver staying in bed, hungover, getting drunk, making it clear the whole day was an inconvenience to her, so it never happened. From being 16 onwards my birthday was always spent with terrible boyfriends who thought my birthday would be a good day to rape or attack or abuse me or at the very least get drunk and tell me all the reasons their life would be better off without me but never leaving when I asked them to leave. My friends and family donâ€™t bother with presents or cards or even calls or texts because over the years my birthgiverâ€™s conditioning of them that I donâ€™t mean anything and am not worth being kind to has worked, and this year I am 6 months pregnant, itâ€™s my first year without my dad who died last year (the only person who ever made this day okay and who ever loved and protected me), and my partner thought today would be a good day to tell me that we havenâ€™t in fact paid the right fees on our rented home and our landlord has put the house back on the market to let, evidenced by the sign that has appeared at our front door today. I went through a terrible episode of mental health when my dad died (the day after I found out I was pregnant), I have schizoaffective disorder and fell into a deep, suicidal depression. With the help of nobody else I climbed out of it, knowing that I had my child and that this was more important and things would get better. Things didnâ€™t get better, and they never have or will. I canâ€™t bring my baby into a world where we cannot afford to eat. I bought rope today from the hardware shop. I canâ€™t fight this off any more, after recovery there were just more problems and pitfalls waiting for me.
