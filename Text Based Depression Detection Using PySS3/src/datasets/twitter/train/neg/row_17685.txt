No reasonThis is a throw away post. If I have any hope left, itâ€™s that I die. 

Iâ€™ve been thinking of ways to end my life in the most brutal way possible because I deserve a horrific death. I know I should care about the impact this would cause to my family and friends, but I just think itâ€™s best if I end it. Whether they will never forgive me or not, it doesnâ€™t matter. I want them to hate me for this. It would be better if the whole world just hated my existence.

I donâ€™t want to get better anymore, Iâ€™d rather drown in this state of mind.
