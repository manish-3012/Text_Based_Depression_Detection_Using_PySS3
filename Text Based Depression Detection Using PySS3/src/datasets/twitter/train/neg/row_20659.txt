My current outlookI really truly feel like life is a scam. You're forced into a world where the odds are stacked against you being truly happy. I think maybe 50% of the population are really happy (although my perspective may be skewed). For me, my life is way more pain than happiness, and it doesn't look like it's going to change any time soon.

The only reason I haven't killed myself yet is because it would hurt my family (mainly my mom) and I don't want them to feel the pain that I do. I also live with some hope that things could get better, but I don't think I have the skills or the energy. On my birthday, I wished that my family would all die in like a car crash or something so I could finally kill myself.

I'm waiting on my therapist, but I don't think he can help change the reality of my life. I wish they would try something other than just talk therapy and pills but when I told my psychiatrist the pills weren't working she just brushed me off.

I'm scared because I know I might impulsively do it. I have suicidal thoughts pretty much daily. When I drive I have to fight the urge to drive into a tree. I think if anyone ever handed me a gun, I would just do it. Like my brain realized I would stop myself before I followed through with a plan, so it told me to take the chance whenever a good opportunity presents itself.

Sorry for the rant, I know I'm fucked up. I just want to be better.
