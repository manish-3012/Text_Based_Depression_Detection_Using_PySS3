Ending it soon.Suicidal thoughts aren't new to me. I've almost done it twice and I feel like I've been living on borrowed time forever. Tonight I'm going to put an end to it forever because I have nowhere else to turn. 

I recently lost my job working from home because I live in a house with shitty internet and my landlord hasn't done anything to fix it. Led to so many problems that they eventually decided not to renew my contract. Didn't feel like a big deal at the time because they're a pretty big company and figured I could get another job pretty quickly. A couple months have gone by and nothing. I can't even get a retail/restaurant/fast food job because there aren't a lot of places here and I don't have my own mode of transportation to get to the city. I've tried looking for similar jobs where I work remotely and so far I've had a bunch of people lie, lead me on and blow smoke up my ass. Welcome to the real world, I guess. 

I've overdrawn both bank accounts, don't have a car to get around/get to another job and feel like a leech on society. I'm a burden to everyone I know because I'm such a fuck-up in life and they would be relieved if I just got rid of myself. 

I tried a crowd-funding project as a last-ditch attempt to get something going and get my feet off the ground but no one gives a shit. I'm stuck in financial hell, can't move back home and am just a parasite that the world would be better off without. I'm ready to stop delaying the inevitable and just end it.
