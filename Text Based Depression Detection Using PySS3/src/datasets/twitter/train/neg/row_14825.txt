The thought of suicide gives me closureIt gives me great relief to know that suicide is always an option. I am planning my suicide very soon, hopefully I can go through with it before graduating college. Nothing is worth living for in life. Everything in life is complete shit. Seeing others being optimistic and happy about life makes me want to throw up. Iâ€™m just not sure if I should drive into a tree or jump off a bridge. Whatever the method, one thing is final. I will kill myself. Fuck everyone
