I need help.I live with all these fantasies in my head. Ever since I started highschool my life's been going downhill. All my old friends are distancing themselves from me. I'm becoming lazy and last of all my anxieties catching up with me. I try to immerse myself in games and books, but it doesn't work anymore. Whenever I breathe it feels like there's a sharp knife in my throat. I don't have the courage nor materials to commit suicide. Help.
