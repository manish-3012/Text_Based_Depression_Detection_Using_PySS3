Im not good with titles but it seems like a good day to dieHeres a bunch of reasons not worth killing myself over that im going to anyway.

I got kicked out of my house because this dude spreas lies about me so now i dont have any friends/connections and the only place I can live is with my mom who refuses to move out of the ghetto.

My sister, my only real friend, moved halfway across the country.

I cant stand being alone so I have loads of fake golddigger 'girlfriends' but we dont actuallllly care about eachother.

The only woman I do care about barely talks to me anymore.

Someone backed into the front of my new Mercedes that id saved up months to get and insurance wont cover it. Its 6k to fix it. 

Ive been in the ER 4 days in a row for panic attacks and ive taked almost all of my xan/k scripts, theyre not giving me anymore.

Oh and i got a $300 speeding ticket for going 5 miles over the limit today, that was my only christmas present.

(Username Bonus) I dont even skate anymore.



Anyway, I got another hour, i want to see the last sunrise.
