This sub has been helpful to me in the past and I'm sorry if I'm about to let you all down.I have a feeling today might be the day. I don't know. I keep flitting between mindsets.

The past few days have been far too much to cope with. I'm so close to the edge of it all now. I feel terrible if I let down people that tried to help me - especially on this sub. You guys have been wonderful. I just have no support irl and this is honestly the worst bout of depression and suicidal thoughts I have EVER had in 11 years of being diagnosed with severe depression.

I can't stop crying, shaking, can't eat, sleep, can barely breathe. It's such an effort just to get out of bed to go to the bathroom. I'm tired of living like this and I just can't calm down.
