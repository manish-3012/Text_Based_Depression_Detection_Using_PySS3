I'm fucking sick of the suicide hotlineI'm not depressed. I'm not mentally ill. I don't even want to die, I just don't want to live. I don't want to finish school or go to college. I don't want to get a job or have kids or get married. It's not a decision based on emotions, its based on facts. They should loosen up about how bad suicide is. Besides, its no loss to the world if I die. I'm just another waste or space and whatnot.
