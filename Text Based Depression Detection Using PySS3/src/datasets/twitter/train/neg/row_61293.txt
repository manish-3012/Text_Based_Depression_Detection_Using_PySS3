heyi reallt want to die. iâ€™m such a burden to my parents. didnt pass my exams, wasted a whole year of my life along with over $30k. my parents keep saying that its okay that im still young and thst everything will work out soonn but i know that theyre stressed out because i donâ€™t know what i wanna do in life. i am so lucky to have such amazing people in my life, theu always support me and aree always there for me and tbh that makes me feel even worse...for a while i thought that im ok that im not sick anymore but literally the tiniest thing ever happened snd im back to being a suicidal piece of trash. and i dont feel like talking to anyone really... i know i keep taking everytjing for granted but igs just so hard for me ????i dont undersyand why. i just wish i could be gone..or switch lives with someone who deserves this good life that i sm living (yet canâ€™t seem to appreciate at all) idk where i was going with this. just felt like venting a little. sorry for all the typos im shaking so hard
