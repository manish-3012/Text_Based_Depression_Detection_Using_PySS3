it just gets worse.every day i think it canâ€™t get worse it just ... does?

itâ€™s like. when youâ€™re in such a bad place &amp; you think. this is truly the worst reality. but. thereâ€™s just more? 

today afternoon i found out something painful and i started to cry. but. the tears just stopped coming. i just sat there. gasping. heart pounding. dizzy. 

sometimes when iâ€™m trying to make sense of everything i think, â€œsurely. this must be preparing me for something. something big or important i am meant to do with my life that i just canâ€™t see/understand right now.â€

but. i was going through a really shitty time when I was 13-16. and guess what happened? life just got *shittier*. 
in even more complex and overwhelming ways. 

there was no light at the end of the tunnel. no relief. nothing got better because here i am over a decade later still very fucking depressed. 

my first suicidal thoughts happened when i was 14. i thought if i rolled down a slope i could break my neck and die. on the day i planned to do it. i went to said slope, sat there and sobbed for hours. 

i canâ€™t even count all the break downs i had as a teenager. everything was so bad that my body created a different coping mechanism. extreme numbness. and even with THAT. i had fucking night terrors + panic attacks. 

yeah okay i no longer have night terrors but you know what i have now instead? more fucking depression!!

nothing got better!! 

if anything it just got more worse &amp; more shitty. 

can you imagine me living for another 10 years only to say that it got worse than this???

to think things have truly peaked in their shittiness only to discover there can be more???

no. fuck that. 
i am not gonna do that anymore. i am going to manufacture courage. i am gonna do whatever the fuck it takes to end this shitty miserable life.
