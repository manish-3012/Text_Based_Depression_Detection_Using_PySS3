Would it just be better if it was over?Have you ever thought about killing yourself. The sweet relief from all the pain that comes with living in this world. No more worrying about girls or school or paying bills. No more thoughts about past trauma or the worries of future trauma. Do you ever wonder if life would be better without you that youâ€™re a burden and people would be better off without you? Do you ever wish that the terrible things youâ€™ve done would go away. That the pain would subside into nothingness. Do you ever wish you couldnâ€™t feel anymore that life was just to much. This is all a part of life though I suppose. Yes thereâ€™s the bad but with it comes good too. I have my friends and family. I overall enjoy life if Iâ€™m not thinking about it to hard. Who would take care of my cat, how would my parents and friends feel if I did leave them in this world. Does this matter at all because I will never feel again and I will never know the pain I have caused from losing me. Thatâ€™s not me though I want to be there for everyone. Happiness in others brings out happiness in me. I suppose if I can bring joy to one more sole on this earth I should stick around. You never know maybe life will turn out alright.
