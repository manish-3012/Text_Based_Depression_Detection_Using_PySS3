I don't know what's happening to me.Do you sometimes feel so fucking depressed and tired of life? I'm biporal..and I don't know how to feel anymore. I have girlfriend, I'm happy but I'm so sad at the same time. Like I'm so tired of existing. Do you guys have something similar? Because I don't really know how to feel and what to do anymore. 
PS: I don't even know what I'm talking about..
