15... Depressed and Living a LieGood Evening, 

Iâ€™m getting right into the post because this has been eating away at me for 5 years. Iâ€™m 15 years old. I live with my Mom, Dad, brothers and sisters quite lavishly. My parents combined income is well over $600,000 per year after taxes. We live lavish lifestyles, I go to a private school that costs upwards of $100,000 per year for my siblings and me to attend. Somehow this hasnâ€™t helped me any. I donâ€™t see how Hugo Boss suits are any better than the ones on sale a Value Village?


Iâ€™m depressed. Iâ€™ve never told anyone except my Mom over text but I told her if she told anyone I wouldnâ€™t be very happy. When I was in grade 5 my Mom get my tested for ADHD and I turned out to not only have severe ADHD but also OCD and Aspergerâ€™s Syndrome. My teachers know about my condition but I havenâ€™t told anyone about it.
I have so many problems in my life and I just want to start with the most important one: my whole life is a lie. Literally. Every aspect of my life is a lie. Iâ€™m a compulsive liar and I donâ€™t know how to stop. In grade 8 I got into stock trading and everybody at school though I hit it big, so, I rode the popularity. Wellâ€¦ I guess it went a little bit too far because now everyone at school thinks that Iâ€™m a millionaire. I have to steal money to make sure people think that I have thank kind of money. I research trades but never place them. I lie to make it look like Iâ€™m trading. Everythingâ€™s a lie. At home my parents have no idea about this. Iâ€™m such as good liar that I have been able to keep a divide between school and home for 4 years now, even with 4 siblings reporting. Anyways, everything I do is a lie and thatâ€™s slowly eating away at me. Not to mention that I have literally no friends at school and nobody to talk to. Nobody. Zero people. My supposedly best friend decided that itâ€™s more important to stand me up when I first asked him to hand out and instead get drunk with his friends. My other friend, well, I donâ€™t know. I just donâ€™t feel that kind of connection with him but heâ€™s cool, but, weâ€™re not good friends by any means. 
Anyways, back on topic. Remember that ADHD etc. diagnosis? Well the doctor that diagnosed me with that became my therapist for a few years. Turns out Iâ€™m so compelled about my image that instead of getting help from him I decided to lie about every aspect of my life, I told him Iâ€™m happy at home and at school. I never used any of his help because I was focused on making sure that he saw me as an academic and a scholar. Iâ€™ve been through 7 therapists and phycologists and, really to no avail. I never told them anything and put on a fake image of my life.
Talking about maintain my public image, Iâ€™m not motivated at all. Not one bit. Donâ€™t doubt me when I say Iâ€™m a genius. Iâ€™m unbelievably intellectually inclined and thatâ€™s something Iâ€™m not lying about. Iâ€™m not motivated because I can pick up math concepts and science theories at the drop of a hat. I can easily pull an 87-92 average without doing any work whatsoever. Things, they just seem to get done. Actually, no, thatâ€™s a lie. Iâ€™m only motivated when Iâ€™m under time constraints, but, even then Iâ€™m not doing to work. Iâ€™m stealing otherâ€™s assignments. Iâ€™ll spoof and email and get them to reply with an attachment of their assignment to my email and bam, Iâ€™ll copy the assignment and hand it in. Itâ€™s not because I donâ€™t understand the concept, itâ€™s because I donâ€™t feel like I need to do the work. I understand it perfectly I just donâ€™t want to write an 8 page essay on Of Mice and Men. Iâ€™m a genius but I need to find some way to get motivated. I think that my lack of school work and organization is dragging me down. You know whatâ€™s also dragging me down at school? The fact that Iâ€™m used and bullied. I have no friends like I said before and people think Iâ€™m rich and so in desperate attempts to make friends I carelessly drop cash at the corner store to buy people slushies and trust me, theyâ€™re expensive in South Carolina. Itâ€™s hard and people know theyâ€™re using me but I canâ€™t stop. I just want people to like me and be friends with me. I promise. Iâ€™m a really good person. The one girl that I have a massive crush on is nice to me though, which is really nice. Sheâ€™s really pretty and sheâ€™s flawless, but, I know my chances with her are slim. Anyways. I just want to move on. 


Iâ€™ve got a lot of issues around the house. Way too many really. Firstly, my Dad. Heâ€™s from Texas, so as you can probably imagine, heâ€™s got a temper, and trust me, his temper is very unfriendly. If something doesnâ€™t go perfectly then holy shit brace yourself because prepare to get yelled at and hit harder then youâ€™ve ever been hit before. Plus, I feel like he just doesnâ€™t love me. I donâ€™t think he does. If I EVER do something to my little brothers or sisters Iâ€™m immediately getting spit in my face from getting yelled at. If I do so much as hit them for hitting me Iâ€™m grounded. Iâ€™m locked in my room and shunned. He spends time with them too. Vacations, bike trips, road trips, shopping. Itâ€™s with them. They have good times together and I feel like I just take the fun out of their activities when Iâ€™m around. They laugh and laugh and when Iâ€™m there I just put a whole damper on the room. Not to mention that I think he kind of hates me. I can talk to him but I canâ€™t be upfront with him about anything because Iâ€™m scared. Same with my Mom. I canâ€™t be upfront with any of them and I have to bottle all of my problems deep inside me and let them slowly eat away at me. My Mom is nicer and doesnâ€™t get mad as often, but, when she does itâ€™s worse than my Dad; itâ€™s like a hurricane. I can talk to my Mom but I can only send her an e-mail because I feel like thereâ€™s something wrong with me, like Iâ€™m a disgrace and canâ€™t talk with her straight to the face. I also think that she hates me. Itâ€™s been pretty obvious Iâ€™ve been depressed for a few years now but sheâ€™s never said anything. A week ago my Mom decided to pamper my brother because she thought he might kill himself, why, because the Famous Footwear didnâ€™t have the pair of shoes he wanted. 



The issued I have at home donâ€™t stop with my parents. They donâ€™t trust me because we have a history that Iâ€™m actively working on but something I need to tell a white lie to escape them but they always blow it out of proportion. I have 2 twin sisters who are 12 years old and boy are they hormonal. Theyâ€™re practically like one person and theyâ€™re as catty as catty can be. I can ask them something and I feel like Iâ€™m getting my head torn off. I can never do anything right for them unless Iâ€™m giving them something, and, to make that even worse, if I donâ€™t give them something my Mom gets pissed at me because â€œIâ€™m not being a good big brotherâ€ which is crap because Iâ€™m busy and I never get anything in return from anyone in the house but Iâ€™m somehow forced to give them all of my possessions. My pin collection that Iâ€™ve spend hundreds of my hard earned dollars on, poof, gone because my brother decided he wanted to start oneâ€¦. Guess whatâ€¦.. Mom still owes me for the $450 in pins sheâ€™s â€œbuying from me for my brother!â€ I didnâ€™t consent to that and theyâ€™re worth more than that! She hasnâ€™t spent that on me in my life other than my education. Speaking of pampering my siblings I can honestly say that Iâ€™m the only one of us that actually cares about our house. I vacuum, clean the dishes, prepare dinner and more on a daily basis where my brother has to be asked 6 times to put his $3000 gaming computer down and put his dirty Gatorade cup in the dishwasher, which, I ended up doing. If I ever try to ask them to do work Iâ€™m immediately shut down by my parents and yelled at because â€œIâ€™m not their parentâ€ and I tell them that theyâ€™re not doing a very good job because it gets me really pissed but I only dig a deeper hole for myself. Oh godâ€¦ does the crapfest end there? I think so. Iâ€™m sorry for the long post and Iâ€™ll have a summary at the end real soon. Finallyâ€¦ Iâ€™m suicidal. Ever since grade 5, yeah for 6 long years Iâ€™ve devised plans to kill myself. I could never do it because the one thing I want more than anything, a kiss from my crush isnâ€™t going to happen if I kill myself, and, my parents, in all honestly would be distraught, but more importantly my Grandma and Grandpa wouldnâ€™t be able to handle that kind of pain. Iâ€™m suicidal, every day for hours I think about just ending it all but I could never do it and will probably not do it. 



Okay guys. I know Iâ€™m depressed and here are the reasons. Iâ€™ve never been able to talk to anyone and I need anonymity so youguys are my only option. Hereâ€™s why:

â€¢	Iâ€™m a chronic liar about my supposed wealth from the stock market and constantly steal to make sure people continue to think that Iâ€™m rich.   
â€¢	I canâ€™t talk to anyone about my problems.   
â€¢	I donâ€™t have any friends at school, anyone to talk to and am constantly bullied and used.  
â€¢	There is absolutely no motivation to get my school work done because it comes naturally, something that I really think is dragging me down and I need some serious help on.   
â€¢	At home my Dad thinks Iâ€™m the scum of this earth and my Mom doesnâ€™t think any better.   
â€¢	Iâ€™m not at all equal to my siblings (in my eyes)  
â€¢	My brothers and sisters all feel superior to me and I end up doing to work and catering to them because I need to do that to stay out of trouble.   
â€¢	My Mom, whenever I try to talk to her is always in denial, always blames everything on my and is very closed minded and pessimistic aboutâ€¦ wellâ€¦ me.   
â€¢	Iâ€™m extremely suicidal and just flat out depressed.    


I **REALLY** need any help that you can give. My life is in the dumps right now and it can only get better (I guess). I just need someone to talk to because clearly everything I'm doing isn't working. I can't escape. Please help.
