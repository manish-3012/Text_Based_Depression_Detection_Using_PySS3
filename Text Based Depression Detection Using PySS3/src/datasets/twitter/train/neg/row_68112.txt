Sick of whiningI feel like I am. I've been here before, stuff got better. But then stuff got bad again. I have resigned myself to accept the fact that i am going to do it. I just didn't/don't know when. I've had so many times that if I had a gun I'd be dead. Now I wonder when I cross a bridge, or am driving, or alone with a shit ton of drugs....that I will end. Life is so awesome and beautiful and we are so lucky just to exist for this short time, but all I want to do is go back home to the oblivion where we all were before birth. Death is only a curse for the living. I'm tired. I'm tired of doctors. I'm tired of hurting people that care. I'm tired of whining on reddit. I'm tired.
