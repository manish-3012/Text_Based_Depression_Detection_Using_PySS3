StrugglingAbsolutely heartbroken, was dating a girl that was my absolute soulmate, I can't sleep for the last two weeks, I keep having the most vivid dreams when I do fall asleep for and hour I'm drinking heavy, I am so depressed so so depressed my head is so sore, we had our first two big fights the last month one was over her going out three nights a week after we were having money issues, and my mind has been such a roller coaster one moment I'm fine next I'm an absolute wreck, I've tried to hang myself three times, but keep thinking that this pain will be gone within a week, I started smoking cigarettes again, I'm exercising but it's not helping, I keep running into her, I'm an absolute wreck, and was wondering what I can do to fix my mind, I got sleeping pills but they didn't help, and I can't seem to find other interests gaming and stuff isn't helping it's like I can't be bothered to do anything but I need to do things, I'm trying so hard to push on I'm only twenty one but I honestly feel like I won't have a comparability with someone like that again this year has been a really hard year for me and my depression and anxiety was bad before we split up, and I think one of the key factors of our split was cause of anxiety and depression, I also am s chef so I work crazy long hours, I have a good friendship network around me but I've only known them for a month all my family lives 40 hours away I went home four days last week, but it didn't help one bit, I feel so broken, and I understand alcohol is only a temporary fix but I just can't seem to find another way to help ease and I'm worried cause I'm so stressed alcoholism is apparent, I'm seeing a doctor today to get some more drugs. But I honestly don't know what to do I have a good job, and everything but I'm absolutely gutted by losing her, I don't regret what we had the fight about but I regret how it was done, and I feel like my behaviour was controlling but I was just thinking about the future, I never once said she couldn't go out, but I was getting upset with the money sides and not telling me she's going out, I understand the relationship became in healthy and I think future me will accept it, but I really need a fix, I've been a broken person since I was young.
