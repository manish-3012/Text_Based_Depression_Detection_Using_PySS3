my depression is overcoming meiâ€™m so lost. i feel so worthless and feel like i have no place in this world. my anxiety makes it impossible to grow as a person and i just have no positive outlooks anymore. i know iâ€™m not going anywhere in life and i donâ€™t see the light at the end of the tunnel. i see a therapist but my parents are against me taking any sort of medication to help me. i just donâ€™t know what to do and iâ€™m honestly scared for myself. i just need some advice on how to get over all the thoughts i have so i can be here for the people i love as long as possible
