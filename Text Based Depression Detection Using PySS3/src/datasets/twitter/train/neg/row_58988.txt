why do people think that suicide is selfish3% so this ones gonna be short.
last year i attempted suicide and my best friend said "how could you do this to me?". i bet the shit out of him and rolled his body down the stairs. i honestly just thought how selfish can this fucker be? anyways, can somebody talk to me?
