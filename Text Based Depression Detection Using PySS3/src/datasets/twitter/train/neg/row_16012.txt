If I go to the hospital tonight will I still be able to go to work tomorrow?Some guy tried to initiate a hate crime against me last week for being a gay woman and I'm still so shaken up I can't function. I was even at work on Thursday and Friday just having to go to the bathroom every couple hours to cry in the stall. None of my family or friends are being supportive, they keep telling me to just get over it. I even tried posting on the LGBT reddit and they said to just get over it. But I can't. Now I have a fear of being murdered by gangs where I live, because that's who was trying to fuck with me as some initiation or something.

I want to talk to a person. I already tried suicide hotline but they weren't helpful at all. I'm scared if I go to the hospital they're gonna call the cops on the guy and then they'll go after me. I also don't want to be committed. I don't have a therapist. Please help
