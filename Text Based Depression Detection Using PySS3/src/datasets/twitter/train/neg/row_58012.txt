I donâ€™t want to get things worseI feel like Iâ€™m drowning in the pitch. I have the lump in my throat for most of the time. I donâ€™t want to stop resisting suicidal thoughs but itâ€™s getting worse. 
I donâ€™t want to strain with this my friends and family. It feels like they could fall apart like me. 
Iâ€™m a teenager, text me if you think you can help somehow.
