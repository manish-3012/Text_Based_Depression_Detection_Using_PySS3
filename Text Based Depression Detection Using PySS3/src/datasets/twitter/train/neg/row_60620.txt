I feel guilty for feeling like I want to dieI (23F) feel guilty because I know there are people out there that have it worse than me. I mainly feel like this because after my partner cheated on me it messed up my self esteem to the extent where I hate who I am because Iâ€™m not who they loved. But I know other people are going through way worse things. 

Then again, I canâ€™t even fathom how else to rid of this pain besides ending it completely, along with myself.
