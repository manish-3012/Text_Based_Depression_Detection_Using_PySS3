Actually wrote the note and have a planI've had ideation since I was a teen, but have never taken these steps before. I was already depressed and hopeless and a breakup yesterday just ended the last thing in my life that made me feel okay. I'm not killing myself over a failed relationship, it was just the last bump I needed to realize that I'm hopeless. It could've been something else.

I've picked the method and have a plan to execute. Wrote the note to my family. I wonder if I'm going to chicken out in the end. I don't know. The thought of doing all this and then not going through with it makes me hate myself even more.
