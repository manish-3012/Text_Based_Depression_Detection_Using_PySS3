Who am I kidding? Things aren't going to get any better.Ever since my fiance dumped me, things haven't been great.  
He kicked me out of our home. My family treats me like garbage since I had to come back here, and I have too limited of a time until I'm homeless. 

Again. 

I fucking hate being homeless. Can't imagine doing it during this pandemic crap going on.  I can't even get a fucking job to get out of this situation because of it.

What's the point anymore? No one cares about me. I don't have any friends, my family doesn't like me, and the love of my life got tired of me.   
Pretty sure no one would even notice if I was gone. I just, wish things would get better. Better off just giving up now than being disappointed more.
