VentingI'm sitting alone at the airport in my car. I haven't eaten more than the donut my friend force fed me so I could sober up before work. I'm still a little hungover. I don't have a drinking problem, I had a party last night for my birthday. Which is today. I'm twenty. I'm in college and work two job. My life isn't awful. But on the drive over here from the beach, I was just thinking about how badly I want to be in a terribly horrifying car accident. I don't want to cause it. I couldn't ever hurt someone or ruin my car on purpose. I want to be in the hospital. The ICU. Seriously injured. Probably not dead, but hell maybe that wouldn't be so bad either. I don't even know what would make me happy anymore. I am just so fucking tired. I'm not religious. I don't think there is anything after this life and that's what stops me. That we all will just cease to exist eventually. I'm an organ donor. I wish I could just give them away now, let my young, and fairly healthy organs go to someone who values life more. I'm just rambling now, but is there really any way to conclude something of this nature? I've always been bad at writing conclusions.
