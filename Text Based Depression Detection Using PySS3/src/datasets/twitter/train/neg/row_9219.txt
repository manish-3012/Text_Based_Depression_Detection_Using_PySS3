I just want to cry.And I can't.

I'm unable to experience any emotions.
I can't even think.
I literally have feeling that there is a black cloud inside
my head that messes up all my thought processes.
Even my field of vision is "darker".

I knew a few people who attempted to kill themselves, because 
"they were sad".
Now, I would do anything just to *feel* sad.
Just to feel anything at all!

What is this?
Is it depression?
I have no reason to be depressed.

I just want it to stop!
I don't know how much longer can I take this...
