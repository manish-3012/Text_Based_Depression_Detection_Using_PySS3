I just can't handle it anymoreI just can't anymore. I have no friends, the ones that I ever did have all ended up just stabbing me in the back, I can't trust anyone, I have fucked up my emotions beyond repair, I have been asking for help for years but never received it. I am told to never be afraid to say whats on my mind and on those rare times that I do, its "the wrong thing" or I get "a talk" that just ends up leaving me feeling like the issue. I have no outlet, I have tried for years. The last time I broke I ended up in a mental hospital for a while and learned how to suppress my feelings well enough to last a few more years. I am always paranoid, afraid of everyone and myself, the few things that I feel actually help me to an extent, I am kept away from. I just can't do it anymore. I have tried "not caring" for a bit but it effected things that weren't supposed to and it set me back quite a bit. I see no point anymore. The only reason I haven't killed myself yet is because I couldn't find anything to do it quick enough and also how my parents would do after. But I am at a point where I don't even care about that anymore. 

I'm fucking done.
