I tried to commit suicideI am 17 yo. 
I swallowed a bunch of random pills last Saturday and  I woke up in the hospital yesterday. I have to stay in the hospital until the end of the week. 

My dad went to see me today and now I feel even worse than before I tried to kill myself. 

I just want to get home as soon as possible.
