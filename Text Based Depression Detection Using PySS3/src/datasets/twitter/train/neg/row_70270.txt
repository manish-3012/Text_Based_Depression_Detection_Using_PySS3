Therapist says I don't have Asperger's. Guess I am just stupid then.I've had social anxiety all my life. I'm 100% sure I have some type of Auditory Processing Disorder because I can't comprehend anything when explained to me verbally. I consistently don't understand the motivations of characters in movies/TV/literature etc., and therefore only enjoy non-fiction media. I have no friends. I drown in detail and get lost in the big picture.

Therapist says no, I'm just depressed and anxious. Ok, great, that also means I'm just stupid and weird. 

People are also evil. All of them. I have no trust that no one will disappoint me.
