I'm going to end everything in two weeks from this Friday.Two Fridays after the coming one, I'm going ahead. I have a way - I'm fine and am going ahead.

After all the difficulties I've had, I've kept going. Now the final bit of pressure has come &amp; I quit.

The last thing that I enjoyed &amp; that actually saved my life has now been taken away from me in the past three weeks.

Until recently I worked out consistently. Four and five days a week - I can't do that now. It's been ripped away. 

Why, my right knee is staying inflamed - even when I do nothing. I saw one of the best joint doctors in my city. He's saying my knee is imflamed with a small bit of arthritis. It's been three weeks. It's still hurts. My ability to do the cardio, swimming &amp; weights I've enjoyed just got taken away from me. 

I'm not going to live while being forced to sit like a lump on a couch. I got to the lightest weight I've ever been at I now weight 197 lbs. 
I used to weight 330 lbs. 

I'll now become a blob like my Mom. I'm not living like that. Now or ever. 

I'm going in two weeks. I dont want to go, but I can't live that way. That's final.

Come next check, I'll get the required items. Write a letter explaining why, and go.
