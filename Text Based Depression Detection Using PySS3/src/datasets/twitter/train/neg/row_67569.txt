I tried to help a friend so I called a suicide hotlineI did just that and the lady on the line didn't take me seriously. Just because I met my friend online, she told me he might be faking it. Why ? Why would someone I met online fake being suicidal ? I've been suicidal and I know how it feels, I just want to help the guy out. 

I feel like the next time I feel suicidal, I won't have anyone to turn to anymore.
