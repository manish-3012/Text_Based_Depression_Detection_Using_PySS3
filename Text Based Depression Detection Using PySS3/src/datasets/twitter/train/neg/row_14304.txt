I can't find a wayAnyone else feel like a failure as a woman?

I am a total piece of shit

This is my second post, I cannot sleep. 

I feel like the worst mother in the world. My kid is sick with pneumonia and I can't even take her to the doctor. My car insurance lapsed and I don't even have the money for a goddamn Uber. 

I have been trying to get disability for the last few months but with everything shut down my case is just in limbo right now. I wish I could work so bad but at 30 I am totally broken. I have too many health problems to list. But I'm not trying to feel sorry for myself but fuck me is it hard! 

I asked my brother for money who I just gave $100 to cause he needed it and he told me to get my life together. It made me cry for over an hour and now I can't face asking anyone else for help. I've always worked even through pain. 

I have a terminal illness and seriously want to just end it but I am all my kids have cause their father is a drug addict and has been MIA since 2009.

My kids deserve a better mother
