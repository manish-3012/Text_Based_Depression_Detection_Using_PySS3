It's all too muchI'm running out of people to speak to about my problems. I am simply too much for them, which is understandable. I am a lot to deal with. I told two of my friends that they don't know what they're getting into before we really became close and they still decided to get to know me. Curse my luck. I wish they had listened because now it just makes me feel awful to see us growing away. I isolate for a reason. This is only a very, very minor spot on my map of issues. I've come to an impasse. My most recent problem now is not having a reliable way to kill myself. I simply can't stand this visceral burning hell anymore. Thank you.
