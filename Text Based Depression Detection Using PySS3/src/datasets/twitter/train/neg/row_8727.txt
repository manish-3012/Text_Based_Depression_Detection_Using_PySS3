Only my cat is keeping me aliveI'm a junior in nursing school and I feel like I'm failing at everything. I skipped one of my practice labs today because I just couldn't leave my apartment. My meds are making me crazy. 
When I sleep it's like I'm getting raped all over again and I wake up more tired than when I fell asleep. 
My cat is the only thing keeping me from killing myself. I rescued him from a shelter and he was abandoned before I got him. I can't let him get abandoned again
