i just want to die in my sleep for god knows how longi dont like the feeling of waking up every single damn day and know my task was to only clean the house, do online class and that's it. i never got a time for myself, for music. i wish to never wake up tomorrow fucking always and just live in the confusing or blacked out dream of mine. sounds corny as fuck? i know. i dont know any "painless" option to end everything, since it's all painful. i fucking hate myself. goodnight.
