Escape alternativesThis is a bit more positive. A lot of the reason I think about killing myself is its a way out of this boring/stressful life. I used to think about going to a mental institute but after actually going there it really isn't a good place to escape.

Do you have any other suggestions of espacism plans? All I have now is driving 17 hours to see my ex which probably isn't the most healthy.
