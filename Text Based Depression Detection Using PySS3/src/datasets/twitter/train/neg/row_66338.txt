Is there *anywhere* to look for information on actual suicide methods (that is, obviously, not here)?Let me preface this by stating I'm not melancholical, nor suicidal, and I do **not** want to die, even though it might happen.

Now, suppose someone is, quite unfortunately, absolutely positive they are going to end their life. Is there *anywhere* on the internet where such a person can find resources on methods, their pros and cons, success rate, level of comfort and the like?

I figure something like this should exist, but finding it has proven exceedingly hard for me over the last month or so.

It might be against the rules to link to these here directly, but I'll settle for broad directions.

Rule 1b forbids:

&gt;b) **Pro-Suicide Posts or Comments,** ***or any explicit discussion of suicide methods***

So, hopefully, this post is allowed, as I'm not looking for any specific information on suicide methods here, but rather asking if they are available somewhere else should anyone "require" them.

Thanks,
