No reason to liveHi, first: sorry for my english.
I have completely no reason to live. I can't focus on anything so I don't enjoy things like books, games or even YouTube video. Every day looks pretty much the same. Nobody really likes me or talk to me, I have just one real friend but we talk really rarely, and I'm too stupid to pass school. What is the point od life when there's no reason to getting up from bed? I've had attempt three months ago and I've failed becouse I didn't know how to tie the loop properly (what is fucking funny) and I still have marks on the neck.
So, what to do, huh? I don't give a single fuck anymore, like my life is over arleady and what is going on right now is just a formality.
Thanks for your time.
