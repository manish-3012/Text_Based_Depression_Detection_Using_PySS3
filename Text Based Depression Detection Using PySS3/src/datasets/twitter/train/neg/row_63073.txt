I don't enjoy thisI just wish everybody understood how much I hate being alive. Since I can remember, (maybe 5 yrs old) I've fantasized about my death. Prayed for it. Begged God to take me out. Overdosed, tried to CO poison myself a few times. Haven't had an attempt in a few years.

    I just wish people knew. I'm not here for me. I'm not alive because I enjoy it, I don't. And it's not fair. But life's not fair I know. But fuck life man forreal. It's torture. I wish they knew.
