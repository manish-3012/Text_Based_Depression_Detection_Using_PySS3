Walking The LineThat is what it feels like in my mind. I'm on the edge and slowly walking along the edge just waking for the foundation to give out from under me. Last night when I was taking my second xanax I just kept staring into the bottle walking that edge once more wanting to take the rest of the bottle but I guess auto pilot kicked in and I closed the bottle without taking that extra step. I'm tired and wish I did because I'm so empty and blank today that I can't be bothered to feel anything anymore.
