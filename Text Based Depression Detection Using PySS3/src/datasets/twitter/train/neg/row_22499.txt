Don't read thisWell, you're reading this so I better tell you what's going on... ha like you care...

My life is very isolated. I'm 15 and I have no friends and am left out of everything. My parents are super overprotective and don't let me use the internet, I'm here in secret on my xbox. I just want to end everything, my parents constantly scream at me and beat me for not being perfect. 

I don't know what to do anymore, I just want to die, I've been like this for years and nothing has changed. I just want to kill myself
