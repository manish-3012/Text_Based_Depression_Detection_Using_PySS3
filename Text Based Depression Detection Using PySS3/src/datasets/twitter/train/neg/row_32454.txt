Nothing leftWhenever I get depressed and people ask me are you ok, I lie and say yes. I'm at the point where I don't people care, they just don't want to feel bad to see me. Usually they just leave me alone, confirming my theory. I'm sick of people asking me if I'm ok. Nobosy cares. 
I have failed at everything I have everything I have ever tried, and my successss are useless in improving my life, college degree, eagle scout, worthless. 
I loss my insurance due to falling through the cracks of the system and they refuse to show mercy. 
I'm ready to die, I want to die, but if I try I know I'll fuck it up like I do with everything in life and rack up medical bills I cant pay.
The sucide hoteline is worthless. 
Why cant I just die.
