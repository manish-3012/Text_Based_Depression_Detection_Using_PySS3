Hearts are brokenTomorrow morning I'm going to set off nice and early to look for someone quiet and peaceful to lay down and disappear from the world. This world isn't a happy place, I've never found acceptance or love and I don't think I ever will. The only person I ever loved broke my heart, I haven't cut my hair, shaved or brushed my teeth for a while now, and the only thing that makes me happy is eating. So I eat until I'm feeling sick.

I don't think I have any true friends and the people I do know will most likely just forget me after a week or two. Nobody will miss me, there's always someone better or more interesting, more beautiful (I wish I was beautiful) I don't see any worth in myself, or any reason for my existence. 

Goodbye.
