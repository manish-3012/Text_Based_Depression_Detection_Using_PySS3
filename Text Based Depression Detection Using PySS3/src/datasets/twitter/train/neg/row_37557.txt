I had to execute my emergency planThings have gotten rather difficult lately and it hurts that much more when itâ€™s your own family poking at your mental weaknesses - they seem to know them best and seem to enjoy seeing me at my worst.  Being a gun owner makes moments of brokenness like these especially hard to get through.  My heart is heavy and tired and my mind is clouded but Iâ€™m thankful I thought just clearly enough to execute my emergency plan.  Hopped in the car with the dog, drove to my â€œdrive through Jesusâ€ window, parked the car and am listening to some metal.  For those wondering thereâ€™s this church that has a small prayer area in the back which is obviously closed at this hour, but from the parking lot itâ€™s illuminated so beautifully itâ€™s just a peaceful place - I donâ€™t even belong to this church or any church for that matter but the spot gives me a such a sense of tranquility in these moments when the horrible thoughts cross my mind of how easily I could end things if I were home.  Iâ€™ll sit here in the car longer until the tempest in my mind calms a bit more - looking over to my dog in the passenger seat helps me come up with at least my first reason to move forward and keep trying at life.  I think Iâ€™ll get him a plain cheeseburger when I leave and give myself a second reason.   Stay kind yâ€™all.
