It really hurts knowing exactly where you were wrong and what you should have done to succeed but being too late to change anythingThe only thing that could bring me happiness is going back in time and fixing my past. I know exactly where I was wrong and I know exactly what to do in order to correct everything, but it's too late. Nothing that I do these days will give me a life worth being proud of, I should have done things right when I had the chance.

It hurts so much to only NOW know what choices I should have made. This information is useless now, but it would had saved my life had I known all of this back in the day.

Everything is over, and it's soul-crushing. My life is done.
