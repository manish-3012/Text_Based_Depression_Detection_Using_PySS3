drunk, not in crisishoping this isn't against the rules...

i'm suicidal by default. i have been for almost a decade now, but i'm powering through it. i'm just so tired.

i have a long-term partner and a cat who are worth living for. i've also gone through two funerals of people who offed themselves, both very close to me and younger than i am now. i can't help but envy them. they both blew their brains out and i don't have the same access, nor am i that brave.

i'm transgender and keep having to delay for financial reasons. i think my partner will stay with me after, but there is still a risk so delaying is a blessing and a curse. 

there is an xacto blade somewhere in our spare room but i am not sure exactly where. i'm not trying to relapse into self harm or to have my partner find me in the tub tomorrow morning. not hurting people is my main drive to keep going. it is not for myself. 

i could get in the car but i also could survive whatever accident i cause for myself so it's probably not worth it. i just...don't know how to become the person that i want to be. i don't know if it's possible. so is it even worth it to try?

everyone who has met me would be better off if they hadn't. so why am i here????
