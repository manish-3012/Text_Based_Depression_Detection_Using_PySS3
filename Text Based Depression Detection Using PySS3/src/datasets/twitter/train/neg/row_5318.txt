quick rant, donâ€™t pay any attention[directed towards my â€œperfectâ€ friends. not towards any of you lovelies. marked nsfw so they canâ€™t read it unless they click/tap on it. just as a test to see if they care ;) ]

holy fuck

itâ€™s been a week since I left this group. a week. I joined back today and I have only been here for a few hours and itâ€™s un-fucking-bearable. I just told you I was gonna kill myself if I didnâ€™t get help (which I just got back from an attempt) and what happened? the chat died as soon as I sent my message and itâ€™s not like it was inappropriate. and then you sent images of peopleâ€™s art/sculptures of pride-themed animals. 

â€œthanks a lot. I *reaaaaaaally* needed itâ€

god, I hate you all. none of you even cared. none of you EVER cared. I canâ€™t even fucking leave because Iâ€™ve already committed to being here. you all are fucking wonderful. said no one ever.

talk to the rest of the group and tell them how terrible I am. talk shit about me where I can blatantly see. or donâ€™t. I donâ€™t care. say how Iâ€™m unstable and I need to be put in a mental hospital. kick me out. I donâ€™t fucking care. not anymore.

and this doesnâ€™t go to the nice ones; the nice ones know who they are and know this isnâ€™t directed towards them. but the rest of them?

fuck. you.

~sincerely, your friend, â€œsimp.â€ (no that was not a typo)
