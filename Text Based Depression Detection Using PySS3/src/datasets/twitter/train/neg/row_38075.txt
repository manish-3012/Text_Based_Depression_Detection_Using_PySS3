I donâ€™t see the point.My whole life, Iâ€™ve felt as if suicide is the only â€œreasonableâ€ thing to do. Iâ€™ve told myself that I need to do it someday, but I just keep putting it off. Thereâ€™s so much I need to explain for this to make sense, but Iâ€™d rather not go into it. Itâ€™s not easy having a multitude of mental illnesses and, on top of that, being trans. This is something Iâ€™d never wish on my worst enemy.

It feels like every day Iâ€™m just here, suffering. Iâ€™m alive, but at the same time Iâ€™m not. Iâ€™m existent. Iâ€™m physically alive. But I donâ€™t feel alive at all.

Iâ€™ve been thinking about it more in-depth lately and Iâ€™ve come to the harsh realization that my death would mean nothing. My family and friends would be better off without me. Everyone would be. Iâ€™m a horrible person, and nothing can change that.

I thought for a while that my life purpose was to be an animal rights activist, protecting and saving animals. I still have the same aspirations, but really, nothing would change whether I was there or not. If I wasnâ€™t there, someone could easily take my place. Iâ€™m just a single person. There are a bunch of new people born every day. Whatâ€™s the point for me in particular to be here?

Iâ€™m so hopeless. My suicidal thoughts have ramped up a lot lately. I donâ€™t really have a reason to live other than the fear of dying.
