Why did I have to be born?I don't get why I had to be born, just a pathetic break from nonexistence that I haven't enjoyed at all. I can't remember the last I got up in morning looking forward to the day, it must have been years ago. I don't want to avoid death, there is not point in extending my life if I get no enjoyment at of it. I don't stay for my family, I couldn't care less really what happens them. I have stopped taking my pills, I don't care anymore. I wish it would just happen in my sleep without me knowing, then I will stop existing forever. Life is once in a eternity but that doesn't mean much to a dead man.
