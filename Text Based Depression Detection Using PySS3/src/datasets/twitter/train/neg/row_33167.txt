anti-suicide pact, still want to kill myselfi made a pact to get better with someone; my best friend, my brother (found family, not by birth)... but i know hes going to get better eventually and im not. we made commitments to try and have a real schedule every day and to go to bed at the same time but even though hes been sticking to it i fucked it all up within a  week.

when i get upset and i talk to him he repeats the same things over and over again about how things can get better and how we're working on it together, but i can hear it in his voice. he doesnt believe it. its all posturing. the fucked up part is i know for *him* that its true. but not for me.

the whole thing started when i told him im planning on killing myself in january and he got incredibly upset and made me promise that i would try and get better with him, and at the time i agreed because i was genuinely afraid that if i did kill myself he would get the idea planted in his head more than it already has and do it

but it doesnt matter now. "recovery isnt a linear progress" and "were doing it together" doesnt mean shit when you know that trying it for eachother means nothing.

what if january rolls around and im not happy and this whole effort was for nothing? what if its a waste of everyones time

if i died it would make everyones life better. minr, his, my girlfriends, my parents... it all is going to culminate into a bit of temporary sadness followed by whatever other replaceable person comes to fill the gap i left.

today i dissassociated so hard i couldnt figure out how many hours were between 2 and 4 pm. how am i supposed to be a museum technician or pass my classes or do anything at all that i need to to survive and to thrive past january even if i make it that far? 

its all pointless. it doesnt matter. its whatever, though, i guess
