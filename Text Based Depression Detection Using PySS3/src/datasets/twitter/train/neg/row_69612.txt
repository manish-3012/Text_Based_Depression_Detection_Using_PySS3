Realizing I don't mean shit to people makes me feel better.I recently realized that I don't mean anything to people I was friends with for 2+ years. It hurts a lot. I even tried to confront one of my closest friends via text saying if I'm just a burden tell me, because I can't take this torture. I've been excluded every big outing they've gone to. They don't talk to me at all unless I try to talk to then first, and even then its iffy. I've recently reached my breaking point when I realized how grossly I've sobbed at recent events that prove how useless and meaningless I am to these people. The friend I texted ignored me. Not like, Oh maybe they dont have their phone. No. They've been posting on social media and hanging out with people. I'm just a burden to them, but at least answer me and tell me I'm a burden. I told them it was okay to tell me that. I'm not mad, as long as it makes them happy to kick me aside thats fine. I mean, I feel terrible. The worst. But, in a way, It makes me feel better realizing I dont mean shit to people, because it means that's one less person who would care if I killed myself. 

I dont know. I've been so scared to post on any sites about my thoughts, because I always thought my friends might see it. But now I know even if they did, they wouldn't care. 
I'm just a waste of their time.
