At what age does depression stop being â€œcuteâ€Iâ€™m turning 21 next Monday and Iâ€™m honestly starting to lose hope more and more. When I was 15 I at least had the hope that when I got older I could grow out of my sadness and maybe it was a â€œpubertyâ€ thing. The older I get the less hope I have in regard to growing out of my condition. The thought of being 30 and still feeling like this is haunting me right now.
