Tired of living. In process of saying goodbye to everybody I care about. Suicide should follow soon after.28 years old, mental health problems, depression, anxiety, neurosis. Never had job because I canâ€™t handle it. Never had a girlfriend because Iâ€™m ugly and emotionally retarded. Virgin. 

I canâ€™t enjoy anything any more, sleep is the only respite I have so I sleep a lot. The anti depressant pills donâ€™t have much effect, just make me feel more numb. 

Over the last couple weeks Iâ€™ve been visiting the few various people I care about and who care about me just so I can say goodbye in my own way. I also plan on writing an extensive suicide note so they know it isnâ€™t their fault and they shouldnâ€™t feel guilty. Iâ€™m ending things because Iâ€™m broken. 

I just hope they move on quickly. I canâ€™t live like this any more. Thus isnâ€™t how human beings are meant to live.
