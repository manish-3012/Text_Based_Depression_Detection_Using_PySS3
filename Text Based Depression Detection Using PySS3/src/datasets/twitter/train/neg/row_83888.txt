I donâ€™t wanna live like this anymoreIdk what to do anymore because I canâ€™t live normally and I canâ€™t see myself ever being able to. Iâ€™m pretty sure I was sexually abused by a family member as a kid, I have vague memories of it happening at least once, and I know I stopped talking for like 7 years until grade 6. Not talking for that long really screwed me up and I have such intense anxiety now, especially around men. I canâ€™t keep friendships or relationships. I canâ€™t keep a job because I get so overwhelmed I end up in the hospital. Iâ€™m on social assistance and donâ€™t have enough money to eat so I have to keep borrowing money just to eat and I feel like Iâ€™m never going to catch up and be out of debt. I live somewhere with hardly any mental health resources, Iâ€™m too scared to even go to the hospital because last time I went for a panic attack (had no idea what it was and thought I was dying) the EMTs treated me like shit and laughed at me in the back of the ambulance cause they thought I was just on drugs (I wasnâ€™t). All I do is lay in my bed depressed broke and hungry. I have one friend who actually talks to me frequently. Other than that itâ€™s just me and Iâ€™m miserable and canâ€™t see myself ever getting better or having a career or just being able to afford groceries for an entire month. I feel completely hopeless and stuck and I just donâ€™t want to live in such a terrible world anymore.
