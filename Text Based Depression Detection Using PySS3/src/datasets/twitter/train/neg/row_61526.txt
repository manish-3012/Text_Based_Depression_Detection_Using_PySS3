Safe spaces that arenâ€™t safe spaces for meI opened up about my experiences with being sexually assaulted and raped by women and you know what people said?

That Iâ€™m â€œhomophobicâ€ because I didnâ€™t enjoy being catcalled by a woman at age 12. 

That she was â€œbeing motherlyâ€ by touching me all the time and giving me unwanted hugs. Of course she wasnâ€™t abusing her power as my teacher to reach down my back and touch me, but she was just doing anything a normal middle school teacher would do. 

So where the fuck is my safe space. Where can I talk about the women abused me without being labelled as the victim because women are apparently so pure and pristine. So what am I? Iâ€™m a girl too.

This world sucks. Thereâ€™s no good. Thereâ€™s only people who use their experiences to be assholes to others. I can never see this world changing for the better. Everyone is becoming so selfish and caught up with themselves to even stop and think for a second about what theyâ€™re doing. Everyone only cares about making themselves look good. Everyone only cares about always being in the right, always being the most correct, always having the last word. 

Everyone only cares about themselves. 

And I care about myself too. So Iâ€™m going to fucking kill myself.
