Police came to my door today?This weekend has been terrible for me and one night I was venting to a friend and I said that I wanted to kill myself (just venting nothing serious) and about bullying at school. Well today I was out with my mom and neither of my parents know about my problems or cutting and such. Anyways I was out with my mom, and my dad called and I had to talk to the police officers and I said I was just venting. I asked the person I was talking to if they said anything and I trust them to be honest and they said no. The only other thing I can think of is that I called the hotline in like May, saying that I have suicidal thoughts. Could they still come to my house even this much later?
