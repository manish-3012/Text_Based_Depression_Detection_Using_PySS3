I'm an intelligent, hard working 23 year old that has accomplished absolutely nothing.I've had thoughts of just ending everything, but then I think of family and friends.

I work at a car wash. I have a degree from Loyola University but got a DUI last June shortly after graduation. Set me back quite a bit. I still owe thousands to the state for that, on top of my 36,000 for student loans.

I feel stuck. With a Communications degree and no career in sight. I've been in food service and blue collar my entire life. The woman I love doesn't love me back. I look around and see the beginnings of flourishing careers all around me, then look in the mirror and see some kid who works at a goddamn car wash and lives with his grandparents.

Sorry for the pity party.
