Idek why I'm posting thisI just need to get some shit off my chest. I've struggled with mental illness my entire life and I've really tried to get through it. When I was younger I tried hard to kill myself but obviously it didn't work. So I accepted I'm too big of a fuck up to die so I've been trying so hard to live. I'm now in the Army, I'm in Hawaii, I should be doing great.

Im not. Idky. Im receiving counseling thru the military and it's okay but I cant tell them that I constantly just think of killing myself. I cant chance my career over being honest but at the same time, all I do is wish I was dead. I've got people that care about me, I'm in pretty good shape just by being an infantryman, I'm even not hideous..

So why is it I'm always unhappy. I understand I'm diagnosed w/ bipolar depression and have severe anxiety. But lately, its a whole lot more depression involved with my bipolar. There's so much sadness and rage and anxiety built up and it's not getting better. Im miserable. Im lonely. I've got all these ppl that care but I rarely have people that actually talk to me outside of work. Hell I could turn off my phone today and not get a text till im needed for work.

Im just so alone. I miss that feeling of being loved and I'm pretty sure I'm about to become another statistic. I've done the therapy, taken the meds, taken the steps towards recovery. Im not getting better, the opposite in fact. I just need to tell someone...I think im going to hang myself and that terrifies me. I've only ever overdosed before. Im scared of hurting others. Im scared of being another statistic. But I cant live like this. I'm so broken. I just want out of this world. Fuck this.
