I want to kill myself but I donâ€™t know how to get the materials I need because I am 14.I have read about easy and effective ways to kill yourself, but for the most part, they all involve materials that I wonâ€™t be able to get. I have thought about using fentanyl and possibly a gun because they seem to be the least painful way to die but Iâ€™m still scared. I have also thought about sleeping pills but have heard itâ€™s unluckily that you actually die off of them, and would most likely wake up with lasting consequences. Thoughts?
