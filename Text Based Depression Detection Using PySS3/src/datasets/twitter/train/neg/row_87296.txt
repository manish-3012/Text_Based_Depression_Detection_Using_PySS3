im never good enough and i should have done this seven years agoI feel like my entire life is falling apart. From the outside, im sure I look like a normal college girl, but Im losing all my passions, Im tired all the time, I just don't want to live anymore. I've always hated how I look--the pressure to be perfect seems too much for me. My eating disorder has taken over my entire life. Im still too fat at a size 4, my size 0 jeans wont go over my ass anymore, I read fatpeoplehate daily just to instill an extra dose of self hatred.
My family calls me fat and crazy behind my back. They frequently victim blame and forget that I was raped 6 years ago today. Some kind of happy anniversary is in store, I suppose. 
My best friend raped me when I was 13 and the rest of my life has been fucked up since then. 
Im never perfect enough, I'll never get into chemical engineering school anyway, my parents will never accept me being a lesbian, I'll never be skinny enough, I'll never be smart enough, I can't even write a proper goodbye note because Im too tired to even think anymore. I just want to be gone. I want to be gone gone gone. I want to be nothing.
