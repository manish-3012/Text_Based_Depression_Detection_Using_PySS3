Its the holidays, and I have to ruin everything.No matter what I do I can't shake the constant reminder that me being alive serves no purpose. Even the people I live with chose to spent Thanksgiving away from me. My parents never wanted me in the first place, I was an accident. They only kept me because my birth father was anti abortion. I was never meant to be alive, much less live this long. 

My boyfriend is the only reason I'm even still alive, I don't have anyone else who would even notice if I had died. I feel terrible because I know he would be so much happier with a man who wasn't me. Any other guy could actually be there for him instead of some fairy like me who contemplates suicide at the idea of leaving his room every day. Even just somebody he could actually love, not a fat unattractive pig he stays with out of guilt and pity.   
I'm so sick of the way I feel. I hate myself so much and no matter what I do things don't get better. Medication never worked. Drugs never worked. Therapy never worked. Hospitals never worked.   


I should be brave like my mom and hang myself to spare everyone's time they waste putting up with my miserable existence.
