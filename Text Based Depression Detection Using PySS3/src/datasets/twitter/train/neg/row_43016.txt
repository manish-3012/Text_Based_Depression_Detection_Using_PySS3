Everything I say is wrong.No matter the context or my intentions, I always end up hurting someone or sounding like a dick. Whenever I open my stupid mouth I somehow just make everyone hate me.

I always saw myself as a caring and empathetic person, but evidently not since I've been called an asshole on many occasions. I see that I'm a terrible person now, but I can't change so I guess being an annoying douchebag is just a part of my identity.

At this point, I'm convinced that it would be best for everyone if I just never spoke again.
