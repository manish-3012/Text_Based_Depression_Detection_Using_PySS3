Mtf at the end of my limitsI've been transitioning for almost two years now, and I'm still constantly battling my dysphoria. I am lucky enough to have an SO who loves and supports me, but I don't think I can take it anymore. I quit my job after constant harassment, and I'm falling behind in school to the point where I'll almost definitely fail and drop out. I don't want to hurt my SO, but I think it would be better for me and my family for me to go ahead and end it. I'm thinking about jumping off a bridge when I get the grades for this semester. If I fail even one class, and I'm certain I will, I don't think I'll be able to stop myself this time, even for my SO.
