Self harm gives me such a rushI had never really cut myself before, just scratched myself til i bled but that proved to be troublesome and time-consuming...i bought a box cutter and went to town. It was like something else took over my body. I couldnt stop. I went deeper and deeper, wiped them down with alcohol to make it sting a second time. It gives me peace and i feel like i have power. I long to feel that, only more intensely, on the brink of death.

I don't wish to be talked out of these thoughts. This is simply the only place I can discuss these feelings without getting institutionalized or yelled at.
