How Quickly It Can Change - A suicide story.Earlier this week, I was eating an Easter lunch with my fiancee and her family at their house in another province. That was Sunday.

This evening, one of her cousins - who was sitting next to me on the couch that day,  hardly two feet away - is gone. 

A man, almost exactly my age, felt things were too hopeless to go on, leaving behind a toddler son, a heartbroken family, and a lot of unanswered questions.

There's more information and the story [here](https://systematicyetstochastic.wordpress.com/2015/04/11/how-quickly-it-can-change/), but the bottom line is - please, please remember that you don't know what people are going through. You can't know their battles or their fears. None of us saw any outward signs of trouble, none of us were able to help, and now we can't.

But from this, I hope to learn to be kinder, more open and respectful, and more willing to accept everyone as they are - it's the least I can do for him and his memory.

RIP, J.
