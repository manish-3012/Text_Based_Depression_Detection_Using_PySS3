Ran a red light in a busy intersectionI feel like complete crap, i probably deserve to die, idk what to do with myself.

My friend that was with me told me about stuff that had happened to her (rape, child abuse, ect) and I was suprized. I was off guard and ran a light on accident, but didn't hit anyone, no one got hurt. I'll probably have a hefty ticket because there were traffic cameras.
