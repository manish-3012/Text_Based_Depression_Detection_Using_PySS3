i've decided.i've had a terrible day today. i've half-intentionally triggered myself in order to punish mysef and, seeing as i couldn't bring myself to overdose today, i've finally set up a date.

it's august 26th. 

on september 1st, i have an exam which will determine whether i'll advance to the next grade or i'll repeat. i've been very depressed these days so i haven't studied at all, and i already know i won't pass the exam. i'll repeat for the third time. i'll be a disappointment to my parents. even if i tried my best, i would only fail.

i'm 16. i'm a minor. i know someone here will tell me that i still have a lot of time left. but i don't think so. i don't think i'll be able to live up to 18 years old. i don't even think i'll make it to next year.

i no longer enjoy life. the things which i used to enjoy, i don't like them anymore. i've spent this whole summer depressed, thinking about suicide and how everybody around me would be happy if i died. and honestly i don't think this is going to get better. i don't want to live feeling like every single thing which i do is a mistake. i don't want to live feeling like my existence is nothing but a burden.

i'm just tired of living.
