Why do I only want to talk about killing myself when I am drunk or high?I only ever want to talk when I am fucked up. Right now I am drunk, last night I was high, the night before that I was high...but I all the nights I was sober, i didn't want to say shit. Now it's like I want to blabber my mouth off of my fucking face. What is with this basic shit?!
