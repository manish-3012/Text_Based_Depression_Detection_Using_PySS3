i guess i just need advice and to know if this was an attempt. iâ€™m not even sure whatâ€™s real anymorei am so lost right now. i think i attempted last night? i had the sleeping pills, i was trying to go to the bathroom and take them but my friend i guess knew (he said he read my notebook cause he suspected i was writing suicide notes) and wrestled the pills from me. does that count as an attempt??? idfk he didnâ€™t let me get away to take them and when i tried to just push him out of the way he tried (and did) take them from me and took my phone away for the time being so i couldnâ€™t get my blades which were in my case. so idk pls tell me if that counts

but i dunno what to do now. i wasnâ€™t planning to be alive today. i think today will be okay but itâ€™s mostly school and band. i wasnâ€™t mentally prepared to keep going. iâ€™m not ready. iâ€™m not going inpatient cause he promised not to tell anyone and i donâ€™t *want* anyone else to know but i just want to try again. he said the threw them away. i want to buy more and try again but i donâ€™t know when iâ€™ll have time cause that was the perfect opportunity and i have to wait like 2 more weeks for that again and i donâ€™t know if i can
