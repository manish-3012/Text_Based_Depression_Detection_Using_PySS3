PainI'm 17 and never been touched by a girl.

I'm 5'4

I have gynecomastia (man boobs that require $5,000+ to get surgicially removed)

I'm poor so I can't pay for the surgery.

Being short and having man tits has caused me to have very low self esteem/confidence and really bad anxiety.

It's also caused me to have anorexia, body dysmorphia and also orthorexia.

I also have severe O.C.D, having O.C.D caused me to drop out of high school at the age of 14.

Having all this has led me to have suicidal thoughts.

I also have fucked up teeth that require $5,000 braces that I of course can't afford and I have acne all over my face.

Only 1 girl has showed interest in me but all we did was text. That was 2 years ago. I still think about her every day.

I smoked weed for the first time a few days ago thinking maybe it'll make me feel better but know I feel disassociated with myself. i think I developed a depersonalized disorder from my high. My thought process doesn't feel right.

I've had enough of life. I'm ready to die. Committing suicide wouldn't end my life because it never even began.
