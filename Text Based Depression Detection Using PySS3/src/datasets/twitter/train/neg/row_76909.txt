Why is suicide not an option?I never understood why some people would say suicide is not an option. I mean unless you're really religious, and have people YOU personally care about then yea ya probably shouldn't. But if you're like me where nobody cares about what happens to me (which I'm actually alright with) and have no reason to continue going because nothing is appealing to me and I don't see a future where I'm content with. Is it still bad? I'm just kinda curious why some people still use the same gimmicks for everyone like "it gets better" or "you'll hurt someone you love" when it doesn't necessarily apply to everyone. I just wanna know what some of you think about this.
