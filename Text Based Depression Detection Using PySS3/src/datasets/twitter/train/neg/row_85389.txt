I get annoyed every time the suicide hotline shows up when I google anything about suicidal ideation.I completely understand, respect, appreciate, and donâ€™t wish to change the purpose of the suicide hotline showing up on Google for others when googling things about it. 

I just feel this odd sense of annoyance every time I see it. Iâ€™ve even tried the - search query to try to get rid of it, but to no avail. It feels as though itâ€™s being shoved down my throat when all I want down my throat is the barrel of a gun. 

Oftentimes I just want to have my thoughts of suicidal ideation â€œin peaceâ€. Googling into the void is my way of talking to someone. Googling into the void is my way of attempting to express plans without a live person being able to judge me for it, yet this robotic search engine wants to help me through a channeled sense of unknown-to-me peoplesâ€™ empathetic addition of the hotline to the query. It should feel nice, but Iâ€™d be lying if I said I felt anything positive from that at all. 

I do appreciate the hotline, but no maâ€™am, I canâ€™t lieâ€” it does annoy me every time I see it, because I donâ€™t want attempts to stop me. If I wanted hurdles I would have stayed in track and field. 

Please note: I am not in immediate danger. I have flatlined on these feelings. I â€œfeelâ€ this way but will not act.
