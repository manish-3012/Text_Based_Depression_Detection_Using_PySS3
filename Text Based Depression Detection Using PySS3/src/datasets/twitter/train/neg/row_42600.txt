so tonight's the nightI know, I know, I already made a post here a couple of days ago, but today, I really think I'm done. I have my note recorded, ready to post, I have my pills hidden safely and securely, to be followed by a nice bit of melatonin so I can sleep through the chest pains, and today, I'm gonna spend one last day with my friends. Sorry. I give up.
