None of anything in your experience is real. It's just a simulation. THEYRE ALL BOTS EXCEPT YOUI dont have any valuable "friends". The one love i had decided to share her love with my best friend instead. time keeps moving faster and faster and i have nothing to show for it. I want the pain to stop. i want the dark spiritual things proving to me its just a simulation to stop. WTF IS THIS? WHY DO WE EXIST? WHY DID MY PARENTS BRAINWASH ME TO BE SUCH A NICE GUY? I dont get to enjoy love like the rest of my peers. i have nothing.
