I can't escape this shit. I am stuck with racist homophobes and there is no hope.I fucking hate being transgender. I mean I guess I dont, but I hate the way my family treats me now because of it. I hate my family's racism. I hate their bigotry. I have tried to move out and live on my own, but I cant afford it. I kept getting evicted and ended up homeless. I have to rely on them. I financially have no other choice. I have no friends. Only a racist homophobic family. I hate living in Indiana. It is conservative hell.
