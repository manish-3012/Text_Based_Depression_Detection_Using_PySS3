Always forgotten and pushed asideI am always forgotten and pushed aside.
I try hard to make friends but they always do things without me. You can tell me to â€œmessage them and contact them moreâ€ all you want but the more effort I put in the more they push me aside.

Even my own family does this. On both my mum and dads side of the family. 

Just when I think Iâ€™ve made an awesome group of Friends I am suddenly left out of the group. This has happened since I was young.

I know I donâ€™t have the best personality and can be hard to get to know at first but for those that are close to me know what Iâ€™m like. They still forget me, they still choose not to invite me.

Iâ€™ve given up on making friends and given up on keeping old ones. 

Iâ€™ve lost several friendship grouped from primary school, to high school and was even ditched by my uni friends. The worst part about the uni friends is that some of them wouldnâ€™t have known each other if it werenâ€™t for me introducing them. Then I was attacked via message from one of them. 

Do we really need friends in this world?

Iâ€™m not trying to sound desperate and Iâ€™m not seeking attention. Genuinely want opinions
