Iâ€™m going to die soonEveryone has given up on me, I have no hope left, no one cares about me. I thought some people really cared but leave me right when I need them. Iâ€™m so rude and selfish and no one likes that but I donâ€™t know how to change. Iâ€™ve gone to therapy and Iâ€™m on medication but I feel worse and worse every day. The medication makes me worse and I think itâ€™s a sign that I shouldnâ€™t be alive. I hope I get into a car accident so no one thinks itâ€™s a suicide
