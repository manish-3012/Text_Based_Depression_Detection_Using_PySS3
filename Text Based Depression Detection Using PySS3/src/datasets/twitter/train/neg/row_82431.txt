Received an automatic message asking if I knew my friend (who took her life 3 months ago).I don't know if I can explain what I'm feeling. A few hours I got an alert from Facebook. One of those automatic "do you know..." messages. But this one has fucked with my mind tonight. 

My friend took her life in July. I haven't fully processed my grief, hell I've been trying to ignore my pain for these last few months. I have really only been able to change from saying "is" to "was" when talking about her. 

Tonight that alert came on my screen. My heart dropped. Somehow in the cruelty of the universe Facebook asked me if I knew my friend. Her profile is still active, well, it was one of the two she had. One was personal, one was professional. I never felt the need to friend both accounts. 

While I know this wasn't some horrible joke and just the result of Facebook's automatic feature/coding, this still hurts. God it kills. 

All the pain I've been trying to ignore for months has stabbed me in the chest. It's so intense that I physically hurt. I don't know how I should even handle this. I don't know what I'm even asking for. I don't know why I'm posting. I just...I'm hurting like I did when I found out...what happened. 

I think the pain of a suicide echoes throughout life. Right now that echo is coming back to me...and I don't know...I just...I don't know.
