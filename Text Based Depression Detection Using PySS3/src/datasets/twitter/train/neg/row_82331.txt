starting to make plans to end itfinding things so tough at the moment, and they are all my fault.

after suffering from anxiety, i went back to university and got a first in law. i did some legal roles to build up experience for a year, and then quit because of the stress. i had two interviews in another field lined up, and didnt get either. 

9 months later and i'm still unemployed. i could have got a legal job straight after but i desperately didnt want to be pidgeonholed which would prevent me getting a job i actually want. 

friends from my previous jobs with lesser or similar CVs have gone on to jobs on Â£20-25k, or further study. i've been wasting my time doing fuck all, and now have another gap on my CV.

i cannot find a job. i feel worthless. i'm ashamed of the example i am setting to my brother. a year ago i was in a good place after working so hard to get my life back on track. 

i've had only 3 interviews in the last 3 months. i have made awful decisions and there is now nothing i can do to put it right. there is a 5 week wait for a doctors appointment and i am now starting to plan what i'll do if i don't get a job soon.

i've cut off all contact with my friends, former colleagues, and family. i can't even look people in the eye. i am now clearly at the stage where people won't give me a job because i haven't got one. this is not a case of someone who has been trying for 9 months to get a job. i could have got one easily within the first 3 months or so. this is my fault, and i ignored advice from my parents, who have basically given up on me.
