I'll make this new year count.Ever since I can remember, it feels that I'm climbing an endless hill.

I guess it's funny, I can describe my life as a series of moments, at times happy and at times sad, mostly feeling bad though, I guess I'm just an unhappy dude in general.

But I'm just done with not taking action, I'm done wondering, trying to save myself from the unavoidable. I'd like for this to be my last year alive, honestly, I hope I'll have the guts to end myself, hopefully today, but I'm probably not mustering that courage today.

I can only hope that I'll gather enough to strength to fulfill my destiny, make this new year count, go where I never dared to before.

I wish you all a very happy 2019.
