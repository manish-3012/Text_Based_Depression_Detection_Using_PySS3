Got benefit sanctioned now Im suicidal.Today I got a letter from the DWP stating that I'm being sanctioned by Â£10.40 a day for 68 days for being sacked from my last job, I only get Â£317 a month from Universal Credit (dont get the housing they've fucked it up and im waiting for it) so they've left me penniless and de facto homeless. I went down to the job centre in a fit of rage and cried and told them whats happened even told them I feel suicidal they told me they cant help, so went to citizens advice and they said to come back tomorrow. 

It wouldn't matter if I got the full UC (housing and JSA) because it'll still leave me unable to pay the rent, food or anything. So I then spent a few hours walking around town thinking about throwing myself from the bridge. 

I cant even convey my feelings, a mix between blind rage and feeling suicidal.
