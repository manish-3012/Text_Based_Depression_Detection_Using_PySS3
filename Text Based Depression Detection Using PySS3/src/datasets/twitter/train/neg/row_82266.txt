Treatment resistant depression &amp; Aspergerâ€™s syndromeA summary of my life:

- I was born with high-functioning autism/Aspergerâ€™s syndrome and ADHD, but I wasnâ€™t diagnosed until I was 15 (yes, fifteen)

- I had an awful childhood. 

- my dad hated me for being born a girl. He abused me emotionally and physically. My mom disliked his behavior but refused to divorce him.


- I had no friends my whole childhood. kids in my school hated me. I got kicked out of an elementary school for being weird/making noises/noncompliance. 


- I was mercilessly (physically &amp; emotionally) bullied in a different school. My parents &amp; teachers kept saying they would help me but no one took action, despite me begging for help. This went on for a year until the bully was finally punished. (4th grade)

- I developed OCD due to the stress and obsessed over germs for a year. (5th grade.) Eventually that got better. 

- I was hated by the kids in the 2nd school for the rest of my years there. But at least I wasnâ€™t getting beaten up every day. 

- I was a bright kid in school but I had ADHD so it was difficult to concentrate and sit still. My parents took me to a so called â€œneurologistâ€ in 3rd grade who said there was nothing wrong with me since I wasnâ€™t obviously retarded. 

- then I got scoliosis, I spent a year doing boring, painful physical therapy (2 hours every day) and wearing a hard plastic back brace (21 hours every day.) The treatment failed and I had to get spinal fusion surgery at age 13. 

- I got into a really good high school where no one knew me. I was hoping this was my chance at a â€œclean slate.â€ I was hoping to make new friends. For the first time possibly ever, I felt truly optimistic about the future. The happiness lasted about 3 months. 

- At the first parent-teacher conference, I showed off my Aâ€™s on my report card. All my teachers had something nice to say about me. My parents listened skeptically and then told me â€œthis is not going to last, itâ€™s only a matter of time before you start failing again.â€ I felt so depressed. Nothing I could do was ever good enough. 

- in 9th grade I tried my hardest to be perfect, so that I would finally be good enough for my parents. I had nearly straight Aâ€™s (couple Bâ€™s), perfect behavior, dressed to her liking, participated in after-school activities and did not cause any trouble. Guess what? It wasnâ€™t good enough! 
My mom constantly criticized me on the cosmetic outcome of my scoliosis surgery (one of my shoulders is a *centimeter* above the other.) She would physically pull up my shirt as I was walking or standing somewhere, look at my spine and criticize me. I felt like my efforts were all for nothing since no one loved me and I was never good enough, so my schoolwork started to slip. 

- In January (2015) of 9th grade I started to feel depressed. In the spring, I began struggling to focus even more (vs just with ADHD.) By June I was demanding for my parents to take me to a physiatrist. My parents refused and told me that I would never be accepted into college if I have mental health treatment â€œon my record.â€ (Mental health records are 100% private and my parents are idiots.) By the summertime (July &amp; August), I felt suicidal. (This is all in the year 2015.)

- In 10th grade, in December 2015, I finally saw a psychiatrist. I was diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and ADHD, and possible â€œrule outâ€ Aspergerâ€™s syndrome.

Over the years Iâ€™ve been diagnosed with: ADHD, Aspergerâ€™s syndrome, OCD (currently mostly dormant), depression, anxiety, panic disorder (currently mostly dormant), PTSD, anorexia, and mixed cluster B personality disorder (borderline personality disorder with histrionic &amp; narcissistic tendencies.) 

- I was treated by multiple psychiatrists over the years with: Prozac, Ritalin, Zoloft, Cymbalta,Adderall, Ketamine infusions, Nortriptyline, Klonopin, Ativan, Risperidone, Lithium, Gabapentin, Effexor, Hydroxyzine, Zyprexa, and Abilify. (In order of what came first, in various combinations.)


I also had therapy: 
CBT, DBT, Individual treatment: psychoanalysis, Family therapy, Social skills group, Partial Hospitalization Program (psychiatric general), Inpatient treatment (psychiatric general), Residential treatment (psychiatric general), Adventure therapy, â€œholistic treatmentsâ€, support group for Aspergerâ€™s syndrome, eating disorder day treatment/PHP, eating disorder residential treatment.  

Now Iâ€™m 18, turning 19 soon, using hard drugs every day and suicidal. Iâ€™m tempted to just kill myself to end the suffering. I feel lost and hopeless about the future.
