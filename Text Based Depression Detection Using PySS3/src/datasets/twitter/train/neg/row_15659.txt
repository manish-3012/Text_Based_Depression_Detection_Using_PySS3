It gets harder each day without the woman I love in my life (nobody died, we just broke up)Talking to her isn't the same, hell I hardly talk to her because I'm afraid of making her feel like she's pressured to get back with me. I lied to her about multiple things and I feel like scum for hurting the trust of this perfect, outgoing woman, she seems so much happier than I am at the moment and I'm glad for that but I just don't know how I can go on. We shared so many wonderful memories these past two years and i wanted to make more with her. Everything I try to do to help myself feel better is hard, music i try to listen to that i loved before make me think of the times we listened to the same songs together, our favorite show reminds me of the times we'd sneak kisses here and there when her helicopter parents weren't looking. The greatest moments of my life were spent with this supportive woman cheering me on and helping to build up a path in life that I don't know if i can reach anymore. I don't want to hurt her or any family and friends by doing anything but this shit is hard man. I couldn't bear to even delete any pictures of us or anything of the sort and I just wish things this year had changed. I keep thinking that if covid was handled better I could have changed then and be more proactive with my life that I could've made her proud. I love you august with all of my god damn heart
