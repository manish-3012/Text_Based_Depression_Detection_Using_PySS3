Proving abetment of suicideSo I wish to die but not in vain! I also want to put certain people in behind bars for the situation I am in currently!

The problem is I donâ€™t feel there is any concrete proof of their abuse. So will a suicide with a detailed letter of what all occurred be good enough to put that person behind bars. 

Please let me know if there has been successful stories as such!
