I can't stop wanting thisI don't like the person I am.  And I dont think I can change.

I don't think I can feel pure happiness anymore.  I can laugh at a funny joke, I can smile at some things in my day.  But it all feels empty.  The things that used to make me happy and the things that I so desperately wanted and looked forward to don't even so much as raise my heart rate.  I can't stop thinking about suicide and self harm.  I just keep WANTING it, like a deep and primal urge.

I know I am loved.  I know I have a good life.  I love my family more than anything.  I know that it would be the most evil thing for me to kill myself.  I have a family that loves me, a niece and nephew that mean so much, a great dog that keeps me going every morning.  To kill myself would destroy my family.  But I still can't stop wanting to end it.
