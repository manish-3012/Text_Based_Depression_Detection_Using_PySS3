I need to make it to Thursday... oh please help me make it...I don't have any strength left. 

Last week i made an appointment with a therapist. It was the earliest i could arrange.

You know what bothers me about it, I took Psychology in school. I know what they say, I know what they do. I just want that magical session that gives me hope. I want the Doc to say somethign I haven't already thought of to give me hope to keep going. 

But I'm sitting here, And the only thing I can think of is, I'm done. I don't want to go on. I don't want life anymore. I want to lay down and just pass peacefully in my sleep. All I can do these days is lay awake thinking is it time? how can I go? I wish it would come naturally right now. keel over from a heart attack or an aneurism or some disease that we haven't seen coming.

But so far, I wake up every morning. That alone should give me some comfort. BUt it doesn't. 
I should feel bad, cause I'd be leaving behind siblings, parents and nieces who I do know love me. But I don't. I just can't help but think how irrelevant I really am. Sure they'd be upset. But they'd live their lives, eventually hit their ends, and the wheels of time will turn, and they too will turn to dust, and my life would be as meaningless then as it is now.

I just need hope, something to keep me going till at least Thursday. Cause Right now, Thursday is the only hope I have, and it's the slimmest hope at best.

My heart, my head, my very fabric of being hurts.
