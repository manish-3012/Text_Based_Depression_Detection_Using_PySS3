Iâ€™m gonna kill myself soonI have no friends, Iâ€™m failing pretty much every subject in school and I spend all day everyday just sitting around alone doing nothing because I donâ€™t enjoy doing anything, I got diagnosed with depression and social anxiety a while ago and Iâ€™m taking medication for it but it doesnâ€™t help. I also have thoughts going through my head all the time that make me feel sick too my stomach. Iâ€™m just waiting for the next time my whole family goes out so that I can hang myself while Iâ€™m home alone. Iâ€™ve been miserable for a long time and my life is going nowhere, I feel guilty about doing this to my family but I think it will be better this way.
