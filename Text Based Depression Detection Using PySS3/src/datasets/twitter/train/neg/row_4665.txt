I feel like I donâ€™t deserve to post here.I feel guilty that Iâ€™m constantly having suicidal thoughts. I just feel like I donâ€™t have a reason to be feeling the things that I do. I found this page not long ago but as Iâ€™m reading through all these posts and after being around other suicidal people I feel ashamed. From an outside perspective I donâ€™t have anything particularly wrong with my life. I have friends, family, a significant other, my grades are decent. Despite all this I keep thinking about killing myself constantly.

I keep telling myself that Iâ€™m too much of a pussy to go through with it but lately Iâ€™ve had an extremely strong urge to take the shotgun in my house, go out into the woods, and end my blight on the world.

I feel like I donâ€™t deserve to get help or go to a psychiatrist because I donâ€™t want to waste resources or that my feelings are invalid since I havenâ€™t actually attempted anything or that since all of itâ€™s in my head that it must be my fault and that Iâ€™m just an attention whore for thinking about myself all the time. 

All of my problems stem from the things I think about myself which makes me feel the most guilty. I know everything stems from my head and I feel like Iâ€™m just making all of it up for attention and because of that I deserve to kill myself for wasting everybodyâ€™s time and resources. Itâ€™s all irrational and contradicting since Iâ€™ve only told two people about this stuff.

I know Iâ€™m probably going to piss people off by posting here when I donâ€™t deserve to but I donâ€™t know where else to go. I donâ€™t want to waste anybodyâ€™s time by telling them this stuff since they have it worse and I feel ashamed for being such a pussy about useless thoughts in my head. I donâ€™t know if what Iâ€™m experiencing is real or if Iâ€™m just being self deprecating and I need to stop grasping for attention. If itâ€™s the latter, Iâ€™m sorry for wasting your time.
