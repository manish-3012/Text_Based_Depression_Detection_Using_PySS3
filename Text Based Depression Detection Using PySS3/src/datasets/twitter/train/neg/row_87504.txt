Feel like suicide is my best optionI am 27 years old and suffered with social anxiety and depression since i was 14.  Up until the age of about 24 my depression has always been bad.  For the last 3 years all i can think about is that i will commit suicide eventually and emotionally i feel so messed up.  I have never had a girlfriend and it hurts badly especially when everyone else has no issues with relationships.  I have a job and never backed out of social situations because of my anxiety but it has never got better and therapy will not help me.  I am trying my best but i feel like its over for me im just living to not upset my parents.  I think i can hold on until i get to my mid thirties but if i dont get to experience a relationship by then i just see myself getting in a rage and putting myself out of misery.  I posted this  hoping for some kind replies as i feel rock bottom right now.
