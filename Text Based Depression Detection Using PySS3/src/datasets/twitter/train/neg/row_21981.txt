I have no reason to live, so why should I keep trying?I'm a failure as a man! I lost my job due to my depression, and I can't get another one. No way I can even imagine myself working again.

I have no family, and I couldn't attract a girlfriend when I was still working and feeling fine. Now when I'm out of a job, broke and depressed, there's zero chance for me to find someone.

I can't work, because I'm depressed. I'm depressed because I'm lonely. I'm lonely because I can't provide for a family.

Wherever I turn, I'm being told to man up. As a white, privileged male I have both skills and ample opportunity, so I should just go out there and grab life by the horns. But I don't feel privileged. I feel accursed. I feel like a worthless piece of crap who cries himself to sleep every night, and spends his days worrying about making it to the next day.

There's no hope for me. The only future I see involves the noose I tied earlier today. Give me just one good reason why I shouldn't end this nightmarish existence.
