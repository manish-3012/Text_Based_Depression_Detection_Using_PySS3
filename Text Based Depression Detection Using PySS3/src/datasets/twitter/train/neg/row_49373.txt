[17M] (Life story, basically) I hate my parents for what they did to meMy parents know they have bad genes (they explicitly told me themselves) yet they were selfish enough to fulfill their desire of having (read; abusing) a child without ever thinking of the consequences.

My body is deformed, my face disgusting (to the point were people canâ€™t look at me without feeling disturbed, as Iâ€™ve been told), and my non-functional tiny penis is just the icing on the cake.

I couldnâ€™t make friends when I was a kid because the other children were scared of the way I looked. That coupled with my parents isolating me for â€œmy own goodâ€ kept me from developing any social skills.

Iâ€™m so lonely and I just want to die. Please.
