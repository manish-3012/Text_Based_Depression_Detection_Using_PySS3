I always feel sad...I don't know what to do....... I want to kill myself but I cant.... Im only 14... but I never get any attention from my parents... and at school I have a lot of friends and stuff... but I struggle with depression..... Suicide all I ever think of I just want to give in I cut every now and then.... what the hell do I do?
