My parents found out I cut My mom found out I cut last night. I was giving her a hug I think or something like that then she grabbed my arm and was like "what are these." "Are you cutting." I lied and said the dog had been rough with me but she didn't believe it. She was really angry and upset and said I'm going to have to be hospitalized and not finish college like my aunt who deal with mental illness. She was heavily threatening to get me institutionalized. My mom has so much going on in her life right now cause my dad is sick and she's taking care of him and I. I feel so bad, I was trying not to add to that by hiding how bad I'm doing. But now she knows and I'm another thing she has to get help for. I feel so awful and I don't even know what to do. I feel awful for the human being I am, I shouldn't have been born.
