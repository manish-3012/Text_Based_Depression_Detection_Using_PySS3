Made a bit of a mess in my lifeI keep typing paragraphs and paragraphs and deleting them so let's just say that i want to kill myself, since I'm posting here.

My ex wants to move on. he doesn't want to try again, after 4 years he feels no obligation to try again. I can't even blame him, if I was him I would never speak to me again. My mental illness hurts everyone around me and I'm just so fucking tired. I'm going to end up self-destructing and I'm just sorry anyone had to be a party to it. I wake up every morning and just knowing that I'm living in a world where we aren't together makes it not feel worth it anymore. I've tried everything. Positive thinking, therapy, i'm on meds now, smoking weed, i'm even fucking seeing someone else now and nothing helps. Everything reminds me of him, everything comes back to him. I still go to work in the mornings, I'm not shirking my responsibilities to mope, I'M DOING EVERYTHING I SHOULD BE. Nothing helps. It's been 2 months and it feels like someones torn out the middle of my body, something is missing. I hate myself without him. Even after everything that happened and how badly he hurt me I would still give fucking *anything* to have him come back and deem me worthy to take a risk for. As it is I'm not worth it.
