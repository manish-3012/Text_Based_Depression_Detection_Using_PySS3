I don't think im gonna make it to 2019Im 22, i have family, i have a few online friends, i have a few real life friends, but like, i just dont feel to keep going, i dont have the motivation to go back to my job, and i dont want to be a drain on my family if i dont have one. ive had a very poor christmas, and it brings with it bad memories. (i had a bad breakup last christmas) i feel like if im alone for new years i might do it, and i forsee myself being alone (all my friends seem to either not want to do anything, or have made plans i cant be part of) and my parents are probably going to their friends, ill probably just be home with my older brother. who i know cares deeply about me, but other people caring about me is not enough anymore.
