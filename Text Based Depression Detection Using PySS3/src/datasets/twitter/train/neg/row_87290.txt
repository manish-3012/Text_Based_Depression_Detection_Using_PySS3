I'm uselessI'm not even going to use an alt because fuck it.

I've been suicidal on and off for years now. Recently being diagnosed with Autism, I can barely see my life going anywhere.  I'll never recover from it, I'm "broken" for good. I can't even feel compassion when people need it. The only thing worth staying alive is my family. My mother is dying, and I'm not even good enough to be a good son to her. I'm just a piece of shit. 

A while ago, someone at my college told me to kill myself. Multiple times. I hate him for it but I'm beginning to think he may have had a point. Even after I told teachers he had been saying these things, nobody gave a shit, and some even sympathised with \*him\*. Not that I wanted sympathy, I just wanted him to stop saying that, not only for my sake but others' too. 

Idk, I'm not making sense I know, I just needed to vent. I'm probably gonna delete this in a bit. Thanks
