Been nearly two weeks since my attempt. Feeling awfulI can't do it again after what the first attempt did to my parents but I really wish it had succeeded. All the feelings are back and worse and now I have no way of getting out, and am completely isolated and hopeless. I wish I had taken more pills and was able to take the jump.
