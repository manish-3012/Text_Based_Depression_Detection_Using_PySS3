I had written a few days ago that i wanted to commit suicide on the 13th, but i've ultimately decided not to go through with it.It would just inflict too much pain on my family and friends. And they've largely been nice. I ll probably be living in shame and dishonor as a result, but i deserve that. 
A massive thanks to all those who replied to my previous thread. I love you all. :) :)
