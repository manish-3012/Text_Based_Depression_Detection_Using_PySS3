Social distancingWith all the covid-19 events and decisions, I am stuck at home. While some are happy that school is "cancelled", I am devastated. Going to school was my motivation in life to keep going and actually doing something productive. It's only been a couple days since they declared school being cancelled indefinitely but I've been sleeping over 20 hours each day. I know it may seem unrealistic but it has been my coping method. Every weekend when school was still open I would sleep and not do my homework. But being at school allowed me to actually do something with my life. I feel like I'm going into a bad slump again and being stuck in my room isn't helping. I want to meet up with my friends but my parents won't let me. I just cry whenever I am awake and just think of the most terrible thoughts. I keep wanting to visit a bridge but I know that will only end badly. What do I do?
