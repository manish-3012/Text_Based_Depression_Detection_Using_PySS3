Almost hung myself, stopped and now the urge is coming backMods, delete this post if it doesn't fit.

I was outside in my backyard looking for a nice high enough branch to almost went through with it, but then called a helpline and opened up about why I wanted to die. That's when I broke down and cried. After realising how much of a snotty, teary mess I'd become, I went back inside to clean up. It was the first step I needed. 

I don't want to die. I just want all the chatter about how unworthy and unlovable I am to stop. I also feel alone and isolated because of that. My partner, having dealt with the ups and downs of my depression so many times, requested for us to sleep in separate rooms.  

I feel alone again. There's that voice that's telling me she doesn't love me. Why else would she want to get the fuck away from me, especially at my most vulnerable? How can anyone love me? I'm a goddamn fucking piece of shit of a mess.
