Lost my career thinking about killing myselfI've lost my job overseas, which I loved, but because of the short time there and gap it will leave in my resume and the fact that my supervisor will not offer much of a recommendation (he wrote a letter but would do no more than that).  I feel hurt and betrayed, as I did good work for them and they just threw me out on my ass.  I'm home now, wallowing around, no car no prospects, and a girlfriend overseas and now I'm think death would be better.  I've been here before, but I'm thinking I will not find another job in my field and the thought of me stepping back and getting a job doing something else depresses me.  I know this is a first-world problem, and that others have it worse, but I cant think of anything that will not make me miserable.
