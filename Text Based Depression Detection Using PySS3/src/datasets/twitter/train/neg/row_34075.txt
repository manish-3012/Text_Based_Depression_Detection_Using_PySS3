Quick answer needed :(An hour ago I swallowed 60 pills of potassium chloride (610 mg per one pill) but now I am pretty anxious and changed my mind, can I do something without going to hospital? Also I practically didn't eat today so I haven't absorbed potassium from food. I try to vomit but I can't.
Basic info about me: 18 yo, 177 cm, 53 kg.
