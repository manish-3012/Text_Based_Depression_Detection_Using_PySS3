I just think everything is pointless. We are just some atoms on a rockI try my best to be happy because i have a family and a partner i care about. I can't help but feel as if we should all just die. The environment is being polluted, people are suffering and there is no real point of us being here. I'm struggling to find the meaning of life and the "to just live a happy life" isn't enough. We are here just working then go buy ourselves stuff to feel better, everyday seems like the same hell. Although i have these thoughts i'm not giving up yet, i want to see the world like other do.
