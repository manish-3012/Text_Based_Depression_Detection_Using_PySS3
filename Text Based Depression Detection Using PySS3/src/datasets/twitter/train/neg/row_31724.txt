Anyone else feel incredibly disconnected?A lot of the time I barely fee human. I look at people and the way they interact and itâ€™s just so foreign to me. I donâ€™t know, I just feel completely disconnected from everything, even myself, to the point where I donâ€™t think I was even meant to be alive. Itâ€™s surreal really and Iâ€™m not sure how I got to this point and I donâ€™t think I can ever get back to any sense of normalcy
