I don't feel like I have the strength to be who I want to be.I'm 19 and in the past year, my Mum was diagnosed with terminal cancer, my grandma died of a brain bleed/stroke, I was practically kicked out of a course (because of the stuff going on at home), lost contact with the last of my friends, and have put on so much weight that I wont leave the house unless I feel like i look skinny.

I'm borderline suicidal. I think about killing myself and how I'd do it almost every day, whenever I'm daydreaming (Which is a lot), I catch myself imagining what It's like and I'm scared. I've genuinely never felt loved or appreciated because I was always that annoying kid at school who no one actually liked, so I was always the third person on the sidewalk and I never kept any friends when I left school. And its same with my parents and family, anything I did, they'd point out the flaws instead of the good things.

I'm sitting here, thinking about who I want to be, what I want to look like, but I feel like I don't have enough strength to keep living the way I am, never mind a life that'd require even more effort.  And I'm scared that If I don't achieve my goals before my Mum passes away, I won't have anything to live for and decide to just end it.

If anyone was wondering, my goal is to loose weight and feel confident in myself, as I never have before. I want to feel like I can have someone look at me and fancy me, rather than be disgusted by the neckbeard who just walked in. I want someone to love me and I don't want to question it's legitness everytime I look at said person. I also want to live a healthy life but I litterally cant stop myself from shoveling trash into my belly because it makes me feel better.
