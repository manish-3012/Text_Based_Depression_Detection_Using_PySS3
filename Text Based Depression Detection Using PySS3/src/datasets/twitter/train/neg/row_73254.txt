I can't live anymoreI don't want to. I don't want to live and I know I'd be missed if I were gone but I have such an insatiable dread in the pit of my stomach all the time. I leave school or work and it immediately comes back, like the times I laughed until I was crying with my friends at school during the day was just a distraction. At home, I write and rewrite suicide notes and I test to see if a bedsheet tied around my neck would hold my weight. I cant sleep at night because of the DREAD, I'm always either sad, feeling a fear or dread or feeling nothing at all. I want to just remove myself from the world, I want to be calm, I want to be at peace and to be free. I feel like I'm going fucking crazy, my doctor's appointment is over a week away but I cant wait that long anymore. I just want to fucking die and I need someone to help me so desperately
