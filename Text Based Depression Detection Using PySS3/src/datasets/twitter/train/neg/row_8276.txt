Iâ€™m in so much physical pain. Death would be a blessingIâ€™m screwed - Iâ€™m in terrible chronic pain, my doctors say thereâ€™s no cure and donâ€™t care to help. Iâ€™m f*cked.

I suffer from small fiber neuropathy, mainly brought on by gadolinium poisoning from a contrast injection; doctors told me it was totally safe, yet two months later my tissues were severely thickened, my feet and hands were just about useless, and my life was changed forever.

Thereâ€™s no cure for SFN. The fda refuses to believe gadolinium is toxic in your system so they donâ€™t know how to get it out. Iâ€™m suffering fibrosis from something doctors said was totally safe, and when I call them out on it they say â€œmeh, something else made you illâ€ or â€œI dont know what to tell youâ€.

Iâ€™m in pain everyday. I google the highest bridge in the area and the gun laws. Sadly there arenâ€™t any high bridges and my state is very strict on gun laws; plus Iâ€™d have to take out to a range to try it even if I bought a gun - IIâ€™ve never held one in my hand, much less shot one!

The only thing that gets me thru a day is aderall, which Iâ€™m now told is going to eventually screw with my brain and memory.

Iâ€™d happily trade places with Luke Perry today so he couple be with his family. My world is full of lies and pain
