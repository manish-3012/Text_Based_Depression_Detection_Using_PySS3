â€œSomeone has it worse then you just be grateful â€œI honestly hate it when people say this it strongly bothers me. Like I understand where people are coming from when they say this. But when you say that youâ€™re just shutting off the person feelings. Meaning that their sadness or depression doesnâ€™t mean anything. Yes we are grateful for what we have but how do we fix our problems.
