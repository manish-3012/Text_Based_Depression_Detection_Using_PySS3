I just don't know what to do anymore.My mother has been an alcoholic for as along as I can remember, and I've been her caregiver in a lot of ways. I clean up after her I try to get her to stop she'll stop drinking for a week here or a month there and always goes back to drinking so heavily she ends up hurting herself by falling or in the worst case scenario downing pills to make an attempt on her life. I'm the one who finds her and makes sure she gets to the hospital, gets to doctor's appointments for the broken bone or torn muscles. It's been like this for the last 20 years. Yet every time she starts back up I feel like I failed yet again, my sole use in life has been to help her, to try and make her better. Every time she sneaks vodka or has a friend bring it to her I end up staring a hole through the shotgun and keys. I want nothing more than just hop in the car go to a field or some shit and end it. Wouldn't want to make a mess in the house. I know having my self worth so tied to her is foolish, but I can't help it. I just want to make things better but it always ends up turning to ash in my hands.
