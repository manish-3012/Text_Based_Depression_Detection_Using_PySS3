Depressed, feel like I'm stalling.I donâ€™t know where to start this, Iâ€™ve been depressed for several years, Iâ€™ve tried talking to a therapist, Iâ€™ve taken tablets, but yet nothing helps. I decided I had enough with the appointments and taking antidepressants and stopped going and taking. I just think every day Iâ€™m stalling my suicide I just want to get it over and done with. Iâ€™ve attempted several times but Iâ€™ve failed so far. Iâ€™ve gotten too ashamed to talk to anyone now, I canâ€™t even talk to my friends and have distanced myself from them and rarely keep in touch. I havenâ€™t completely given up, I try but sometimes I get the urge to just go and do it and I end up trying, itâ€™s getting harder not to do it these days. Not Sure why Iâ€™m writing this here, maybe I just want someone to talk to sometimes or something.
