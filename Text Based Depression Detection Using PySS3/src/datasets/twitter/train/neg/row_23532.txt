I'm scared and empty and I don't know what to doI've been so depressed for months. So, so depressed. Along with panic attacks and OCD, I'm just wasting away. I was on Fluoxetine but I stopped after telling my doctor I was only getting worse after like 6 weeks. I can't get out of bed, I just want to sleep all day. I have things I have to do but when I start to do them I just cry and don't have the damned energy to sit up and I'm afraid of my own mind, it's just getting worse and worse. Every time I step into a street I imagine a car ramming into me. God it would be so easy. I imagine the taste of a gun in my mouth daily. I have a constant mantra of "I should die, I hate you, I hate you, you should be dead." I hate therapy. I hate going to the psychiatrist. I hate trying meds. I hate not being able to eat or shower.

I don't want to hurt myself but it's getting so bad so fast and it's quickly approaching the point where I don't know what else I can do, I can't keep feeling like this, I can't take it, I need help, I'm so scared.

Also, I've been staring at this razor I've had and it was too dull to do anything but now I've got two little marks and the only things stopping me from digging deeper is knowing people will see and I'm scared at what I'll do in a frenzy and I'm scared of where I'm headed. I don't know what to do. I've resisted SI in the past despite wanting to (a combination of feeling numb and feeling like I hate myself and deserve it) but it's so hard.
