I just don't want to be aliveI can't think of many negative reasons that make me want to die, it's more just like I WANT TO DIE. TO NOT BE ALIVE. That's all. I can't think of reasons for why I feel like this, and that pains me even more.

Also, I felt sick when I first had this thought, but I'm sure a lot of you feel the same-- when a close friend said to me "stay alive, even if it's only for me" -- I immediately just thought NO. I won't do that.

I love her so much, and I love having her in my life, but that just doesn't mean that much to me. If you tell me that, it probably won't make me feel any better, and I hate that. Because I am so lucky to have friends I can talk about it too, but IT DOESNT MEAN ANYTHING TO ME!

LOL I want to die, probably won't anytime soon, but I want it so bad!
