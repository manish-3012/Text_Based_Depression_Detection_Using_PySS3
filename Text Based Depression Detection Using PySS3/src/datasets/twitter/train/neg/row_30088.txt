The worst feeling in the world is knowing how little you matterI think about this often. Iâ€™m actually a pretty social person who could talk to anyone, yet something about me just repels people. I donâ€™t really try to make friends anymore because I know theyâ€™ll just leave anyway. I get that life happens but people donâ€™t care like they say they do. I know for a fact if I werenâ€™t here anymore, people would be â€œheartbrokenâ€ and â€œshockedâ€, yet where are they? If they knew me, theyâ€™d see how bad I hurt. Why was I always the one to check in? To offer help?
