im tiredhabits are crawling back in. i have to force myself to get up at 12, just to lay on the ground and do nothing. go back to sleep repeat. i cant eat. im fucking 87 and i cant eat. i just feel so sick. i dont even know how behind i am in school anymore. im not even going to graduate high school because of my fucking idiocy and procrastination and i cant even fix it. i try for one day amd sleep in the next. my parents hate me, im nothing but a burden. my dad said id never be his son. he hates me. i ruin his life. no permit, no job, no friends, no education, still an ugly as fuck stick with nothing good abo ut him.  i dont ever want to go outside again. i dont want anyone to see my horrid face or hear my hprrid voice. walking used to be nice. i used to like taking walks. but now when i walk i always wander too close to the road . close my eyes and dip in and out and just pray itâ€™ll happen already. i wish i wasnt such a fucking coward
