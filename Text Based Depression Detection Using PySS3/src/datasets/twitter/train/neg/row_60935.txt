Being lonely killing meI donâ€™t lack of people around me. What Iâ€™m missing is someone who would be same priority and she is for me. I meet a lot of girls but always end up she have someone more important with who they enjoy spending time more then with me. It always end in the same way. Iâ€™m bored to open anymore to anyone when she will have someone else already. I was going to watch movie with one girl last night. I waited 2 hours because she prefer to talk with her ex who doing bulllshit to her every time. And I went to seep because I couldnâ€™t film comfortably anymore knowing I donâ€™t mean nothing again to someone. Donâ€™t know for what iâ€˜m even trying. I wanna end this endless lonely life and being number 2 when someone need something.
