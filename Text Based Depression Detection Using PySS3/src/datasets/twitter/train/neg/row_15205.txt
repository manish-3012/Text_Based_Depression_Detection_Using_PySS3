Losing everything I love, can't stand existing anymoreI've dealt with my bipolar for well over a decade, lost everything I had and had fought like hell to build it up.  Been back in college for a couple of years, things were going well, actually had friends, felt like I had a direction in my life, was intellectually stimulated and fascinated.  I'm a year out from graduation and was on the verge of applying to grad schools, but that dream dies in the next 24 hours.

My school yanked my financial aid and my appeal supposedly gets heard today, but they keep asking for more stuff so it doesn't sound promising.  Today also is the payment deadline for the semester, so even if they DO hear it and by some miracle approve it, they won't have aid processed in time and I have NOWHERE near enough to pay for my tuition and no way to get it.

With my dreams and purpose and life coming to a screeching halt and no realistic way to get them back, I don't think that I can go on anymore.  People keep asking me what my "Plan B" is and they really don't want to know the answer because it involves me going from being a great story of recovery to becoming another statistic.  

I don't see how I can recover from this.  I don't know if I even have anything left in me to try anymore.
