I'm in a constant loop.Im done with typing in what im going through, and then cringing about my posts and then deleting them completely. I've had enough why do i want to die so bad for months and one day i just delete all my posts. I even deleted my other account and opened this one a few months ago. I just started posting on this one but i'll tell what im going through if anyone wants to hear it. Either way, i just want it to end rn. Its 2am i have yo get up at 6 for school but i just cant calm down im constany thinking of how i could kill myself most painlessly and what my note is going to be like.im horrible at school and my parents just make it worse.
