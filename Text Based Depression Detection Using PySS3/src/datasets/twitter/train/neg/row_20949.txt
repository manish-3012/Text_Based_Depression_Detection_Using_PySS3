I actually donâ€™t want to dieI would have rather not been born in the first place. 

I donâ€™t want to live with how my life is currently. But I have no motivation to change anything. 

Everyday I feel progressively worse. Everyday I feel this tremendous urge to kill myself. 

I feel like Iâ€™m living out a slow death. I literally feel like Iâ€™m dying.
