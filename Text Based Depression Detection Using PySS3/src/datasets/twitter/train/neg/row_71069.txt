Why are guns so expensive???I don't know anyone who owns a gun, which means I have to buy one. But even starter guns are $400 at least. That's a big chunk of my paycheck, so if I fail that's a lot of money down the drain. Besides that, I don't know anything about guns. I can't very well go up to the shop owner and ask which gun is best for shooting myself in the head. What's my excuse for buying it? Would a vague "home defense" excuse work?
