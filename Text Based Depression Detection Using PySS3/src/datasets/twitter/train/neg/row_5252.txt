I don't know anymoreTired of dealing with this I deserve love and happiness but yet I don't have it I want to just sleep and never wake up been battling with depression and anxiety and last night was the worst when my husband came home I wanted to take as many pills just to OD I feel like everyone would be happy if I wasn't around
