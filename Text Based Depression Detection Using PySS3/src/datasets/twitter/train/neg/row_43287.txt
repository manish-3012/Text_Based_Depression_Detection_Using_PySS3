im in survival mode please tip my scalethis weekend has been awful. i am sick. i am very weak. i have not been eating or sleeping enough and it has reached a point where im pretty sure i need to be hospitalized. i even ate more. friday and yesterday and today. i called off work friday and today. i have literally never done that once in my entire fucking life. i cannot help myself. i can't think straight. i keep thinking i should go to the hospital but i don't even know how i would get there. i don't think i can drive a car at all right now. i would call someone but i can't function enough to even do that. like i don't even know what i would say. i don't know what to say. i have no idea what is wrong with me or what has happened i keep thinking i may have been drugged i feel so incredibly fucked up. more fucked than times ive done shrooms and acid before i am literally in another dimension it is taking me so long to even make this post. 

i think i am very close to death. like i think i could actually talk to god right now. if that makes sense. like i am barely even on this fucking planet. i feel like it is completely up to me whether i stay here or not. it is so surreal to be having this moment rn. you go your whole life wondering about your death and i think my moment is here. it is in my hands it is up to me. there is no other force with me no one is here to help me or tell me which one to pick. live or give up? i am so close i am 50/50 right now. i could go either way. my will to get better is not more than my will to give up. it just doesn't matter. and it is up to me. and it does not matter.
