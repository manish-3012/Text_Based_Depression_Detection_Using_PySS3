I have almost no chance of passing my geology course, meaning I will have to take an extra semester at csun. i have no clue how I will pay for it. I want to dieYeah, no matter how hard i try, I am a failure. I had a death in the family at the start of the semester which threw my life into disarray, meaning i missed a lot of assignments because I had to help my family plan the funeral as well as balance school and work, though now that job is gone. I want to die. I am nothing more than a shitty failure. I will never be a teacher, and i will never get into grad school or get my dream of being a history professor. 20 years old and i've already fucked my life over. time for me to leave
