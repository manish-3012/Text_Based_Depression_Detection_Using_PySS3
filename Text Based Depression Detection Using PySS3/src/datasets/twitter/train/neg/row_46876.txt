No one ever sees meNo one ever really sees me. 

Today I realized my friends are more friends with each other than they are with me. I know part of the reason is because of circumstance but it still sucks. They donâ€™t ever really know the pain Iâ€™m hiding. How could they? I donâ€™t even let them in. I tried once, but they didnâ€™t understand and it made it worse. I cried. Somehow I already end feeling as if my hurts and pains are silly, even when they complain about so much light let stuff. They can laugh more freely, but they donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m so awkward, so quiet, never fitting quite in because of well over a decade long battering of my heart and mind with depression, anxiety, and traumas. My brain and heart is not the same as theirs. Itâ€™s been abused, damaged and I donâ€™t know how much of it is repairable. Iâ€™m still trying to fight against it, though going back and forth and being high functioning often leads people to tell youâ€™re lazy, youâ€™re not trying hard enough. Itâ€™s like I just want to say â€œcan you please try to regular (stressful) things while youâ€™re bleeding and see how that works out for yaâ€. I feel very lonely. Theyâ€™ve been my friends for 10 years. There were a lot of memories where I was laughing so hard I would cry. 
Now Iâ€™m just crying.

Thanks for coming to my ted talk.
