Does this sound like a fake suicide to you?I've been suspicious of this person for a bit, they seem to want a lot of attention. But heres what happened awhile back, Sophie's mom texted the GC saying that Sophie attempted to commit suicide and was in the hospital. She told us that she stabbed her stomach and that Sophie was okay. She was released the same day/in a few hours. It just seemed very suspicious to me and one other person in that GC. But we moved on and forgot about it, talking with Sophie and other things, she seemed fine. (I'm not close to her.) But today she texted some of her close friends saying she was going to commit suicide the whole GC was in dismay, my GF is still worried. And not much has happened since the person who thought her last attempt was suspicious texted me saying they talked her down.

I may sound like an ass but I'm suspicious that she faked her suicide, sure she may possibly be suicidal and depressed but faking a suicide and getting everyone to worry and contact you is such a manipulative shitty thing to do. So whats your thoughts reddit?
