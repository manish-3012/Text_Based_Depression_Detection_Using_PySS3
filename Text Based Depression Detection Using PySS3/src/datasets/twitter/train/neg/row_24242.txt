I don't even deserve to complain.I was born into a (mostly) loving, affluent family and never once had to worry about starving or paying the bills. I have to right to want to die when I have everything.

I was born with a silver spoon in my mouth and yet I'm shit at *everything*. I can't do this anymore.
