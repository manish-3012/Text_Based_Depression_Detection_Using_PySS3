I think this is it...Iâ€™ve been toying with the idea of suicide for what feels like my entire life but lately it feels like itâ€™s constantly in my head. I feel obsessed with it, Iâ€™m constantly scouting new ways to kill myself; a new belt, eyeballing a median to crash my car, a pond to drive into... lately Iâ€™ve been taking walks in my very bad neighborhood in hopes that something bad will happen. I am $6,000 in debt and canâ€™t get a loan to help, Iâ€™m ashamed to ask my family not that they would help me if I asked... and itâ€™s local people/businesses that I owe and they are calling and texting and threatening to go to the police., my friends and roommates donâ€™t like me and we donâ€™t even talk. Iâ€™m not religious but I keep making bets in my head with god that if things go right just one time Iâ€™ll silence these thoughts and things never go the way I want. Iâ€™m just ready to quiet whatâ€™s pounding in my head. Iâ€™m not sure why I felt the need to even post here but itâ€™s nice to put everything out there and know people will actually see it. Maybe someone will find it after Iâ€™m gone.
