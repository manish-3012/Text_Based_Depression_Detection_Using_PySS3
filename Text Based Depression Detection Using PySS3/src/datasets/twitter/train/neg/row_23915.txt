I can't cope anymoreI was assaulted nearly 2 months ago and I can't get it out of my head. I have dreams about it, I have flashbacks all the time I can't get through a day without reliving it in some way. I see him all the time, I'm scared to sleep in my own bed and I can't walk past his neighbourhood without being terrified. I keep thinking about him hurting my friends and I'm scared they will see him. I'm exhausted, I can't fucking live like this and I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm losing my mind, it's so painful I just want to get out of this body.
