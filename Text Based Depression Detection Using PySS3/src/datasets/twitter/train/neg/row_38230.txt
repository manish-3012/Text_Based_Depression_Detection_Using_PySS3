School is driving me closer. I need some advice.It seems like no matter what classes I take, Iâ€™m slowly losing the knowledge that they hammer into your head. I canâ€™t remember things like the other kids. Iâ€™m just constantly under the impression that Iâ€™m too stupid for any of this. Itâ€™s only been a week and already I feel like Iâ€™ve picked up where I left off last school year, barely getting by no matter how much help or tutoring I get. Sometimes Iâ€™ll catch myself wondering what the point of any of this is. Itâ€™s the same crap everyday, and every day the result is the same: more confusion. No amount of studying helps. No amount of khan academy videos or after school hours help. The school system has led me to believe that Iâ€™m good at remembering things and writing them down afterwards and nothing more. Theyâ€™ve led me to believe that since I can barely pass classes, I wonâ€™t do anything in life. Whatâ€™s even worse is that I know it isnâ€™t true, but why does that matter when the voices in your head constantly tell you otherwise? 


Iâ€™m on the verge. It doesnâ€™t even look like itâ€™s worth it anymore. Whatâ€™s the point when the world is slowly falling apart anyways? It just doesnâ€™t look like itâ€™s gonna get any better. 

School has driven me to suicide watch. If anybody out there knows how to conquer this devil of a situation, please let me know. Otherwise itâ€™s all over.
