Feeling ignored..I've been thinking about suicide for years now as an option.

I am on the autistic spectrum and have tried to kill myself before.

Basically as the years go on, my friends have drifted off from me. 
Mainly because I feel I am too much for them and they all have relationships.

The one thing that always make me think about suicide is being alone. I do not want to be one of those 40 year old men who spends all their time alone. I know for some people, that would be great for them but for me, it' a no. I'd rather just end it if I know that is going to be my life from now on.

I know my issue may sound silly but hey ho.

Sometimes I feel ignored by my friends and I'm starting to question if they want to even be my friend?

I also have ADHD so I can get really hyperactive sometimes. 

Plus I am struggling job wise and I if I do not get a more permanent job soon, I'm going to have to go back and live with my parents which will cause me to be alone even more.

So basically, I've decided to give myself to new years. If nothing improves and I do have to end up going back home. I'll end it, no one would care anyway since everyone ignores me. They probably won't even notice.

The only reason I'm holding on for another month is to try and see if there is a light in the end of the tunnel. Here's hoping..
