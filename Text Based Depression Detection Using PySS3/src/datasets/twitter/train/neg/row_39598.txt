Feel trapped.Apologies if this seems like a self-centred rant, will try to keep it short: 

I know that if I killed myself it would make me an awful person because my brother jumped off a building two years ago and it would be unimaginably difficult for our mum to have both her kids die like that. The problem is that secretly I wish I could just make it all stop. Currently I wouldn't act on it, and I'm not sure if having strong suicidal feelings without the immediate intention to do anything about it makes me suicidal, depressed, or what. 


It seems melodramatic written down because externally life seems ok - good job, social life - but I feel numb and don't have any hope that things will improve in the future. I self-harmed nearly every day for several years as a teenager (early 20s now) and since largely overcoming that the suicidal thoughts have gotten stronger. I can't actually remember a time in my life when I've felt happy. Would counselling help? I guess I've been hoping this will just get better on its own eventually.
