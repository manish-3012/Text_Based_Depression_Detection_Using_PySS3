I keep expecting to wake up from this nightmare.4 years ago, I was a perfectly healthy 21 year old. Life has had it's way with me, and I am in disbelief that I haven't already ended my life.

Things that have happened to me in a 3 year span in order of occurrence:

-Randomly developed panic &amp; derealization disorder, plus generalized anxiety 24/7
-Met my full-blood adopted brother (only brother) for the first time, he was 27 years old. A month after I met him, he overdosed and died.
-Girlfriend of 4 years left me for a woman
- Was diagnosed with chronic tinnitus from a concert. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinnitus)
- Mother is an alchoholic, 24/7 drunk. I miss her. Recently found out my dads been cheating on her for 2 years.
-Started getting muscle twitching, vertigo, difficulty speaking and swallowing out of nowhere (doctors say possible MS, possible ALS, possible LYME disease)
- Met another girl who was there for me through everything, she recently left me because of the way I treated her through everything. She was perfect and felt like my one way out.
-Job restructuring left me in an undesirable position from one I loved.
- A couple days ago, noticed I felt the constant feeling of orgasm in my pelvic / groin region, This has not subsided at all (http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/249594.php) looking online, I only see two people with this disorder that are male EVER being studied, and yet here I am.
- Muscle pain, constant, 24/7. 
- no family left. No one left.

I've been to doctor after doctor, nothing has helped, and every week something life altering happens that pushes my fucking face so far into the ground that my hope to see light again diminishes almost completely.  

No one can really expect me to live like this can they? I am completely miserable, fatigued 2/47, symptoms and life events every fucking day, can't go out anymore, can't do anything, and all in the blind of an eye.  

Most of the things listed medically are seen as chronic, incurable. I am the definition of misery, I want a way out so badly, but I don't want to die. The idea is starting to comfort me more and more every day I have to live through this.
