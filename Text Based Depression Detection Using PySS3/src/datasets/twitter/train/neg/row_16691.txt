I feel at peaceIm not sure if im allowed to post this here,  but to cut a long story short i have singlehandedly managed to ruin my own life, my SO's and my best friends and now i feel as if i've not got any reason to carry on ( i'd be lying if i said i wanted to find a reason too) but i feel completely at peace with the idea of just giving up and ending it all, i feel no fear or anxiety about dying and i want to know if this is "normal"
