I know I want to but I don't know why...I guess I will start off by saying a few things about myself. I am 19, living on my own with my girlfriend, in shape, and a manager at a retail store.

I just don't really want to live anymore. I can't feel attached to anyone anymore because of my last relationship. I care for her more than anyone else but I just can't love anymore and it hurts. I had said I gave up on love in the heat of the moment but I guess I have. I feel like my job is a dead end and I hate waking up knowing I have to put in a 9 or 10 hour shift just to pay bills. On top of that I have severe medical problems. I know others have it worse which is why I put on a fake smile for everyone. They don't need to worry any more than they have to for me. I have failed at suicide once but I contemplate it more and more every day. I have no logical reason for thinking this way and even though I have come to terms with that it doesn't help me any. I hate my existence and it has caused me to become bitter.
