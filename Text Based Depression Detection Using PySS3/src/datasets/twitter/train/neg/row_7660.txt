2020 is the end of the lineI've had enough, if this is living someone can have this shit because I'm done. I sold everything I own and moved across the country, there's nothing left for me but struggling to make ends meet, and it's not a struggle that fulfills life. Everything problem is my fault and everyone's problem is my issue, I'm so tired.
