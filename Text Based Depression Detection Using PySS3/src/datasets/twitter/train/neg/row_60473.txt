People Only Care When Youâ€™re OkI feel like Iâ€™m constantly drowning and trying to swim while holding up the people around me. Iâ€™m applauded for swimming, but no one is there to grab my hand when I start to struggle. It almost feels easier to drown than to continue kicking to the surface. I just canâ€™t do it anymore. The boat has sailed away and I donâ€™t have the energy to try and catch up.
