Found "evidence" that my girlfirend cheated on me really hard.i just don't even want to talk about it or write a text post on how heartbreak Iam right now. I just found some "evidence" that my girlfriend cheated on me with multiple guys (and even had sex with one of them.) i almost fainted when i found it out, really, everything started going blur and i almost felt on the ground.

I don't  know even what i do anymore, she's my reason to live. If i really find out that she did that, i won't be afraid to jump anymore. I just needed to unburden, been crying non-stoping for hours.
