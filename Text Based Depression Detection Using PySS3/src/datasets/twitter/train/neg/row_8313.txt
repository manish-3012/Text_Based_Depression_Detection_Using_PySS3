HopelessI feel hopeless. I get ignored all day, get called annoying, am useless, and just am an overall loser. I don't serve a purpose in this world. "Oh, but you're still young." It doesn't help when you feel hopeless at thirteen either. Life just gets harder. I didn't intend to be a burden, but that's all I am to my friends. I'm probably not going to kill myself tonight, but sure wish that I would accidentally happen to die...
