I think I'll do it tonightI cant cope anymore. I'm too ugly to be a prostitute, too weak to work in gastronomy and too stupid to get education. My so called friends and family successively ignore me while I'm telling them I'll literally kill myself. I never mattered to anyone. My country is in ruin and it can't be reversed. I have no reasons to go on. Years of therapy didn't help at all. Instead I only got something like secondary psychopathy. First people to notice will be my roommates after the opened container of sour cream spoils after months, and manager that I don't pay rent. I don't want to be stopped. I chose a painful method but by far the cheapest and taking the least guts. My own fucking mother dismisses me as a "kid", tells me to "grow up". Let's see who needs to grow up when I'll be dying in the ambulance because the nearest open ER is a hundred miles away. Goodbye. I can't take it anymore.
