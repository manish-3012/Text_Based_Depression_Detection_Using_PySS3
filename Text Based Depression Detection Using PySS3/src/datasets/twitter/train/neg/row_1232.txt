I donâ€™t want to live, but I donâ€™t want to dieThe thought of death terrifies me...the possibility that itâ€™s just blankness, and nothing else. 
But I donâ€™t want to live. Iâ€™m stuck, have been stuck for 16 years. Everything has just gotten worse.

Iâ€™m only 26 but Iâ€™ve worked so hard to get better, and then something happens and I end up worse than I was. Iâ€™m tired of fighting. Iâ€™m tired of being me, of putting everything I wanted to do off until Iâ€™m in a better place...I never will be and canâ€™t do them unless I am. I am stuck and alone and fucking jaded. 

So fucking stuck. I donâ€™t want to be me anymore. I wish I was somebody else. I wish I had someone elseâ€™sâ€™ better life. Iâ€™m unfixable in so many ways. I wish I had more time and support. I just donâ€™t want to do it anymore
