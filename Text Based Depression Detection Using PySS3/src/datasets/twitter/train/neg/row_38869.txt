Do i tell my parents i tried to kill myself ?Long story short i have been struggling with depression and anxiety for about 3 years now. I got a phone call randomly from my mum yesterday saying her and my dad (they split up when i was very young) wanted to meet me together and talk. 
They must have picked up on how i have been the last couple of years and realised something is not right. 5 months prior to this though I actually went on holiday with some friends. I went home early one night with the intention of killing myself and ending it all. I wrote notes but because i was drunk at the time I actually slipped on the tile floor of the hotel and knocked myself unconscious, Only to wake up to my friends back at the hotel room gathered around me.... 
so feeling stupid i said i had slipped and i left early because i was too drunk. Since this i have decided not to end it because when i came round and read my notes i had left to my parents I couldnâ€™t stop crying, thinking about my mum reading it. So my question is do i tell them about this or keep it to myself ?
