I have chronic pain, i'm not depressed though just tired of being in painI've been diagnosed with disorder called clusters. I'm constantly in pain . I spend at least 100$ a week on meds, and I'm unable to work. 0.003% of the human population has this so very little research has or can be done. Theres no real treatments just trial and error and it's all been error. 

I'm so sick of feeling in pain and in a pain no one can sympathize with unless they've had CH . there have been burn victims and people who have given birth who say this is more painful.

I'm not depressed i'm just tired the pains to much i donno why im writting here i just dont have anyone
