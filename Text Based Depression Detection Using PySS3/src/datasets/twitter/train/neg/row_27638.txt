I deserve the pain.
Iâ€™ve asked people to not fuck with Acetaminophen OD since itâ€™s VERY painful â€” and since Iâ€™ve been through that shit once. But now, I have the urge to OD on Paracetamol again. Only this time Iâ€™ll do it right with the right amount and make sure itâ€™s long enough before itâ€™s found for the N-AC to not counteract it.
