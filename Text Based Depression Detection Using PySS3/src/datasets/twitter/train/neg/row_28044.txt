The line between my thoughts and reality is getting very blurred.The love is disappearing from my family, like a flame going out. I don't know if this is in my head or not.. I don't know if they are legitimately mentally unwell or maybe I am? 

I try to be nice and i'm treated like i'm a horrible person. I act annoyed and they show more respect. I don't understand anymore.

I just want this tension to end. It tightens every day and I don't know who or what is responsible for it.

Am I pushing into schizophrenia?
