I want to goI feel like I have nothing more to say to anyone. Everything there is, I've exhausted it. 

I just want to go, I don't want to be here anymore. 

I'm alone. I just don't want to be here any longer, I can't seem to get away from it all. I'm trapped in this painful lonesome place and I just want to leave.

EDIT (02/15): I'm okay. I've started seeing a psychiatrist.
