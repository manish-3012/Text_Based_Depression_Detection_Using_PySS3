What do you do for fun?What do you do for fun? I spend all day in bed on the internet/games and I'm so sick and bored of it. But I don't have anything else in my life worth doing, everything I used to like doing no longer appeals to me. It takes so much effort to pick stuff up, and I feel so bad about the progress I've lost that starting again just feels depressing. I used to do Aikido, play the piano, exercise, and study at uni. But now it's too late. Every time I try to start again, I realise how far I am behind, and it just sends me back into distractions. How do I break the cycle and get over the fact that I've lost 2 years of my life to this fucking stupid disease? Hopefully next semester will be a fresh start, but I'm just so fucking sick of being this lazy and stupid.

Sorry for the rant I don't really have anything to offer I just felt like this would be a place to let it out. FYI I have exams all this week and I've done nothing to prepare for them, I'm going to go and probably fail, but at least I'll've gone.
