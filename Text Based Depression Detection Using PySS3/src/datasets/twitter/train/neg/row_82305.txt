RegretI was in 4th grade at the time, so maybe 10 years old. Back then, something happened to me that continues to haunt me as of now. I don't remember it vividly, but I remember someone younger who might've been assualted; while we were in daycare, by someone a couple years older than me. Till this day I still don't know whether or not something happened or not. The possible guilt continues to kill me to this day. Fast forward 8 years later, I'm even making up things that may or may not have have happened that day possibly because of anxiety. I don't think I can ever find peace for what i may have done. This is mentally exhausting to think about what can i do ?
