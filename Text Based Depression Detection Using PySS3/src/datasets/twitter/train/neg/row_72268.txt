Thinking of Killing Myself SoonThere's just no help for me and nothing in my life is going to change. At this point why bother with life when assholes like you don't even help me. How much blood do I have to donate at no cost, how much time do I have to spend with veterans, how many therapists, before society gives me a helping hand? Its never going to happen. So suicide seems like a good solution to my never ending problem. 

Look through my comment history it explains everything wrong with my life.
