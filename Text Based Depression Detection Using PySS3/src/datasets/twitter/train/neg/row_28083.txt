Maybe I am selfishA friend told me today that he hopes I get past my depressive episode cause it really doesnâ€™t sit well with him the fact that I joke about killing myself so often. Maybe I was selfish only thinking about myself when telling him my problems and not thinking how it would affect his mood or so. So I guess Iâ€™ll stop telling my only friend what I feel for now. I really care for him and donâ€™t want him to feel bad or uncomfortable because of me.
