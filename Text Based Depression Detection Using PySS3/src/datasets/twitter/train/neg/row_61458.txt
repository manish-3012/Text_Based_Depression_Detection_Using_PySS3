Literally no reason not to.I don't want to wake up at 6 a.m. after 3 hours of sleep to a cigarette smoke and beer can littered house and a screaming gaslighting alcoholic mother and a retarded obese father who's too much of a fucking pussy to get a divorce or put me up for adoption. I don't want to spend every waking moment being forces to listen to a teacher online who doesn't give a fuck about my education or feelings through a shit internet that I get punished for when I can't connect to the online world. I don't want to hope that my damaged sister who had to suffer the same shit as I do to forcefully remove me from my parent's custody only to go to a dirt-poor foster home since nobody in my family would be willing to take me in. People always promised me for my entire life that things would get better but they've always gotten worse at an impossible speed. Why do I have to suffer through this? Either my existence is so worthless that God hates me or he doesn't exist at all. Though if I ever wanted to think about it my entire family of religious freaks would hate me even more than they already do. The only thing that distracts me from any of this is going on the internet and looking at stuff that gives me false hope that there's better things waiting for me, and even that'a being threatened by my parents hovering over my shoulder to make sure I'm a good little boy and I'm doing all of my homework that focuses on shit I physically can not learn about from my absolutely fucked brain that'a been so shaken that Incan't retain any information.
