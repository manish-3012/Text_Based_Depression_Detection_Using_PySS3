I can't stop this might lead to the endI've done it once and now my thoughts are just an endless spiral. There is no-one I can talk to, there is no place I can go it's just spinning down and my thoughts are concentrating not on the if not even on the how and also not when but how fast I can be there.
I can't take it anymore. And I don't think this time I can be saved after I've done it. This time will be the last time.
