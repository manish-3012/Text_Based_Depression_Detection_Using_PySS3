I'm just so tiredI'm so tired of getting up every day. I go to work, I take care of my son, I do all the things I'm supposed to do, and I still get made to feel like a selfish asshole. and then I do it all again the next day.

I'm tired.

does it get easier? do I change? I want to want to live, but I dont.
