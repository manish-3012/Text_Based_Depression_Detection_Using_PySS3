I think I'm ready.I've had anxiety and depression for years. Nothing much has given me relief. I am always overwhelmed with worry or sadness.

The most prominent feature of my life is my obsessive worry about dying. I don't like feeling that I'm not in control.

I've finally decided it's for the best that I go out on my own terms. Erase myself from this world. No more worries, no more uncertainties. I will have complete control. My only regret is leaving my beloved dog behind, but as time passes she will learn to be happy as she is now - she has a good family.

I've tried once before, but obviously it failed. Now I have access to methods that are essentially guaranteed to work.

I am ready for this. I don't really want to kill myself, but there is no way I can keep living like this. Sorry it had to end this way.
