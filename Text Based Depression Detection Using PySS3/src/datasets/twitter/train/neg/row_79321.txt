I'm convinced this will be my last ChristmasI'm a failure I have been since elementary school. Then I went to a middle school for kids with learning disabilities. I barely graduated high school with a 2.8 getting straight Fs my first two years. The same thing is happening at my junior college. I get funding from Californias' DoR and when this semester grades come out they will drop me due to a sub-par GPA. I'll most likely be "expelled", I'm already on probation 2. I'm going nowhere in life. I have no motivation and see no point in doing well. I don't want to work 40 hours a week for the rest of my life, I don't see why anyone would.
