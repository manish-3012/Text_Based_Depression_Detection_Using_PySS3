Whatâ€™s the point in life?I donâ€™t understand how people can live their entire lives working 8hrs a day. It makes no sense that our purpose in life is wake up, go to work, come home, eat something then sleep. This cycle repeats for 40 years in some peopleâ€™s lives. If the whole point of life is to work to survive I really donâ€™t want to live or experience anything. Iâ€™d rather just die than have to worry about bills for the next 40 years.
