I might do it tomorrow.I have nothing left to live for, I lost my job, I'm not in university and because I lost my job I'm waiting for my SO to leave me. He's at work tomorrow so I might do it then but I'm unsure how, I don't want to traumatise him by him coming back to that scene, but at the same time I know he'd be better off because he has a great job and a degree and there's no point him wasting his time on me. I fuck up everything in life and I need to go.
