Simple incomplete guide to emotions***Now imagine the emotion spectrum as the ocean, of course being sad or worse is being underwater and being happy is being out of the water, breathing***

If you are always happy, **ENJOY YOUR F\*CKING LIFE**

***I***

***Still***

***Don't***

***KNOW***

\-------------------------------------WATER LEVEL------------------------------------------ happy life, not much

If you're don't feel any emotions rn, you're **NEUTRAL**

If you're a bit sad, **YOU'RE JUST BELOW THE SURFACE**

If you are really sad, **YOU'RE AT AN UNCOMFORTABLE DEPTH**

If you're depressed, **YOU'RE REALLY DEEP AND YOUR HEAD STARTS TO HURT**

If your deep into depression, **YOU CAN'T SEE ANYTHING**, no more light

If you're just a bit suicidal, **YOU CAN'T SEE AND YOUR EYES HURT**

If you're suicidal,  **YOU'VE HIT ROCK BOTTOM,** you'll think that things can't get any worse

If you kill yourself: 1 there was hope. 2 sorry, it's too late

Sorry for it being incomplete but as you can tell I've had many experiences above the water-line. If you want me to add stuff please comment.

&gt;Be happy
