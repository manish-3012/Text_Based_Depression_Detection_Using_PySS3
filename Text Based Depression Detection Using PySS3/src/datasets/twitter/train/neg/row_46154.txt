I can' t handle the pain anymore but I want to live.Hello I'm a graduating student from the Philippines with dreams and plans for the future. I have a girlfrIend and I love her so much. But I have suffered from toothaches and jaw pain so much I want to end it all. I endured a whole semester with rotten teeth  that was always painful and cried myself to sleep every night and I could not focus much on keeping up my grades.

Now I am suffering of severe jaw pain. I can't sleep, I can't eat and I can't open my mouth. I prayed to god to save me, I want to beg anyone to save me. It's 1 am and I'm crying again cause I don't know what to do. I don't want to be a burden to anyone but I want to live my life why is it so unfair.

The only option I see is to end myself. I can't bear the pain anymore. I love my family and I love my girlfriend but all I can feel right now is pain. I've been taking a lot of different pain killers but when it wears off, I just want to be in peace. Someone please save me. I don't want to die yet but with this unbearable pain I feel like death is the only option to end it. 

If I lock myself in the car while burning coal, would that be enough to kill me?
