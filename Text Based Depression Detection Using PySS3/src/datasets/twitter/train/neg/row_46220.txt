Why can't I just Cease to Exist?I remeber 5 years ago screaming and bashing my head against every surface screaming to not exist.  This place is I think is hell.  There is no greater gift than if I cease to exist completely.  Like before I was born.  I am currently trapped in a living hell.  Tortured, suffering, and unable to be free of misery.  I can't pretend anymore.  I have crawled on the ground on my knees and begged for help.  No, just carrots and more cruelty.  Confusion and pain.  It's not possible for me to truly be happy unless I no longer exist.  There is a level of trauma that I have experienced that can never be undone unless I lose my memory. 

Why would anyone insist on me continuing to exist when my life is a living hell?  If death is a sure way to end it all...  Would you ask anyone to keep living if they were being tortured constantly?  Only if you were a psychopath. 

So I'm asking for help.  Please allow me to cease to exist.  Please let it end.
