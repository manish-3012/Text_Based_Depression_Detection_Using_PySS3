Iâ€™m worried about my brotherI hope this post is ok here. 
I think my brother is going through some tough times. I want to help but he moved 5 hrs away last year. 

Long story short, I (30f) was not a very nice big sister. Brother (28m) was bullied a lot and a lot by me. He has recently told me that he doesnâ€™t want me in his life anymore, citing said bullying. 

Our most recent text exchange I realize went badly. I didnâ€™t know that he was in such a bad head space otherwise I would have worded things differently. And I didnâ€™t want to make things worse. Now sometimes he gets upset about something and then heâ€™s fine later in the day. This time I think is different. 

So today while visiting my mom I brought up brother and turns out he had already told her. I said I was really worried about him. I know heâ€™s taking medication but heâ€™s not being monitored by a doctor. And heâ€™s not seeking therapy, which Iâ€™m pretty sure is my dads fault. (Dads opinion of therapies is pretty negative) 

I got really upset because I felt like I couldnâ€™t do anything to help. And I worry any message will be misinterpreted. So I pushed my mom to take this as a cry for help. And she needs to pay more attention and ask more questions. Iâ€™m worried. 

Also I have screen shots but I donâ€™t know how to add them.
