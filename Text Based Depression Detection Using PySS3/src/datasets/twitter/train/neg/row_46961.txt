clearing my mind and wanting to end it allI haven't self harmed in a year or so but my suicidal thoughts have been getting worse. out of control anxiety and depression. all I can do is either plan out how I'll kill myself instead of finishing school and living a mediocre life, or distract myself from everything, digging myself in a deeper hole. I end up sitting around through nights like these when I just wish I could think straight and stay calm so I can at least sleep let alone exist in my bed without wanting to kill myself. thinking back to last year and many times before then all I would do is self harm and Id be able to clear my mind and I'd be able to cool down over a short period of time after that. I don't know why I'm typing this here but I can't get my mind off of it and I want it all to end
