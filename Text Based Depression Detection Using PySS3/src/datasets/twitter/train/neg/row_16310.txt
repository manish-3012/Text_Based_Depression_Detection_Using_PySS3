iâ€™m killing myself now please helpplease help I feel so bad right now, I failed an exam and my mom is so mad and screaming out loud is getting terrible, was I really that bad of a child for her? I canâ€™t keep on with this heavy heart, Iâ€™m just a step away from going out and hang, but I fear so much of this being a temporary decision resulting in a permanent situation
