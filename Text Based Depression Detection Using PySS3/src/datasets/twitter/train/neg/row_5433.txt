Never cheat on your soulmateTwo years ago i cheated on my girlfriend, i Was cuddleing with another woman in bed. No sex or kisses, still not okey. 

She still decided to be with me, she cries all the time still thinking about it.

Now it looks like she had enough and will probably leave me any day now

We both love eachother so much. But she cant take the pain. I Never believed in the term â€soulmateâ€ before i met her and now i have fucked up everything in my life.

If/When she leaves me i dont want to live anymore, i Really just want the easiest most painless death i can get. So ashamed that i will make her even more sad from me doing suicide, and i feel so sad for my family and friends. Life is 0 without her. She is my best friend since i Was 13 years old and now i will lose her forever
