I've decided I'm going to kill myself* I have an uncontrollable long-term obsession with people and events which are long gone, which impedes on my ability to be happy every day.
* I'm dealing with guilt from all the people I've hurt over my lifetime.
* I failed high school.
* I failed my university preparation course.
* After failing university preparation, I went to university anyway and dropped out after the first year.
* I'm alone.
* I just don't feel motivated to carry on with life.
* Going back to university is hard, because all I think about is the screaming and fighting I had to go through to go. (I had to repeatedly fight my mother growing up.)
* 20's are supposed to be "the best years of your life," so I don't feel motivated to continue.
