A friend needs helpSo our first post over in r/Advice detailed the situation, but it got worse and we were told to post here. The silence was only broken today, and we found out he tried to take his own life. The exact date of when heâ€™s going to return is unspecified, but when he does, we have no idea how to act. Would physical contact be advised against (one of our friends needs physical reassurance, and he was okay with that before the incident, so)? Do we act like nothingâ€™s changed? Do we talk about it after some time?
