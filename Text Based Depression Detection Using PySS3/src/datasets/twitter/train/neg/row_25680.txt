Starting to think it won't get any betterI've struggled with depression and anxiety since I was 14.. I'm 21 now. My life should be fine. I have a loving family, a job, a nice apartment, etc. I take meds and I exercise, eat well, whatever. I do all the shit you're supposed to do. I still want it all to end. I don't feel comfortable around anyone and when I'm alone, I'm just alone with my thoughts. I don't have anything worth talking to anyone about. I feel like shit. Plain and simple. I have good days but the days that I feel shitty don't feel worth it. I thought about ending it two nights ago. I got in my car and wanted to drive as fast as I could into a pole. I drove over the bridge and pictured myself climbing over the fence. I don't think it gets any better like anyone says it does. I don't want to hurt my family but I feel like it's only a matter of time
