Hi, I just really need help right now.Hi everyone, those of you reading thank you. Starting in October I met a girl and really hit it off. We talked of dating and right before we started she dumped me off and went with some other guy. At first I was sad, but I got over it. Well a few weeks later I started having an overwhelming sense of feeling not good enough. This feeling comes and goes, but I almost always feel down unless I can somehow occupy myself with friends. I feel that I'm over the girl, but she may have triggered some sort of underlying depression. I just don't kbow what to do and need to talk.
