i really donâ€™t care anymorei feel nothing. it may be a mood swing idk but i wanna kill myself so bad right now. iâ€™ve been suicidal to different degrees for so many years now. but yesterday i was a little more hopeful for the future but i wake up today and i just feel so sad and depressed and i just feel this need to kill myself. deep down i know nothing will get better, if it does then it wonâ€™t be much better than this. i just donâ€™t care for anything anymore
