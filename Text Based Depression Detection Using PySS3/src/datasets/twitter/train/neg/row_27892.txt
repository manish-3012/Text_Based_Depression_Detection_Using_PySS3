What's the point?I'm a shy person, even if it's anonymously on the internet so I don't really know how to begin this properly (it's more that I don't want to humiliate myself.) I guess I'll start by addressing the fact that I'm 17-years-old, but it feels like I've lived a lifetime. Not sure where it all began but at one point I developed a Nihilistic personality, that's most likely when it all went downhill. I just stopped caring about life or anything it had to offer, I eventually stopped caring about my friends, my family, everything that I used to cherish. 


Maybe it was little bits and pieces that made me develop such a mindset, I'll address what I think were the main problems, might be long but please bear with me. 


I developed trust issues at a young age and eventually became asocial. This made my life hell, I didn't like anybody getting too close to me so I purposely turned myself into an unlikable and hostile person. I could not, and still do not to this day, trust anybody and the only reason I can think of why I became like that was because of an unfortunate history with betrayal of trust. What happened is irrelevant, what is relevant is that it happened a lot and it hurt me a lot.


Next thing that occurred, not being around people made me develop a lack of empathy while simultaneously making me emotionless. I went to school and didn't interact with anybody, sat alone at lunch, did group projects alone and just about any other red flag you can mention for a loner kid, after that I came home and locked myself in my room and that was my day for a long time. I wanted to socialize but my trust issues didn't let me, I still felt emotions at the time but what really made them disappear was the realization that nobody cared. I locked myself in my room and my parents didn't care, I was a loner at school and nobody cared. So I just said "Fine, who needs them anyway?"


Time went by, forgot the last time I ever loved somebody, if I ever did in the first place, forgot the time I actually felt something. Things like sex were and still are meaningless to me, I can't really crave it or want it so I guess I'm just a self-diagnosed asexual. Basically everything was out of my life except for me and my mind, the only thing I find positive about this is that it allows me to look at things from a perspective that is purely through thought and reason, rationality and logic.


And so finally, this is the unfortunate beginning of the end... 


**I came to the conclusion that life is meaningless**


This is where the negative aspects of my personality come into play. The exact moment I came to this conclusion was the day it all went downhill. I kept asking myself the unanswerable question "What is the meaning of life?" And so I became frustrated because of the lack of answer. On the plus side I finally had something I never had, a goal. I actually had a goal, something to keep me going, a will to live. A foolish one at that however, "To find the meaning of life." Obviously I was never going to find it, so I eventually gave up on it.


Graduated from high school, was an excellent student ready to go into one of the best universities the country I currently live in had to offer, basically the road was set for me to become a successful person in life. And I refused. I gave up on moving forward because after graduating high school, and before I ever got a chance to go to university. I unfortunately came to my conclusion. My parents, and just about any other small amount of people I can count on one hand that I knew, were disappointed and frowned my decision upon me. I assume my parents cared somewhat about me since they insisted on taking care of me regardless of my decision.


And so I wasted a substantial amount of time doing nothing but living in my house. Until I came to a gruesome thought...


**Maybe I should kill myself**


And so now I'm here. No goal to keep me moving forward, nobody or nothing to care about, nothing to feel. I'm basically an anomaly, there's no place for me in this world and even if that's false, like I previously mentioned... I just don't care.


I don't know what to ask of you, that is if anyone bothered reading this. I think that would suffice really, someone reading this. I guess I'd appreciate you all sharing your thoughts.


I have nothing to lose.
