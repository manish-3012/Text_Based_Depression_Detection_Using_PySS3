I died yesterdayI died yesterday and now for some reason my body is moving but Iâ€™m dead inside. Yesterday was it. Iâ€™m dead. I have nothing on the inside. No joy. No sorrow. No up. No down. No conversation. Nothing. I am a body thatâ€™s waiting for death whenever that may be because Iâ€™m already dead.
