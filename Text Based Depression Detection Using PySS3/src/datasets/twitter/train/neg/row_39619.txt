Girl left me for my best friend. It feels like I have nothing left. Like a fucking retard, I pushed away everything to get this girl. I stopped caring about everything I love. Long story short, I stopped trying in school and I pushed away friends, and lost interest in basically everything I used to like. I fucked up. Girl is the only thing I care about. Girl left me today for the only friend I have left. Considered blowing brains out. Convince me it's a bad decision. 

Edit: I woke up this morning after barely sleeping, and I still feel like trash. I'll be okay though, I promise, and I can't thank you guys enough for reading and replying.
