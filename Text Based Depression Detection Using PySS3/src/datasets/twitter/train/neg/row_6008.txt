I'm probably going to end it soonTitle says it all. Just thought someone should know. 

I've tried help and it worked for a while. I tried guilting myself to stay alive. It doesn't work anymore. I don't even know if I'll make it to Christmas. I wish it all would end. I was a mistake. I'm useless and worthless. I want to die tonight.
