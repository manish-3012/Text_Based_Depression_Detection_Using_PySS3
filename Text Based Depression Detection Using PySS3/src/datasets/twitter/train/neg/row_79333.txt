Those of you who have voluntary committed yourselves to a psychiatric ward or asked a friend/family member to come supervise you for fear of harming yourself or others: what made you do it? What was the tipping point, when you knew you had to do something for your own safety? What did it feel like?I struggle with vague suicidal ideation from time to time. It mostly takes the form of a morbid fantasy/curiosity, driven by my felt inability to manage my my life and the desire to free myself of it. I don't think I've ever reached a point where I've felt a serious urge to do it, thank god, but I have gamed out how it could be accomplished and flirted precariously with the logic that would lead me there.

In carrying out my thought experiments, I never have trouble intellectually grasping and sympathizing with the trains of thought that could lead someone to self-harm. But, frighteningly, I'm completely unfamiliar with the emotional experience of being that close to danger. I don't know what warning signs to look for and I'm afraid I wouldn't recognize the feeling (or haven't already), and given that depression tends to corrupt one's ability to reason and think clearly, there would be nothing internal to prevent me from following through on an urge.

I want to know that if I'm ever in the grips of a bitching depressive episode and don't have anyone to keep an eye on me, I can depend on my higher cognitive functioning to at least recognize some red flags, allowing me to protect myself from myself. So in hopes of collecting some "data", I'm asking all of you who've flipped that kill switch and given responsibility for your own safety over to a hospital, friend, or what have you: how did you know? And what did it feel like?
