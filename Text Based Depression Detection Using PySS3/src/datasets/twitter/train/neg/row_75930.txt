Tired of it all (Kinda Long)Im 19F and I've been depressed since 10th grade. Went to therapy but my parents made me stop cause it incovienced them and they said my depression was fake basically. I have no friends, never had never will probably. Too much abuse from people over the years has made me socially awkward and too anxiety ridden to even operate in society. I don't have a job and I've been desperately looking for one. My parents are gonna kick me out by the end of December.

My boyfriend is basically the only reason why Im still living but even then its getting harder these days. Hes so supportive and willing to help me and promises to give me a better life. We're long distance and have been together for 2 years. Hes saving everything he can to come see me and live together. 

Recently I've become more and more tired. Of everything. Im tired if being a burden to him. My panic attacks and suicidal thoughts worry him. Im tired of making him panic and worry. I'm tired if veing so dependent of him finicially and for emotionally. 

I'm tired of waking up everyday doing the same thing. Tired of being unable to do anything about being so fat and ugly cause whats the point? Im not going to amount to anything anyways. 

I've been contemplating suicide for so long. I just want this to be over with. I got the short end of the stick with the life lottery. I can't take much anymore. My only fears is that I don't want it to be painful, I'm scared what happens after death, and how will my boyfriend react...
