I owe you all a drink.Hi guys,

I am happy to say I donâ€™t feel suicidal anymore. Tonight I talked someone out of suicide and Iâ€™m trying to help them get sectioned.

It made me look back at where I was then, at my lowest point and like them I was on reddit. Writing a suicide note, here of all places.

A few people dmâ€™ed me but I canâ€™t find them all now, I all them my life (however, in lieu of my life I hope you will accept a pint.)

I want to pay it forward.

Thanks so much.
