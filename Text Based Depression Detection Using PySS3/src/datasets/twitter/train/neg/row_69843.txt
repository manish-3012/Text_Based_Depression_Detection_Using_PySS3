hi friends. first post. losing myself a bitthis will sound pathetic to most people, but i had a pet die yesterday and it tipped me over the edge.

i almost died in january this year from an episode where i wasn't in my right mind. they still called it a suicide attempt and i don't blame them. on the grand scale of things i'm better but i've also done a lot in the meantime, reckless things that people think are me doing positive things to change my life but really were impulse decisions. 

a lot of the reason why i tried so hard to get out of hospital in january and do my best to live was because of my pet, and knowing i need to be there to care for him, and that's something i was happy to live for, but he died completely at random, and since i was discharged from therapy about 2 months ago even with the hospitalisation i have nothing to do with myself right now, and i can't help but blame myself. i know even if i do something awful, there's a fair chance i'll snap back enough to save myself and worst case scenario, i end up in hospital which i really don't want to do again, but right now i'm doing my best to stay okay. if i do something awful again it'll either kill me or end me in the psych ward, i'm not a healthy person. i just really needed to talk about this somewhere where people wont think i'm calling for attention or for someone to save me or whatever, y'know.   
i'm doing my best to be ok. it's horribly far from being the worst thing in my life, but it might be the last straw. i want to be ok, which is new for me, but i still have so many ways in mind to off myself right now
