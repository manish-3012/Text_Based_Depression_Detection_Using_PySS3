Tired of feeling like a burdenI've hit a wall. My depression is at its all tie worst and the SSRIs I've been on are ineffective at treating my depression. I feel like I'm a nuisance to everyone in my life. People offer words of support but I still feel alone. I don't have anyone I can talk to. I don't have anyone that will listen to me. I'm trying to put on a brave front but thoughts of ending my life are getting more and more pervasive.

I hate that people share concern only as it extends to committing suicide. I hate that people are offering me false promises of "keeping in touch" and checking up on me and then I end up being the person to reach out for help. I hate that my friends don't even seem to care that I am screaming for help and the absolute best I get is apathy. Do they want me to just go away? It just feels like they want to push me away. I feel guilty for even sharing this because I'm letting people down. I removed myself from all forms of social media and a part of me hopes that someone will reach out and ask me how I'm doing, but I doubt they will.

I am so utterly and completely alone. And I'll die that way too.
