Thank YouHi, first time posting, not a throwaway because I don't think any of my friends really know my reddit account anyways. After going through a lot of these posts here I've realized that there are always people reaching out and willing to help those in need and I want to say thank you. Its pretty touching to know that people care enough to browse this subreddit and to reach out to someone struggling. 

I've been recently diagnosed and things have gone downhill pretty fast. I never saw myself as the kind of person to act on these terrible thoughts in my head but just the other weekend I stood on train tracks and cried because I felt accepting of that. I'm scared. I found myself staring at a knife for 20 minutes. When I flew on a plane that traveled dangerously close to a city skyline the only problem I had was that my parents and brother were on the same flight and I didn't want them to die with me. 

I hate having these thoughts. If I'm having these thoughts and I can't control them what is stopping me from acting them out if I'm not in control of myself. The depression is causing this and I want it to stop before it gets worse. I'm already on medication and going to two fricken therapists. I don't want to act on this but I feel like I'm heading to a darker and darker place.
