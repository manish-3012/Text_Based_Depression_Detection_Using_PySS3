I donâ€™t know how much more I can takeI am having such a rough time right now and it makes me want to just fucking hurt myself. My boyfriend is currently look at apartments in Portland and will move there at the end of summer. Heâ€™s upset and Iâ€™m upset. He may change his mind but for now itâ€™s really fucking with me. I feel like everyone is having so much fun without me. Iâ€™m generally a happy person and thatâ€™s all people see in me, but I have depression and anxiety. I am lowering my dosage in medication and that may be why Iâ€™m having this sudden outburst in feelings as well. I have been hanging out with friends but I feel so lonely. Iâ€™ve been using weed as a crutch to completely get out of my mind high to where I canâ€™t even form sentences. Now I want to start drinking and do the same. I have a drinking problem in my family and never have drank before. I want to hurt myself in every way possible. I canâ€™t kill myself because my mom already lost one child to suicide and I know sheâ€™d kill herself and my dad would drink himself to death. I just feel so worthless all the time. I canâ€™t stop sobbing. All my x-actos are either dull or hidden by my mom. My knives are also dull. I keep thinking how it would be so easy to go but I canâ€™t do that to my family.
