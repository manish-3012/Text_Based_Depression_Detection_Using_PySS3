I'm sorry I'm backI posted here a year or so ago, and since I've gone through a lot in life, I finally came out as bisexual after years of thinking it was wrong to be gay as a teen, but now, even though I feel like I now have loads of great friends around me, even repaired broken family bonds, I still feel so empty, Like I'm the only person experiencing what I'm going through, I know I'm not alone but it feels like I am. I've decided this time around, I'm going to get proper help, I don't want to feel like this anymore, I go through stages of feeling such strong happiness and sadness, then stages of utter indifference to everything. I want to be happy, that is my only goal, i would die to be happy
