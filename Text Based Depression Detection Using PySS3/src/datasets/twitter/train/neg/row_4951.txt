I'm Done!I'm done. Over it. Finished.

I'm sick of the memories.

I'm sick of the feelings.

I'm sick of the urges.

I'm sick of the pain.

I simply give up on trying to fix myself so I can have a good life. Nothing works anyway. 37 years of trying for what. I'm a huge fuck up &amp; I just have to accept it. So I'll just exist until death takes me.

P.S. Venting, no need to reply.
