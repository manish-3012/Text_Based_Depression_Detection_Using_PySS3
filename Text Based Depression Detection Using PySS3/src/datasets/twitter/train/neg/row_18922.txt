Can't hold a job for more than a few days because nothing ever feels right.I don't have much else to say. I've been dealing with chronic depression for about 6 years now and the suicidal ideations come and go, but lately they've been very strong as I continue to fail at achieving any sort of satisfaction from my friends, family, the art I create, and the work I must do to start living on my own.

I'm currently living with my parents and I honestly just don't know what to do next. I tried applying for SSI, but was rejected. Like I seriously wouldn't mind "retiring" and just taking that tiny monthly payment instead of trying to go out and socialize and push myself, because all that ever seems to do is dig me further into this rut.

Any advice or help is appreciated. I am not as suicidal as I was a few weeks ago, but the ideations and the comfort of the idea of non-existence are still very pertinent in my mind. Also I'm probably going to give up on my current job in a few days here since it's only feeling less and less right for me as the days go by. My deep, tired subconscious just wants me to bullshit myself and push through the discomfort so I can start living on my own, but my existential mindset and my emotional fragility are always holding me back.

Please help.
