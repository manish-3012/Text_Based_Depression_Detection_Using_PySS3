I'm so tired of lifeSo I've reached a point where I'm running out of reasons to live (26M). I'm very tired of life and all its problems.  I don't have anything to look forward to, no ambition, no future plans, and no motivation.  There is way more pain and suffering in my life than there is happiness so I'm truly wondering if living is worth it? I don't really see what valuable things life has to offer that can offset al the pain and suffering.
