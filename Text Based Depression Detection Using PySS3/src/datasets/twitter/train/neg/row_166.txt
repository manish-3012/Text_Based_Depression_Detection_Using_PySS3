Somebody told my friends to kill themselveSo, a bit of backstory. Me and my friends have all been at the school since kindergarten and had known each other for ages. Some of the people in my friends classes started telling them to commit suicide. Both of my friends have depression/anxiety and I don't know what to say or how to support them. What things could I say to them to help them, and let them know that they're not alone?
