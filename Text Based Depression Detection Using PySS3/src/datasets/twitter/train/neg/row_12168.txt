I can't go onSo I am 14/m and I can't bare life anymore. I live in a town in Cumbria in the UK. I am bullied by the people I would have once called friends, it is not physical bullying, more phycological bullying where they get in my head and fuck with it. My mum is an alcoholic and when she is not a drunken bitch she is just a bitch. My dad never gets off my case and is a sick a lot of the time.

I have a sort of crush on this girl in my french class, I don't mean to sound like some sort of twat but she is the most beautiful person I have ever seen. It is a shame really that I don't have a more likeable personality. I am a bit of a cunt and I have little to no social skills, I can talk to people for hours on things like discord but once I am place in front of them my mind goes blank. This makes interacting with people really difficult so I try to be as quite as possible so people don't really notice me. I would say something to her but I would fuck it up like the other times I tried to interact with girls. 

I have suffered with depression for a while now and the bullying thing doesn't help, if it where physical bullying I could handle it as I am not the smallest person and I can take a lot but mental bullying with a mental illness is never a good mix. I just want the pain of living to go, I know at 14 I have my hole life ahead of me and what not but at this point I don't see my life lasting much longer. I just have one question to the people who read to this far, it is 'what does life feel like without depression' I ask myself that on the daily but I can't answer it because I have forgot. If u could answer that I would be very grateful.
Thank you for reading.
