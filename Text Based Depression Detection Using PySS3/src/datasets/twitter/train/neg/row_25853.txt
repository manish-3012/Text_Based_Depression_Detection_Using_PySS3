[17m] I think I might kill myselftldr: fuck my "life"

I'm 17 years old and in high school (grade 12) right now my grades are falling fast even though they need to be high to get in a decent college. I'm probably not gonna get into college let alone get my High School Diploma. I'm lazy, pathetic, and probably worth more dead than alive. I'm running out of reasons to keep living.

I also happen to have a pointless crush on a girl in one of my classes. Which makes me even more lonely than I already am. It's stupid because we haven't even talked to each other yet because she's on the other side of the room and I'm too introverted/socially awkward to approach her. I'm constantly dealing with self loathing because i'm cowardly and inadequate It feels like every day I consider killing myself. At school I have several projects due that I haven't even started yet. Oh and I also have a major test that I haven't studied for. Why? My own fucking laziness. I'm scared that i'll never amount to anything and I consider suicide but then I feel like a coward and i feel even worse. It's like i'm in this weird cycle of wanting to kill myself and then feeling guilty and pathetic because it would hurt my immediate family if I actually went through with it. Then again I will just be a disappointment to them if I decide to keep living. 

Someday's I have no motivation whatsoever, yet for some reason I force myself to keep going to school even though i'm just a waste of space there. My mediocre "life" is falling apart before my eyes. I just want my life to be over. I'm running out of reasons to live. I'll probably kill myself before the year is even over.

edit: I'm not sure why I even bothered posting this here. Nobody cares anyways.

edit 2: forgot to mention that i'm addicted to porn/masturbating. Ugh i'm so fucking disgusting.
