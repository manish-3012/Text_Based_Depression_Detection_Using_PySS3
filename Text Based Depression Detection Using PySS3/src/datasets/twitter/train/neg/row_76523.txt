I hate this worldI hate this world. I hate the people in it. I hate everything. The world continues to become a shittier and shittier place on a damn near daily basis. Yeah there's all kinds of happy videos for people to share but far more acts of violence, neglect, hurt, crime, and everything negative. The bad far outweighs the good anymore. Our society as a whole is getting dumber. Yes we're making more advances but that's a select few who do it and the number is dwindling. People are more concerned about themselves and protecting feelings than standing up against real injustices or actually lending a hand or money to someone who needs it. People are caring less and less about each other. It's becoming all about attention and making yourself look good. Not to mention here in America the media is fueling race wars. On top of that everything, and I mean everything is fucked almost beyond repair at this point. The good is dying the indifference is growing, and that is terrifying too. I really don't want to live in this world anymore with the rate of which it's plummeting into the abyss. And this hasn't even been everything, this was an abbreviated version of what I feel. I hate everything.
