i wanna dieiunno

i got a gf, family, couple friends so why do i feel like this??  shits confusing
i feel like i should be more grateful anf i am so grateful i really am im very lucky to have everything in my life but just leaving it all behind dont bother me much either
i hate myself and lately i wanna die more than ever, iunno why
yea i should see a professional but im 15, i got no money and my parents wont pay for me or care to make me see someone
and i just feel so shit all the time. im a dickhead. being dickhead is bad. i try stop being dickhead but im still dickhead nontheless
and sometimes i cry myself to sleep, and its bad, no one knows how bad it gets 
i wish i could tell my girlfriend, but she would be annoyed, i wish i could tell my parents but we arent that close, i would i could tell my friends but they just dont understand
happy new years. wish i was drunk rn but i made a promise to someone i really care about, and if it werent for this person, her love and how caring shes been to me, i wouldnt be here 
 yea have a good one cya
