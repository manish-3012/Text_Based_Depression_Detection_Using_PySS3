I'm So TiredI'm not sure anyone will ever see this or if anyone cares. It doesn't really matter to me anyways, I've never really been into sharing my personal stuff. I've dealt with depression since a little girl, which is expected after being abandoned by a druggie mother and bouncing around in Foster Homes, got raped (who does that to a 5 year old), getting adopted only to have my new parents have extreme problems and my sister to begin making porn at 11, becoming a sugar baby at 17. My little brother is a super handful, dealing with some mental/delayment issues. My dad committed suicide about a month and a half ago. I've been distant with my mother ever since she sided with him on the issue of him molesting me, and lost all of my friends and my long term boyfriend, though we broke up almost a year ago. All of this is a lot. Just too much. My body doesn't even work, I have multiple health issues that leave me in constant pain. Anyways, I'm going to end it. I can't right away. I've made a prior commitment and got the lead in the school play. Can't ruin that for them. After that, well.. I'm not going to stick around.
