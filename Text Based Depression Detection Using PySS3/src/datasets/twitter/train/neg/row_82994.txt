I'm a hypocrite and I feel so badI keep telling people that "suicide should never be a solution", that "even if you can't currently see any other possibilities it doesn't mean that they aren't there", that "if you exist it already means you're enough" and such, but I'm thinking about suicide the whole day. I feel so hopeless and so worthless I don't know what to do. My words are meaningless because I don't believe them. I want to die.
