I am....a person who has every reason to do it.   But them pesky reasons not too theres just no way around.   Even if you have nobody left that would be destroyed theres still that chance that what if God is real and so is hell and people who kill themselves go there.  Or what if u botch it and become disabled is another one. Those pesky reasons force me to suffer.   How about you....
