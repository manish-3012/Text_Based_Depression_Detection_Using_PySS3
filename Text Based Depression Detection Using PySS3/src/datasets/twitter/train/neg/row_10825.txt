What if you are just plain tired of it all?I am a older woman, with a job, house, and husband that loves me. There is nothing bad or painful in my life.  I just think ahead to the 25 or 30 years of waking up, going to work, coming home, having dinner and going to sleep... and then doing it a million more times.  Slowly my body will degenerate, my mental faculties will slow down.  All of this punctuated by brief travel to other places where I wake up, walk around that other place, eat dinner and go to sleep.  Wheee.  I just keep getting the feeling it would be nice to just move on.  Maybe there is something to move on to... maybe just oblivion.  Either way Ground Hog day would finally be over.
