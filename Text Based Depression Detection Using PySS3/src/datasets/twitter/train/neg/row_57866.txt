i honestly feel like iâ€™ve wasted my life.iâ€™m 18, turning 19 in may. iâ€™ve always had health complications and been severely obese my entire life, and iâ€™m only now fixing it.
iâ€™m losing weight, dealing with my diabetes but i canâ€™t help but think that iâ€™ve wasted my entire childhood.
iâ€™ve never gone to prom, not that iâ€™d want to, but still. i never kissed anyone, i stayed home and played video games with online friends. iâ€™m transfem, and i feel like iâ€™ll never look like what i want to, i feel like iâ€™m trapped in my current body. 
and i cant help but think itâ€™s all my fault, no matter what my parents tell me, no matter what my therapist or psychiatrist tell me.
iâ€™ll be getting surgery for weight loss in May, and by 2022 May i should be a healthy weight, but iâ€™ll be 20. i feel like iâ€™ll have missed out on more opportunities by then. fuck.
