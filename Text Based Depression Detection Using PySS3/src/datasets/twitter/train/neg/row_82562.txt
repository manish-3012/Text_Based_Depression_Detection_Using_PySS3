I feel suffocatedFor a little bit of background; I'm 18- almost 19. I've dealt with reoccurring feelings of dread and suicidal thoughts and perhaps depression since around age 12- have been dealing with disordered eating and thoughts since age 10. 

Recently, some things have happened in my family... Things that are completely out of our control that have been stressing out my parents and sibling. This came with the unfortunate news that therapy is out of the question. We no longer have health insurance... But even then, I don't see the point of seeking help. I have these overwhelming feelings of absolute dread and hated for myself but the thought of speaking to others- especially family and friends makes me feel panicked. I don't want to drag people down with me. I do that enough and they're dealing with plenty. With everything that is going on, my problems are minute. It hardly seems to matter anyone because regardless of what I do it doesn't seem to help and I feel like something is severely wrong with me- like I'm a freak who can't function properly. 

Unfortunately, in the past when I've spoken to my family it's treated at if it's normal so I have no clue whenever or not I'm just stupid and overthinking it. 

I didn't bother using a throwaway; none of them know I use Reddit.
