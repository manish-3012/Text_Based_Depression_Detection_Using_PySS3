A suicidal poem thingy I wrote the other day. Might be *Triggering*.It hurts. I know..
They will tell me that I'm selfish. I have some friends, a family who loves me and a home.. Wait, home? I thought home was somewhere we all belong..
But I don't belong there, I swear. For some reason I can't seem to fit in, it sucks to be me. I wish I could be mentally there, not only physically..
But my mind is running so far away, I feel ashamed. I honestly wish I could find my place.. I'm stuck in the mess I made. I'm sorry mom, I'm sorry for being me.
I'm sorry dad, I should make you proud, not sick. So I will keep this pain to myself.. My mind feels like hell. It's trying to kill me, can you see it? No you can't.
Because I hide it too well, I'm alone in this hell. Sorry God for my words.. But I need to vent : I'm not a saint. Everything I do is wrong.. Where do I belong? Everyone seems to know where they're going, I'm stuck In time.. I'm lost in my own mind.ï»¿
