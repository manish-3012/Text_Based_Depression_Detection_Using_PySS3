was 20 days cleaniâ€™m 16 (f) never been diagnosed because my mother refuses to allow me to go see a psychiatrist. iâ€™ve been battling with thoughts of killing myself for a few years now. closest i got was trying to OD on pain killers a year ago. i ended up throwing up and pretended as if nothing happened. every now and then i get really dark. the other week i bought a rope and hung it but didnâ€™t do anything because i realized it wasnâ€™t highly enough to cause damage. instead i ended up cutting myself 5 times. which is something iâ€™ve been doing for years on and off. 
my mom has made it clear that i was a mistake and that iâ€™ve practically ruined her life. today she reminded me and yelled at me for a long time. i went to my room and just ran two blades across my arm about 3 times. 
i really either just end it now, find some pills, use the rope. whatever at this point. or just walk down to the hospital with the blood running down my arm hoping theyâ€™ll help me. at this point iâ€™ll take either.
