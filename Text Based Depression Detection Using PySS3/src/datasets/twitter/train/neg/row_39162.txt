90% of the time, I just want everything to be over with. But there is still a small 10% of an intrusive thought that I could literally just pick up everything and leave at any time.Sometimes I think about running away from everything. My life isnâ€™t bad. I have a good life. I just need to do something or this depression is going to end me. I just want to take my important things and disappear.
