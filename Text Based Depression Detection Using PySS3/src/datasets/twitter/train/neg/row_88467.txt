Probably thinking of dying in a few days timeNever had any happiest memories.It's almost always bad shit happening to me since i was in primary school.counsellors and pyschologist has not been any help to me.I hope to jump off the stairs and maybe hit my head,seems less scary that falling off a building.The world is too much for an autistic person like myself.It's been 10 years of this,i can't take it anymore.nothing is working for me.
