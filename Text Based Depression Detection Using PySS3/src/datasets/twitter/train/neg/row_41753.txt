This is hardHi,

I donâ€™t really know where to start. I havenâ€™t slept in months. Maybe years. 

My girlfriend is supposed to come over tomorrow. Sheâ€™s been worried about me. She wants to break the lockdown to come see me.

Iâ€™m not sure I can make it the next couple of hours till she gets here. I cracked maybe 2 days ago. Iâ€™ve been in and out of break downs and psychotic delusions.

I donâ€™t want to be alive. Not that I donâ€™t feel like I deserve to be alive or that I feel nobody will care if I die. I just donâ€™t want to do this anymore, I donâ€™t want to wake up, and I donâ€™t want to struggle to go to sleep. 

Iâ€™ve tried so much. I was a champion athlete. I was a top academic. I tried going out and not going out at all. Drugs, sobriety, music, crying and being stoic. Trying to be better at my career. Trying to be a better person. Instruments, poetry, writing, research, analysis, helping others, helping myself be a better person. Trying to be kind, trying to be mean. Trying to reach out trying not to talk at all.

And Iâ€™ve done so much, so so much more than most people get to say theyâ€™ve done. 

I donâ€™t see why I should keep going. I feel maxed out. I donâ€™t see myself being any further in life. I donâ€™t enjoy anything. Thereâ€™s nothing wrong with me, or my life. A bit of baggage, some messy family history. 

Iâ€™ve been alone for weeks now. The only conclusion Iâ€™ve arrived to is that I add no value to this world. I am a danger to those I love because Iâ€™m so toxic. I donâ€™t make people happy. I donâ€™t want to keep being a wasteful source of worry for others. 

I want to die. I donâ€™t want to go out quietly. I want to fight, and claw. I want something to make me feel broken before I go. Not just life itself. Not something so simple. 

Iâ€™ve written notes or sent messages to people I love. Iâ€™ve said my final words. I feel like thereâ€™s this darkness wrapping over my eyes. I donâ€™t even know where I am anymore. I feel like Iâ€™m operating outside of my own body. 

All I want is one more hug from the poor girl who has dealt with me through to much. I just want to hold her one more time and then I canâ€™t go. 

Iâ€™m so tired. Iâ€™m so god damn tired.
