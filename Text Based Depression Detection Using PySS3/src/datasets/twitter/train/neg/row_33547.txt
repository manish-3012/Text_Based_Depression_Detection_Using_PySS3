I really need help to save someoneIm not sure if this is the best place, but a friend of mine contacted me that another friend send him a text which seems to be a suicide note. So far he isn't responding and neither i or my other friend know what we should do, since we only know him over steam, no personal information, nothing.

His Steam bio also sounds frightening to me and his profile pic is from a band called "Death Grips".

&gt;I don't know where to go

&gt;And no one else seems to know.

&gt;What if my reason for living is to find my reason to live?

&gt;How are you going to trust somebody when you don't trust yourself?

&gt;Cause you satisfy my heart

&gt;Even though we'll fall apart

&gt;Why get a dog? It's just gonna die

&gt;Everything you love's just gonna leave you one day

&gt;And that's just real shit he can still spit

&gt;But what's the point?

&gt;I said a lot of stupid stuff

&gt;I think that I was growin' up


I just want to prevent someones death.
