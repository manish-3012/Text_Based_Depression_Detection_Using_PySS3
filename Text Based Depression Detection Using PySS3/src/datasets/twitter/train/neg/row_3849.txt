Why do therapists/shrinks SO often phrase questions in ways illicit specific answers?"Now... I \*have\* to ask...

You're not suicidal, homicidal, or hallucinating - are you?"

The specific verbiage/phrasing varies, but I've had variants of this question asked by multiple therapists and psychiatrists. Asking these questions makes sense, certainly - but combining them together as if they're congruent seems flawed thinking. 

For me? I've had a LOT of suicidal thoughts/thinking for a long time, but never any homicidal thoughts or hallucinations. But the way the questions frequently get smashed together just feels like it equates all three lines of inquiry, overshadowing any attempt to respond with nuance or detail.

Suicidal ideation is common, but if you're presented the 'opportunity' to admit to suicidal thoughts in the same breath that suggestions of homicidal violence &amp; hallucinations are discussed? How....does that \*possibly\* bode well?

Is it a matter of shrinks/therapists looking to get answers as quickly as possible, focusing on the time-costs involved? Or is it just a matter of convenience that serves no practical purpose?
