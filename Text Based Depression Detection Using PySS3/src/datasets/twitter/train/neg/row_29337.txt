When there is no one to blame.. You blame yourself.I can't sleep right now..  Been in bed almost an hour..  I told her I would do anything but words aren't enough. What you need are actions to have already happened that haven't. I feel stuck in a loop. And no one really cares to listen. Being in need of help is weakness so I can't ask facebook. But right now this feeling of not having anyone is soul crushing.  Especially when I'm suppose to have someone to talk to when ever I need them for the rest of my life. It fucking hurts.  No one needs to worry today... I'll get to sleep eventually and when I wake up hopefully the reset button will have worked.  But why do we always think about taking the easy way out when the rough times get rougher?
