I cannot live with who i am and who I have becomeIt is really going to be a struggle to write this as I have never confided this deeply into anybody. I have tried talking to therapists but it is hard opening up to them when so much my life is so shameful.


Right now I feel as though am at the crossroads. I cannot logically see why I should continue living on and I come in hopes that you can convince me otherwise.


I am going to summarize my life to help you get an understanding of how I got to this point. Let me start at the beginning:


-My parents were both immigrants from an African country who came to United States in the 80's. They gave birth to my two older sisters before my mother went to Canada to pursue a degree while my father worked in the US. I was born in Canada immediately after my mother got there, and was raised there with my two older sisters. I never actually met my father in person until we moved back to the United States with him when I was 6. Because of this, I never had developed that crucial bond with him at a young age. We never went fishing together, threw a ball in the yard, or did any other of those father-son bonding activities that build a relationship. So to me, he has always felt much more like a step-father than my actual father.


-Growing up, my father was a dictator in the house. Our relationship was cold. There was no "I love you's" or "I'm proud of you's" ever. We would never speak unless there was an imminent purpose to do so. I would get physically beaten to a pulp for getting mediocre scores in elementary school. As I little kid, i had nobody my age to play with, and since both of my siblings are older sisters, I would spend a lot of time playing video games alone. Eventually,my father got fed up with me getting C's in school and took away everything from me. He took my phone, ability to leave the house, my computer access, my television privileges, and would break any game system he found in a temper tantrum-ed rage. He physically moved himself into my room and would basically monitor me as I stared blankly at my textbook for about 6 hours until it was time to go to sleep. From 6th grade to 7th grade I would come home from school, go to my room, and lie on the floor with my father laying on my bed as I would do math problems over and over or rewrite a sentence a thousand times to improve my terrible handwriting. Imagine being grounded for two years straight. This level of strangle on my life led me to become deceitful and dishonest, as i would have to lie to my parents CONSTANTLY to have any semblance of fun. The consequences of getting caught would get progressively worse and worse..... beating after beating I took until i began to fear being in my father's presence.


-Now, fast forward to my sophomore year in high school. I was becoming visibly depressed so my mother forced me to go see a psychiatrist. He diagnosed me with ADD and suggested i start taking medications for it. However, my father was strongly opposed to taking stimulants as he claimed the side effects were not worth it and that I just needed to try harder in school.


-Later that sophomore year, I made the first major mistake of my life. I had a friend at the time, and we would sneak out of our houses at night after my father went to sleep, meet up and go sneak into our old middle school to play video games together. We would steal candy from teacher's desks, have rolling chair races around the hallways, and play basketball in the gym. This went on for about a month until one day, like an idiot, I wrote Nigg*r on a picture of MLK as a joke/troll to stir up some controversy. They ended up checking the cameras so we got caught and I had to go to an alternative school for the rest of my sophomore year. 

-It was at this point I found out that my father had given up on me. He called me to his bedroom where I found him, my mother, and my sisters exchanging in a heated argument. It was at that very moment, he told me directly to my face that I was no longer his son and that we were to never speak again. He told my mother that he was done with me and that I was her problem now.

That put me on verge of committing suicide but my mother convinced me that I could prove my father wrong, make something of myself, and that the future would get better now that my abusive father was out of my life. Looking back, I really wish I had gone through with it as I have caused nothing but grief and stress for my mother since that moment. Had I done it, my mother would have surely gotten over it by now, would be retired, and would be back in her native country like she tells me she wants to do when she retires. Instead, the next two years of high school were spent massively gaining weight (went up to 300LB), being isolated at my room playing video games with online friends, while still awkwardly and tensely sharing the house with my father. 

-I managed to get into a Mid-Tier level college about two hours away from where I lived. Me and my roommate (who was this rich snobby white kid that I randomly got paired up with) didn't get along (admittedly I was a slob) and he ended up ratting me out to the police for having weed in our room. I got suspended for a semester, but I ended up being able to return the next year (however i lost now the ability to receive federal financial aid because of my marijuana charge). I got into a fraternity (which looking back was more due to them looking for a black guy than for my personality). I was starting to lose weight (went down to 230LB). Things were looking better. This may have been peak of my life.

-Or so I thought..... After I joined a fraternity, i thought it would help me become more social-able, but in reality, it just made me more aware of just how much of a loser I really was. All my fraternity brothers were swimming in females and despite this, I wasn't getting any. Not even close. In fact, I became a laughing joke amongst my brothers after i got "walked in" on while I was losing my virginity to the ugliest (hideous face but a decent body) and most desperate girl in the Quad using my embarrassingly small penis. I went to our formal alone because I couldn't get a date..... I was becoming more and more depressed..... and desperate.... and weird.

-It was at this point I made the biggest mistake of my life. I went into the girls bathroom in my dorm and recorded a girl coming out of the shower. It was an impulse decision and you don't know how much I look back and wish I had just rubbed one out instead. Long story short, she saw my phone from underneath the shower stall, freaked out and called the cops on me. I denied the whole thing and came up with a story of how that I was late to an exam, needed to take a shower but all the mens bathroom stall were occupied, and that my phone was just sitting on the floor next to my clothes. I deleted the video and after they conducted a half-ass search on my phone, they found nothing. It turned into a "he said/she said" in which the university found me innocent, but the justice system found me guilty. To this day I still have to deny this, to protect my mother and family from the shame that it holds. This is what has been killing me the most inside. At the time, my mother and sisters acted as though they believed me and fully supported me, but I deep down inside i know that they had their doubts. I ended up spending a month in jail, and to be honest, i did not mind jail. It was nice having some people to talk to and being able to play cards all day.

-If this girl I am referring to happens to read this and is able to deduce that this story is about her, words cannot do justice for amount of remorse I have for what I did. I am forever sorry for the pain I must have cause you. I don't know what ended up happening to this girl, but I would assume she probably had to change universities and more than likely no longer has trust in society/men anymore. I'm sorry, I truly am. However, i know you will never forgive me, and frankly, I haven't forgiven myself for that either.

-If there ever was a moment in my life I truly wish I could have rewritten, that would have been it. But I cannot, and those actions will always reflect who i am (or was at the time) for the rest of my life. Forever, I will have to live with the fear that any new person/friend might google my name, see my mugshot of my arrest, and instantly will want to disconnect me from their life (and rightfully so).

-Back to the story: The next year, ended up I went back to the same mid-tier college, since they did not find me guilty. This time I was staying in an apartment off campus that my mother was paying for while I went to school. Again, I became depressed due to the isolation, stopped going to classes, and ended up failing all of my classes that semester. How could I do this to my mother? What the fuck is wrong with me.

-After a year off from school, I went to a psychiatrist and was able to attain an adderall prescription. I have been going to community college for 3 semesters now and I have made nothing but straight A's.
I know community college is way easier, but the adderall has really made a difference and has allowed me to actually focus and get my schoolwork done. But I'm afraid its a little too late now......

-Even if i get through college now, it is more than likely I wont be able to get a job anyway because of my criminal record now. My only chance is as an entrepreneur, but I barely even have had the work ethic to make it through college, let alone start my own business. I can take over my mother's transportation business, but that is risky because if the board of education realizes she is no longer running it and condone a background check on me, I will lose the business. 

-Now what kills me the most is that I have been slowly have been watching my mother work herself to death to get me through college. She is 62 years old now and is still working almost 8 hours a day as well as doing most of the chores around the house that is now just me and her. Both of my older sisters have both moved out and having are having successful careers.

-I had already decided that if i didn't have my life in order by the time my mother has passed away i would kill myself. I refuse to live off my sisters and continue to be a burden on their existence. I cannot look myself in the mirror anymore, as what I have become completely disgusts me. 

Last night, I got into an argument with my mom over something insignificant. My mother told me that I am becoming just like my father and that I resemble him much more than I resemble her. The sad part that I cant just live with anymore...... is that she is completely right. I am becoming the very person I hate most........ I just want her to move on from the mistake that I was....

So any reason why I shouldn't just kill myself? I'm tired of this and my future isn't going to get brighter with this criminal record under my belt. I am a creep, a loser, and I have been nothing but a burden my whole life. Nobody would cry if i died apart apart my mother and sisters, and I think that the stress it would relieve, would far out way any temporary emotional grief my suicide would cause.

im about to turn 25 years old, 300 pounds, living off of my mom, with still no plan or future in sight.

I know this is very long but if you made it to the end, please any thoughts would help. I dont see any real answer but suicide here.
