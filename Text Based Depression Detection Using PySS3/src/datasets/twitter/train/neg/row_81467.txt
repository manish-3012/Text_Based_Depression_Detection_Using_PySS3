Just donâ€™t know anymoreThis year ya been rough on millions of ppl. For that, I know Iâ€™m not alone but yet I am. 

Found love in a different city in 2019.

Quit my job (made decent money) and moved 100 miles away from my mother (my best friend in life and she had heart failure), my friends and family in 1Q of 2020. 

My mother died in May, (still unemployed) and now Iâ€™m over $6k in debt from unemployment benefits payback. A year ago none of this existed other than being lonely. I was good with my job, friends and family.  Now I donâ€™t have anything left except my new relationship. 

Iâ€™ve brought this all on myself, short of my mother passing. Iâ€™m out of energy and options now. Never imagined Iâ€™d be posting here but I here am.
