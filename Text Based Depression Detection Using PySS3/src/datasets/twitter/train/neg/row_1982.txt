A little story of a long lost friend, gone nowSo earlier this week I found out that one of my long lost pals from elementary school died. I don't even know if we were really friends, but that's besides the point of me writing this. It's just kinda been bugging me this week... other's from my childhood have died, but he was the first one that I actually really knew. I don't know what happened, I think it might have been self inflicted but I'm not sure. It probably doesn't matter either. But there's a reason I'm writing this. A Facebook page was put up for him and I can't believe how many people are coming out of the figurative woodwork to say their goodbyes. Even me... I probably haven't talked to him in 20 years or more, but I had a story to share. It's very touching reading everyone's thoughts and it makes me a little sad that he's not here to read them. That he can't tell just how much he was loved.

My point is that if you are feeling like it's hopeless and that nobody would miss you if you were gone, they would. It might be your best friend or someone who you played with a few times as a kid and haven't thought about since. We still think about you and want you to know how much you have meant. Give us another chance to say nice things **to** you instead of **about** you.
