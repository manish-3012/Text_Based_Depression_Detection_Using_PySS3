Tried to overdose myself and woke up. Nobody checked on me and my friend scammed me out of money.I'm at a loss of reason. I tried taking four times the recommended amount of my sleeping medication and feel awful. I tried to go outside and ran into a colleague who told me my friend that I work with has dropped out of a project that there is no chance I could do without them. They were the brains behind the operation so now I'm likely to lose my job. Plus I was paying most of the expenses to get reimbursed and my receipts at the office are gone. So I'm out at least $800


I've been having these feelings for a while now. For months since I've started my career, a feeling that nobody would care and most would be better off if I was gone and this shows it. 

Why did I have to wake up? I don't have the guts to try it again. In the past 3 months, my friends of many years have left me. I was an idiot to tell people about my issues because that just made them leave.

I don't know what I'm going to do anymore because I have no reason to continue. Everything I cared for is gone now, anyting that meant anything to me. Everything waiting up to this is just been so much and now I get to wake up to losing my last friend and likely my job.

I promise I will read everyone's post but I don't think I have the strength to reply.
