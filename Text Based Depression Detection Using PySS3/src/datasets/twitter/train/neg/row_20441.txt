Can someone tell me if I will be okay, please?I forgot my password to my other account but that doesn't matter. 

So I'm 16, 136 pounds, and 5foot'9 in height. I took around 14-17 pills of 500Mg Acetaminophen within 5 hours.

I fell asleep for quite awhile but my stomach is in so much pain when I woke holy shit. I thought I could handle it. Pretty dizzy too. I was confident in my choice until the past hour or so. I'm getting scared. I just want it to be Friday so I can chill and watch Steven Universe with my sis.
