I feel so alone. I feel like I canâ€™t do this anymoreMy mom ignores me all day and we talk once a day despite living in the same home. My only friend and I feel like the only person who genuinely cares about me is my boyfriend but at the same time I feel like he cares more about the attention I give him more than who I am as a person. Iâ€™m 17 now, The older I get the more my moms past addiction makes sense. Iâ€™m remember trauma I used to never think about. I saw a video of someone nodding out and cried and cried for an hour. I feel like Iâ€™ve been obsessing over it trying to research more and more about heroin because knowing more about it makes the trauma make more sense because I was too innocent to understand it in the past. Anytime I talk to my mom about it she gets mad and says Iâ€™m trying to make her feel guilty. I just have no one else to talk about it to. Sheâ€™s been clean from heroin for 2 years but I feel like I never fully processed it. Everytime I think about it I cry. And I know my step dad is doing stuff still too, I saw him smoking heroin in the hall once and my mom thinks heâ€™s doing coke now too. My boyfriend is my only friend and I feel like I donâ€™t belong in my own family. I skipped class and fucked up my credits sophomore year because I got in the wrong crowd so Iâ€™m doing an online diploma thing soon but I feel like I have no future. I feel like my eating disorder has gotten so much worse during quarantine too and I donâ€™t know how to fix myself. Me and my mom got in a horrible argument today and I feel so horrible. She says things that she knows will break me. I feel like the only reason I havenâ€™t ended it is because I know it would lmfao INCONVENIENCE everyone basically. I have shitty social skills my mom thinks Iâ€™m on the spectrum I never had many friends at school I always feel so alone. My mind is racing everywhere. I feel so alone. Iâ€™m a fucking burnout. I feel like everyday gets worse. I have no one. I wish I could just cry on my moms shoulder.
