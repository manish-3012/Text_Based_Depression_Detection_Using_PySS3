I'm not sure how I am supposed to be preparing for my upcoming GCSE's when everything just seems to be so shit* Toxic and failing friendships. Honestly don't feel like I have a 'true friend'.
* No longer have any ambitions or drive.
* Feeling like I don't fit in anywhere. (found out I'm an INFP so that's pretty neat)
* Boring personality, school has honestly taken it all out of me.
* Having the live with the feeling of being a disappointment to my own parents and society itself.

I just want to escape my responsibilities. Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
