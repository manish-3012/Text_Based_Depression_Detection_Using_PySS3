Here again, againI recently made a huge move (back to my home country for a few months) and have a lot of new stresses in my life (new boyfriend - long distance as well) and still have all of my old stresses like IBS and crippling mental health issues like depression and anxiety. 

For the last 3 days I have been in the deepest darkest depression I have ever been in! I have constant fear, sadness, jealousy, difficulty breathing, and have stopped eating. The only thing I can think about is ending it, and the only thing keeping me from doing it is the guilt, which in turn adds to my frustration. 

I have tried looking for a therapist in my area and they are all hella expensive and over booked for weeks. I cannot talk to my family, friends or boyfriend as they either lack the knowledge or sympathy to be there for me. 

I don't know what to do...all the things I normally do to get my self out of the darkness are not working this time. 

A big trigger is my new relationship and the accompanying jealousy that came with it...I constantly think about my boyfriend cheating (because he went out with another guy for dinner and drinks), and even though he assured me that he didnâ€™t and I believe him (in the rational part of my mind) the irrational part of my mind tells me to dig and stalk and look for evidence that he is lying (and as luck would have it I found some substantial at best evidence that it might have happened, so now I am even more crazy about the situation). 

I am trying to get help and I cannot find it! I donâ€™t know what to do!
