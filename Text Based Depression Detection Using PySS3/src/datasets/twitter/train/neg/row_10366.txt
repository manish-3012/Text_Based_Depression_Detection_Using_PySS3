I feel like a burden.I feel like people don't want me around. I know it must be wrong, but sometimes I just can't get the thoughts out. I used to have depression, and I've felt good for so long, and then it just hit me today; first the worry that they don't want me there, then a feeling of nothingness. 

I don't really know what else to say, I feel so dim, like nothing. I am supposed to spend the weekend camping with a group, I don't know if I can make it through those days around people like this.
