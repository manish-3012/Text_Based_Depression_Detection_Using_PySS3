Trying to hang onMy life is nothing like I ever thought it would be.

I failed out of college with crippling student loans. I'm finally opening my eyes to the fact that I'm in a controlling and abusive marriage. I'm a stay at home mom with no income of my own, no friends, and no family nearby. I've isolated myself to try and keep my husband from accusing me of cheating. I dont even take my son to the library or playground out of fear of those accusations. I literally just wake up, take care of my toddler and the chores, go to bed, rinse and repeat.. every day. I have no purpose in my life. I feel absolutely worthless. If my husband left me, I'd have nothing. No money let alone anywhere to live. I'm pretty sure he'd take my son away from me due to being "mentally unstable" thanks to my bipolar depression. 

I don't know why I'm alive anymore. I've been thinking of suicide almost everyday for the past month. I'm so tired.
