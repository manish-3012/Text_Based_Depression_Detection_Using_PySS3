Shit just got realIt's the first time I ever got so close to doing it, shit just got real and I can't take it anymore. I have money related problem but I couldn't care less about those things, I also have problem with my tooth and I don't have the money to get it repaired but those are just little annoyances adding to the fact that my life is miserable. All I ever wanted was just to have a social life and have friend, without feeling rejected and acwkdward everytimes. I just came to the conclusion that things will never get to be like I wanted, I missed so much of what is supposed to be part of the human experience. This shit got even more depressing when I found out that the only girl I ever got close to be in relationship with, now have a boyfriend. Don't tell me shitty phrases like "things will get better", I already waited all those years wishing I would someday find my way. Now I'm 29, getting close to 30 years old and nothing seem to change. Do I have a job? Yes. Do I enjoy it? More or less, but the fact is that loneliness just came back with a revenge.
