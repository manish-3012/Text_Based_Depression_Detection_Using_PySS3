DreamNever really thought like it would get to this.
Past 11 years went by normally. A happy kid.
Nothing in the world to worry about. 
This one was different some how.
You didnt even know what suicide was. Much less thinking of doing it.
You didnt think that you were about to experience it.
See your lifeless body hang from the ceiling.
Your parents screaming and crying hysterically. 
You never thought that you wanted that. Maby you didnt.
It's going to be to late now. Cant take it back. Pretending it was all a dream. 
At your funeral that say 12 was to young.
I say. That's my decision isnt it?
