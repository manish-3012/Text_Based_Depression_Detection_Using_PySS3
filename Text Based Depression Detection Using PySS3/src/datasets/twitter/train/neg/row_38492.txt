I can't do life right nowI'm ending it. I'm offing myself. Moving was hard enough, dysphoria made it all 10Ã— worse, depression amplified it to the max, and a breakup broke the camel's back. I have nothing, I have no one, it's all a waste of time, I'm a waste of time. I'm going to overdose on my old antidepressants, wish me luck.
