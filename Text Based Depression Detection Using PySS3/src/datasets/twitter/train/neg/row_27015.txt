Hard to find reasons to keep goingThree months or so into college, and quite honestly convinced I can't take anything more. I feel so alone constantly, even around people, and as if I'm not meant to be happy.

Schoolwork feels like a chore less a joy, which wears further on my patience for what feels like my endless stupidity.

I seem to be little but a nuisance to my girlfriend, and I feel like she always ends up feeling hurt when we're together.

Sometimes it just becomes apparent that nobody is happy when I'm around. I feel like a drag on everybody, and I just can't do it anymore.
