I want to disappearMy mother is convinced I owe her something for giving birth to her; however, she doesn't help me get around, I feed myself out of pocket, I haven't asked her for anything in a long time

I don't expect anything from her so I merely desire the same philosophy from her

But she calls me disrespectful and rude and I don't understand because there's nothing I can do to make her see from my point of view

I only have two good friends, and one of them is my girlfriend, who I am drifting farther and farther away from and it really hurts because I honestly love her so much that the thought of us ending up apart is killing me inside as I write this

I'm disillusioned by the current state of society and decided long ago that if I can't survive doing what I love, I'd rather be dead

Everything is falling apart around me and I feel like everyone is just trying to get rid of me

I don't really know if I want to kill myself or what but it's really painful to be alive right now and i just need some help
