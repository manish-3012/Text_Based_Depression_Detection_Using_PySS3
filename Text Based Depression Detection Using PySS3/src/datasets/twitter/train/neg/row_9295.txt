University makes me want to kill myselfI'm at University in the UK, my second year out of three. I have Depression, of which I am taking medication for, and am on the highest safe dose for myself. I have a resit to do, and I'm working on it, but everything seems to be going wrong. The base work (from the teacher) is broken to hell, and it can't be fixed. My deadline is tomorrow and all I can think about is how ending it all would make it a hell of a lot easier than trying to finish this stupid work.

I don't know if I can cope. But the university doesn't care, they just want the work in.
