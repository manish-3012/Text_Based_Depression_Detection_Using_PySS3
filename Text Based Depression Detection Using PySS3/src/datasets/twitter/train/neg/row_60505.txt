I make everyone around me miserable and everything I do ends up making things worseIâ€™ve tried so many different things. Iâ€™ve tried multiple medications, Iâ€™m going to therapy regularly, Iâ€™ve tried different strategies to manage my anger and mood swings and nothing works. Iâ€™ve ruined every relationship Iâ€™ve been in, constantly hurt people around me, every job I work at I call in way too much even though aside from one abusive boss they arenâ€™t that bad. Iâ€™m just miserable and I make everyone else miserable and I need out. I canâ€™t even coherently write out everything, but Iâ€™ve constantly felt at my absolute lowest and it gets lower every year and I know I canâ€™t get better. I just want to be gone so the world can be a slightly better place
