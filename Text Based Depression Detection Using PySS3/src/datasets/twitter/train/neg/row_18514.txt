I never have wanted to kill myself more.I'm suffering so much. I feel like it's just one thing after the other. I just think the future is just more shit just waiting to happen to me. So what's the point? 

My boyfriend of over 2.5 years broke up with me earlier this week. On top of breaking up with me, I found out I'm pregnant yesterday. On another note, my bird of 15 years died yesterday too. 

I just feel so low. 

I feel like I could never be loved. 

I feel so alone.
