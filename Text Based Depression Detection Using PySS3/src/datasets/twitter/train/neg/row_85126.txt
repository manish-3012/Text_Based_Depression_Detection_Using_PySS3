Iâ€™ve decided that tonight will most likely be the lastI just canâ€™t take it anymore. Iâ€™m tired of all the pain. Iâ€™m tired of all the headaches. Iâ€™m tired of everything. Iâ€™m just tired of everything. 

Iâ€™ve finally decided that tonight Iâ€™ll try to make it the last. Iâ€™ve been trying for so long to do something right. Iâ€™ve made people happy and Iâ€™ve made some sad or mad. But no one has made me happy for more than a few seconds. Iâ€™ve also have never experienced a worse point in my life that Iâ€™ve ever thought of. 

My whole life feels like 50 years but itâ€™s only been 12. Iâ€™ve been trying so long. My dad is in prison for years. My mom might go to jail. I donâ€™t know who I can trust anymore. I havenâ€™t seen my stepmom in months. I canâ€™t even trust my mom. 

Iâ€™ve tried telling others of the pain Iâ€™m in but no one cares to do anything. Iâ€™ve experienced headaches everyday over and over and Iâ€™ve tolerated them until I talk about it after it becomes almost to much but no one cares. 

So this maybe my last night here and the only person who had no clue what was going on was actually the biggest help of all. My time here has been hell so Iâ€™ve decided to try to end it once after all after all the thought of it. Iâ€™ve decided to cut myself right down both on my forearms. If I survive this or decide not to Iâ€™ll update this with what happens. 

So this is it not. Bye.
