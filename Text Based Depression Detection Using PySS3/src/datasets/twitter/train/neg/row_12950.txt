I feel like I'm a toxic poison to my familyI've been depressed since childhood. I'm seeing a psychologist but I feel like all I do is cost my parents money for that. I feel like a funeral would be cheaper and my death would be easier to get over. I have a toddler and my husband is constantly pointing out how bad of a mother I am. If I go now while he is still young maybe I won't fuck him up. I don't even know why my husband married me.
I've wanted to die since I was a young teenager and people keep stopping me. I'm scared to do it though. I just spent a half hour looking at ways to kill yourself on a different subreddit. I don't think I'm supposed to feel this way but after spending half my life in therapy and on meds I don't think it's going to change. I just don't know what to do anymore.
