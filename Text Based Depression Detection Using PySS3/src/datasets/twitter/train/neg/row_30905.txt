I don't have the guts to do it and I'll never have themI thought about it so many times, I tried it multiple times, I harm myself, but I can't step any further. 
And it makes me feel so weak and vulnerable.
 But it scares me so fucking much, that I can't commit. 
What if I survive?
 I don't even have the guts to kill myself. 
It makes everything just worse, I feel pathetic and I am pathetic.
 I hope y'all feel better than me. I definitely have too much time to think about this
