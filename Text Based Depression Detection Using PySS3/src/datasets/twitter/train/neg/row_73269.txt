Canâ€™t even get dying rightJust tried hanging myself in the wardrobe. Head started swimming and I backed out. Throat is aching and has a big red ring around it. Just keep fucking everything up. Wish I wasnâ€™t such a coward. My mum tells me not to let fear hold me back. If Iâ€™d taken her advice Iâ€™d probably be dead right now. This is probably why most people commit when drunk or on drugs. 

Until next time.
