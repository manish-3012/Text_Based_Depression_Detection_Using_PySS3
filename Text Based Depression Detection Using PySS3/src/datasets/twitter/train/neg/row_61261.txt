I'm Giving UpI'm just done.  I'm worthless, and I'll always be worthless.  No matter how hard I try, there's just no getting around it.

I spent the last 4 and a half years alone and in and out of depression, and finally when I think things might start to go right, I just fuck everything up.  I meet someone more important to me than my own life, and somehow I manage to make her think that I don't care about her at all.  All I do is spend every waking moment worried about her and how she's doing, but I don't care about her.  I'm just another worthless scum that's going to mistreat her in some way and make her feel worthless.  I'm truly sorry from the bottom of my heart that I ended up making you feel this way.  Not that it matters anymore, but I truly loved you more than you'll ever know.

I just wanted to make someone happy, to be there for them no matter how tough things got, but I failed.  I can't even do something as simple as that.  I don't deserve to be on this planet.  I don't deserve anything but death.  I need to just end it before I end up hurting someone else that comes along, not that there ever would be anyways.  Who the hell would want to actually be with a loser like me?

Anyways, peace out reddit.  Post away about how I'm wrong and this isn't the answer.  I'll sit back and laugh at each one of them while I'm slowly draining my body of blood.
