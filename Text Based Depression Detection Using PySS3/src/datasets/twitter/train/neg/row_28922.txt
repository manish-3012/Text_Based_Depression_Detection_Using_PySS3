Feeling trapped.I'm a 20 year old male.  All my life I've had this feeling that everyone around me dislikes me. This causes me to always feel trapped and distant from people i know and people i want to meet.   When i speak i feel like no one ever listens,  I'm always asked to repeat what I've just said or they just stop listening entirely. This causes me to lose sleep over being such an useless idiot.  I often contemplate suicide,  I just feel alone and that if I died it would just be easier.  I doubt i would be remembered for much longer than a month.
