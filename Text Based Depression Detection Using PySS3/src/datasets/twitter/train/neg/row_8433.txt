I'm going to kill myself...
I've already decided, just dropping in to say goodbye. 
I'm tired of all this crap that life insists on throwing at me. I'm tired of losing everyone and everything I actually let myself care about. 
I don't care if I hurt my family; they've hurt me for as long as I can remember...
I have little to no friends to hurt. 
One has a boyfriend to help her through it, and we're hardly close at all anymore. 
I've been waiting for my life to get "better" and been trying to "make my life better" for almost 4 years now. 
And guess what? NO IMPROVEMENTS! 
I can't talk to anybody, even if I want to. 
I'm sick of being expected to put up with the shit this life trows at me..
I'm afraid and i keep cutting myself because i deserve pain.
I'm in therapy and it has done nothing. 
I take sleeping medications and i abuse them every night.
I know that if I live, The emotional pain will just get worse
Suicide seems like the best route to me
