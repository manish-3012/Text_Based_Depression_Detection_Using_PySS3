I just don't knowIt's taken me a while to even bring up some courage to post here but here I go. I'm a 19 year old male that for the better part of about 4 to 5 years has been struggling through depression and suicidal thoughts. I don't exactly know why I feel this way but I do. The worst part is that during spring and summer I thought to have gotten over it. I was finally happy and I was actually able to get my life on track.
Even when I started going to University I was enthusiastic and happy but now I just don't know it hit me like a sack of bricks. Academically I do well and I even fell for a girl but I just don't know anymore.
