Just another day..As I sit here I am once again contemplating suicide. Nothing different from usual. Just like all the other times I will probably not go through with it. It doesn't help that this is the second time typing this since I accidentally closed the tab :/ Everything has become too much of a burden lately. Not even my usual emotional problems. School has once again become too much for me. It doesn't help that I have to deal with my parents calling me while drunk and telling me that I will never graduate. That I will fail out. That's a lot to handle when it comes from the only people that should be encouraging you. I believe they are right. My grades are slowly going down. As I type this I have a test in two hours that I am likely to fuck up. I can't handle the thought of failing. I'd rather end my life than fail school. This depression is so heavy and exhausting I need a rest.I know you will come here and tell me not to end it. That is why you are here. So do not worry I'm not immediately planning on ending myself. I'm waiting for winter break so I can rest and assess my situation without any stress. There are of course some serious emotional problems to handle on top of school but I will deal with those some other time. I wish you all to have the good day that I cannot.
