I Feel Like A Failure Without A FutureI don't know what I'm going to do with my life. I'm angry at the world and myself and I want to kill myself because I don't think that  have a future that I want to live. It all started when I found out I couldn't go to the college that I dreamed of going to because my family couldn't afford it. Instead I went to art school, which was another disappointment; I hated all of my classes and the people that I was dorming with. I moved back home and now my parents want me to go to a local school with cheap tuition but I don't know if I'll enjoy it there. My entire life I've tried to find a community of
people I could be part of; I've always felt lonely, and I hoped that college would help to alleviate that, but I don't think going to this shool will. I worked incredibly hard in high school to get into a good school and now I can choose between going to a great college and bankrupting my family or going to a cheap, mediocre college. I feel like all of the work that I did amounted to nothing, that I'm stuck living at home while the rest of my friends move out and have adventures in new places, that I won't find new friends at this school, that I won't have a successful career if I go there, that I won't find a girlfriend, that ultimately I'm just going to be stuck in my hometown and that my life will amount to nothing. I'm overwhelmed and I feel like nothing I do will be right for either myself or my family. I want to kill myself because I feel like a fucking loser who won't amount to anything.
