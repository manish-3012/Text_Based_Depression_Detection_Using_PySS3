Iâ€™m going to kill myself as soon as my car is fixed.Life has been degrading and painful, I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s next. 
I lost my job almost a year ago and honestly I donâ€™t really care about getting a new one, Iâ€™m on disability so I donâ€™t need to work. 
I have a boyfriend but he doesnâ€™t know that Iâ€™m depressed or suicidal and I donâ€™t want to tell him, Iâ€™m also transgender and My illness interferes with my transition.
Iâ€™m exhausted from life and angry, I came out when I was 12 and Iâ€™ve had to constantly advocate for myself since then, I diddnt Finnish highschool and I donâ€™t have many friends, I have chronic pain and Iâ€™m just ready for it to be over.
Thereâ€™s a bridge near Santa Barbara that I plan to jump off of, thereâ€™s a suicide barrier but Iâ€™m going to use my car to get over it.
