Itâ€™s time to go? (26/F)I havenâ€™t had a bad life. Actually itâ€™s been pretty good looking from outside in, but no one can see whatâ€™s inside my head. I wasnâ€™t beaten or abused by my parents or family. Iâ€™ve always been fucked up in the head though (I think with BPD). Iâ€™ve always known something has been wrong with me but wasnâ€™t able to get help professionally.  I managed it ok before she died, because she was always there to help me.

Things fell apart after I watched my mom die 2 years ago. Since then, Iâ€™ve become even more of a raging alcoholic, blew all of my money on a 1.5year â€œaround the worldâ€ trip where I had a mental breakdown abroad a few months ago. I returned back like the waste that I am to my dads, who Iâ€™ve treated like shit my whole life because Iâ€™m an awful person.  I am currently unemployed and can barely brush my teeth, alienated all friends and some family, and see no future in my life.  The sole reason why I havenâ€™t offed myself yet is my dad and some of my other family but mostly my dad.  I have a brother thatâ€™s older and also mentally ill and I havenâ€™t talked to him in years because we got in a fight started by me and my massive uncontrollable temper after my mom died.

The story is too long and complex for me to get into long details, but basically Im a failure and torn at a crossroads. Iâ€™ve lost all ambition. Iâ€™ve spent the last 3 weeks since returning to my dads researching suicide methods.  Instead of trying to make myself get better, I sit on the couch and research for hours all day every day.

Im now sober which sucks even more, because the full scale pain of just how fucked up I am in the head is coming to me for the first time in my entire life. Thatâ€™s 26 years of being a shitty person, friend, girlfriend, daughter, niece.

I donâ€™t know who I am, what I want, in fact I donâ€™t even want anything. I just want it to be over and to be with my mom. Iâ€™ve lived enough for 26 years, Iâ€™ve been in love, Iâ€™ve had a good job, Iâ€™ve traveled, and right now thatâ€™s enough for me.

Iâ€™m thinking Iâ€™ll do it in a mall parking garage. . Itâ€™s not fair to my dad to clean it up in his house. He will be sad but i think better without me. He has a wonderful new girlfriend and has moved on. Iâ€™ve tried hanging myself here and passed out once, but then woke up. After that i took myself  to a psych ward for 2 nights hoping it would help but manipulated the doc to let me out (his diagnosis was simply depression, dumb).

I guess I just canâ€™t see a reason to live, Iâ€™m just too fucked up and an embarrassing awful person. Itâ€™s not just my moms death, itâ€™s feeling so fucking sick for my whole life and only being able to cope with alcohol and drugs.
