goodbye.my life is a mess. nothing has ever gone right and will never go right. i'm a burden to my family. my friends have all abandoned me and left me to die. for good reason.

i'm leaving this note here. on fucking reddit of all places.

i hope you all can get better without my horrible existence getting in your way.

i'm sorry.

goodbye.
