Sick of constantly wanting to dieI mean, like most people on this forum, I want to die. Constantly. Even when I am happy I want to die. I am just sick of always feeling tired and not feeling like my life is mine. I work three jobs and am taking part in graduate school. I have a best friend, whom I love very very much, but constantly feel like I have to emotionally babysit. I have a boyfriend whom I love but honestly can't feel comfortable with; my fear of him abandoning me makes it hard for me to relax and enjoy our relationship. I have lost two best friends whom I can't seem to get over or forget. My father, the only supportive parent in my life, has cancer. My mother is a complete c*nt and manages to make me feel guilty for existing despite me knowing full well our damaged relationship isn't my fault. I fear all of my friends really hate me and are putting up with me. I feel like school just isn't worth it. I'm so busy I don't have time to go see a doctor, or therapist, or go to the gym (exercise makes people feel better sometimes). Despite having 3 jobs I have money problems. Almost zero me time. 

I want to die. But I'm scared of dying painfully. I want to die peacefully. I hate waking up. I don't want to feel this way.
