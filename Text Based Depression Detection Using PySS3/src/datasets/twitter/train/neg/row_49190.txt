I'm ready to goI'm ready to go, and I think I finally understood my family and friends are waiting for me to do it, and have been for a while. Only issue is that my best friend and roommate is away in New Zealand for a month, and I don't want him to walk back in from that holiday and find me. I don't want to do anything publicly, kinda wish there was a way to disappear without the clean up afterwards
