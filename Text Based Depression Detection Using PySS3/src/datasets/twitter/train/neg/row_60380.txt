Help I need to get tested for mental illness before i kill myselfIm 11 years old and am scared of death but my parents treat me like a piece of shit.They are homophobic and transphobic so when I  show emotion they say man up.They are religious (we will get in to that later).They also work helping the mentally ill.The last thing you need to know is my parents were fighting for 5 years now and got divorced a year ago (me and my sister live in 2 houses)

For me I felt terrible about 2 years ago and when my parents got a divorce I felt suicidal.1 month ago I took  a deep breath and told my mom im always stressed and suicidal.My dad is very religous so if I told him he would just talk about god being on my side.I told my mom that while they are not abusive they scream at me a lot and say we are dissapointments but then tell us (me and my sister) ok now get good grades and become rich (remeber im only 11 and she is 13).My mom said that I need to take deep breaths and remeber life will get tough but you have to keep those thoughts out your mind.

My mom in her life went through a lot of stress during the divorce in particular because she had to refinance the house and got no help from my dad.She thought of suicide one day but got over it quick with thinking god can help me.So  i said deep breaths help but it is not a cure.Word for Word I said "I think i need to get tested for anxiety."She snapped saying you control and you do not have a mental illness." This because she works with people so close to killing themself they are taken seriously or people with Schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.I took a doctors approved test from the mayo clinic saying i score 18 out of 21 on the anxiety scale and i have severe anxiety snd 20 out of 28 on the deppresion scale also severe.

My moms thinking is that people confirmed to have deppresion or anxiety have gone through things like losing a loved one or divorce witch are causes.It is also confirmed that your parents getting divorced is also a cause (which probably caused it if i do have it.)So at this point if I cant get treated why live just so i can suffer.If anyone has a way for me to mabye get therapy or even tested by a doctor please tell me in the comments.

TLDR I was open about my suicidal thoughts got rejected to get tested for a mental illness and I will takes suggestions in the comments.
