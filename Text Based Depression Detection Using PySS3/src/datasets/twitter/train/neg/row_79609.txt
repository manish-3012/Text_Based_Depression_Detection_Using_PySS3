Does anyone else hate themselves so much it's unbearable?I am not having a good day.  I needed to get work done today and four hours have slipped by and I've done NOTHING.  I cannot even begin to express how much I hate myself.  It's overwhelming.  I hate everything about myself - my appearance, my neediness, my jealousy, my insecurity, my depression, my high moods, my low moods.  Everything.  

The thought of living with myself anymore can seem like unspeakable torture, like being locked in a room with the most annoying, disgusting person I know for the rest of my life, with literally no escape.
