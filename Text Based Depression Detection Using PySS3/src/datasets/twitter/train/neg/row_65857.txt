I honesty just donâ€™t see the pointThe universe is vast and endless. We are a tiny, microscopic speck in the cosmos. Human life is so small and minuscule in comparison to the rest of existence. 

Id probably consider myself either atheist or agnostic. Either way, I feel like life itself is just some kind of weird cosmic mistake and we are all just waiting to die. But in the meantime nothing really matters. 

What actual impact am I going to make in the world? What actual change am I gong to create? None

Whatâ€™s the point in going to work, making friends and having any kind of experience when there is no real meaning to it all. 

Why shouldnâ€™t I just speed up this process? Just get it over with, ya know?
