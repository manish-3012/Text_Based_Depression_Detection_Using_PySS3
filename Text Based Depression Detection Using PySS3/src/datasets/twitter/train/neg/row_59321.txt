Don't want to live anymore. Want to escape but there's nowhere to escape to.Just look at my post history. I'm obsessed over a girl who doesn't want me. I have a loving family I don't deserve. I'm too stupid and about to get kicked of grad school. I have no skills to even get a job for when I do get kicked out. I have a huge debt from student loans that I'll have no way of paying off. I have no real friends because I don't know shit about the world so I have nothing interesting to talk about. I'm a pervert who just browses /r/sex nonstop. I even browse /r/incest from time to time because that's how fucked up I am.
