whiny little assholeI'm never good enough &gt;&lt; The C+ in chemistry is literally going to ruin my life. I feel like these fucking grades make or break my life. My dad never shuts up about them. Why aren't you studying? Are you going to get an A? You better not slack off and get a B! You should meet [nerd], he is good at [subject], you guys should spent [inordinate amount of time] studying.
	
I literally had a shit eating grin when my TA told me I was going to get an A in psych. I could feel the icy stares of the other folks in the class. They were calling me losers, a nerd, etc with their looks. Everything but saying it,you could feel the thoughts forming in their heads, the words just under the surface of their lips.

When I ask someone to hang out they all ignore me. Or give some obvious bullshit answer. "I don't have a cellphone." Their phone rings with a text. Or, "I'm busy." On facebook they have a status that they're bored. So it's obviously been to spite me, a weirdo loser.

I'm a hypocrite! Too loser-ish to hang with frat bro level folks who know a decent number of people. Too cool for losers. 

It's just busywork and stress. All stress, no play, or even a respite. Of course, I am a boring person with no interests. So maybe it's just me.

I had decided not to kill myself when I got the acceptance letter. I thought (foolishly) that I would be a new person. Ex. Actually make friends, enjoy my free time instead of just crying or bed or being severely bored. I turn 18 over the weekend. Come monday, I will be the proud owner of a ~~handgun~~ some other long gun (21 for that blargh).
