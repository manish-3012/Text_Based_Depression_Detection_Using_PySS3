Just feeling sad and sickBeen on Prozac for a month now, low dose for now.. I think itâ€™s working, but Iâ€™m eager to raise my dose. I feel sick to my stomach right now even though Iâ€™m currently with family for holidays. Iâ€™m pretending to be fine I think. I felt okay earlier, but as the night goes on, I just feel more and more dread. My mind is going deeper and deeper into dark places and I feel terrible.  So alone even in a room full of people.
