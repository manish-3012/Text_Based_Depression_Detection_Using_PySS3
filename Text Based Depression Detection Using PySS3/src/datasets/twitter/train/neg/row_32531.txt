I'm going to kill myself because I can't use my nicotineIt's the only thing I'm addicted to, and I completely fall apart without it. I used to smoke, but then I moved onto vaping (cheaper, only reason, much prefer smoking), but my vape broke (atomisers are shit) and I can't cope going through withdrawals again so I'm going to kill myself
