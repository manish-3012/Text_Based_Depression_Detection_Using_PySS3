Why do you do it? What keeps you going? what reason pulls you out of bed every morning?

Im 17, have everything going for me; one of the best schools in australia, relatively high socio-economic bracket, university is pretty much a given. I have no idea what keeps me going. Every morning I think to myself "what the fuck am I doing with my life?" I could do literally anything I want to. I have a facade of being an outgoing, very happy individual. On the inside that could be no further from what's actually going on.

Problem is I lack any goals, motivations or dreams of actually doing something. Now factor in the fucking huge amount of pressure in this lifestyle for me to actually achieve something. What is the point? 

I've been to the edge before and stopped myself because I felt bad for doing it to my family. Please tell me why you do what you do.

(sorry for the rant)
