I tried hanging myself with a belt last night but stopped myself.Fuck I wish I wasn't so much of a coward. What kind of insolent fuckup does one have to be to fail a suicide attempt. 


Idk. I'm just gonna keep living autonomously for now. I wish I was still the happy friendly person I was years ago. I wish I didn't have any problems. I wish talking about my issues won't immediately commit me to another horrible hospital or make others leave or warrant the same recycled responses.


I truly have nothing left worth living for at this point. 

Oh well. Thanks.
