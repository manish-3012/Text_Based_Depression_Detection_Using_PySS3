My friend is in the hospital from an overdose.Hello everyone, a while back I posted here about my friend. Well she found out that I knew everything, from her diary, to her school, and that she smokes and cuts herself. After that she told me she couldn't take it anymore, and then she told me goodbye. She went to the bathroom and locked herself there. I wasn't there since I am in California and she's in another state, but her cousin was there. Well when her family came home from work, they broke the door and they found an empty bottle of pills and scissors. She's in a hospital right now, I don't know what's going to happen. Will she be ok? And if she is ok, how can I help? I don't want her to suffer anymore. I want to be there for here what can I do?
