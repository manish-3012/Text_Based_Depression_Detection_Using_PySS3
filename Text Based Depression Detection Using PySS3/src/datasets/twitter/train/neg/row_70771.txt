Done.So, in short, I'm probably gonna kill myself very soon because I'm a 23yo Kissless, dateless, virgin, who just spent a very long time talking to a girl who I thought was interested in me, but eventually said she started dating someone else. I'm tired of trying. It's not getting better, it's getting worse. I just wanna blow my head off...
