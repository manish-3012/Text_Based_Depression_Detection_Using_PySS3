Had a bad LSD trip in attempt get over girl.I took LSD in hopes of getting over a girl and I had a bad trip. Seriously considering suicide and my feelings of infatuation just makes me want to cry.


I feel like I lost the light in my world after that bad trip and I feel like there's no purpose in living knowing that she will never love me.


Like what the fuck is the point knowing she will never share these feelings?


And the worst part is is that she doesn't even know my name. She probably doesn't even know that I care about her this much.


I'm a weird creepy loser.
