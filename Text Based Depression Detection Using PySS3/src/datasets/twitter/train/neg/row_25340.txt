I didnâ€™t ask to be born and be forced to live some kind of meaningful life.Do all of us really need to be here? People always say every life is precious. But do all 7 billion of us really need to be here? Weâ€™re destroying the earth, using up all its resources, killing each other. I was born into a family and now Iâ€™m forced to love them and make them happy. I donâ€™t contribute anything meaningful to this world. I would be better off gone.
