I could stay alive, but why would i want to?I donâ€™t want to get married, donâ€™t want kids, donâ€™t want a stable job, I couldnâ€™t care less about money and I have nothing holding me back. So, why then, should I stay alive? Thereâ€™s just no point to it at all, itâ€™s always the same boring shit every day. I used to tell myself Iâ€™d make a list of all the shit I wanted to do and then kill myself, but now even that seems pointless. Life is boring and Iâ€™m done with it.
