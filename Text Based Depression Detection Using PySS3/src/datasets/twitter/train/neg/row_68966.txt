I tried killing myself 3 weeks ago and I want to do it again.Sure, I have plenty of people to turn to. But where has that gotten me so far? My mom just up and left, Iâ€™m not upset about that, she can stay gone for all I care, but my little sister is just a mess and my dad now wants a divorce. 
It doesnâ€™t matter anymore. Sheâ€™s at Virginia Beach, probably staring off into the seas. Sheâ€™s never cared how her actions affected anyone else. She just uses her Bipolar as an excuse to be an entitled, whiny brat of a person. I canâ€™t stand it, I canâ€™t stand them. The only reason I havenâ€™t downed a bottle of pills, relapsed in cutting, or a million other things, is my sister.

I just want to collapse into myself and stop existing. But I just want to go, I donâ€™t even matter to my own parents. Iâ€™m just the fucked up, overdramatic, suicidal teenaged kid. I need to rot in the ground.
