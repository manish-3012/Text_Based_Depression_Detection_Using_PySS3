TikToker with AutismI don't know if this is the right place to post this, but:

I've been following this guy on TikTok for a while now. He's funny and uplifting to all people, and of course he has autism. I don't know if that is affecting his judgement, but right now he threatened to jump in front of a train and has been acting very strange on his page for a week or so. I'm starting to feel like it's a hopeless cause because he hasn't listened to any of our suggestions and compliments in his comments. \\
