Really wish I started over againI am just 18 and I'm already having doubts about whether I should keep going or not. I regret all the things I have done and all the things I haven't in my life, and I know it's barely complete but thinking about this so early, I feel as if I need to express it out there. Sometimes I wish I could start over from a certain point or even from the entire beginning but taking advantage of every second I have to make my life more enjoyable than it is today. Every time I find an ounce of joy or happiness, there is always this sadness and remorse that overpowers it and haunts me till sleep and even after I wake up.
