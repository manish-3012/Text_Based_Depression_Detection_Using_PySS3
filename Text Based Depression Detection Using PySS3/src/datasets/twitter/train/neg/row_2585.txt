Can someone give me a reason to last one more wretched week?I've never struggled so hard. Every day has been worse than the last, for 7 years. All my weeks are terrible. Next week will be like the last one. Please don't say that tomorrow may hold something that will make any of this worth it. I cannot take it. There is too much pain. I called in sick from work, and they are close to firing me because of how often I cannot come in. I need help. I've been searching for help since I was 15, and now I'm 22 and it's gotten worse. I need soothing, but healing seems like a stupid dream. Not everyone can heal from trauma. The psychs pretend there is hope but it's not always the case.
