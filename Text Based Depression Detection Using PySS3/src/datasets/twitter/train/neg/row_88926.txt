iâ€™m so terrified of not getting the help i needthereâ€™s so much i shouldâ€™ve gotten since i was younger so that i could be independent and doing better than i am now. but my parents prevented me from all that or didnâ€™t support it so i have nothing that i need.. what iâ€™ve been doing for 22 years so far isnâ€™t living at all and iâ€™m probably dying young because my health is so shit. iâ€™m trying to get help like always and i just feel itâ€™s never gonna work :( nobody will ever see me and see the help i need and try to help me.. iâ€™ve been trying on my own and i just canâ€™t. i have no one and nothing.. i just feel i should give up
