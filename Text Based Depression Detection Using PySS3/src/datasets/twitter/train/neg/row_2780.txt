does that mean you think I might as well just die too?maybe this isn't the right plaxe for this post, I don't know, please refer me to the correct place if needed - but does anyone else get hit really hard when you're talking to someone and you're talking all like "we all die anyway so why can't I just die now" and they come back with the "does that mean you think I might as well just die too?" 

I hate that I know they're right, the original statement is flawed and top full of self hate and justification and only works when you talk about yourself

but sometimes it doesn't only work then, and I hate myself for it but I also sometimes just think, hey, why don't we all just die? that would make this so much easier

i am not actively suicidal

there was no point to posting this but i had to for some reason sorry bye thank u
