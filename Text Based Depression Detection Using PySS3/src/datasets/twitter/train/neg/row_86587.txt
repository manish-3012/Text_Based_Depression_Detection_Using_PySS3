I don't know why I existAll that I've been doing in my life is making my parents stress and they eventually got a divorce. I don't know if it was about me or not but it still tears me up I'm just a big fuck up in general always being the one to blame or the next stepping stone for someone to succeed off of I just lay down every night wondering why I exist and if I die will it make much of a difference. I have never attempted suicide but I don't want to wait and see if I do
