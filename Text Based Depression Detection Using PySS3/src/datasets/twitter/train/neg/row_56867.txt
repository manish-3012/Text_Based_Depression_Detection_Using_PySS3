Was about to kill myself but realized it was probably going to be a slow death so I stoppedI was in my bed, re-thinking everything wrong with me and my current lifestyle. I was looking up ways to kill myself without making it seem like I did it on google when this thought passed through my head. What if I just suffocate myself to death with a pillow? That way, there's maybe the chance that everyone was going to take that as me dying because I fell asleep on a weird position. So I put my head on the pillow, started breathing and just waited. I was running out of air when I stopped. I assume I inhaled some carbon dioxide, seeing as I started breathing heavily when I pulled out. I guess I couldn't wait that much, would've been a very slow death. This just happened. I don't know what to do or think right now. I'm probably going to waste the rest of the night crying myself to sleep while eating garbage or smth.

Edit: Idk if I should call this an attempt? But I guess I'll have to talk about this to my therapist. Wonder what she'll say
