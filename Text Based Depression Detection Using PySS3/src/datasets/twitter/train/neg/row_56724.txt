I finally broke down and bought life insuranceAs the title indicates, I'm getting closer to the main goal. I made sure to go over the paperwork; the company that I bought from doesn't have a clause specifically being able to deny a policy in the event of suicide.

It isn't much but it will pay both my and my fiancee's cars off as well as the little bit of student loans I've accumulated. With a bit left over, it should cover portions of my unborn baby's tuition.

Next step: getting an active will.
