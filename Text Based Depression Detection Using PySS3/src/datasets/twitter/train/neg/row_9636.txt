Moving OnI'm personally not in a crisis at the moment, I just need a place to dump this to get it off my chest.

Just some background first, I've never really had any experience with suicide up front and personal. I mean, a close friend of my dad's committed suicide a while ago, but that's about it, but I wasn't there to see all the nitty gritty.

So a month or so ago, a girl on this small private Discord community I'm on comes on and heavily hints that she's going to swallow a bunch of pills. Everyone in the call was on disbelief at first, but eventually things got into a panic when we realized she was serious. I myself was shaking the entire time, I wanted to do something, it felt like she was right there but all I could do was sit and listen. She did it all over the call too. Got a glass of water, swallowed every pill one by one and counted out loud while everyone that thought of her as a friend just cried. I can't get it out of my head. I know it may seem petty but it still makes my heart sink thinking about it. She's okay now, and sure as hell seems to be moving past it better than I am. I just hope putting this out there helps, god knows I've tried, but "just forgetting" hasn't worked out.

And to anyone going through a rough spot, just know that you're never alone, as cheesy and sappy as it sounds, and that you don't have to take your life to take away the pain. Stay safe.
