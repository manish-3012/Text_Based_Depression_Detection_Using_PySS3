I think I'm getting through the worst of it. Just.... Tell me I matter, and that it's possible to get better.I gave up my dream school and changed my entire life plan for my now husband, and we are now fighting. My mental health has tanked. My parents helped us buy a house, but because of that, we're drowning in debt and I'm terrified to ask them for help getting me a therapist.

I feel so tired.

The last person I met that felt real to me, that I actually connected with, told me tonight that he can't be with my because I'm polyamorous--even though we're both openly falling for each other. So we're trying to decide if we should just end it right now, or try to pretend nothing's wrong until he HAS to end it. 

I'm only twenty three, but I feel like I have nowhere to go and I am so tired.

My house is a mess, and my husband isn't good at supporting me emotionally. And I really, really need it right now.

I don't know what to do with the rest of my life.

I want to be a writer, but it's so hard to focus and I am so tired. I want to sell romance and erotica and I am honestly trying, but I can't focus on it. I have so little drive, and my husband isn't supporting me.

I'm not crying anymore, but I still feel broken. Tell me I'm not alone?
