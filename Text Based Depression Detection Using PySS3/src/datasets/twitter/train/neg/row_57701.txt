My therapist request was rejected..After my suicide attempt, my doctor recommended I get a daily therapist. I thought "why the hell not?" 
So after searching the web and asking around my hospital (I was kept overnight for a few nights, what else was I supposed to do?) I filled out a form that is supposed to match me with a perfect therapist for my problems.. 
After a day, they told me that my problems were too severe for any of the therapists they had.. 

Whatever... I'm not gonna be here long anyways..
