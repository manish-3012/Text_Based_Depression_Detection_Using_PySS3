If it wasnâ€™t for my son Iâ€™d be deadIâ€™ve nothing but my 3 year old to live for. I know 100% Iâ€™d be dead if it wasnâ€™t for him. But lately Iâ€™m starting to see heâ€™d be better off without me. Iâ€™m a good mum, but Iâ€™m so damaged. I had a hard childhood and my boyfriend doesnâ€™t have any faith in me. Iâ€™m working but just do it to do something. Iâ€™m so sick of life, it always goes against us. My boyfriends family turned against us because of me, to my own family Iâ€™m a burden. My aunt even told me what a horrible person I am and that they only see me for my son. I just feel like nothing will change. My boyfriend always makes jokes how I have sex with other guys or want to marry other people or how we can only sleep together if Iâ€™m drunk. Iâ€™ve never cheated and never felt any of those things but they hurt me so much and make me feel so inadequate. 
How do I fix myself.
