DoneI'm not some kid with a bad break up problem. My family has turned against me. My kids don't speak to me and tell me I was a horrible mother. My own mother died. A pet I adored more than life was cruelly taken from me. I'm horribly sick and disabled. I hurt all the time. And now my grandson is being ripped from my life. I've researched all the ways to get out of this life and I really just wish I could get my hands on a cyanide tablet. Why is killing yourself so hard to do? There should be an easier way when a person is just DONE.
