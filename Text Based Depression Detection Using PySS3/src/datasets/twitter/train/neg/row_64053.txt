Ready to do itI don't want to discuss the reasons that made me do it. I just feel like I am finally ready to do it, my abusive family being one of the main reasons why I do. 
They are constantly trashing me, treating me like shit and telling me I am worthless to the point they make me self-harm. It's now the second time I have hurt myself from anger. 
I wish I could leave but I can't as I don't have a job or a place to stay. 
I am working hard to get an education but it's all pointless as long as I stay with them. 
I am ready to do it, and I want them to watch, to know what it's like to feel helpless and have a panic attack. 
Imagine the panic you experience when you see someone jumping in front of you and you know it's your fault... 
Then again, the only thing that has stopped me until now is the fear of ending up disabled or getting just way hurt (broken bones etc) without actually dying. I am scared to cause irreversible damage. You'll try to talk me  out of it but it's what I truly want and need.
