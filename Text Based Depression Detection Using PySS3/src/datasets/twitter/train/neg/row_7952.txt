Failure part 3Guess who is such a coward they dropped out of college with only 1 semester left? Me! 

Guess who made a last minute decision to do that hours ago and is moving back home with their parents like a fucking loser? Me! 

Guess who was forced to break up with their significant other because of this? Me! 

Guess who thought this would be better for them but is regretting it as i pack my things to go home tonight? Me! 

Guess whose brain is fighting tooth and nail for me to fucking end it right this second? Me! 

Guess who is an absolute fucking failure in life. You fuckin guessed it. Me.

Congratulations, depression. You win! Every decision I make doesnâ€™t matter. I will always be sad. This monster is unforgiving and relentless. The racing thoughts win, the intrusive thoughts win, the impulses win. 

Letâ€™s see how long I can put these beasts off before I probably end my boring life in my boring childhood bedroom.

Bon Voyage, friends.
