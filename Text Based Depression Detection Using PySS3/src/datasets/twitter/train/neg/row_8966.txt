I will take my life if I don't find resources to treat my mental health effectively and find housing before the end of the month.I'm homeless, indigent and haven't been able to keep a job, or a friend for the matter, in over a year. I'm frankly so out of control and self-destructive that I'm rather scared of how my behavior may affect other people, physically. Enter nihilism.  So I will take my life before I hurt anyone. I would definitely prefer not to but like the analogy goes , it's as if I'm at the top of a burning building and have the choice between a torturous drawn-out death or one that ends with a sudden stop. My previous experiences with state-funded care from a myriad of providers have been hell. I've even spoken at psychiatric survivor meetings and because of my experiences seeking state-funded care is not an option. Does anyone have any advice? Workable advice not the hang in there nonsense that we've all heard before. I have a phone bill and car payment I would really like to pay next month but I'm not going to if real solutions don't present themself soon. Certainly not looking for handouts, merely providers or locations anywhere in the country I can drive to within a couple hundred bucks of New York and garner treatment. Thank you in advance for your responses.
