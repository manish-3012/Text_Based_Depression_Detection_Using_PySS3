Almost no one knows.Almost no one knows how sad I am. My dad left me, my mother and my little sister back in march after he attacked me for a third time that year. I feel like the only real friend i'v had for the past 2 years hates me now and thinks i'm an over sensitive prick. Non of the people who acted like friends talk to me anymore. My mother is the epitome of government dependence, we are on EBT, she doesn't work, and she takes the money I get every month for having a disabled father and uses it to just get by instead of trying to improve our lives. We pay 30$ for rent every month. I can't talk to her because I honestly think she has the consciousness level of a 12 year old girl and I have a hard time trying to be around her, If I have to talk to my mother for more then five minutes I start to feel an anxiety attack coming on. My family constantly ridicules me for smoking marijuana and refuses to accept that it might be something that I need just to get by the day without crying.

No one knows I cry myself to sleep the nights that my insomnia gets to me and the doctor that prescribed me some Ambien for the month straight told me if I don't stop smoking I'll end up like my father. The only person I can feel comfortable talking to about everything is my counselor and I only get to see her for another two months because poor people insurance is a bitch.

I can't shake this feeling of loneliness and I just want the agonizing torment to stop.
