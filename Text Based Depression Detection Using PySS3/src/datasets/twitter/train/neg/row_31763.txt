Weâ€™re actually blessed, my brothers and sisters!I hope you are well. But if you struggle with depression and suicidal thoughts like myself, take comfort knowing weâ€™re actually blessed with knowledge of experiencing such emotional trials. This has thickened our skin. It has allowed us to move to a new plane of self realization. We know the pain associated with life. 

Life can be a cold, evil place. People are susceptible to evil. But evil cannot exist without good, dark needs light to exist. 

Those who travel through a tunnel of depression have been blessed to know the depths of darkness. But the light is grander than the darkness of the tunnel. 

Stay with us. Keep traveling on this journey. It truly is beautiful despite the tunnels. 

Imagine your favorite place. Smell the smells. Hear the sounds. Be taken away and just linger a while. Take a few deep breaths and relax. 

You are loved by a loving God. He has blessed us all. 

All my love to you all today!
