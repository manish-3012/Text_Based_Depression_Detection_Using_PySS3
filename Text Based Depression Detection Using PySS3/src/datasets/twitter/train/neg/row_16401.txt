My best friend just kill himselfTwo years ago, and i know i will never meet a guy like him.

I miss him. Very much. We talk about everything, played games online, steam, calls. I meet him at school, and we was like always together. Pranks, funny moments, skip class, drink a little...like, i see myself on him. But, now, this part of my life was take alway.

So difficult.
I was drepress like him with 20+, and was nice talk about this with him too.
Randomly the medications helped me, but never helped him. Now i here, live.

My last talk with him, smoking cigarrets at park,
I told him that I wish he didn't kill himself, that I would miss him. 

And this is my last text i send to him: "I know you keep thinking about suicide; I just wanted to let you know that I would like you to improve, so if there is anything I can do to help you in any way you tell me."

He killed himself some days afrer this.


I don't know why i posting this. Just taking out of my chest, i guess.
