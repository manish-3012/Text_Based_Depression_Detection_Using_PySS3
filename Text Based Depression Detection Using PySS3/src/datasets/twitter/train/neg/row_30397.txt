I just told my mother that my biggest wish is to have a gun, to put an end to myself.The last months, i've only been able to think about how much i want to take my own life. Thinking about death is the only comfort i have anymore, it will put an end to the constant recycled painful feelings inside me.
My mom asked me if there was anything i could have right now at this moment, what would it be. I said i wanted a gun, i just want out. I could not stop crying the rest of the night.
She immidietely took me to the hospital, where we could have a talk with the acute team. We were discussing about putting me in a mental institution, but they said that would just make me even more depressed. Because apperantely the patients there are "a lot worse" than i am, i'm not "psychotic" they said. And the whole thing came to one conclusion, one that i keep hearing from others over and over and over and OVER.
"It gets better."
How. How does it get better, i've been on Escitalopram for years and last year they stopped working completely. I was forced to start on Effexor, i've now been taking 300 mg Effexor for over two weeks. And i'm still sinking, nothing is of help. There is nothing. People just need to realize that life just isn't meant for everyone.
When everything that used to make me happy and laugh, now only makes me sick. How do i go on? What do i have to live for?
