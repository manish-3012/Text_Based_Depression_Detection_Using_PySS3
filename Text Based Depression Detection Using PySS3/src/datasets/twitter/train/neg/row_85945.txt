I am so lostI ruin everyone's lives and have been since I was born. I have been alone and unsafe my entire life. In spite of that I have always loved and cared about everyone and have always tried to be a good person and positive and not feel sorry for myself. Two years ago though, I was hit hard by PTSD and I had no idea what it was and now it has complete control over me. It has destroyed every aspect of my life and my person and has erased who I was completely. I am everything I hate. I now represent the abuse I've received my entire life. I deserve it now. I am selfish and not worthy of any love. I had it for a little bit from someone amazing, but I ruined that too. I have been drowning and have been fighting as best I could to stay alive. People don't see how hard I try in the face of constant terror and living as a small child in an adults body and so alone and so afraid. Full of fear and hearing all the horrible things that have been said about me my whole life (and it continues) by people that were supposed to protect me. I couldn't even get my parents to care about me at all. I was never good enough unless I was something to be used and thrown away. I am an awful person now. I hate myself more than anyone could imagine. I try so hard to be different, but there are so many times I just can't fight it and I act out of fear. I am useless and wasting space. People would definitely be better off without me around. I am only a problem and offer no value anymore. I feel so awful. 

Thank you for letting me talk here.
