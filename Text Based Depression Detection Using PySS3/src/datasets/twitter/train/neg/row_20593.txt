Need some light.I don't feel any pain. I don't feel anything. Just emptiness. I'm 26 years old, I have accomplished many things, my life is successful, I'm smarter than any people I know, I earn more than any people I know, I have everything that I want to have. I could not ask for more. I have friends, lots of them, but I still feel alone. Tonight (it's 2 am) two girls hit on me, I'm nice looking, yet I don't have a girlfriend, I don't want one. I can't love myself. I like to think that my depression comes from the fact that I quit smoking a week ago (it's been easy), but the reality is that i've been thinking this my whole life. I don't want to kill myself, I just don't have any reason to live. But i will probably still do it, this week, because I'm tired of all this. Yes, I'm drunk, yes, english isn't my first language, but I cried for the first time in years, I don't want to put this burdern on my friends, I just want to go, in silence, without anyone noticing. Just go.
