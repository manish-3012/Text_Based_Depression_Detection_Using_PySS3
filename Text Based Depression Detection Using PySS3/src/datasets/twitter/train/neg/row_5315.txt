Life is basically a absurd horror showHello.

I am an individual with chronic back and neck pain and some joint pain. I have other health issues, mental issues. 

They all combine into a being that just thinks about dying and cursing at everything. Life seems like pointless suffering and death is the end that returns my consciencousness.   


My life would basically be going to the doctor for because I can't function without them and probably gonna need medication and maybe even become physicaly disabled if things get bad enough. That is not what I want. I want to set free my consciencousness from the sufferings of just existing. 

Hopefully I will override the biological programming that DNA instils in all living beings and that is to live. Just a little longer...
