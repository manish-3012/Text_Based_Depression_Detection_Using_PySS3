unrequited love bringing me to suicidal thoughtsthis is probably going to sound really stupid

so thereâ€™s this guy. letâ€™s call him E. 
E is my best friend and iâ€™m his best friend. we hang out decently often, and our friendship is honestly the best thing i have. 
but...i am also in love with him....it hurts like hell because heâ€™s literally the cutest, nicest, most amazing guy iâ€™ve ever met in my life, and i honestly want to spend the rest of my life with him, and i care about him deeply, but i know for a fact heâ€™ll never feel the same way. 
i forgot to mention iâ€™m a male and E is also a male 
heâ€™s very accepting when it comes to homosexuality but heâ€™s straight. thatâ€™s the problem. iâ€™m in love with my straight best friend. 

the fact that i can never be with him literally hurts like no other feeling iâ€™ve ever felt in my life. i just canâ€™t take it. heâ€™s so AMAZING and it just hurts man. 

i often find myself thinking about suicide. if i can never be with such a beautiful person as him, then i donâ€™t really see the point in living, because thatâ€™s honestly the only thing i want in my life...so iâ€™m already a failure in life. whatâ€™s the point of living with all this pain? whatâ€™s the point of living if i can never truly be happy with the one person i love?
