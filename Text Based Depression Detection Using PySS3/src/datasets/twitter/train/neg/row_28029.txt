It feels like nothing can stop me from ending it all. It all just feels horribleI need help. I am sitting here with a bottle of pills and I feel like I can't control myself anymore. I tried calling a hotline but it didn't seem to help at all. I'm so lost and alone. I've been disconnected from my family for religious reasons for the last two years. I am in a foreign country with little money and pretty much no real friends. My only light in this depressing situation was my girlfriend who has been with me for four years. But that seems to be gone now, and on really bad terms (no cheating or huge catalyst, but just bitter and sad and angry breakup). I am currently staying at her parents' place with her, I've got nowhere else to sleep or go, but I feel so miserable and alone here. I am so sad, and helpless, I just feel like ending it all. I should also mention that I have been seeing a therapist for more than a year now and taking antidepressants for a couple of months, but nothing has seemed to work or help me cope. Now with nowhere to go or anyone that cares about me, I have nothing... why even try anymore.

I need help, guidance, anything... please, I don't want to be miserable and depressed, I don't want to die (but I feel like I do). What the hell do I do?
