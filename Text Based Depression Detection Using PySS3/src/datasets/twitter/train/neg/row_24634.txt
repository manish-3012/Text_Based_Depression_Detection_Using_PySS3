Tired of fighting just to be good enoughTitle edit. Tired of fighting for nothing

If my brain is out to get me who am I to fight it?

If my existence is out to get me JUST HURRY THE FUCK UP

two years ago I wrote a post here saying how I had been fighting and fighting through a 4 years long major depressive episode. make that 5 1/2, the 1/2 missing I was actually pretty set, I had beaten it woo I woke up, and didn't feel like dying, I woke up and was excited for what the day would bring, invasive thoughts gone, self harm, suicide, 'past that shit'.

Honestly I should have seen it coming, I'm going through Male to Female hormone replacement therapy, and like puberty itself isn't enough to cause depression. Gotta go through shit to get what ya want, I KNOW THIS I'VE DONE IT ENOUGH. I once wanted to be happy, I once was happy. I was at where I wanted, I have friends, I had a job, I had money, I was good, then I injured myself, lost my money, became fucking useless again, it won't heal for 5 months of non stop pain, like actual non stop pain there is no comfortable position I can rest my shoulder in at all, sleep has become this hellish experience where I need to just lay in pain til my brain puts itself to sleep, I can't do much of the shit that used to make me happy, and don't have the money for it either.

MTF hormone therapy, can change the way you perceive emotion the way I used to cope would be to literally forget about the shit that fucked me up over life

now I lay in bed in pain balling my eyes out at events that happened years and years ago remembering every shit feeling it gave me. 

It's like every bit of shit in my life got up at once and decided to fuck with me.
