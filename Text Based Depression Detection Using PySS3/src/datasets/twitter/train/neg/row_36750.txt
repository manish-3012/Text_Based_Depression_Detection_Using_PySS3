Drifting awayI feel so disconnected from everything/everyone.I always check on others and make sure theyâ€™re doing alright no one checks in on me.they only seem to want to acknowledge my existence when theyâ€™re feeling down.I am always replaced by someone else.I always think about what would happen if I commit suicide and who would pretend to care.Everyone always seems to care when itâ€™s too late and when u try to reach out to them they make u feel like ur a burden.I feel myself care less and less and fantasize more about my own death as time goes on. I canâ€™t get rid of this feeling that Iâ€™m going to die soon. That my mental health will win the battle and Iâ€™m too tired to keep fighting
