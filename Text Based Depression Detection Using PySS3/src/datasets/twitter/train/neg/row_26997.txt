tonight's the nightTonight would be the perfect night to do it. I've tried before and failed because of I was sacred. I have the house to myself and no one would find me for at least a day, plenty of time. I'm so tired of it all I just wish it would end. I want to get better, I want things to change but I don't know how, it seems impossible. I don't know how I can keep going on like this.
