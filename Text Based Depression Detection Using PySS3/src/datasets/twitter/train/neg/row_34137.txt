I want to open upI think...I think I want to tell my friends that Iâ€™m suicidal, and addicted to self harm. Iâ€™m at a point in my friendships that I think I can be open with them, and Iâ€™m more than sick of hiding myself in long sleeved shirts and jumpers. I want to wear my cuts with pride, because thatâ€™s who I fucking am. Thatâ€™s me. I know myself. I want everyone else to.

The next time I post, itâ€™ll be to tell you all that Iâ€™ve told them. So I really hope Iâ€™m going to be able to post again...
