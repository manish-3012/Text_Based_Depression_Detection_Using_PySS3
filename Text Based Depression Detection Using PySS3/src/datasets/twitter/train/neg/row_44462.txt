Recently made an attempt at my life. How do you reach out to establish support system with friends without overwhelming friends and scaring them away?I recently made an attempt at my life. 

My doctor recommended me reach out to my close circle of friends without pushing them away. I know some people wonâ€™t take it well. I am worried about over burdening my very kind friends by relying on them too much. 

I worry because I only have one friend I open up to at the moment. I donâ€™t want them to think I only come to them for talking about my mental health. 

They have been incredibly supportive over my mental health issues. But I fear that I will push them away if this is all they see me as. How do I expand my support system to lessen the burden on one person. How do you approach close friends about this stigmatized subject?

Any advice?
