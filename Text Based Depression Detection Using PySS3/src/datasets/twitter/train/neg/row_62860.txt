I am ready to do it. I have people in my life that need me right now
I need to be strong for them.
I have a husband who loves and cherishes me.

But; it is cold. I can see my breath take white form in the air. 
I can't respond to the texts or phone calls. 
Hold the emotions in, for too long now. They are bleeding out. Unstoppable. 
Flashbacks. Flashbacks. Flashbacks. 
I want to be strong.
But here I am. 
6 years old again. 
Tied to a bed, for days on end. With him. On top of me, inside of me. Hurting me. No food, no water. For days. Just a cold room, ropes, a bed and my dad.
My breath white as white in the air, just like tonight. 
I want to be strong. 
I just can't anymore.
Melanie; what are you doing?
get help. get help. get help. 
no sleep for days. 
Flashbacks, flashbacks, flashbacks. 
I'm tired. I'm done. 
All I can think these days is; suicide, suicide, suicide.
