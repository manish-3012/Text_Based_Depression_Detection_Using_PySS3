I really want to end it.Lately these past few months, everything has been a bit of a struggle for me. I've lost friends, family and relationships all because I can't get out of this funk. 

Last year I almost ended my life. I was whiteknuckling a rail to prevent myself from jumping in front of a train. 

Things got better. I tried time and time again to put those feelings of dread behind me and move on with my life and for awhile, it worked. Until now when its all come crashing around me once again. My father is an alcoholic and an abusive manipulator too. He gets himself plastered and blames us all for making him depressed to the point that he *has* to drink. He'll work himself into a fit of rage and threaten to kick out whoever decides to stand up to him and his bullshit. 

He threatens to leave my mother and that instantly makes her switch from defending me and my sister to his side. I can't do this anymore. 

My job...I love my job. Not many people who work in retail can say that but I honestly can. Lately the stress of my home life is impacting my work and my boss is taking notice and is disappointed in my performance. I have nothing but the utmost respect for my boss and knowing that im letting her down is another impact on my life. 

Honestly, the only thing keeping me here is knowing that if I go, I'm going to really ruin my best friend's day. He's been so supportive and gave me the nudge in the right direction to getting better. He's the one that was there for me when I needed help the most. I can't betray that trust by going behind his back and ending it all but frankly, I can't keep dealing with my depression anymore. 

I'm sorry if this is the wrong place to post this, I just needed to vent and this seemed to be the best outlet. Also I'm sorry for whatever mistakes I made format wise, I'm using my phone.
