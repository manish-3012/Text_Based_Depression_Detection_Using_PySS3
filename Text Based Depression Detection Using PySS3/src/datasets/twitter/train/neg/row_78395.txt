FinishedI never know how to start these things. Iâ€™ve posted here before and Iâ€™m posting again. Iâ€™m always worried it looks like attention seeking. I do understand depression is a very individual thing. I do find myself very frustrated at some of the posts in here but itâ€™s not my place to judge and I donâ€™t know OPs history.

I can only tell you about me. Iâ€™m 30 in 16 days and I have a severe chronic illness since I was 10. Iâ€™m not often unable to eat or drink for long periods of time. Iâ€™m fed every night by a tube in my heart. I have a severe vomiting and loo problem. I could go on but for me itâ€™s come to an end 

My life needs to have some quality thatâ€™s something thatâ€™s been seriously diminishing. Iâ€™ve explored every medical option here and abroad. There are no fixes unfortunately.

Iâ€™m currently writing letters for my passing. Just some instructions for my body and my apologies to my family. I do love them with all my heart but now I have to go before I die slowly in hospital.

My research shows painkillers and carbon monoxide should help me drift off without awakening 

Iâ€™m going to be the biggest hypocrite now but I need you all to appreciate your health and the freedom it gives you.
