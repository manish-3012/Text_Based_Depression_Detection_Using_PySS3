Keep going on great dates with women that are promising until the end, but the day or two after, they dont want to talk to me anymore. I want to fucking dieBeing a straight guy is a fucking curse. I dont want to desire women. I dont want to be torn apart because of being lonely. I hate this so much. I want to kill myself so badly. I keep bonding and having a great time with some girl and she thinks so much of me, but then ghosts. I cant deal living like this. I just want to die. It shouldnt be so hard. I cant get anywhere in life. AAAND people all over the internet want me to die anyway for being so alone. Fuck. Fuck.

FUCKING KILL ME. IM DONE. I DONT WANT TO DESIRE WOMEN.
