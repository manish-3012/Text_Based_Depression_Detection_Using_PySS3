I should just kill myself, no one will ever understand.I feel like i'm screaming for help, but the people in my life just seem to ignore it, they seem to think that this is just something i can power through alone. The only two people i feel like i can talk to are 1) in a psych ward and 2) constantly unable to answer me due to their own issues, which i understand.

I just feel so sad and angry all of the time, and it won't let up, my self harming habits have flared back up and i just hurt on the instde and out all of the time and i just want it to stop.

I've never been this close to going and buying the ropes, i don't care about how devastated/guilty my family may feel anymore, there are only 2 people i am staying alive for and i'm losing my grip on them. I'm just so fucking lost.
