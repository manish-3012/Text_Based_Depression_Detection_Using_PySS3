The Infinite BlackThat's what I call it anyway. I could be wrong about the afterlife, but I prefer post-death being kind of what it was like before we were born. Just nothing. Pure peace. Nothing weighing you down, and nothing pulling you up. Just infinite, impenetrable black. So welcoming to accept you into the arms of infinity. No more humiliation, failures, or feelings of inadequacy. No more being alone and hating that you aren't worth anyone's time. Just absofuckinglutely nothing. If the void had a prayer, I'd say it every single day. If suicide had a saint, I'd whisper her name with my hands clasped together in front of my face. I want it so bad.
