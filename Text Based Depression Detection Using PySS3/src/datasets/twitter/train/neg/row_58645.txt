Hook up said I was too rough, I'm in a dark placeI hooked up with a girl recently while we were both fairly drunk. We went about our thing and got to a point where we stopped because we were both too drunk. We ultimately didn't have sex outright, and I checked in with her the next day and she said she had fun. However, later on I heard from a mutual friend that she felt that I was too rough during foreplay and had bit the inside of her thighs (not blood, but she had marks/bruises the next day) while going down on her. She did desire to hook up with me, but felt in retrospect that I was too rough and found it jarring. She didn't tell me while we were together that I was being too rough, but I apparently had assumed she did, even saying it aloud (which is uncharacteristic of me) and I know this to be wrong. I thought I had just been giving her hickies and such and am shocked that I was too rough without asking for explicit consent. 

I've reached out to her to try to talk through this and she's said she'll talk with me soon when she's ready. I haven't been able to think about anything else for a moment since. 

Since I learned of this I've been experiencing a lot of shame/suicidal thoughts for having put someone through a situation which made them distraught. Today has been really bad and a lot of my ideas have been revolving around passive suicide i.e. getting hit by a car, spontaneous death. I keep imaging myself jumping off a fire escape/out of the window at work and just not having to be anymore. I feel so much shame that I'm sick to my stomach 24 hours a day, I can't sleep, and I feel like my life may be over as I can't see myself ever not hating myself now.
