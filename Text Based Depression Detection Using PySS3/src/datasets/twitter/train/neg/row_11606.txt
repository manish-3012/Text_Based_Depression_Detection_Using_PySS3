My life is ruined.I had a ton of academic potential. My depression and anxiety fucked that up.

I had a ton of great friends. They stopped talking to me after my depression and anxiety took over. 

I hear my family members talking shit about me. I'm a burden to everyone I'm associated with. 

I'm not the happy, ambitious person that I used to be. The only thing keeping me alive is my cowardice.
