I think I'm gonna implode.I'm filled with a rage that I can't calm down. It's not directed at anyone, but myself. I just can't fucking stop hating myself. I'm sitting in my room, just filled with this intense self loathing, and I don't know how to stop. I wish I had access to some drugs if I'm being honest. I know they cause misery if done in abundance, and if I ever get my hands on some I'm gonna do them till theres nothing left, but I need something to ease the pain. I really want to just self destruct, and I can't get help nor ease the pain. It really fucking sucks and I hate my life.

Edit: Really glad I put this up just to be ignored...I don't even know why I try anymore...everytime I try to reach out I just get ignored like the piece of shit I am.
