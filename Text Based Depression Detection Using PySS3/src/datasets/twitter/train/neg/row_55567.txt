Every birthday, I have a stronger urge to finally let go.Itâ€™s been around 6 years since I started thinking about committing suicide and the urge to finally do it gets stronger every time my birthday approaches. The thought lingers on and off very often throughout the year but itâ€™s especially stronger when my birthday approaches.

I canâ€™t believe that Iâ€™ve been contemplating killing my self for so long. Iâ€™ve â€œattemptedâ€ about 3 times last year which ended up in disappointing failures where I could act like nothing happened the next day. 

Iâ€™m honestly sick of myself and feeling the same pang of pain in my heart and one part of me canâ€™t believe how long Iâ€™ve had the same thought and feeling through out these years. 

My birthday is approaching in two weeks, and itâ€™s considered a big milestone age. I only made it this far because I know the only way I have out might end up traumatising way too many other people. Iâ€™ve exhausted my other options and this option is the only way but I donâ€™t wish to drag others into my death. 

I tried seeking therapy but itâ€™s way too expensive and my parents have enough on their plate.

I have a major exam to take this year and I canâ€™t help but lingering over the thought that suicide will be the only way out. The suicidal thoughts are also really hindering my ability to study.

I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s the point of this post. I just wanted to confide in internet strangers since I know telling anyone else closer will get them EXTREMLY concerned and affect them hugely too.
