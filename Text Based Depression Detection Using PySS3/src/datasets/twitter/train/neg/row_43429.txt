I can't feel joy anymore. I can't keep going alone.I'm broken. The thing I most prided myself on, my rationality, has been destroyed by the meaninglessness and misery which consumes me. 

I was walking to my car in the parking lot today. Another car drove by. All of a sudden, I found my mind begging for it to hit me, kill me, bring me peace.

Life is suffering and meaninglessness. What would make it endurable for me is if I had someone to face the absurdity with. I feel insignificant and uncared for. Sure, I have understanding friends and loving parents, but that isn't enough. I need someone I can love, someone who loves me, someone who sees what I see and can march forward with me. 

I can't do it alone. I'd rather die than do it alone.
