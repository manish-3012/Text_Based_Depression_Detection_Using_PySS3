Please lift me back up...I dealt with severe depression for many years, and after changing some things about my lifestyle I found myself becoming much more happy and stable.

But now... everything looks so bleak. The feelings of worthlessness and the lack of will to live are so strong.. I reached out to everyone in my real life that I can think of and there's been no response, aside from my boyfriend who hates that I have feelings and in no way supports me in times like these.

I hate myself. I hate being alive. I don't want to wake up anymore. Please... I need some kind of support. Anything. I just want to feel better! I don't want to harm myself... 

I'm sorry.. I hate being a burden. Just knowing that anyone might waste their time on my words makes me feel like a worthless piece of shit... 

I'm sorry.
