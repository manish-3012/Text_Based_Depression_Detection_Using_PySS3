When youâ€™ve lost everything whatâ€™s the point in going on?Iâ€™ve lost my health. My physical appearance has gone down the drain. Iâ€™m physically unable to do all of the things I love. Iâ€™ve lost my sanity. My cognitive function is getting worse by the day. Iâ€™ve isolated myself from all of my friends. The only family I have left is my dad.

25, unemployed, and deteriorating by the minute.
