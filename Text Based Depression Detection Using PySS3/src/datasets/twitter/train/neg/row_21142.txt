Failed drug overdosage attempt.This is a pretty long post, but if you want to get right to the main point, just ctrl + f : â€œIâ€™m not dead. Also, I canâ€™tsleep.â€
///
I wonder if this will ever get read. Iâ€™m not even sure someone could turn on this laptop. &lt;Enter&gt;

&amp;nbsp;

Is overdosage painful? &lt;- real title of the document, but you canâ€™t type question mark on file names.

&amp;nbsp;

I donâ€™t know, but Iâ€™d probably know in a few moments. Iâ€™d probably wonâ€™t be around to write it, though.

&amp;nbsp;


Believe it or not, my decision to kill myself is something I took a long time to take. Whoever you are, I hope you feel glad over my inevitable demise because I sure am.

&amp;nbsp;

Taking the final action to execute myself is incredibly hard. What really tilt the scale was the thought of thinking what I would do if someone close to me confess that they want to kill themselves.
In that situation I would definitely tell them to just do it, thereâ€™s no saving them.


&amp;nbsp;

My heart is beating really fast and Iâ€™m taking short breaths, itâ€™s probably the adrenaline of taking so much pills.

&amp;nbsp;

The glass of water is gone. Thereâ€™s someone outside and I donâ€™t want to go to the sink to fill it with more water.

&amp;nbsp;

My stomach feels warm and my fingers are trembling. Itâ€™s still easy to type.

&amp;nbsp;

What held me off from suicide for so long is neither my family nor my friends. I mean, theyâ€™re great people, in the sense that they try to prevent me from it. But in my mind, I think that they just want to avoid the bad reputation of letting someone close to them dying by suicide. I donâ€™t blame them for anything.

&amp;nbsp;

What held me off is the fact that I would ruin the reputation of the things I believe in: Like religion or the state of non-religion. Or like, knowing a terrible book that keeps you at night just by the thought of how bad it was and how ridiculously popular it is. Or like, having Rei as your waifu and being unjustifiably mad of Asuka fans and thinking that when you die Rei gets one less fans and people will think anime push people to suicide and stuff.

&amp;nbsp;

You know, just for context.

&amp;nbsp;

 I feel normal right now. My fingers are still trembling though. Also, itâ€™s cold.

&amp;nbsp;

At some point, I realize that thatâ€™s a ridiculous reason to live for. You canâ€™t live with something else for a reason. You need a reason to live for yourself, which really drove me mad when mom told me how sheâ€™s getting old and someone will need to take care of her at some point. Again, not blaming them, but if Iâ€™m going to live, Itâ€™s definitely not because I solely want to take care of them to their death.

&amp;nbsp;

Really though, thereâ€™s no tragedy involving my decision to kill myself. Writing this word file makes me afraid that Iâ€™m going to undermine everyone else who had decided to kill themselves and who are currently depressed (just a little).

&amp;nbsp;

My whole body is trembling a bit more.

&amp;nbsp;

Iâ€™ve got nothing else to say.

&amp;nbsp;

Letâ€™s talk about my experience with the psychiatric.

&amp;nbsp;

I did a really dumb thing to tell her that Iâ€™m depressed (not going to talk about it here). I think that it somewhat made her think Iâ€™m really not all that serious about suicide. At some point, she told me â€œYe, you probably wonâ€™t ever get enough courage to kill yourself anyway, just give up on suicide.â€ (a lot of paraphrase). This was after I made a hangman noose from my laptop charger. Iâ€™ll admit it, she was pretty convincing.


&amp;nbsp;

But like, she really sucked at motivating me to do things. Probably because she doesnâ€™t have a lot of time to work on me. Probably also because Iâ€™ve been looking for motivation stuff on internet and I sort of became numb at the whole thing.

&amp;nbsp;

By the way, Iâ€™m trembling a lot more, but itâ€™s nothing painful and I could still type pretty easily. I hope I get sleepy enough to die in my sleep.

&amp;nbsp;

I think everyone agree that life is all about gaining personal happiness and avoiding... unhappiness. People do good things at the cost of themselves because they like seeing other people happy, or they like being praised and famous or they like the prospect of eternal happiness in heaven. People avoid being a dick because they donâ€™t want to get into prison or getting revenge murdered.

&amp;nbsp;

People invest, thinking that they would get greater happiness by holding off the immediate and short term. Not just in money. Investment can come in studying more to get a better job, saving money to buy an Iphone instead of expensive food and probably getting a kid.

&amp;nbsp;

I stood up to take a piss, and it felt really weird. Iâ€™m all dizzy.
Iâ€™m a failed investment. When I told that to my psychiatrist, she told me that thatâ€™s not a sure thing. I could still change. Needless to say, Iâ€™m not convinced.

&amp;nbsp;

Mom also said I could still change. What? Am I supposed to be myself or change to be someone who is happy to contribute for other people? Mom told me Iâ€™m currently not who I really am and that my real self is a kind person who could be of help to everyone.  

&amp;nbsp;

Which reminds me of a stupid and unpopular comic Iâ€™ve read a long time ago, one of their character said: â€œEvery parent want their children to be differentâ€.

&amp;nbsp;

Okay, now I really got nothing else to say.

&amp;nbsp;

Letâ€™s talk about my attempts for suicide. I have some pretty hilarious stories.

&amp;nbsp;

My first thought is to jump from a really high building. My old apartment in Indonesia is pretty tall and I live on floor 16 (If I remember this right).

&amp;nbsp;

I was quickly able to dissuade myself from that. I donâ€™t want to be a bother for everyone who is going to see my corpseâ€¦ Nah, I was just too much of a wuss to take that decision.

&amp;nbsp;

At that time, I thought that when I end up deciding to kill myself, Iâ€™d use a knife to pierce my heart and Iâ€™ll do it swiftly without second thought.

&amp;nbsp;

It was kind of a long time later that I realize I was wrong. I wasnâ€™t brave enough to stab myself. The reason is obvious, I fear pain.
I tried someâ€¦ â€œtrainingâ€ to accustom myself to stabs. Like poking the knife to my glasses and using my whole strength to stab my bed.

&amp;nbsp;

The heck, my head is getting sluggish. It took me a long time to find the word for â€œbedâ€.

&amp;nbsp;

Anyway, I gave up stabbing my own heart and look up other method for painless death.

&amp;nbsp;

I found out about how to tie a hangman noose.

&amp;nbsp;

Iâ€™m sleepy.

&amp;nbsp;

////

&amp;nbsp;

Iâ€™m not dead. Also, I canâ€™tsleep.

&amp;nbsp;

Sorry that Iâ€™m leaving the story on a cliffhanger, but thereâ€™s something more important that I have to tell.

&amp;nbsp;

So like, itâ€™s been 3 hours after I took about 2 dozen or so pills.
I still feel dizzy and Iâ€™m trembling a lot more and itâ€™s getting a lot harder to type, but I feel a lot better (I still want to die, mind you).
But like, shouldnâ€™t I be dead by now or something?

&amp;nbsp;

Am I being given fake pills or something? 

&amp;nbsp;

The pill cover from which that I took are mostly labeled paracetamol and ponstan.

&amp;nbsp;

I definitely took more than the recommended dosage.
So, umâ€¦

&amp;nbsp;

Whatâ€™s happening to me?

&amp;nbsp;
