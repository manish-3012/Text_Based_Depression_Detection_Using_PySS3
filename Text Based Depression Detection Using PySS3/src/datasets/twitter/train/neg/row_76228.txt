Can't help my feelingsI've had a good life for the most part, but since 7th grade I've had feelings of depression and eventually anxiety that have intensified over the years.  I am now 20 years old, and it has never been this bad (I acknowledge that some have it much worse than I do).  Every day I'm teetering on thoughts of suicide; I find it impossible to function in day-to-day tasks (homework, socializing, etc.).  I feel as if no one around truly understands how I feel, and that just makes me feel worse.  My girlfriend is compassionate about it, but I feel as though even she doesn't get the scope of what I'm going through.  Every day I find it harder and harder to hold on, I feel like I'm on the edge and my fingertips are slipping off the overhang one by one.
