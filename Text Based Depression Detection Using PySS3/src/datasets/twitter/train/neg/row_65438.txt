Cleanest Method?I think I'm going to leave soon and I don't want to leave a mess or traumatize a first responder that might find me.  Any ideas on a clean method?  I was thinking I could lay plastic down in the garage and then a few absorbent type moving blankets over that.  I just don't want to give someone else PTSD when they find me.
