The thought of suicide is comfortingI'm not seriously considering suicide and I probably won't do it, but I think about it a lot. It's almost become a part of my daily routine. Even though things around me are getting better and I have a lot of good people near me I still tend to think that I just don't belong in this world and that everything would be better if I killed myself.
