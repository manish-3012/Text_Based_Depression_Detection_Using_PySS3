Tell me the truth, would you miss me if I left tomorrow?Today is my birthday, the only person who wished me a happy birthday later wished they'd never met me. My family lives 8000 miles away and they didn't even say happy birthday. I feel so fucking alone, why should I live only in disappointment and sadness?
