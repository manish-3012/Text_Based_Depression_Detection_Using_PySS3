What can I doI'm 18m and I have mild Autism, ADD, and severe Anxiety. I'm a dropout and have never had a job or GF or a lot of friends. People always tell me I'm a stunning guy and ask if I'm a model and always tell me how smart I am. The thing is I don't see that or feel that. I have dreams of being an investor/ model and an actor and I'm damn good at it but I'm so depressed because I feel like no one wants me not even my own family. I have no direction and idea what I'm going to do and I refuse to live a life of constantly putting myself down and my own family putting me down. I can't get a job cause of my impaired social skills and have no money  and all I do Is play video games cause that's the only time I feel good because it takes my mind off of the bullshit and pain. I've been through a lot more but I'm not going to share everything on here. I'm getting to the point where death seems like a good way out of being trapped in my own nightmare in my head. Sorry if this isn't organized and doesn't make a lot of sense but I have to put it out there.
