I am so depressed I want to kill myself I am 26, working at a dead end job, and I hate it. I took journalism because I liked writing, and then found out I am a terrible writer, I am a moron and I can't do my job. i don't have the interest in my job, creating a future or anything. I just feel dying would be better. I want to kill myself bu i can't seem to do it because of fear, anxiety.. My friends are moving on with life getting married and enjoying life. i spend the last 4 years being miserable. i don't think i will ever be happy, my depression makes me lash out at people online. I want it to end and I think of death. I am going to hurt someone or myself, and I just want to do it because I am so tired of breathing. I am sick of seeing happy and succesful women, I am sick of hearing my mother tell me to get over it. I don't know what to do...and I am abut to leave my country for a place I hate. I just feel I will kill myself one day so no point in doing anything and I just want to get over it.
I keep telling myself go commit suicide, go die...and i envy those who could do it.
I keep pushing myself but I can't seem to do it. I cut myself a little with a knife, but other than that...I can't do more.
I know I mess up everything, i messed up my life, and I will mess up my future. and I am going to end up being poor and homless and probably hurt anyone who can love me. I wish I could end it quickly, just kill myself and be free.
