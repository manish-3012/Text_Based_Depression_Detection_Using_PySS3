Don't wanna be here anymoreI was doing well. 

I was doing so well, I can't even remember the last time I actively thought about killing myself. 

But here I am again, and it's all because of my soul-sucking job, management fucks things up so bad and it's us that have to bear the weird of it, and it's been slowly chipping away at my sanity. 

I don't wanna be here anymore. 

I just don't, I hate this, I hate waking up to this every day. Every job application I send falls through, and there's not much else I can do that's on the same pay grade without a degree. I feel trapped, I feel like I'm hell, I feel like a burden and a failure. 

But I can't, I can't do it, I can't die knowing my sweet loving boyfriend would lose someone else in this way, I can't die knowing my grandma and my mother would have to find my body. I can't do it knowing my mother would feel like a failure after trying so hard to help me out with all my other mental health issues. I can't do it knowing what it'll do to my brother's mental health. 

I can't just kill myself and I feel like a coward, and I feel even worse because it's just my stupid fucking job that's making me want to die so badly, I hate that the fix is so simple yet so fucking hard to achieve.
