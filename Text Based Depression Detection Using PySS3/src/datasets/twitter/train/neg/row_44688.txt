Whatâ€™s the point of another attempt at life?Iâ€™m here. Again. 

Every time I try to improve, fix, therapize or otherwise work on my mental state or health, the most I receive is a brief respite from living hell. Usually about a month or so.

Got 6 weeks before I wanted to kill myself again. New personal record. 

And now Iâ€™m here, doing nothing, being nothing. Again. And again. Every time I pick myself up and try another attempt at normal life, I tell myself that this time I can be successful, this time I can change, this time I will achieve mental health. 

Itâ€™s a lie. Every time, itâ€™s a lie because every time I end up here again. It might take three days, it might take three weeks but it never ends. It never fucking ends. 

Nothing even fucking triggers it. Thereâ€™s not even a reason. I woke up with the urge to slap myself. Then over breakfast I contemplated whether or not a few razor cuts would make me feel better. Now itâ€™s lunch and Iâ€™m sure suicide is the only way. 

I ought to respect myself enough not to lie to myself again. 

Never again.

Never again.
