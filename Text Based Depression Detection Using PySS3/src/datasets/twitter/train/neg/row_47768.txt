She ghosted meI don't even understand what happened. She seemed fine all day today. Nothing out of the ordinary. Until about an hour ago she just randomly blocks me. I loved her. I trusted her. She promised me she wouldn't.... I told her what would happen if she did betray me... I told her what I can't live through another heartbreak.... and then she breaks my heart....
