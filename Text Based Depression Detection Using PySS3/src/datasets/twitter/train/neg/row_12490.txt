i feel dead alreadyi don't really know where to begin and i'll try my best to keep this short. i'm 36, i have a wife and a 5 year old boy. i've been unemployed for over a year, i can't even get an interview for a job. i had to move my family into my moms house because my wife couldn't afford to pay rent alone anymore. for a while everything made me angry...the news, tv shows, comercials, the selfishness and materialism of society in general. then i got to this point where i feel nothing at all, no anger or fear or sadness or joy...i just feel empty and hollow.

i tried taking every pill in my medicine cabinet and still woke up the next day. half of the pills turned out to be laxatives. so i spent an entire day on the toilet half asleep. (it's ok to laugh, i don't mind) 

but i feel like i'll never be happy again and i'm tired of faking it. there's more, but thats about the jist of it. i can't sleep, have no energy. all i have is a doomed feeling like i'll never feel joy again. and that my family would be better off without having to deal with me and my apathy.

i used to smoke pot, and that helped. but now that i'm old and i can't find it anymore. so i'm debating going to therapy, but i have the impression that they'll just drug me up on some pills that will make me feel worse or turn me into a zombie. but i almost feel like a zombie now, i can't even cry anymore. i feel nothing

the only reason i'm still alive is because i am a coward and don't want to try any suicide technique that will cause me to spend my last moments on this earth in pain.

has anyone sought professional help that helped them to feel normal again? should i try it? i don't know what to do. this is my cry for help, i don't know how to fix myself
