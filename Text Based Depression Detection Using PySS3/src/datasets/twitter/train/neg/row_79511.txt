Lost HopeI'm a male. I'm 5'2, I'm fat (230 lbs) and I have a micropenis. I'm sure everyone can already get an idea of how easily that can break a man's confidence. I'm a loser who can't get an ID nor a job. I was abused as a child and neglected by everyone I ever cared for growing up. Given this and due to failed relationships in the past, it has left me mentally unstable and emotionally damaged. I'm currently homeless and have absolutely lost all motivation and will to live. If anyone is reading this, please help.
