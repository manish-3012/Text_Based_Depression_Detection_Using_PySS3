Age where suicide is acceptable.I can understand keeping teenagers from killing themseves because they haven't reaized their potential or experienced real life, but I'm neary thirty and don't feel that life's benefits are worth the weight of dread and misery. I really want to give up but I'm being blackmailed with things like "your death will haunt me forever."  from people I trust enough to talk about depression with so I feel pressured to keep on living for their sake.

Other people seem to be having a fine enough time and I don't want my death to affect them in any lasting way. How old do I have to be before I can go out quietly and people will accept it without living their life with a shadow? I don't want to hurt people like a monster I just want to stop existing. How can I achieve this? A matter of time? Isolation?
