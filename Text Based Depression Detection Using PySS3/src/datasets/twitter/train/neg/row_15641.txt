I donâ€™t want help to make my life better, i want it to endIâ€™ve been dreaming, imagining how iâ€™m going to kill myself. Whenever i think about this, i feel a sense of calm, finally a place i can rest and all my problems will be gone. Imagine it like youâ€™re driving a car, and the car keep getting faster and faster and you want it to slow down but you donâ€™t know how. You only know that suicide is the break, a pedal that u can press but you car will stop forever. 

I think about what happens after i die, my body, atoms, will return back to nature. The universe will continue normally just like before i was born. I know itâ€™s wrong but in a way i look at suicide as a beautiful thing. Someone, who has been suffering, freed from their pain, resting in peace. 

It feels calm as i stand at the roof. But at the same time iâ€™m too scared to go nearer to the edge. Iâ€™m afraid i might actually do it and jump. It tells me that deep down, i know i want to live. As i have these thoughts, i canâ€™t help but feel selfish. I ask myself, â€œwell if youâ€™re so suicidal why donâ€™t you commit suicide now? Donâ€™t undermine the people who actually committed suicide, you didnâ€™t suffer as much as them. You would be so selfish if you committed suicide. You will burden your family and friends with the painâ€

Life is beautiful. Itâ€™s not just about constantly being happy. The pain, the hardships and not knowing everything is what makes life special. The mystery is beautiful. We fail and we fail but we have hope, goals that we want to achieve and we continue to try no matter how hard it gets. We have faith.

But as I constantly try to move on with life, the more i realise, there is no place for me here. It seems like i simply am not capable of finding anything here. It seems dark, and whenever i run from it and see some light, the huge darkness will always catch up.
