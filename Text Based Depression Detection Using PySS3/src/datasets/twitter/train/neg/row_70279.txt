The Game of LifeThere comes a time where you keep losing to this boss enemy. You don't give up immediately because you genuinely enjoy playing the game. But after 20 attempts, you begin to get frustrated and lose hope. You leave the game but intend to return afterwards. You seek help, checking forums and asking others for tips and advice. A few days later, you return to the game with new-found knowledge and renewed confidence. Yet, you still can't execute the moves and after another 10 attempts, you give up again. You fall into despair and lose all hope with progressing the game. 

&amp;nbsp;

Then, someone noticed and decided to party up with you. Together, you guys took down the boss and you finally got to the next stage. But deep down inside, you have no sense of accomplishment because someone had to hold your hand and walk you through the boss stage. Furthermore, the enemies in the next stage are tougher but should have been manageable IF you had picked up the necessary skills and defeated the boss on your own like everyone else. 

&amp;nbsp;

Somehow someway, you managed to drag yourself to the next boss and oh boy it's a tough one. You got completely rekt at your first attempt and it's beginning to look like a joke. Similarly, you sought advice elsewhere only to no avail. You found someone else to party with and once again, defeated the boss with their help. And the cycle repeats as you face even stronger creeps and struggle every step of the game.

&amp;nbsp;

You realise that this vicious cycle is just going to continue forever. You are severely under-leveled and you understand that seeking help all the time will just further screw you over. Slowly, you consider leaving the game for good. You are shocked at your own lack of resilience but it just proves to you that maybe this game really isn't cut out for you.
