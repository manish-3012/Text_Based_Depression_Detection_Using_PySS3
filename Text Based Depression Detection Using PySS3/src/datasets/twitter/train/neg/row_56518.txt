I really cantI really don't know what to do anymore; I just feel so much guilt and aimlessness. It feels like I'm just waiting for something bad enough to happen to push me over the edge, or to a point where all the small things just become too much. I've been to psychiatrist for anti-depressants, but when I take them I feel as they could give me the energy to actually go through with it. My only friend is a person who ditches me as soon as they get into a relationship and pretty much has never cared about my mental well being. I don't feel close to anyone, not even my own family. I have lost all joy in my life. The few reasons that keep me from doing it, is that if I fail it would be extraordinarily painful and mess me up for the rest of my life.
