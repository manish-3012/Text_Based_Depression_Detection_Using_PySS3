Iâ€™m trying to not let gender dysphoria make me suicidal again, but Iâ€™m really struggling. Help?Iâ€™m doing everything that I feel safe enough to do to combat it, since my parents arenâ€™t too accepting of me. I spend a lot of time talking with people who refer to me as my preferred gender and name. But itâ€™s still really hard. Itâ€™s just eating me inside. Certain parts are hard to ignore and puberty is making everything that much worse. My current therapist isnâ€™t really helping that much, and he knows heâ€™s not qualified to deal with gender dysphoria. But insurance wonâ€™t cover a gender therapist. I have to help my parents pay for it. I donâ€™t have the money yet, but Iâ€™m another two weeks I should. But still, Iâ€™m really scared itâ€™s going to get worse and Iâ€™m going to seriously hurt myself. Help me please.
