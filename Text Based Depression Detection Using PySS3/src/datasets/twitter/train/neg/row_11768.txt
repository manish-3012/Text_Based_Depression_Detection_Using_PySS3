I don't have anymore energyAnd tomorrow i have to go to college but i really can't  with how i am feeling. It's only going to get worse. I can't stay home either. My family is already suspecting something is wrong and I'm slacking off because college is hard when really i am scared of being there and terrified of being around ppl and not being able to socialize or feel close to anyone makes me even more depressed. Idk what to do.
