Why cant I kill myselfSo pretty much I bought a rifle around 2 weeks ago and have been just waiting until the day I blow my brains out. I got it under my bed right now with 2 .45 acp bullets loaded in it. I practice putting the barrel in my mouth but  never do it. 

Why is it so hard to ACTUALLY shoot oneself, even though the task seems simple enough? 

To be honest I've tried everything to get help I don't want any of the B.S. there's a way out I've heard that 1000 times. There's not always a way out realistically life isn't fairy tales just wanna know why it's so hard to actually pull the trigger if I wanna just die so badly
