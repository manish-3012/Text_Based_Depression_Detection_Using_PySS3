People make me want to kill myself 

"You look like a guy who insults women when they refuse to send you nudes"

i dont think its fair to be seen as this creepy monster who rapes, murders, etc when i'm just lonely, i don't even leave my room anymore. I just leave work and go home, i dont have the energy to go out, to date someone. I never killed anyone, or raped nor am i a wife beater.

If i had to snap i would have a long time ago, when i suffered in school with bullying or at home with my absent mother and stern father.

It's the vibe, it's the weirdness they say... you look totally creepy, souless eyes, souless smile.

What does creepy really mean? Is it really something that menacing that makes you run for your life or the average unnatractive guy you see on the street or in a pic on reddit?

I'm sick of being labeled something that i am  not, sick of living, just want to end it all.
