low self esteem, dont feel like living anymorebut i stay alive for my parents.

&amp;#x200B;

feel as if ive been bullied a bit in my life. not enough to really whine about though.

&amp;#x200B;

ive never been very good at anything ive tried to do. 

&amp;#x200B;

no job or study. just want to feel like im worth something and can say 'look at what i can do' to people who hurt me. but i cant because those people who hurt me are better than me at stuff anyway. even when they try less hard than me.
