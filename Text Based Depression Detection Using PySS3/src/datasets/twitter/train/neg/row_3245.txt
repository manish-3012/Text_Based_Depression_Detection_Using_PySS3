I feel deadI couldn't do anything useful this week, the intrusive thoughts are just too crippling. Memories, too. My throat and chest are tight and my head is throbbing from crying. It's been two weeks already and this feeling isn't leaving me, and I'm afrad I might end up sinking back into depression. The only thing that sort of comforted me so far has been the idea that I can just kill myself anytime if I can't endure life any longer. Now I can't stop thinking this is the time, this is what I've been waiting for. I feel like a huge chunk of my life has been stolen from me. I'll never have that back. I can never have a normal life, much less a happy one.
The whole point in life is the search for happiness but that I am doomed to not have. Living a life without hope is like being dead already.
