before i go.I'm slowly losing it. I'm in my 20s, I have a job I like enough, I have friends who I get to talk to when I'm not working, my relationships with both my parents are finally at a decent place. But I still just hate myself so much, and hate myself more than I hate my worst enemies. I've only tried to stay alive for so long mostly because of things to look forward to. I tried to kill myself when I was 15, but my mom stopped me, and then I kept trying to find things to look forward to. When I was in high school it was graduating, when I was in college it was graduating college and moving out of FL, when I was working in a field that I wanted to get into and was struggling to get my foot in the door, I just clung onto the thought that I'll make it somehow. Maybe it's been a bad few couple of weeks, but my ideation has gotten so much worse where I sometimes have prayed to go out a la Donnie Darko. I'm terrified that eventually all of those things will go away, and I'll have nothing to live for because things end eventually right? It's just easier to imagine a world without me in it rather than living in a world where I'm without anything, or worse, only left with my depression and anxiety. My dad tells me all the time that I have to find happiness from within, but I'm so afraid it's seeped away that I have none to cling to, so what's the point. I'm finishing up a current gig right now that ends at the end of the month, and don't have any prospects at the moment so I think I'm going in May/June/July, depending on how I feel. I'm visiting my best friend in June, so I have that one thing to look forward to. I just know that I don't think I want to be alive by my 25th birthday in July. Any suggestions on things I should try before I go?
