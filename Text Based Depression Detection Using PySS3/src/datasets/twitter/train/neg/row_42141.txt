It's 1am, i'm home alone and thinking if i should kill myself.Right now everything is so stressful for me, even on days that i'm not so stress is still think about suicide so stressful days make it even worst. My first therapist appointment is in 3 weeks and i told her that im suicidal when i asked for one, she said if i feel really awful i should ask for a number to call there but i'm not sure what to even say and i don't know how to even ask and tbh i probably wouldn't have the energy to call.
