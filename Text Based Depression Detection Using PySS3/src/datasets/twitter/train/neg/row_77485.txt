I havent spoken to a single human in 5 daysIm probably damaging my vocal chords but holy shit. I get bullied at school and my parents have told me Iâ€™m a failure. I barricade myself in my room because it is safe there. I wake up sad that i woke up, i go to school and get abused and then a go home and get looked at like a freak. I just want to give up. It would be better for my parents. I havenâ€™t slept in fucking days. Ive been taking more and more pills to help me sleep and forget about it all. I miss talking to people i miss making people laugh. I used to be so funny so happy but that is gone. Maybe i should its killing me. I know i shouldnâ€™t but god Iâ€™m so done. I just want to sleep forever and not wake up.
