I want to kill myself today
Feeling very suicidal lately. Iâ€™ve had major depression and anxiety since I was 13. I started taking medication and seeing a therapist when I was 15. Iâ€™ve taken 4 different medications with no beneficial results. Therapy hasnâ€™t worked, marijuana and cbd oil havenâ€™t worked. I just feel unlucky all the time. I donâ€™t have great parents, Iâ€™ve been cursed with depression, I have no friends, no education. I struggle just to take 1 or 2 classes. I got a puppy about 6 months ago. I love her more than anything, and I told myself that I wouldnâ€™t kill myself, because she would be absolutely devastated. She follows me everywhere. But now Iâ€™m feeling like it wouldnâ€™t be such a big deal. My parents could always take care of her. Iâ€™m just tired of being in pain. Iâ€™m obsessed with my appearance, but I seem to be cursed in that aspect as well. I have a lot of acne scarring, and I get stretch marks just from breathing. Iâ€™ve never been overweight, but I have stretch marks covering every single inch of my body. I am legit 5â€™8, 120 pounds. I went on vacation to Florida with my mom. We stayed at a private beach house away from everyone for 5 days. I felt a lot better. I was eating more than I normally eat, because I usually eat more on vacation, but I was getting a crap ton of exercise as well. I got home last night, and woke up this morning with stretch marks littering my arms. Pretty much the last place on my body that had been untouched by stretch marks. That felt kind of like the final fuck you. I know itâ€™s stupid to kill yourself over stretch marks, but itâ€™s not just the stretch marks, itâ€™s everything. Itâ€™s been a rough year, I lost my uncle and my sister. Iâ€™m just tired of being in pain. I feel like some unknown entity just doesnâ€™t want me to be happy. As soon as I start to feel slightly better, I get fucked again. Iâ€™m just really really tired. I want it to end.
