Going to the doctorI'm thinking about talking to a professional about my depression, but long story short I need my parent's insurance. How can I tell them that I need a psychologist without actually letting them know I am depressed? I just don't want my parents to know that I am so much of a failure that I need a doctor, plus I don't want them to worry.
