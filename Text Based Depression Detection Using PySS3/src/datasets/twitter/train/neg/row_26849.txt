UpdateA while back I'd posted about some suicidal tendencies I was having. Everyone here helped talk me through it. 

I decided to hit rock bottom. A bottle of whiskey and a pack of cigs in one night, fight club (kind of a woe-is-me amplifier for me), and a suicide note all typed up. I took a photo and went to sleep. 

I woke up the next day and...something clicked. I looked at the photo. I was disgusted. So I worked out and bought a book on programming (something I want to do but lacked the ambition). I cleaned the house. I applied for jobs, since I'm unemployed. 

Overall, productive. I decided to try again the next day. Working out hurt, but the endorphins just pumped me up. I did this for a week. I gave up smoking and drinking. 

4 days into it I seemingly came out of my funk. Now, 7 days later, I'm me again. My old self. Ambition just pouring out of me. Today I bought a pack of cigs and smoked one. It was awful, representing to me everything I've overcome. I gave the pack away. 

I'm back, dammit. I'm fucking back and it feels great! Nothing is stopping me now. I've thrown away the suicide note. 

I thank every one of you for talking to me. It helped; it worked. You guys rock. For everyone struggling with the urge, I implore you to keep trying to live. Find a reason. I challenge you to. Even if you think that reason is beyond silly. Just keep at it. It DOES get better. 

Thanks again, everyone!
