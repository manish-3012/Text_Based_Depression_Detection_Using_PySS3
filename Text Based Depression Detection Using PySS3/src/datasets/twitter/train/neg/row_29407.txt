In an hour i won't be here but that's okayI feel bad cause i won't visit usa anymore and I'm stuck in shitty europe but is time to go, unlike many people before me i won't leave any note , I'm just driving in that mountain road cliff and oops i won't turn at the bend "accidents" happen and the funny thing is no one of the very few people know me I'm a suicidal person,  i now for sure some think a suicide person is a looser or mentally impaired (yep not ill just impaired) so i guess is for the best in this way,also they won't loath me for the funeral cost.
