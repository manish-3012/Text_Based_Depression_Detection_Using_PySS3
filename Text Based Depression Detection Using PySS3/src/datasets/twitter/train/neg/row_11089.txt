Iâ€™m 17 and I have thought of how and when to kill myself more in these past two years than I have in six years.Iâ€™m 17 and these past two years I have thought of killing myself more than I have in the past six years (thatâ€™s how long Iâ€™ve been struggling). I just found out I failed one of my IB classes, which is the first time Iâ€™ve ever failed a class. And right before college applications need to be sent out makes it all the worse. I just try so hard in that class and I still get the lowest grade amongst my peers. It sucks. The teacher gives me suggestions on how to improve and I try them but they never work. I think Iâ€™m doomed to not make it into any of my colleges and just end up dead by my own hand. 
It sucks thinking of it this way and people say that one bad grade isnâ€™t going to determine the rest of your life but thatâ€™s not true. This is one of the most important years of my high school career and I just feel terrible. I canâ€™t even talk to anyone because my mom believes that there are certain people who deserve to be depressed and a â€œspoiled bratâ€ like me doesnâ€™t fit into any of those categories. 
Right now, my future is uncertain but I know that I will either kill myself before this school year ends or when I turn 30. Sorry for the rant, but as I said I canâ€™t talk to anyone and I just needed to get it all out.
