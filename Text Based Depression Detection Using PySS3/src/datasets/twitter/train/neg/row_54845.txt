I really really wanna die right nowIâ€™ve been feeling suicidal for such a long time and Iâ€™m sick of it. I was hospitalized for 5 days a few weeks ago and was feeling better but the thoughts are back.

Iâ€™ve tried so many coping skills and Iâ€™m on 4 different meds that Iâ€™ve been on for like 3 months now and Iâ€™m in therapy and nothing is working. Iâ€™m just fed up and I want to die. Iâ€™m sick and tired of feeling this way and I just want it all to end.

I donâ€™t see another way out and I feel like this is my only option.
