i have to do itfeel like all my life i just been a selfish ungrateful human being, people try to help me but i just always seem to do them dirty no matter how hard i try not to, might smoke a ton of heroin and let it stop my heart or eat a bunch of morphine, like taslima nasreen said, but anyways, goodbye.
