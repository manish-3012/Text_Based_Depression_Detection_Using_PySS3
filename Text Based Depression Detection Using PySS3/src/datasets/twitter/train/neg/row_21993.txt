I donâ€™t want to die but I donâ€™t want to feel like thisI feel so empty. So, so empty. I have no friends. I have no life. I canâ€™t get joy from simple things. Thereâ€™s nothing left and I canâ€™t. Iâ€™ve had this plan for years and itâ€™s getting closer and nobody is taking me seriously. I want to die, but I donâ€™t. Music is literally the best therapy and even then it doesnâ€™t work. It feels horrible.
