I want to die so bad.University is starting up soon. I dont know what to expect, other than my ADHD destroying any chances of me passing classes. I'm scared. I know I'll just fail.

I tried studying Japanese throughout the summer. I failed horribly. Every time I see someone who is better at me in Japanese, I just want to shoot myself then and there. They're so much more dedicated than I ever will be. I'm just a failure instead.

I think I might just cut contact with everyone I know. I'm scared that all of them secretly hate me. I'm scared that they'll see a post like this and laugh at it. I don't know if I can trust anybody. I had 5-6 friends abandon me suddenly. I now realize it genuinely traumatized me. I wanna kill myself for being such a fucking disgrace.

This time it's for real. I thought I was gonna get over this feeling 3 days ago. I'm still this suicidal and I just wanna end it now. I'm trying to reach out to my school's psychological services but I don't know if I'll be able to get myself to actually contact them.

I'm so so close to death. Of course I know my friends will be disappointed. But honestly I've been venting so much that I think it'll be a relief for them.
