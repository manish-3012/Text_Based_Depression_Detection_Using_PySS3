I can't take it anymore Everyone around me is in a better situation than me. Socially, I mean.
 Practically everyone has someone to talk to / text (I feel like I'm missing out; everyone's out there interacting with their social groups while I'm here super lonely...). I haven't got a single friend! I have minimal social contact, something that for me is crucial (for my welfare)...
 I wish I had someone to **direct my efforts to**, that would change my a life a lot in many ways (positively). It would give it meaning..
 I can't seem to socialize properly even though I desire intimate relationships; It would seem that people have a bad reputation for me, and beacuse I have no energy to change it (depression) I can't make myself look likeable...
 I just wish I had someone.. Someone to share my life with, someone to grow up with, someone to funnel my efforts (mentally financially, emotionally, etc...) into!!
 I can't take it anymore, it ends up being a vicious cycle, I can't talk to people beacuse I'm not experienced and beacuse I don't have friends or anyone else really I can't get experience and boom. Cycle repeats... ugh
 I. Just. Can't. Take. It. Any. Longer.
 I'm thinking about jumping in front of a subway train, but I don't want to end up in a vegetative state...
