I feel so alone.Everyday I try to keep myself as busy as possible, I try to distract myself from the crushing and overwhelming loneliness I feel all the time. The problem is that I am an insomniac. So there always is a part of the day where everyone is fast asleep and I am left completely alone with nothing to distract myself. And I really just canâ€™t fall asleep to pass the time. I donâ€™t know what to do. Every single night I get an overwhelming urge to just end it all. To just kill myself and be done with it. I mean what kind of life is worth living where I feel so depressed every night and have no one to help me.
