I gifted my RedditGifts ASAP because I'm not sure tomorrow will come...It's bad this time, I don't know how else to put it.  I've tried to ask for help, but I feel like I'm doing this alone, and I'm just not that strong.

I have an appointment with my shrink today, and I'll beg for some sort of med change, but I know it isn't all about the meds.  Therapy on Wednesday, and then I will make the final decision, but I've already started to say goodbye...
