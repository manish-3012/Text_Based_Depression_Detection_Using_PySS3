I'm accepting itI've been ok with the idea of taking my own life for many years 
I'm 31f bi polar I've always struggled but through drugs and alcohol I never had to feel anything Expecially all of these emotions
I got sober last year and since then I have been dealing with my bi polar (which fucking sucks) all of these emotions are just horrible, I've had some happy times but mostly I'm just getting closer to the day I finally end it and I'm accepting it full heartedly
I feel terrible for the people I'm going to hurt and betray but I don't want to do this anymore I'm done I don't exactly know when but I'm ready to go into the darkness from which I came
Thanks for letting me ventðŸ’–
