I want to kill myself so badlyIâ€™m honestly not sure what this community is or what Iâ€™m supposed to write about, but I have no other outlet. Iâ€™ve had depression since I was young, Iâ€™ve gone to therapy, done prescription medication, and tried everything I could do. I have been really struggling these last couple months. Iâ€™ve been trying so hard not to because as I religious or as far as I am from my religious background. For some reason when it comes to killing myself i canâ€™t not believe in god no matter how hard I try. Itâ€™s the only thing that stops me because the idea of hell terrifies me. I want so badly to not believe itâ€™s real. The pain I feel every single fucking day is agonizing. I wanted to do it today and drove in my car around town thinking I could crash it. I didnâ€™t because I donâ€™t have the guts to do something like that. I drove to the lookout in my nearby town and Iâ€™m crying in my car typing this.  Iâ€™m in so much pain right now. I donâ€™t want to live another 60 years feeling like this but I know I would have to. Iâ€™m so scared and in so much pain
