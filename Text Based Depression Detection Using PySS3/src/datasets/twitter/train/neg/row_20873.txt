Suicidal might do it FridaySo Iâ€™ve always been anti-social growing up. Not many friends, a loner, when I got to about 9 or 10 I stopped being friends with people because I noticed people made me the target for jokes. I would get bullied beat up ruled out. I got so used to it that in high school. I stayed to myself 3 years and only watched anime and played video games, until my Senior year someone told me Iâ€™m waisting my looks that Iâ€™m good looking. I started going out with friends, smoking, drinking, ran track my senior year. I made out with girls, but didnâ€™t date or have sexual intercourse, but girls whom I wanted to date would be scared off by me because I would get attached quickly and blow up there phones when I wasnâ€™t getting the attention I wanted and I would send mean messages because I was hurt. So I did this with 3 girls my senior year then started focusing on myself, I went to work at mall &amp; a call center my first year out of school then towards the summer of 2017 I started working at this store called Ross as a security guard. My interview I met this beautiful girl, I havenâ€™t seen any girls I wanted in a whole year so I tell myself Iâ€™m going to talk to her when I start workin. 2 months go by and I still havenâ€™t said a single word bc im so shy until finally I sucked in air walked to her and said hi. After that weeks later we hang out then we kiss and month later we have sex (first time for me) and I have my first girlfriend. Mind u I learned from my past not to be overly emotional so I would talk to other women to keep my mind off of her as friends. My first car breaks down after a month of having it and I think my girlfriend is going to break up with me but she tells me the car doesnâ€™t matter itâ€™s me that matters and thatâ€™s when I started getting attached. I would still give her space and do my thing at work I ended up getting a second job to get another car for us, but I felt I wasnâ€™t enough I would always tell my girlfriend stuff like this isnâ€™t enough money or why do people treat me like a joke and Iâ€™m so much better then this. She would get mad and feel like she wasnâ€™t good enough for me or say things like u think ur better then people. She even said something like I think your so stuck on what u wanna be in life Bc u donâ€™t wanna be like ur dad and lost so you try to copy everyone else and find a style that suits you. I started crying after the call bc she was right my mindset is so negative I donâ€™t even know who I am or who I want to be. I would do things like run over to her house when she was angry at me and it make her furious. I even ran to our job Bc someone told her I was cheating on her when it wasnâ€™t true and I embarrassed her. She gave me a second chance on our 10th month of being together to work on myself and give her space but I ended up getting kicked out my moms and needing my girlfriends emotional support when she needed space she didnâ€™t wnana see me and I was hurt she kept telling me to let her breathe so she change for us so I kept forcing her to see me bc i needed her but she would be even pushed further away then finally one day I went nuts and tried to break into her home to spend time with her and tell her my problems because I missed her and she was pissed. She walked out pushed me away and go into a Lyft ride and told me she was done. She told me she was balling her eyes out bc i wasnâ€™t that same guy 10 months ago that Iâ€™m disgusting and she sees me as this person who looks down on people and thinks heâ€™s the shit. We argued I called her names and she thinks I looked down on her our whole relationship when I just wanted better for her Iâ€™d tell her go back to college go follow your dreams and sheâ€™d make Excuses. Now sheâ€™s telling me sheâ€™s hanging out with guys sheâ€™s going back to school and traveling. Iâ€™m so hurt so mad at myself because I feel left behind. I wanted to kill myself before I met her &amp; I think I was mentally unstable before our relationship and now I feel even worse. Am I insane am I a psychopath whatâ€™s wrong with me ?!!!!?!?!? I think I need to see a doctor Iâ€™ve been in my apartment for 2 months havenâ€™t left begging her and pleading her over messages that Iâ€™m sorry. Idk what to do anymore itâ€™s like she was my emotional support and calmed me down. WHATS WRONG WITH ME I NEED TO FIGURE IT OUT BEFORE ITS TOO LATE AND IM REALLY THINKING ABOUT KILLING MYSELF THIS FRIDAY
