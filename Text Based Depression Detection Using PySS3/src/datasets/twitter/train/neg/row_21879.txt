Nothing holds any appeal anymoreNothing makes me happy in my life, hasn't really for a couple years. I have lost so many friends that I see no point in making new friends. sex holds no appeal as I am circumsised so losing my virginity holds no real draw. and without a desire to fuck or socialize love is kind of out of range. I spend my day going to classes I hate for the major I hate the least ( still hate it) so I can get I job I will also hate. what little social life I have breaks down into people telling me I am lazy for not caring about the crap I hate or being told " it will get better" thing is its been years now and things only get worst, never going to enjoy real sex, never going to have a friend for more then a month and I am stuck at my college till I graduate and get a job I hate. even things I used to find fun, art, video games, movies nothing really getting me going. I drink and get high when I can but not enough to make the majority of my life bearable.
