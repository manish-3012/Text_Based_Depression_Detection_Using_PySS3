Anyone else feel shitty talking to the SHL?Idk the times i was in a call with an operater after a fucking hour of elevator music, i felt so uncomfortable and really guilty that i have to burden some random guy at 4am with my negative shit. I just feel really guilty having to ruin this persons night. I dont even know what to say during the call, i dont know how to start a sentence saying i want to die. Theres too much to say. And its too tedious to explain everything. Its been a year since i last called cause i dont like talking in general.

Btw Does anyone have any experience with antidepressants? If so, does it work in any way?

Just a quick dumb rant, im not feeling that suicidal tonight.
