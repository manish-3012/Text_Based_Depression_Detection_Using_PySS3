I want to go to bed and never wake up. Even the most basic of activities have become too difficult.In short... Fuck it. I can't keep doing this shit. Five years ago my mother died. I pulled the plug... she had a stroke and when I turned 18 I decided to pull it. A month later my Uncle died and after another month my Grandmother died. Shit has been difficult to deal with. I moved to NYC three years ago to escape the pain but nothing has changed. And it isn't like I was happy before all that shit happened. I have been depressed and suicidal for as long as I can remember. I have fucked up school ( I'm 23 and can't do basic college) I'm lazy, angry and stupid. I am a drain on people around me and ever single day I think about ending my life. I don't want to watch the bad choices I've made grow to maturity. I've been to psychologists and psychiatrists and so far nothing really clicked. I don't know what to do other than just end my life. I know it would hurt my Girlfriend, Father and Grandfather. So far those are the only reasons I haven't done it yet.
