I need help.I really don't have anyone in my life who really cares about me and it is really getting to me. I am on medication for depression but it doesn't seem to be enough. I feel unloved, uncared for and lonely. I had a VERY close friend recently turn his back on me. Not only was he my best friend, I was secretly in love with him which makes it all the worse. He won't even talk to me anymore. He told me that he was my friend and he would never leave and that we would always be friends. Now I'm having a hard time getting close to anyone and trusting anything people say. He helped me to face and over come the abuse I went through a lot and now he is gone and I have no one. On top of all that, I am very stressed about school. I am in constant fear that I am not smart enough to become the doctor I so deseratly want to be. I find myself sometimes thinking about suicide becasue I feel like I have no hope. I have been made to feel like I can't/don't do anything right. I put on a happy face as much as I can but it is getting to be too much. I don't really have many friends or people who like me. And only one that I can think of that really cares at all. But I am afraid that she will leave if I try to talk to her at all. I feel so terrible that my friend left me after all the promises he made. I feel like I caused it by saying too much and that it was all my fault. I feel like I will never have anyone that special in my life again. Then, on top of all that, I was abused really badly as a child and I have a lot of nightmares so I'm not sleeping well and am plagued by the memories and thoughts of what happened as well as the insults that were thrown at me. I find myself beleiving them more and more. I'm trying to keep trudging along and I have been for about 4 or 5 months. But it suddenly got really bad the past week and I can't take it anymore. I don't know what else to do. Can someone please help me?
