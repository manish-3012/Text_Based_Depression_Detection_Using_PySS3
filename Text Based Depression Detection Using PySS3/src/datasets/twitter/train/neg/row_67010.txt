Not me but what do I do?Got a cryptic text from a long time friend an hour and a half after sent. Wouldnâ€™t respond to texts or phone call. Called 911 for a welfare check around 10:30. Havenâ€™t heard back. No way to contact anyone. Texts go unanswered. Donâ€™t have family phone numbers even though Iâ€™ve known him for 15 years.
