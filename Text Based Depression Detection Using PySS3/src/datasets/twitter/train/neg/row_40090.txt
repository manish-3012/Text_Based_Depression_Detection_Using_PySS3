Going to end it soonI hate for it to be the reality, but the time has come. I developed a severe disability that has continued to destroy my life and livilihood for the past 10 years. I can't get a job due to it and the daily pain is constant

Unfortunately I made the collosull mistake of getting married and having kids. I love them all, but my disability puts me in a perpetual bad mood and I snap and yell frequently at them. They don't deserve that. And it prevents me from providing for my family at all

Fortunately I had the foresight to purchase a substantial life insurance policy in the past, so when I go at least my family will be taken care if

Its grossly unfair that the world has changed in a way to trigger my disbility, and no one cares. No one can help. Its just nevetending pain and dissapointment. Whatever I did to deserve this, I am truly sorry. Perhaps I did nothing and thus is just a testament to the lack of caring that people have for others when they change the laws to ones that trigger pain for people like me. Who knows

I have no idea why i am posting this, i guess I felt like saying goodbye to someone. Goodbye
