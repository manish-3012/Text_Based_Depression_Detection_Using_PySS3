His birthday was on Thursday.William was a sophomore in high school when he made a decision that changed everyoneâ€™s lives forever. I woke up the same night it happened to my brother with an utterly terrified look on his face. He told me that William commit suicide. I didnâ€™t believe him. 
An hour later, it was midnight, and I was laying in bed, scrolling on his Facebook page trying to see if there was any sign he was going to do it. I couldnâ€™t even cry I was so stunned. I was shaking and my heart was pounding, but I was mostly just really really confused. 
William was a family friend. My brother was one of his best friends. They were the same age, and I was in 8th grade. I didnâ€™t know him super well, but every single time I was around him, I was enjoying every second that passed. 
I stayed awake very late that night trying to process what happened. To this day, I still have no idea how he even did it. Some say he hung himself. Some say he put a bag over his head and sealed it shut. Honestly, I donâ€™t really want to know how he did it. That doesnâ€™t even matter. No matter how he did it, the fact is that he did it. 
My life changed forever after that night. Not long after that, I myself was feeling very suicidal for a while. There were times I came extremely close to making that same heartbreaking decision. My mind became so clouded that I completely forgot how devastating it was when he made that decision. Yet, I did something he couldnâ€™t do: I confided honestly in my friends and family and I got professional help. 
Iâ€™m still on Zoloft, and it has really helped me. I wish so badly that he would have tried medication or at least getting help. Who knows; maybe he did try and I was unaware. It can be really, really hard though. Yet, getting help for that wonâ€™t ever be as hard as the pain other people feel if you make that devastating decision. 
Thursday would have been his 19th birthday if he was still here. In a little over a month, it will be the 3 year anniversary of his passing. Today, I remembered that it was his birthday even though it was two days ago. I feel so guilty for forgetting his birthday. To make up for that, I want to share this message with you. 
Please, please donâ€™t make that decision. You are needed, and you are loved. So was William. He couldnâ€™t see that, and you might not see that either. I promise you that itâ€™s true. I was deeply effected by his passing as were many others, and many people will be deeply effected by yours. Suicide doesnâ€™t end the pain, it merely puts it onto somebody else. I care about you, William would have cared about you, and your friends and family care about you. Please donâ€™t do it.
