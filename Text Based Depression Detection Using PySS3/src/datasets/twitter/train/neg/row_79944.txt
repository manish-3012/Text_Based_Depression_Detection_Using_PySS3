Don't know what to even do anymoreI feel like I've been clinging on to fake ideas and desires that arent real. There isn't any meaning in anything I've been doing for the past few years and I've just been wanting to end it. I feel like i'm clinging to these ideas as a means to give myself meaning or motive but I know im just thinking this just because I have nothing else.
My dreams can never come true and I don't even feel comfortable in my own house anymore. I know I'm being kind of vague but I just feel like falling asleep for good right now.
