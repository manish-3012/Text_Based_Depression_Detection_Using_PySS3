Mercury poisoningMy dad works at a lab and I took a bottle of mercury from it. Not sure if this is the kind that can kill you, but I'm desperate at this point, and probably too much of a coward to kill myself some other way. Right now I'm sitting in my bedroom listening to birds chirping outside, and all I can think about is how it'll taste. Should I be ready to gag from it? Throw up?

 I'm having second thoughts. Maybe I'm too much of a coward to even do this. I guess I'll edit this post if things don't go according to plan.
