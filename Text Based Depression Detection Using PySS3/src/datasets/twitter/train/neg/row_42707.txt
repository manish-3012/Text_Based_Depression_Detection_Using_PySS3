My girlfriend plans to commit suicide in a year's time and I'm struggling to talk her out of ithey r/SuicideWatch. been a while. my girlfriend plans to commit suicide on the 14th of February, 2020. Due to certain circumstances, on that day itself, there isn't much I can do besides calling an ambulance or police on her address or getting others to try to intervene. However, it's not like its a fixed date either, and my anxiety's been acting up.

She seems to be fixated on death, and regardless of how much I try to talk her out of it she simply seems to rebut everything or "future guilt trip" me. I've been trying my best for several months now to convince her otherwise, but having been in a similar position in the past, the mentality she possesses is understandable and the regular advice simply won't work.

I understand it requires a lot of courage to commit suicide, but how do I convince her to use that courage to keep living on? I don't want her to keep living just because of our selfish needs and not wanting to feel pain when she's gone, but because she has so many opportunities and things to live for.

Please help, thanks.
