I plan to kms right after graduating collegeI am only in the first year of medschool but I decided to graduate it and then kms. I really hate myself, I REALLY REALLY do, I see myself as ugly, fat and stupid although no person considers that I am that, but for me other's opinions of me doesn't matter, mine does and I have a veeery poor opinion of myself. I want to kms after college because I am gay, I am sure that I will probably die as a virgin who never even had a kiss because I didn't meet any gay guy irl so far and honestly doubt that anyone would be with me. But maybe at least people won't remember me with disgust, if I finish college and not get married nor even date they would be suspicious and assume that I'm gay, if I suicide then they would think because I had depression, in both cases they would consider me mentally ill but the later would be more "socially acceptable".  I feel like I was always a disappointment to my parents, they ALWAYS complained about something and even if I did the opposite they still complained and they only ever cared about their reputation and honestly I truly believe they would prefer a dead son over a gay son because they made such homophobic remarks when asking me if I were gay because I wasn't dating, but I was antisocial specifically to make it look like that's the reason and not because I'm gay. I had a big crush on a guy from another country but he is ignoring me now, I don't think he ever liked me and ... why would he? No one else does. I will just focus on studying and training while being as antisociable as possible  to get through college before finally ending my torment and dying in peace. Some may ask "why not do it now?" The answer is that I would look like a failure, it would make me looks like I couldn't handle college, but if I finish it and pass the final exam with a big grade then it would look like I accomplished something, like I wasn't the complete failure I daily feel that I am.
