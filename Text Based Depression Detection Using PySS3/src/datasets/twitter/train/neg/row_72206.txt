Idk why Iâ€™m like thisIt was just a casual night with my parents and we were discussing random topics while watching tv, a friend told me a girl I was interested in wasnâ€™t into me earlier that day but itâ€™s nothing new, Then the topic of me being depressed/ suicidal came up. I donâ€™t ever feel comfortable enough to fully explain to them why I feel the way I do because itâ€™s extremely shallow and self centered. I know I should be grateful for my life and the great friends I have but itâ€™s just not there. So anyways I ended blowing up on my mom saying things like â€œIâ€™ll never take your advice because itâ€™s seriously the dumbest shit Iâ€™ve ever heard.â€ Her advice was basically telling me to keep busy and you wonâ€™t think about it much. The thing is the problem doesnâ€™t go away if you just ignore it and Iâ€™ve tried doing that for most of my life but it hasnâ€™t worked, I had a therapist for approximately 6 months but then she ended up saying she feels like she can no longer help me and gave me other places to try.  So any advice she tries to give me Iâ€™ve heard before. After I just went to my room and tried to keep my mind off it. Then 15 min later I heard my mother crying in her room. And Iâ€™m just a Fuckinh mess, I really donâ€™t know what wrong with me at all. I donâ€™t have love for my family as most normal people do but I donâ€™t hate them either. I just wish my existence was erased or I could die without it effecting them. Sorry this was more of a rant than anything intelligent
