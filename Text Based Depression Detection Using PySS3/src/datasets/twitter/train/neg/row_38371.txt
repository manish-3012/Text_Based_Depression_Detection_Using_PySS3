Homicidal ThoughtsThis is scaring the shit out of me.

I think I've genuinely gone insane.  After 2 years of having thoughts of self-harm and killing myself, the anger is beginning to stem off and I feel an incredible sense of hatred towards people.

I just want someone willing to listen.  Everyone I know left me.  Either ignoring me or letting me know I was unwanted.

I was in the process of seeking professional help multiple times but it never resolved.  I feel like even those in the medical sector don't give a shit about me.

The thought of ending my life now seems like a logical decision because I'm afraid of what I'll do if I don't.
