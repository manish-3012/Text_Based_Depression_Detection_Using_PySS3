Just have to hang on till the end of this monthSchool has been very difficult for me this semester. I started at a new college, I declared my major and my classes are heavy. I have a lot of unpleasant things going on at home. Iâ€™m working part-time. Iâ€™ve just got to make it till the 27th, then Iâ€™ll be on Thanksgiving break and the semester will be over soon after that. 

Itâ€™s taking a lot out of me to keep going, but I have to remember that the Christmas tree will be going up later this month and that always makes me happy. I just have to keep going.
