EmptyI'm empty. I'm alone. I'm tired of life and just want it to end. Why do I wake up? Why can't I just lie down and give up and be done with this waste of an existence. I noticed my posts were angry today before I noticed that the emptiness inside was eating me up today. Just a bit ago I was holding my knife in my hands without realizing it, thinking, 'why not?' I still can't think of a reason. I'm tired of making the motions, acting like I care, or that I want to be in this world. If I had a gun I wouldn't even be typing this now, it would all just be over. I want it to all just be over. My life is just sliding by day to day. Existing instead of living. I have nothing to live for. Nothing I care about. Nothing to exist for. I am nothing. The world will lose nothing the day I'm gone, so why stay? Why exist? Just to suffer? Is that my purpose in life, to suffer? Well, I quit. I'm done. Please, just let me die and be forgotten. If I had my way, people would forget I ever existed. Just an empty space where my empty life existed. Why? Why? Why? In the end my please are empty too. I know they won't be answered. I know tomorrow I will still exist, but I don't want to. I just want to be as empty as I feel. To be nothing, then maybe I'll be at peace.
