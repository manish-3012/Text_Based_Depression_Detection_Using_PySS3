I love you more than I love myselfIf I wasnâ€™t with you I canâ€™t picture me with someone else. And when we separate itâ€™s like weâ€™re under spells cause when we hurt each other we come back to help each other heal. You say Iâ€™m crazy but at least you know my love is real, and your crazy too thatâ€™s why they say love is hell. And itâ€™s forever so I hoped you never up and bail cuz if you leave me for someone you will get someone killed.
