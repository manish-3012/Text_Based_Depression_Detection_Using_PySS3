My dad is blaming me for hitting a pole. Instead of helping me figure out what insurance I had he'd rather have my credit score fucked for 7 years.My dad is selfish. He'd rather have my credit score fucked over instead of talking to the insurance about liability charges. But the only thing I'll give him on this is that he doesn't remember what insurance he had. I doubt he'd do any leg work to help figure it out because it doesn't benefit him. And he was running from bill collectors his whole life. He was an ex-gambler who screwed over my moms credit. He doesn't care about credit and doesn't realize how important it is.



Why won't help? Because he's selfish. He thinks the "car insurance payments will skyrocket" so he just assumes let the bill sit on my credit report for 7 years and then "it drops off" With bad credit I have nothing. With bad credit I can't rent an apartment or get a job. I'd rather be fucking dead than have bad credit. 


I can't even afford to eat. And my dad won't even help me with this insurance shit. I want to die. He only cares about himself.
