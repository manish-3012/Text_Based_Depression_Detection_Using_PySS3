Rethinking sucideNow that I helped people out. I realized sucide is definitely not the right answer. Yes, I suffer from sucide ideations and depression. But I refuse to lose this fight called life. I just need to create a strong mindset and ignore my emotions and live by faith in myself, or a greater being. I want to help out humanity. I can't stop living until my time comes.
