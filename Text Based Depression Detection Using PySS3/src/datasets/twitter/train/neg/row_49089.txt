I can't get any helpI can't afford a therapist, don't qualify for it for free. Doctors I've seen have shooed me away. Suicide hotlines don't do anything. They just say "noooo don't do it you have so much to live for"

No I fucking don't. I have no prospects. I destroy everything I touch. I'm evil. I harm everyone around me. No friends. Family that hate me. Fat (inb4 "just lose weight" it's medical, you think I haven't tried?). Ugly.  Offers of "help" are just "hey I'll listen" but they don't really care. Every time I try and speak out I get swatted down like an annoying fly. Then once I'm dead everyone will ask "why didn't he say anything?"
BECAUSE YOU WOULD NEVER LISTEN. YOU KIND OF PEOPLE NEVER DO. My life has been shit for the last 10 years. If "it will get better" fucking when? Because 10 years is a long fucking time. 

I just want someone to care.
