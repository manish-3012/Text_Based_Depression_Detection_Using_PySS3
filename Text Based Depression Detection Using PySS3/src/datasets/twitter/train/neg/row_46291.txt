I'm sorryHi whoever is reading this, first of all I apologize for you stumbling onto my post. Second i need to ask you a favor, if you would be so kind as to read this whole post, it is my legacy, my last words, my last presence. 

I am currently 19 years old, turning 20 in a few months. My dad passed away when I was young. I had no mom. I have no family here. I have no siblings. No friends. 

I volunteered a lot. I worked 2 jobs. I went to school. I was a loner, a "weird guy", a loser. 

I struggled with depression and anxiety all through my life. This year I have never been more tired than before. Its tiring living your teenage years by being an adult. I never went to parties, never celebrated my own birthdays, never went out with a girl, never had steak because I would not be able to afford it. 

It is always a constant struggle of balancing between my work, my bills, my studies. I really thought I could do it. It was silly of me to think so. This is my last goodbye. I have no one to say it too except strangers over the Internet. Thank you for reading. 

If you must know, I will be ODing myself on pills. No one will notice I'm gone. Good bye.
