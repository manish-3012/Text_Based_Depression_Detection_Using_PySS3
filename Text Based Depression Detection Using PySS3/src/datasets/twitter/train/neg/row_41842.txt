Donâ€™t know what to doIâ€™m so tired of living and fighting. I donâ€™t know what to do... i cut myself two weeks ago. I have been out of the mental hospital for a month now. I take medicine and go to therapy. I go twice a week. Iâ€™ve tried to kill myself more than ten times. Iâ€™m in high school and I cut myself at my school and now I have to be supervised all the time. My school doesnâ€™t have the resources to so Iâ€™m afraid that they will get tired of trying to keep me safe... I just want to give up... I feel empty, depressed, scared, worthless, like I let everyone down, a burden, a failure, a disappointment, like everything is my fault, and like Iâ€™m a mistake... I canâ€™t do this... Iâ€™m sorry this is a long post... I donâ€™t feel strong or like Iâ€™m capable of living and being on my own in the future...  Iâ€™m blind and thatâ€™s partly of why I feel depressed. Iâ€™ve been abused sexually physically verbally emotionally and psychologically. I have been abused by my friends and exes. I have also been bullied.  I have gotten sexually assaulted and abused sense my freshman year of high school. I am a senior in high school. I am so tired and afraid of being and feeling the way I do. I also self harm. For those of you who are reading this, Iâ€™m sorry you all read this long post.  Iâ€™m sorry for everything.
