HelpI was determined to die this morning. I took 3000 mg of Neurontin which I thought would be enough to make me pass out without causing damage if I failed. But I couldn't pass out. I feel strange. I feel scared. I have one thing to live for tonight and I have to make it through the next ten hours. After that I don't know what I'm going to do. I'm so scared.
