I've never felt like to commit suicide than everRecent years has been hard on me and mainly my pet dog is what my happiness comes from but he's getting old. I hate to face it but he'll die soon. The thought twists my stomach. Been getting bad grades going to summer school. Parents find every reason to morally ruin my mood because of it. Been thinking of going to the Manhattan bridge and jumping off. This post is pretty irrelevant, but I hate my life more than ever. Everytime they bring it up or teachers like to constantly bring up how I'm a fucking failure I just beat my stomach until it wrenches with pain and I lay on the floor for hours until it goes away. I feel like we're never gonna be truly happy, happiness is either just some giant fucking troll that God likes to send out because it gives him a good laugh after he takes it away or happiness doesn't exist. I've decided that the moment my pet dog dies I will kill myself. All I want is a way to end everything. I've figured that 4-5 terrifying seconds after jumping off the Manhattan bridge for an eternal bliss is a steal, best bargin in my life. I wish that things could've been different that out of 40 trillion sperm cells that I wasn't born. Not sure if god exists but if he does he's definitely the most biggest troll in the universe. Again this post is probably really stupid but I just wanted to get my word out.
