I donâ€™t understand why no one believes that i genuinely want to die.â€œoh youâ€™ll look back on that and laughâ€ 

â€œwell you just want to not feel what youâ€™re feeling, itâ€™ll passâ€ 

or even just straight up â€œno you donâ€™tâ€ when i just said i fucking did. 

they make it seem like itâ€™s just a silly thing to say. like life is so great and that iâ€™ll eventually understand that. why donâ€™t they understand that regardless of how much my circumstances change, life will always be miserable. I will constantly have to work, and to be able to afford any more than necessities iâ€™d have to work so much that iâ€™d never have time to enjoy it. and i donâ€™t even know if i can get or hold a job. probably not, iâ€™ve failed at every single thing ive ever needed to do in life. i havenâ€™t even finished high school because iâ€™m so pathetic that i used to just run out of school crying everyday. I have no life skills, no outstanding character traits, nothing to give any reason to think iâ€™ll succeed in life. while yes my current situation has a lot to do with why i want to die, even looking past that and into the future... i canâ€™t see anything good. I just want to die, life isnâ€™t good now or ever, i donâ€™t see why thatâ€™s hard to understand.
