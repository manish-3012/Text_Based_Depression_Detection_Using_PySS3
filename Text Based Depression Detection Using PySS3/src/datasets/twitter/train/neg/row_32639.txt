Why?Maybe Iâ€™m depressed but Iâ€™m not sad. Im essentially two different people when Iâ€™m with friends Iâ€™m hopeful, optimistic and caring but as soon as Iâ€™m alone I find Iâ€™m emotionless and really just donâ€™t care if Iâ€™m alive at all. basically I just feel tired of being alive and have constant thoughts of suicide. Wtf
