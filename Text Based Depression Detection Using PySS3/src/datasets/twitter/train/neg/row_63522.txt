Got drunk and tried to do something crazy to feel alive again.I was at my uni pub the other night, i tried to steal an item as a trophy of some sort, the security guards (three of them) cornered me and pushed me against the wall, one strangled me, bare in mind im very small and i did not resist. That led on to me having a panic attack i told them to strangle me tighter and hit me, i wanted to die, what made it worse, was that my flatmates all watched me having an episode, one friend tried to calm me down, being drunk i told him i attempted suicide because of my depression and he took me back to my room told me to sleep it off. i couldn't sleep i just felt like i was the lowest piece of shit, so i tied a noose and tried to hang myself again, the wire i used wasnt strong enough and i just got the shitty end of the stick again, things just keep getting worse and i have left it for so long to get help. i dont know what to do.
