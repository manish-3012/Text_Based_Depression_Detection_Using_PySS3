I really, really want to dieI don't know what to do. Nobody seems to love me. There's only one person who ever has and I constantly feel like I'm failing her. My mother screams at me and compares me to my ex, who scarred me badly, my friends keep leaving me and my life in general is just falling apart. I can't help myself and I feel so useless. My parents think my mental health issues are excuses to not do anything even when I really just have 0 motivation. My best friend is wonderful and I love her more than anything, to the point where she's the strongest reason I'm still alive, but I vent to her so often and I feel like such an asshole. My emotionally manipulative ex did this to me, venting to me too much and saying she wanted to die or she was going to cut herself, I never do anything that extreme to my best friend but I feel like I'm being my ex anyway. I feel like a failure constantly and like a terrible person and there are people in my life that call me a terrible person too. I really think I am. I want to die so badly. I feel scared to do it and I don't know any good methods. I don't want to be in pain I just want to go away and never come back, which is probably selfish, but I don't care. I just want to die. The only things stopping me are my fear of death and the fact I'll hurt my best friend and I don't know if that's gonna be enough for much longer. Please help me
