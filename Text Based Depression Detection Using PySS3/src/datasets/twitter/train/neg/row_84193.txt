Birthdays and Christmas are coming. My anxiety is through the roof and I feel like I am running a million miles toward a brick wall and about to be hit by a freight train. I just want it to STOP!I have always felt like I will end things myself.  If you read the title u can see how I'm feeling. I have no idea how Im going to make it through this month. I have 3 kids birthdays before Christmas and then all 4 kids for Xmas and I have $41. I don't know how anything is getting paid. I'm freaking out and I just want it to stop. I don't want to go through it anymore and I don't want to disappoint my kids. It's too much.
