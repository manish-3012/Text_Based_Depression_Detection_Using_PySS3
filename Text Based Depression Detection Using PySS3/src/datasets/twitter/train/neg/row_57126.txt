you donâ€™t have to be depressed to commit suicideI think itâ€™s really interesting how everyone has this concept that you have to be sad or depressed to want to kill yourself. I mean... sometimes you just get tired of waking up and dealing with the same bullshit EVERY SINGLE DAY. 
Every time I get in my car I contemplate crashing it... Iâ€™m a young adult and have felt this way since I was a teenager. Will I feel this way forever? Maybe thatâ€™s just the way Iâ€™m meant to go out? Iâ€™m not sure? Any advice reddit friends? 
I just donâ€™t feel like I have a place or purpose ya know; like maybe Iâ€™d do everyone a favor by following though what Iâ€™ve thought out so many times before.
