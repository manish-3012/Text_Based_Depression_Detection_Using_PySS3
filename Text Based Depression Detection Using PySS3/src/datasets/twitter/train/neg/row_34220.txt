I hope I slip away in my sleepI'm slipping away in almost every aspect of my life. My peers are moving ahead while I'm struggling to get up and fight my demons. 

Every railing I check to see if it's high enough. I hope a truck runs me over at every intersection. I used to have medication but I haven't refilled them in about a year and am embarrassed to ask for more since I haven't seen the doctor in a long time. I don't think I can go through the whole ordeal of getting another prescription again. It was so hard to see counselors and doctors for weeks on end. Even if I did, the effects won't kick in soon enough for this to stop. 

I'm in my last year of college but nothing from class is sticking. I'm lost and confused and have no energy to figure it out. I'm slacking in all my projects and class work. I've been failing my tests and assignments. I don't think I'll even last another month. 

Any help is appreciated
