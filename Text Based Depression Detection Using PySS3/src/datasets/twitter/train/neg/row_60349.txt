Its my birthday tomorrow24th year in a row of spending my birthday alone. At first it was without friends or family but then I got closer to my brother and made a good friend, but even though they are there physically I still spend them alone. Ive always wanted to have one with a girl. I have always been told that the connection with the opposite gender (or whichever your sexual preference) is always so much different than just a friend or family connection. Someone who actually wants to be there with me on my birthday to celebrate. I've wanted to die now for 8 years and it always gets worse on my birthday. I remember 5 years ago thinking maybe in 5 years I will have someone to spend it with. The only way I have gotten through it is by telling myself maybe in time something will get better, and it never does. Not for lack of trying though, not one of those people who thinks woe is me nothing good happens because I expect things to magically go my way without any effort. Just tired of the struggle. Not sure how much longer I can put on the fake smile.
