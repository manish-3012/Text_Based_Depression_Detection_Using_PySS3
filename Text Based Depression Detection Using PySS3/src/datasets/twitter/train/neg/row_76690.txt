goodbye I'm so sorry for my actions and words when I'm with all of you, sorry for see me in my worst moment's really I'm so sorry for express my self in the worst way possible, sorry for make you cry if I did but I just can't hold all this darkness and selfishness inside me.
Thanks to everyone who tried to help me, I really appreciate all your help but it's just for a while that keeps me moving forward with all of you, in those moments I was really happy and thankful because I didn't realize those friends I have are good people and I really feel that I don't deserve them, they deserve someone more happy and more socially with them, I don't know what they will think of me when I say goodbye to everyone but I know that they will keep moving forward without me because they are more stronger that myself, so know that I said what a had to say I'm leaving to go to sleep for a while.
