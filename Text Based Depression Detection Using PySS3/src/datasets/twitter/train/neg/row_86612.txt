being short makes me wanna kill myselfheck, i am not even that short i am 5'7 to '8 at 17, living in Romania. but still, human nature fucks me up. we think so much and we are so rational yet guess what our genitalia is still in 50000BC, looking for the best pair of genes that will give us long legs in order to run from a bear or shit. 
we are still animals and no one seems to want to raise above.
i just wanna end it at times since seemingly if you don't have another 2 inches in height you are suddenly viewed as less human by everyone. fuck this.


fuck this.

FUCK. THIS.
