I'll get trolled, I know. Posting here is asking for it...but oh well.I feel really empty inside. Things are fine in my real life, I've been accepted to my next degree, I'm about to graduate with honors...I have a lot to be grateful for. 

I just feel lonely. I have no one to talk to, and I just recently relapsed into selfharm after a few months. I know posting here is asking for trouble, so throwaway it is, but I had to let it out somewhere. I just want to pull a trigger or slit my throat. I'm tired of smiling...and I'm tired of knowing that me feeling this way is bullshit. I should be happy. My life is fine. 

Edit: there seems to be some confusion about why I feel lonely. I have a pretty active social life that doesn't suffer because of school work, I just feel disconnected and like I really have no one to reach out to. Or maybe I just don't want to reach out to them because they've got their own things to deal with.
