I'm sorry and goodbyeI can't do this anymore. I had a panic attack last night and my mother just verbally abused me and threatened me to lock me up in an asylum, so i'd rather die now than spend the rest of my life locked up just for being depressed. Thank you all for being so kind with me, even if my time here was short. I hope we can meet again someday in our next lives, and stay strong. Don't make the same mistake as me. Goodbye.
