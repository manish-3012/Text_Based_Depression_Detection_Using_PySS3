I don't want to die but I wouldn't mind if I die.I don't want to die but sometimes I just wish to sleep and not wake up, or die in car crash and better if someone kill me. I think about ny death every night and sometimes I just feel like I am too curious about death or what will happen after it.

Anyone else feels same way ?
