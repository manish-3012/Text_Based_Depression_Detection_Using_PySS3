My grades aren't good enough to go anywhere, and even if they were, I'd be going somewhere aloneGetting yet another ~50% on an exam just reminds me that I'll never be the doctor I want to be. I'm incapable of writing as well as I need to in order to create a career out of that. I envy the friends of mine that work dead end jobs but live in apartments together and love life.


Plus, tomorrow's V day, and it's my 19th in a row that I'll spend alone. The idea that anyone could find me remotely appealing is as alien as anything. Nothing would be stranger than feeling loved.


I'll wake up tomorrow after drinking myself to sleep and go to classes like a good little student, fueled by habit and responsibility, but I won't feel anything resembling joy. I don't even have the time to write anymore, which is the only thing I've wanted to do lately.

I don't know what to do. Being tipsy doesn't help.
