I don't know what to do with myselfI live in a abusive household and it's really not helping my depression. 

I have a online boyfriend who I talk to all the time but I feel like I'm just constantly annoying him but he's such a sweet man.

I've gotten help at school but it's not really working since I can't just open up and say hey I cut I have a horrible household because that will get my parents sent to jail or me sent to a psych ward.

Thanks if you respond if information.
