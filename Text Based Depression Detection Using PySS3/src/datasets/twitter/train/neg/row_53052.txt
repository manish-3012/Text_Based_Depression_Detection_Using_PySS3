I canâ€™t even kill myselfI canâ€™t even kill myself. For months I planned the entire process. Wiping my PC of evidence Iâ€™m depressed, wiping my phone history, destroying all my journals. Even making the attempt out to be an accident. I drove to an empty parking lot at about 12 oâ€™clock last night. I made sure all my windows were shut and the AC of my car was turned off. I then released the toxic gases while I played a movie. I wonâ€™t explain the toxic substances I used for obvious reasons. This was suppose to be a peaceful death, and it was for the most part. But not in the way you might think. I could feel myself slowly dying. It could be best described as being in a chokehold. I could still breathe but my body started to lose all sensation. I kept dozing off and waking back up just praying I would peacefully fall asleep. But no, Iâ€™m a pussy so I managed to swing my car door open and toss my body onto the pavement. I laid there for several minutes gasping for oxygen. Alone. I canâ€™t even kill myself and leave this horrible life. Iâ€™ll have to wait until Iâ€™m 21 so I can just blast my fucking head off.
