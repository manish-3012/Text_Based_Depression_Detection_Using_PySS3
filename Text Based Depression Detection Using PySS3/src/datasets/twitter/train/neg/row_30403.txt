I want to give details but im too unmotivated.Pretty much, i have horrible dibilitating disorders and horrible unsupportive selfish family and im stuck in this horrible lifestyle and every time i get a little sliver of hope for a better life, life just throws another big pile of shit on top of me keeping me stuck in my shitty lifestyle. Im destined for constant failure through life and and it makes things extra fucked up when im completely fucking insane on top of it all. So i just want to give up. It isnt worth trying anymore
