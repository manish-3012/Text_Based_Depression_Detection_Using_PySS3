Iâ€™m a pharmacy technician. It would be so easy.I have access to tons of drugs. I work in an in-patient hospital pharmacy, and it would be so easy for me to steal some IV tubing, and take a large bottle of Propofol. Let it drain into me, and I could just fall asleep forever. I think about this every single day I work.

I wonder if I should quit? Maybe Iâ€™m putting myself in danger, being this close to hazardous medications when my mind isnâ€™t really right. The more I have these thoughts, the less I trust myself. I hold narcotics every day. How easy would it be to pop in all these opioids and call it a day. Guess Iâ€™m just scared that if for some reason I fail, Iâ€™d be fired from my job. And I donâ€™t really want to wake up in the same hospital I work in. How embarrassing.
