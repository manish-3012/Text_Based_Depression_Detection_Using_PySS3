I'm crying and I don't know what I'm doing.So, yes I posted like just yesterday but it's already gone down so no one usually looks that far.

Right now I'm crying... It's hard to breath and my face is blotchy and I realized how the two people I only talk to are just busy and it's not their fault.

It made me realize I have no one else.

I'm sitting here crying in my room at 11:48pm. I'm breaking down.
I can;t breath the greatest and I'm dizzy from all the loss of breathing from this breakdown. This is the 2nd breakdown and I had another one yesterday. I don't know what to do.

edit; i have breakdowns very often over the smallest of things.

I just wish there was someone I could talk to everyday and actually get along with and people who would actually stop what they're doing and stay up with me to help me like I would with them. But egh.
