This subreddit continues to shock meI read some mind blowing stories that make my problems and "depression" look like it's nothing...Can such bad things really happen to people or are they trolling?I can't believe that life can get so bad , How?As I keep participating here I get even sadder and it hurts I need to unsubscribe but on the other hand I don't want to do it
