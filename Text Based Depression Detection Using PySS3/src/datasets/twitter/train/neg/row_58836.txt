All that I love has been washed away.I am alone

With the current
Of heartbeats
and stone

It shreaks
In my ears
And my bones

Viola 
babbles 
Atone

All of my friends have drifted away, I'm chronically ill, in pain, and unable to do the things that make me happy. My wife has someone else to lean on if I go. I'm just not needed and trapped in my house.

I need someone who I won't burden to talk to.
