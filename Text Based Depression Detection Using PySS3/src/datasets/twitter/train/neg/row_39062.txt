I've ruined my life beyond repair because of a stupid teenage mistake.I know how this sounds but give me a chance. At 19, I'm 23 now. I was walking down a street and I exposed myself to a jogger. Little did I know at the time that the mistake would have long-lasting implications. I gratefully completed and paid everything I was punished with. Thankfully I wasn't put onto any sex offender registry, however, ever since this mistake, I cannot find work, I had a cancer diagnosis that I cannot pay off, I have Medicaid paying for it at the moment but this means I can't work unless the job has health benefits to pay for my treatment. This mistake will singlehandedly destroy my entire life. I have a girlfriend that loves me dearly but I feel as if I need to break up with her not because I don't love her any longer but because I feel I will do nothing but be a burden on her and the kids we could have in the future. Would I be wrong to assume I just could end it all? Just one quick action and it's all over...eternal sleep? Please talk me out of this.
