I would rather commit suicide than go through therapy againTitle really says it all. I just donâ€™t want to deal with anything like it ever again. I was abused as a child and sat with my first therapist at 5 years old. Spent the next 12 years on medication in therapy. The ideation never stopped and once I made it to my 20s I was just lost, I didnâ€™t expect to make it this far. Iâ€™m now 30 and the idea of my life being torn apart due to â€œgetting helpâ€ fills me with so much anxiety that Iâ€™d rather end it than go through all of that as an adult. This scares me because I know I need help but I donâ€™t want to reach out and be institutionalized. I donâ€™t even want to call a help-line in fear of them contacting the cops. I just feel alone. Anytime I try and talk about this stuff Iâ€™m told to reach out and get help, but Iâ€™m terrified of what that will do. Thoughts? Anyone dealing with something similar have some insights? I really appreciate any feedback.
