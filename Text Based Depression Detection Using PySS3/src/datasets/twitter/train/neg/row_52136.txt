I stood with the rope tied around my neck for the first time tonight.This isn't even a throwaway and I don't care at this point. I don't know what to do i've been depressed since the beginning of highschool all the way until the end and now i'm not moving out to go to college with all my friends but living at home to save money, I stupidly did things with a girl to try to help it but it ended up making me hurt more and I don't feel like I have a reason to be here any more. 

I've been depressed for a while and always had have thought of killing myself but tonight was the first time i've gotten up on my chair and tied the rope. I don't matter and i've made too many mistakes trying to solve my depression. I'm closer than ive ever been to just stepping off that cliff.
