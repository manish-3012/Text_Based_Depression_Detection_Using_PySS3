It's hard to think of things to live for these days.And I'm just *tired* of being told it "it could always be worse, you should be grateful" and "well... You'll be okay." This is the loving words of advice and encouragement from the people that are closest to me. Times like this I feel a million miles away from everyone, I'm just disconnected somehow. I can't find a good job that pays well, I can't find a direction to go, I'm facing rejection in every corner. My counselor, my only sense of reason sometimes, completely forgot about my session and postponed me 3 more weeks. I don't want to die. I know that I could be happy in the future. But I need this pain to end. Sometimes I think I was just mistake, never meant to be here anyway.
