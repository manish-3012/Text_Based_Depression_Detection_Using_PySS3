My plan for the next yearI'm a 19 year old guy and I live withy parents. But I need to get the fuck out. So I'm going to save up as much money as I can for the next few months and leave as far away as I can and I'm not going to tell anyone. I will probably end up homeless and probably kill myself anyways but whatever. If it doesn't work out for me I'm going to kill myself on July 5th. That's the day my dog died 3 years ago.

So hopefully this all works out but I know it probably won't.
