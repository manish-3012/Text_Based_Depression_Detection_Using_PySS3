SchoolTbh I never figured i'd be posting here but I can see myself slowly losing my sanity and more than a couple times a week start to think about just ending it.

I'm in my first semester of college and honestly can't see myself making it through another year.  I'm not any good in my classes and there are a few I might not pass.  I already have enough issues with anxiety and mostly spend the time alone trying (and failing) to stay ahead of classes (for example it's 3am and I have a class tomorrow morning).


I am not yet completely down that dark road but I can see myself there in a very short time.  I figured I'd slowly write a note of sorts, sign it with my PGP certificate and see where i'm at when I finish it.  I've already thought of a way which would be 100% effective (That was actually the easy part).

Anyone who says university is the best time of your life is full of shit.  It's a good time sometimes but it will be a miracle if I survive it.

Anyway, just needed to get the off my chest.  Figured this would be a decent place I wouldn't get downvoted to hell or my post nuked for having a throwaway.  I might update or something, depends on how busy everything is.
