It's always the same story for everyone I used to know.I befriend them. I get to know 'em. I learn to care about them. I get attached to them, call 'em my best friend, forget what life is like without them. Then they leave, because of me.

I can no longer trust anybody (even my own parents,) which means no one to talk to about my endless list of other issues, no one to supplement my main coping mechanisms, and I no longer want to be here. I give up.
