How do I get over heartbreak so I don't kill myself?It's not just a puppy love type breakup. Not invalidating anyone going through that, because I know that also sucks.

It's years of consistently being told I am too unwanted, too ugly, too everything for love. And the pain of having the first person I was vulnerable with for years tell me  they used me and I am nothing.

I can't afford therapy.
