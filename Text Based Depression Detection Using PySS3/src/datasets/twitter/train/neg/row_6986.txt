I'm going to kill myself this weekendOn the surface everything looks great. I work in the industry I studied for, I have no student debt. I'm respected by my supervisors. I have a small public profile and am looked up to in my community. 

And yet, I'm miserable. For the last six months, every day I leave work I think about jumping off the top of the parking garage. A couple times I've stood on the ledge. On my days off I just sit in bed, I start drinking around noon and don't shower. Hell the only reason I shower during the week is because I don't want to get fired. Not that I care about getting fired, I just don't want to be bored during the day and alone with myself. 

I'm completely alone in the world, I'm miserable every day and I'm tired. I'm going camping this weekend with friends, at some point I'm going to go take a piss in the woods and shoot myself in a way that looks like an accident. I'm so fucking embarrassed I'm almost 30 and I still feel this way, but whatever so it goes.
