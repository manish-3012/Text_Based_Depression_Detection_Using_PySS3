Why is suicide so selfish?Everyone tells me that suicide is so selfish, but why?? I want to die, why can't I just have that. I don't want to endure this anymore; however, if I kill myself, somehow I am the selfish one. I already know I am going to get comments about how I will hurt my family and stuff, but it already hurts me badly enough to be alive. It always feels as if the whole world is against me. How is it not selfish of them to make me endure this? I should be able to do what I want. I never decided to live, so why must I stay alive? I live everyday waiting to die, and there's absolutely nothing I can do to change my situation.
