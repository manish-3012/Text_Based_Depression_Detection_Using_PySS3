I think about suicide daily, but I'm too much of a pussy to do anything about itI really, REALLY just want to die.  I've been depressed for a good 3 years now, and it isn't going anywhere.  I've lost all motivation in school to the point that I literally don't do anything anymore (straight 0s).  I smoke weed every single day, but it's just a false sense of happiness.  I'm never really happy.  I have a good home life, great parents, great friends, but I just feel... empty.  I think about it every day.  To just let go of all the stress in life.  To just give up.  I don't want to be here anymore.  I fucking hate it.  I also have severe unmedicated ADHD that my parents do nothing about.  No medication whatsoever.  I just... I have no work ethic.  Period.  I don't see me getting anywhere in life.  I can't even do schoolwork.  How the FUCK am I supposed to hold down a job?  How am I going to survive?  I just want it all to end.  I've thought about all forms of suicide, and have done several attempts, although I pussy out at the last second.  I've tried hanging myself, but I just couldn't do it.  I had a gun right up to my temple, but I couldn't do it.  I've been on top of buildings, ready to jump.  But I just *couldn't do it*.  I don't want to put my family through a suicide.  I know they love me, and I know it would devastate them.  And that just makes me feel worse.  I have no real shot at happiness.  I just want the pain to go away.  Sorry if this was a bit of a ramble.  I don't have any plans to kill myself anytime soon, so don't worry about that.  I'm just constantly thinking about it.  What it would be like to just quit life.  I don't like it anymore. 


I want out.
