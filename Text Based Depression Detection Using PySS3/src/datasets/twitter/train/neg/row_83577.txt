I dont even want to be happyThe thought that always just finds its way into my head is "i don't want to be happy even, I just know I want to die before im 30". 

I dont have anything. Literally anything to live for. My main goal in life was to have a family, but i just don't think im ever going to have kids because generational trauma is real and i cant possibly imagine doing that to my kids. I thought I wanted to be a teacher, but im so tired and burnt out and thinking about it, I honestly don't think i can handle constantly being a good role model to kids all the time. I don't think ill ever date again because I just drag people down and I ruin the relationships in my life. My degree is useless and I don't enjoy anything.

Literally nothing makes me happy anymore. I used to love anime. Cant motivate myself to watch any. Dogs? Used to research and dream of them. Now? Not really... my family? I am so extremely sad to say that I feel like I don't even feel like I love them...

Im literally shiveling up. I used to be strong and fit and whatever. And everything is gone. 

I just despise life. And it makes me sad because maybe I do care? But I don't??? 

And then life.
What is the purpose of life anyways. So what if im happy? I just don't really care anymore about it. I might believe in Heaven (please don't comment on religion thanks, id rather not have to deal with the âœ¨religion is a fairytaleâœ¨ stuff. Respect beliefs even if you don't belive it, its not that hard), and it used to make me so hopeful about being happy forever. But honestly...whats the point. I'd rather just not. Not exist. Not be here. Just nothing. Id just rather have nothing, be nothing, exist nowhere. Death is so comforting. Just nothing. No afterlife, no suffering, no mundane, no existing. 

I have no motivation to go back onto my meds or do therapy. Im losing motivation to graduate. Im tired. Im exhausted. And I just want to feel absolutely nothing.
