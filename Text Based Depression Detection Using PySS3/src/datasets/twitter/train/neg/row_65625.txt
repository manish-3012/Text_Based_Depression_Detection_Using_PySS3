Tomorrow is my birthday and I just can't take it anymoreThe problem with a birthday is that it's a celebration of the fact that you're alive, and I don't have anything to celebrate. I'm not smart enough, I'm not athletic enough, I'm not sociable enough, I'm just not good enough. I'm a human failure! All I can celebrate is being closer to death, and even if I died, I'm sure it wouldn't matter to anyone.


How do you think people would react if I killed myself tomorrow? I feel really tempted to do it...
