Why does life have to be so difficult?I have no motivation anymore, I feel so tired all the time, I have a goddamn short term memory that Iâ€™ve suffered from all my life, every obstacle I face feels so unclimbable and if itâ€™s not and I fail that only shows how incompetent I am and just keeps on adding to my list of failures. The only thing I accomplished is a high school degree. I canâ€™t do this not only can I not get a job or go back to school Iâ€™m just not cut out to live. It would be so much better I would finally feel free if I could just stab myself in the brain. Or just die in general that would be so much better Iâ€™d finally be freeâ€¦
