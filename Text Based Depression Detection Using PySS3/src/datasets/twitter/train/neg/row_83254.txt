Having suicidal thoughts, worried I might end it.hey anybody who reads this. I'm in my room by myself and im just feeling exhausted. Guess i'm feeling like no one appreciates me much. Some people here on reddit seem to, and that's nice when it happens. But I don't know. im tired. My problems feel petty. I don't know. I guess I just want someone to talk to tonight.maybe this isn't the right subreddit for that, but im legitimately depressed and have been for a long time. No clue what's causing it. it's crippling me. fuck, i need a drink or something. Sorry for being such a downer guys
