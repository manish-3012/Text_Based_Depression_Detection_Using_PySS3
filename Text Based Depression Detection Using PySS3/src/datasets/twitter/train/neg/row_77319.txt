Yoooo, anyone else thinking about this to prevent bedbugs from eating you alive?I'm currently living with these nightmares, and I just wanna kill myself to deprive these bastards of eating on my body.

I walked on the railing of the bridge yesterday to see how it felt, and a police officer stopped me.  I never thought it would be that easy lol.
