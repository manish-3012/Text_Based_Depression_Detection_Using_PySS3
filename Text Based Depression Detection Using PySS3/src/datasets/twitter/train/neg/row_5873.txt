I need helpI am 17 and I've been suicidal severely since last year. I am really scared but sometimes my emotional pain is overwhelming and it makes me want to jump down the balcony immediately. Feeling panicked is too scary and too painful. It's too much for me. There's no one who can help me. This is the last thing I can do. I am desperate.
