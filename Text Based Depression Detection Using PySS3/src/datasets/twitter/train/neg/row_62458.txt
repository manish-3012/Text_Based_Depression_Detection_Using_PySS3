I just can't take it anymore.I posted in /r/rant a while ago hoping it would make me feel better but I just keep falling deeper and deeper into hating myself and everything around me. Everything in that post is still ongoing, only with now with extra shit piled on top day to day.

It's the stupid little things I can't cope with like my Mom telling me I've not washed the dishes properly, or cutting my finger, or trying to put something in the fridge and it falls out, and then trying again and it falls out, and then sitting on the floor crying because I just can't take it anymore. 

Sometimes I wrap my fingers around my throat and squeeze and I feel calmer. I just wonder if I should stop pretending and just do it.
