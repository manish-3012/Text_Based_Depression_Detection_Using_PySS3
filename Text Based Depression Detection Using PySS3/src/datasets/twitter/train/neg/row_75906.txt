4 years4 long years itâ€™s been since I became suicidal. Everyday for the past 4 hours I have wanted to kill myself. That type of shit fucks a person up even more. I canâ€™t get help because Iâ€™m too embarrassed about the way my parents will think of me because of my issues. I honestly wish I could but I just canâ€™t and Iâ€™ve accepted that. Iâ€™ve become numb to the pain.  There is no light at the end of the tunnel. Iâ€™ve given up. I bought a gun 3 separate times with the intention to shoot myself. I could never do it. My time has finally come. This shit hasnâ€™t gotten better in 4 then it never will. Iâ€™m going to kill myself in the summer after my family finishes up the school. I donâ€™t want this cause their grades to suffer. Iâ€™m sorry
