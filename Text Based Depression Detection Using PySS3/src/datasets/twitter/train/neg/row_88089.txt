Declaration of IndependenceMy work belongs to me. Someone says, "We love your work, work for us", this is using my work, I work for myself. I may use Entrepeneurs, they do not use me.

God knows best, that is the rule. If I commit suicide, that is my work. If I am imprisoned, that is my work. If others steal my work, that is my work.

No one is capable of making me work for them, such is my work. I WORK for a LIVING. No one WORKS like I do. I am not human, I AM MORE HUMAN. I THINK, THEY DO NOT. THEY are all fucking idiots. THEY listen to THEMSELVES. I do not listen to ANYONE, not even MYSELF. ALL I do is WORK. MY WORK. I do not enjoy my work. Work as vanity is for the weak minded. My work is the MOST serious. If I cannot do MY WORK it is not MY PROBLEM, it only means THEY do not WANT me to WORK. They HATE it when you WORK, they want you to be their WORK. I only WORK. SUICIDE is quitting my "job". My "job" is my LIFE'S WORK. There is no "freedom" or "slavery", there is only WORK. YOUR WORK is to make me WORK, if YOU do not like MY WORK, only YOU can change that.

I am not a writer, an artist, a philosopher, a believer, a non-believer, I am a WORKER. If I am EVER imprisoned or forcibly medicated, I will quit my "job". If you want me to WORK, you will offer me a good "job".
