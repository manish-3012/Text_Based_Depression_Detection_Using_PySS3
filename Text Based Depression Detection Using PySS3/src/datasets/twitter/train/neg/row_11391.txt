Not sure if this is the right place to ask but I just need to.Sometimes I just have thoughts of how nice it would be to just kill myself or be dead. I'm not suffering from depression and compared to all the people who need an ear on this sub, I have a good life, however, like I said, I just would rather be dead 80% of my day. I was wondering why this could be if any of you could help. I don't think I'm suicidal, but I know I'm a huge failure so far in life and knowing that just makes every day feel long and I just want my short life to end already. My question really is just do any of you know what could be bringing on these thoughts? My doctor says I'm not depressed.
