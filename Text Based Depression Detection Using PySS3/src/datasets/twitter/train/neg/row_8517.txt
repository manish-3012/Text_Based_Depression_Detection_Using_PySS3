Please leave suggestions.My dad lost my cat. My friends all moved or unfriended me. I come home, and get berated for not doing the dishes right away, or getting a B- on a test. I'm 13. I hold n my pain all day at school, and come home and hold it in more. I'm known as the happy, bubbly kid at school. I cry myself to sleep every night. I put my heart out for it to get stomped on. I can't do this anymore. I'm going to go. Somewhere where I am loved. Somewhere I can be free. So tonight, at 1 am EST, i'm going to heaven. It's just the matter of how will I get there. If you have any recommendations for how to die painlessly, that would be nice.
