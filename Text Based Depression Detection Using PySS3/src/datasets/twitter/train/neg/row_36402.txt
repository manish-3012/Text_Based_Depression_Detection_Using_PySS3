Getting my thoughts on paperWe were best friends back then. You moved away from me and I haven't talked to you in many years but I still love you. My life got so sad now. All I do is live in my parents' house. It's an easy life which makes me feel worse. Its just so hard to go outside now. I'm trying to live a normal life, working on hobbies that I pretend to be interested in, and find a partner and move on but it's been so difficult. Someone from our school just killed himself, and I always wonder if I'm next. I'm holding on. Everyone else is moving on but we will see if I can keep going.
