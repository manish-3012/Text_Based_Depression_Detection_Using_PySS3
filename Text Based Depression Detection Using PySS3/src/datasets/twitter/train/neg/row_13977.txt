I cant take it anymoreEveryone hates me at first sight, and they dont give a fck about me when i need them. Sometimes i could be of use but its just fucking sometimes, when its not "sometimes", they dont fucking need me. They dont give a fck about my feelings. All they care about just to get rid of me even tho i dont know wtf i did wrong. They always ignore me like im worse than pile of shit. Acutally almost no one remembers my fucking birthday if it wasnt for facebook bday reminder. I cant even get a therapist or whatever.
Plz tell me the easiest and painless way out.
