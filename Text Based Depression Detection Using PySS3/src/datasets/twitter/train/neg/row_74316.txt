I'm just feel empty...(Sorry for my English, I'm French)
I starting to tell my fuc*ing life. My father had a cancer before I born so, he try with my mother to have a child with operation and I'm here now. When I was 2, he cheated my mother with an another women. My parents are divorced now. I lived with my mother until the day (I had 4 or 5), when I saw all of my "friends" exited the school with they dad, I asked my mother : "Where is my dad?". I regretted now, it's one of my biggest fail of my life. My mom contacted my father and I lived one week with my dad and one week with my mom. When, I was 6 or 7, I've been harassed for 3 years by all of the guys of my school. I tried to kill myself every day. One day, I was just bored of that so I was angry and I sent 3 guys at the hospital. All of my life, I was lonely and, when I was 10, I started to talk with girls and my only 2 friends was 2 girls.

When I was 11, I discovered 2 things : I have asthma and my father is just an asshole (he prefer my notes compared to me) so I don't see him now. When I was 12, I discovered I have schizophrenia. Now, I'm 14 and I have a shitty life. My ex used me for annoying his ex and she doesn't loved me. I have feelings for my best friends (a girl). I tell her my feelings but now, it's like we have never be friends.

It's my fucking life, and I just feel empty. I don't have the strength to kill myself. Now, I just wait the Death take me...
