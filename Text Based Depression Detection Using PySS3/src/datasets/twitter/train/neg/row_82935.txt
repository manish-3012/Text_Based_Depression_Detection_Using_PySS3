Iâ€™m sorryMy whole life Iâ€™ve been that screw up in the family or the kid no one wants to hangout with. I was used to being the friend you could replace after a couple of days of knowing him in class. I started giving up in life cause I knew there would always be someone better than e and I was ok with that. So I spent the last 3 years wanting to be happy, walking away from friend groups cause I knew I would be replaced with someone better. I know I wonâ€™t amount to anything in my life, and I know itâ€™s not alright to be ok with that like iâ€™am now. But Iâ€™m tired fighting, Iâ€™m tired of feeling sick in the head, waiting for someone to help me knowing thereâ€™s no one there to help. Iâ€™m not gonna doing anything rash, or hurt myself, but the thought always come back and the little voice is telling me Iâ€™m worthless. Recently I did find a friend group that hasnâ€™t left me yet, and a friend hugged me. It was weird, I was never really hugged before, even the thought of it was weird. Having someone feel like they genuinely care for me was odd, I spent so much time fearing it because I hurt myself and someone else being happy. But that changed, now I can be happy no longer being afraid of the consequences of it, I wrote this to let you know there is actually hope for happiness. Sure a million people could tell you there own story of how they became happy like I did, but finding happiness is doing it yourself. No one knows how to make yourself happy except yourself, and itâ€™s going to be hard. Youâ€™re gonna want to go back into a dark place but every moment you spend trying and fighting to be happy is a victory In the books.
