My friend keeps talking about how she wants to kill herself and I increasingly feel like there's nothing I can doShe is 23 and has been battling depression most of her life. She's actually taking meds, and has worked with various psychiatrists to try different cocktails, but nothing's working. Also she says it takes a very long time to get an appointment with a psychiatrist with kaiser permanente (her insurance provider).

She has a dog, but says that her dog doesn't bring her relief any more. She just decided to take the semester off (community college), because it was too stressful. She does not have many friends, and she is in the process of breaking up with her boyfriend.

I try my best to balance being there for her and allowing her speak, with offering her gentle suggestions. She does not respond well to either really. My most recent suggestion was volunteering, but she does not want to do that. And she has gotten to the point where she doesn't even like it when I ask her how she is doing.

What can I do? Is there anything I can do? I want her to live so bad, but I don't know what else I can do. I love her so much and I just want her to be okay. Please help. Thank you.
