people who think we don't know what we wantpeople who treat us like we're delusional and don't know what we're saying. people who treat us like we're absolutely brain-fried and delusional and that we need to be "rescued" are some of the most patronizing people on this planet. how could you ever look at someone, especially a person who's in pain, and think that you know what they want better than they do? how much of a god complex do you have? what is the logic here? i could MAYBE give the idea some credence if it was in the wake of an intense but possibly endurable event, like a loss/breakup/etc. but you could give them encouragement rather than saying, "you're out of your mind, and here's what you SHOULD do because i say so." it makes me mad beyond all reason. anyone else feel a similar way?
