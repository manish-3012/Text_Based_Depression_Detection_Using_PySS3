Guilt of losing out on close to $1MM usd from gambling and savings being gone. So far behind in life now and worth absolutely zero. I don't know if I want to recover, I just want to end it all. Money is freedom. Happiness. Opportunity. And I am trapped and suffocating. I gambled away my life. Literally. Earlier  this year I quit my job after having profited several hundred thousand  dollars in investments/margin trading/cryptocurrency. I never took out a  dime. In fact, I chased losses so hard that I lost almost all of my  initial investment and the unrealized gains I made over the course of  the last 15 months or so.

Seriously  consider suicide everyday. Havent worked out in months, I drink a  handle of liquor everyday, and have done so for the past 120 days. I am  so fucking ashamed. I realize I was straight up gambling. And every  single morning I wake up with my subconscious saying you ruined your  life. You're selfish. Reckless. Unreliable. A fuckup.

I  can't take it anymore. I am still unemployed and down to my last  savings until January. My family knows Im suicidal, but they don't know  how bad things really are. I hear comments from them saying, you're  losing a lot of weight, what's going on? Snap out of it. Etc. I've  always struggled with anxiety but now that I've more or less handicapped  myself for the rest of my life financially, I have gone completely off  the edge.

I  don't want to live like this anymore. How the fuck in Gods green earth  did I fuck up so badly? I destroyed my entire 20s of savings, and  retirement. I did everything right in life, paid off my student loans at  22, worked hard, and I betrayed myself out of human greed. I want to  get a 9mm and put it up right next to my temple to pull the trigger.  Even with things as they stand off now, I will be writing off tax losses  until the day I die, as the max reportable per year is $3k usd.
