I need a distractionUmm idk what to say but ive suffered through depression most of my short life and it really hit me hard this christmas season. Idek Why im such a mess, I have a gf friends and a fantastic life for anyone from the outside looking in. Yet I have such a change in attitudes and moods all the time I also feel life is pointless and is death is inevitable why wait till im 70 if i can just die now
