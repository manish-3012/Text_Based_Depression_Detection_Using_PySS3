So what are your reasons for wanting to die?Mine are parents not taking care of me and therapists who chose to destroy me and no one is protecting me or helping me do justice in that regard, so I end up feeling much more demoralized and demotivated to live life in an environment where people choose to abuse others for their own self\-gain

I have never met anyone who did the opposite \- actually moralize me and make a great person out of me
