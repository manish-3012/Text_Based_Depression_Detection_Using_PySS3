Looking for people around me to save me: they do notI am going for death by benzo withdrawal. Iâ€™m aware it might be drawn out and painful and shitty and leave me with brain damage. 

My life is honestly garbage though. I cannot finish university because of the recurrent severe depressive episodes I suffer from. Itâ€™s been almost 8 years. Itâ€™s extremely embarrassing at this point. Itâ€™s not even solely that. Itâ€™s the unprocessed shitload of trauma I have to live with day after day. Itâ€™s the ongoing trauma as well - a brother with autism whose chosen target is me. 

My country is ill-equipped. My mental health team is ill-equipped. 

My mother and therapist know Iâ€™ve stopped two of my anticonvulsant meds cold turkey. My psychiatrist put me on a waiting list. 

Iâ€™ve received treatment in the states. I want to go back because there is no hope for me here. 
At least treatment there isnâ€™t illegal. At least their psych wards arenâ€™t as barbaric as the ones here. 

But thatâ€™s not an option either. I feel like I am being a giant petulant child whenever I have mental setbacks. Iâ€™m tired of people treating me that way.
