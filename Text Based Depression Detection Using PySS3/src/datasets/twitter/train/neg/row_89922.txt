I feel comfortable talking about my plans here since it's anonymousI have a backpack filled with bricks and a padlock to lock the straps across my chest so when I jump off the bridge, I can't panic and whiggle out of the straps. That's how I plan to go. I don't have a set date yet, but given how things have been going, I can't handle much more.
