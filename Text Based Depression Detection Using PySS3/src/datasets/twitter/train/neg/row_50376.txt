Frustrated with life...Is the society really raising in terms of their ideology and the way they see the world?
I don't find any growth in the mentality of people. They still think girls are meant to be someone's wife and to devote their life on their husband.
Dude!! Wakeup... We have our own life too we girls can also be ambitious we can also have a dream to make a identity of our own.
It hurts when your own parents don't understand you. It feels like it would be best if I end my life.
Every thought is a battle, every breath is a war, and i don't think i m winning anymore..
