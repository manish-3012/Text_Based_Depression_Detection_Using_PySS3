feeling pretty lost.my life has not gone well these past 3 years with an exception of one person, i used to cut like 1 a month, ive lived with my dad my whole life and things have ever gone well there he used to beat the shit out of me but im not really complaining about that, its the fact that he chose a woman he just met over his son, so when i turned at this past february he changed the locks, she sold my ps3 for drugs and i was homless for about a month, till i talked to my mom i moved to florida (from ohio) left behind all my friends which have always been more family to me than my actual family has and the girl that i love (that one person i mentioned earlier) since i got here i thought things were going well i got a 10000 dolar check from S.S and thats when shit went down hill besides the fact im so far away from the only person i care about, iconstantly fight with my mom now, (she made me give her 5k of that check btw (which ended up being 8k after i got another one) because she knows how to push my buttons and treats me like im five, she smashes all my shit up and twlls me im worthess( so did my dad and his girlfiend) (last night she tried to smash my flat screen) id run away but i have no where left to go i have no where i can stay im 1800miles away from the place i call home, i only have one friend here but i couldnt stay with him, and that girl i mentioned earlier talks about getting married but then constantly changes her mind the next day and is basicly raisingher little brothers so i couldnt move in with her, ive gone completley brok (had to spend 4k to get to my grandfathers funeral for me and my mom) i have so litle hope in my life, i try to blieve in god but its so difficult to believe in relgion any more,i just wana be happy like i was when i was young before my dad started doing drugs and before i lost everyone i love, i just feel so alone (i have goals in life but they seem meaningless with out the girl i love, and i hear from family constantly about how they love me but these are the same people who let me be homeless for a month (a cold winter february in nrthern ohio) all i thnk aout is pulling that trigger and ending all this shit, then no body would have to worry about me any more, they can live thier happy ass lives with out me, since im such a burdden for everyone, and im not here to throw my self a pitty party, i just need some one to talk to, some advice i dont know if i can take another 4 or 5 years of this shit.
