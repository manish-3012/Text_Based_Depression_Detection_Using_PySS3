Parents would be relievedI feel that my parents would be relieved if I killed myself. It would relieve them from the constant worry. They wouldnâ€™t have to stress over me, how I am, or what I struggle with. Iâ€™m not medicated right now, and in a bad place in life. Things keep piling up, idk what to do in life or what decisions to make. Iâ€™m lost. My parents told me tonight that they canâ€™t keep doing this. I feel like I should go ahead and do it.
