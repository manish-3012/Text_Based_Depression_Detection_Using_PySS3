HelpI'm going 17 years soon, been really depressed for a while now. The past 3ish years have been a downward spiral for me. I've failed a lot of classes, been too depressed to show up to school, and I constantly feel like my life is entirely pointless. I feel like my friends are slipping away from me, and even then I never want to leave my room or go see anybody anymore. I used to be such an extrovert, but now "introvert" would be a massive understatement. I rarely feel anything, and when I do feel something, I feel indescribably horrible. My life is worthless, and I feel more and more the urge to end it. Nothing goes well for me anymore, and I can't even find drugs to numb me for a while. There is something seriously wrong with me and I need help.
