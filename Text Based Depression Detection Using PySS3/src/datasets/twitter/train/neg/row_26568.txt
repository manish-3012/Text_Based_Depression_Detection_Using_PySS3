I just don't understand whyI'm not actually going to hurt myself. I.m.just having a moment. I'm pretty severely intoxicated.  I just don't get it. Three years ago I was 15. I had depression, the kind where I was on those suicide fourms, where I wound up being stripped searched as I got dragged to the hospital by ex police pigs. And I beat that shit. 

And now Elohim decided that I needed to have anxiety now too. And now I feel I half function. And then he took away my eating. And I can't look in the god damn mirror cause I look like a Holocaust survivor. God damn I'm just trying to do college, study history and shit, and here I am starving to death. 

It never worked for me with the girl, or the boys. Short relationships with shitty people that break my heart. And I'm in love with this girl right now. She's my heart. She's everything. And she's going away to study in Asia for 8 months. The big others gonna take her too, and I'm not ready to have my heart broken another God damn time. 

He took my drugs too. I'm sick of them. And I'm sick of my "drug friends". He even took my goddamn drugs. 


I just don't get it. Why does nothing ever go right for me? What did I do wrong? I'm trying my best, I just want to be happy and healthy for one God damn minute. I'm sick of looking at my life like "Is this it?". I feel like I'm 15 in the hospital again. I'm about ready to throw the towel in on this shit. I'm sick of my goddamn life I just don't get it. I just don't understand
