My best friend just started dating my ex.He really felt like "the one" and the breakup came out of nowhere. He never even gave me an explanation as to why. I'm still not over him. I feel so broken. It's been the worst break up I've ever been through, and dealing with it has been hard enough. We only broke up two weeks ago. Now, my best friend is dating him. I don't know what's happening. I don't know what to do anymore.
