Someone help me to kill myself with carbon monoxideI've done my research and concluded that carbon monoxide seems to be the least painful method of suicide out there, but only if done correctly. I just need help with setting everything up and having the right specs etc to ensure I have a peaceful death I already know that the CO has to be as pure as possible to avoid a feeling of suffocation. What I need to know is things like:
What ppm of Carbon Monoxide should I get?
What size should the cylinder be/ how many litres are necessary?
What specs should I have for the room I'm doing it in (A medium sized garage)?
Anything else you can think of that would ensure my death be painless and certain
Thank you in advance.
