Planning and Planning AMA...If you look at my history...I'm scared for my life right now...whats even worse is that I even more scared for my life after I potentially find out that I'm HIV+. Life after HIV+...whats the point?... you take medication, you burden your parents, your family and eventually you will die 15-25 years later. I'm planning and will keep planning for how I will die. I'm South Korean and the suicide rate is high over there...a popular form seems to be hanging especially with celebrities. How can I look at my parents face? How can I face my family? Why should I live with the burden of shame and disappointment? 

I thought about that if I do test + then I should just run away but at least tell them. Tell them i'm + and at least they will know why. 

YEAH GUYS IM NOT + YET BUT MY BEYOND PARANOID PESSIMISTIC OUTLOOK ON LIFE KILLS ME AT TIMES.
