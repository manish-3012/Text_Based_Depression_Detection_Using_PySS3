When the only way out is... out.I've written six suicide notes between the 6th grade and now (I'm 18).

I'm thinking it's time to use one of them.  There's no escape. I'm currently in a situation where if I choose option A, I let down one half the people in my life, and if I choose option B, I let down the other half. The only way everyone can win is if I do nothing, and the only way I can do nothing is if I check out. 

I've almost attempted suicide three times in the past 2 months. But I'm too much of a fucking pussy to do it. I always have been. It's just another way in which I've let down everyone, even myself.

You can't fire me. I fucking quit.
