Most painless way to go?Simply as the title says, what's the most painless (preferably easy) way I can kill myself?

Please do not try and post anything to talk me out of it, I've been battling these feelings for five years and nothing like medication, exercise, friendship, music, religion, or any other suggestions have made me feel even one tiny iota better. It's to the point where I don't even have the energy to get out of bed, I just lie there crying for hours at a time. There is absolutely nothing going on in my life that's even remotely worth sticking around for, so my mind is made up and all I need is help to complete the next step. I don't know what I'll feel once I'm dead, but it can not be worse than what I'm feeling now that I'm alive.

So please, I need a recommendation on a way to kill myself. I will consider all suggestions before going through with it, as I want to make sure it is clean and painless. I'm a bit of a pussy so the painless part is important as that's the only thing that scares me slightly.

Thanks for reading if you did, any legitimate suggestion is appreciated. :)
