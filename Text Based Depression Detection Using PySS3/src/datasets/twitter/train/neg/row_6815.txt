I will lay my head on a track TodayToday I will be ready to end it.
Get myself dressed, go to the station and lay my head on the tracks. It's a easy way, painless and fast. 
I will never be happy. I will never have a good life. This is a illusion. 
Deep down I knew this years ago and I was right. I decided not to end it years ago. Iam disappointed that I didn't do it earlier 
It was such a waste of time. 
And definitely not worth to keep going. 
Thing got even worse than I imagined it. 
I don't care anymore if someone, friends ect will be sad about my death. You will maybe.. But they will overcome this and live their life like nothing happens. I will be forgotten. And it's OK. Iam not worth that people should remember me. 

Thank you for reading. But I doubt somebody will...
