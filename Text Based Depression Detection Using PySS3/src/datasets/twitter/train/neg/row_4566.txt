I'm feeling over the edgei feel like life isnt real anymore and i just dont care about anything anymore. i just want my life to come to an end. I've lived as much as i needed to and now i just want it to come to an end. there's nothing to live for, life was pointless anyway. if it wasnt for my family i think i would really end it but they're the only ones I care about enough not to do it.

I wish I could just be on another planet on my own. I enjoy being alone. Unfortunately I'm stuck on earth with shitty humans without a choice.

I don't know what to do but I felt like I need to let this out to someone.
