18 and homeless for the past few years. Cant do it anymore.My friends always tell me that my aspirations are something Ill reach. They say that what I want to do in life is admirable. They say I'm talented when I perform. 
Since I was a freshman in highschool I have been struggling with homelessness, including not having money for food and only having one pair of shoes which sucks in the winter. I just cant do it anymore. I dont want to. I have all these diagnoses and I have dreams but I just feel like Im so sick of shelters and being kicked out for minor things and just like trying at all. 
Im hungry, homeless, wanting to eat all my pills and thats it. Nothing is worth anything anymore I just want to die I am so bone dry empty inside.
