Someone I know is considering suicide and is doing it soon. The mental hospital refused to admit her. What do I do?Someone I donâ€™t know very well (but who is really close with my sister) wants to kill herself and soon. Her brother and boyfriend did commit suicide recently and itâ€™s left her in a state of constant depression. She was saying goodbye to family members and friends yesterday and tried to OD in her room. They admitted her to a mental hospital and despite the fact that she had cuts on her arm and had to go to the ER for an attempted OD, they refused to admit her. After much convincing, they admitted her but released her the next day. My poor sister feels so helpless like she doesnâ€™t know what to do. What can I do to help this person and my poor sister? I really donâ€™t want to see them kill themselves even though Iâ€™ve only met her a few times. What do?
