Borderline Ex vs ADD me = suicidal thoughtsI canâ€™t get over the fact that I was betrayed, lied to, manipulated, left in such a cruel way and to make the whole formula even more harmful even sued by my borderline ex gf.

I have done so much shit, I have nightmares every time I close my eyes, Iâ€™m afraid to see her in court.

Iâ€™m trying. Iâ€™m trying daily. But gym, work, the girl thatâ€™s so deeply interested and in love with me at the moment, my friends, my nice body, my beautiful car.

Nothing helps me to escape my deep anxiety. The feeling that leaves me crippled every minute where Iâ€™m by myself.

Iâ€™m done because the fact that access to psychological help is so hard here. Iâ€™m confident that seeking help while stating Iâ€™m suicidal will in my current situation lead to losing my job and existence.

I have voices in my head sometimes that make me say loudly and clearly while Iâ€™m alone â€œI want to dieâ€ that force me sometimes to think about dying.

Iâ€™m still young but I canâ€™t imagine living like this for a lifetime.

Borderline partners are the worst. It damaged me so deeply. All this shit.
