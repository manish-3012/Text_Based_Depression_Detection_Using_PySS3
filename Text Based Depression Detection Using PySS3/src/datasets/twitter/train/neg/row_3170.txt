Let it endLet it all end.

Let the trail of regret that follows me end.  The ones wherein I know I'm being cruel to myself, but wherein I also know that this cruelty is all I deserve.

Let the disgust end.

Let the toxic grip of this poisoned mind end.

Let the shame end.

Let the constant and unerring sense that I'm an intruder on everything end.

The constant unerring sense that they see something other.  Something that isn't part of their collective.  The thing that keeps me inaccessible and unlovable.  Let that end as well.

Let the horror end.

Let the screaming memories end.

Let the exhaustion that comes just from trying to walk the way I think I'm supposed to look whilst walking end.

Let the total, grey and uninspiring low-grade hum of creeping terror end.  The one that keeps me sick and disgusting even on the days when I can otherwise stand up without the blood and thunder rushing to my head.

Let my parents die so I can finally do it without having to picture their despair.

Let it all end.  Shut it down, wrap it up, turn out the lights, lock the door and never look back inside.  It was all a mistake and I only landed on this planet through some administrative celestial error.

Let everything I learned or knew end.  Let all my dreadful yesterdays disappear with me.

Let the lonely silence end, and let the noise end.

If you knew the monster I must surely truly be, you'd let it end too.

I don't want to be here anymore.  Nothing can help me and no love is enough.

Just let it end.
