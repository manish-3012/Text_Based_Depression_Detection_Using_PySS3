Why canâ€™t I do it?Iâ€™ve been trying to kill myself for 5 years. Ever since I left high school everythingâ€™s just been getting worse. I hated school since I was little so I naturally hate college and I hate failing over and over again. My depression has been getting worse. Iâ€™m almost out of my motherâ€™s insurance and I canâ€™t get my GI bill anymore. Everything is against me. Iâ€™ve been trying to get better but still fail miserably. I want to die so badly countless suicide notes I marked the time I was supposed to kill myself so many times. So why? I just want it all to stop. Why canâ€™t I kill myself? Why am I so pathetic? I could use some advice. Not for getting better I already tried that but for actually killing myself please and thank you.
