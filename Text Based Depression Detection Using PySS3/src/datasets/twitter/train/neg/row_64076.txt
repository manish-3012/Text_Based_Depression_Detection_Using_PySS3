Need some companyMy gf and I have been having serious issues and because of this sheâ€™s flying out to her parents and I will be home alone for two weeks.. Iâ€™m fearful that I will have a bad day and finally take my life like I visually see when the thought crossed my mind. Does anyone picture themselves bleeding out and having your body found days or weeks later? Idk. I hate all these dark thoughts I tend to have. I have a home gym I canâ€™t gather energy to try and use. Everything just feels so fucked...
