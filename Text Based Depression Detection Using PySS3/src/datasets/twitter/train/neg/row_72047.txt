Not sure why I'm bothering with this honestly..4th time I've wrote this.. Keep backspacing because I feel so silly and guilty taking this to strangers, putting my problems in others lives. 
I'm really close you guys, ya know? 
It's not even to a point where its a big deal anymore, It just feels.. right. 
I'm pretty done with this world as of now, I've come to realize I don't care about anything or anyone..
For the longest time I've been fascinated with death.. And this concept of eternal peace sounds comforting. 
No more dealing with daily problems, and even outside of problems, all I've accomplished in this life is hurting others and hurting myself, putting my own mindset into such a low space that I don't matter to myself anymore.
I'll probably get a few views, maybe a comment or two, but my point is none of this matters. 
I was on here helping someone just a few minutes ago and seeing how similar they are to me fucked my shit up
I don't know how much longer I can last, and I don't give a fuck about anything. 
I'm either going to hurt myself or get myself killed by the police. It's repeating in my head over and over.
