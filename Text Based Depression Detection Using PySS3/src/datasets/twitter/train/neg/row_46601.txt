Hey you! Yes "you", that part of yourself that is willing to listen...Ok so... here we go. I know how is it to feel suicidal. Depressed. Sad, without being able to see the light in that tunnel. Without somebody being here willing to hear your screams. And in fact, I am still like this time from time. Yet I never cut myself, hit myself, or attempted to kill myself. Not because I am special, or because I just met some good friend, or you know, that unexpected happy turn in life... no, no, no.

I made a **choice**. I made a choice to see the world where the world doesn't expect us to look at. I made a choice to understand the world and appreciate every form of life, including myself, for what it does, for how millions and millions of years of evolution assembled together this hands that write here, these eyes that read here, this body, of which Nature made it special. Now, should I just throw all of that away, just because I am stuck in my head, in my misconceptions, in my past or in my future, in my current "me"? 

*"Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem".* You know, the more you think about those words, the more you realise you are your greatest project. Think about a future you, where that future you will tank the present you for taking that extra step, that extra tiny bit of force, to carry on the next day. 

If you believe in uncertainty, your whole life will be uncertain. The strenght to carry on it is always within you and nobody can take that from you. Nobody except yourself!

Cheers. Stay strong.
