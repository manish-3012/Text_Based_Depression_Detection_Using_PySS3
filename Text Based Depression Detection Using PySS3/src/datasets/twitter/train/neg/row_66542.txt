Suicide is the only optionI'm sick of this. I can move and improve my life in every way possible except my sexuality. I'm always going to be stuck with being a lesbian. I'm never going to get out of it. I'm sad. I'm angry. I'm scared. 

The only option that I have is suicide to escape it. I can't think of anything else. Conversion therapy doesn't work.
