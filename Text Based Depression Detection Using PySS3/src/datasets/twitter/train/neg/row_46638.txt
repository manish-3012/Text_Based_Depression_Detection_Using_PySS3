I am overwhelmed by guilt.I went to a hunting trip with my father and accidentally shot my father. He didn't die there but died in the hospital because of complications (his health wasn't that great to begin with).
  
Since he brought the money into the house my family has fallen into economic troubles and I feel so isolated from my mother and siblings because I can feel that they're holding a grudge on me for shooting our father. I'm starting to doubt in myself if it was an accident and cry myself to sleep every night.
  
I just don't know how to live with myself knowing that I took another human beings life.
