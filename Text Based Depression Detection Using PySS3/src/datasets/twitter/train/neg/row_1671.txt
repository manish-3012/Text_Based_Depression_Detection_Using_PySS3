I donâ€™t know how to help my depressed teenage daughter.She has been self-harming and says things like, â€œl just canâ€™t do this anymore. I want it to stop.â€ I am so thankful she comes to me (always kind of sneaky, away from her brother &amp; sister, when we can be alone) and tells me what she is feeling. But I donâ€™t know what I can do to make her world feel less overwhelming. So I just listen and tell her I am so sorry she feels that way. Outside of getting her professional counseling, What other things could/should I be saying and doing to help her?
