I hate my life. There's no point to it anymore.The option of suicide keeps crossing my mind lately. I hate it so much but I honestly don't see a downside to it at this point. Nobody gives a fuck about me. Nobody's life would change at all if i were just suddenly gone. Not one single person would even notice if I were suddenly gone. None of my "friends" will even talk to me anymore and I honestly have no clue why. Not like I've done something to piss off any of them. I end up sitting alone in my bedroom alone day after day, trying to get some of my "friends" to hang out with me, even just for a little bit. I end up just sitting around, alone and forgotten. It's like some vicious circle. Being alone and forgotten makes me more depressed, yet being depressed makes people ignore you. Until you decide that living a life of depression isn't worth it anymore and you take the most obvious way out. Then, of course, everybody talks about how that person was such a good friend, and how great a person they were, even if they didn't fucking know the lonely bastard. Seen it happen so many times already in my short life.

I'm so tired of feeling like i'm fighting for my sanity constantly. I don't really even want to commit suicide. I just want this loneliness, this emptiness, to go away. I so desperately need a shoulder to cry on, but those closest to me have turned their backs on me. I don't even know what the fuck to do anymore. Nothing excites me anymore. I have nothing to look forward to when I wake up in the morning. I feel like I have reason to live anymore.
