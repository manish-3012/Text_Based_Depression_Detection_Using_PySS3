I need some convincing not to end it all.Hey folks. I live in Australia. I am 20 years young. I want to lay down the fundamentals of my life and the difficulties I'm exhibiting so hopefully some of you nice people can give me a reason to continue going.

Let's start with the basics. I genuinely do not believe I belong in society. Here's why:

* **I have debilitating anxiety**

This isn't your 'run of the mill' type anxiety that comes up once in a while. This is constant. It's a never-ending battle that makes even the simplest of tasks feel like I'm climbing a mountain. If I have to go anywhere in public, or speak to anybody, I freeze up and start shaking and cannot control my emotions. I've had this my entire life. It doesn't seem to be getting any better. I've actively tried remedies to try and contain my anxiety but nothing has worked. 20 Anti-depressants later and countless sessions with a psychologist/psychiatrist has yet to prove effective.

* **I have moderate functioning Asperger's**

I've yet to come across a single benefit more than "critical thinking" from having been diagnosed with the disorder. While I don't mind having Asperger's due to giving me an explanation for who I really am, it's quite clear that the world isn't tailored for people that suffer from it. 

I can't work. I can't hold a job. I can't even study because I have horrendous information processing. The funny thing is, I haven't even resigned myself to giving up. Those are all things I genuinely *WANT* in life but feel I can't do, due to the barrier that surrounds me. I want to study so I can land a kick-ass gig and eventually find a partner, so I can pursue things that I enjoy such as travel, painting, etc. 

I can't find but see myself becoming homeless though. The world looks down upon folks like me. "Loser" "NEET" "Leech" (Funnily enough, the same people that seem to be for Universal Basic Income, but I, for whatever reason, are just lazy and are somehow undeserving of any financial compensation for my INABILITY TO WORK.)

Seeing all these wants whisper past my vision, gives me nothing but a feeling of intense sorrow that cannot be alleviated because of my inability to fit in.

Disclaimer: This is NOT a pity party for me to wallow in my sadness and exclaim "woe is me". It is merely an explanation for my foundations of who I am, and want for a reason to keep going.
