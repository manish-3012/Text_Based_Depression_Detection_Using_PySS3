I'd rather die, than divorceI love my wife, but I hate being married to her. Her depression affects mine and vice versa. We are slowly making each other miserable(er).

But I don't want to hurt her by asking for divorce.

Frankly, I would rather die than hurt her that way. I would prefer to just rip myself away by violence, then admit to her face how she contributes to my pain.

To be fair, she is a lovely woman and a very good wife, when the depression isn't eating away at her. To my discredit, I am not the best husband, regardless of my depression. I won't go into specifics, but suffice to say that my failings as a husband have excacerbated my wife's already potent depression.

TL;DR I would rather kill myself, than admit to my wife how miserable I am.
