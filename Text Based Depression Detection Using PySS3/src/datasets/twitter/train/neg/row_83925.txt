I just tried to kill myselfI didn't know what else to do, I have no money, no friends that can help, I asked my dad for help and he asked me for money (cheek considering he's barely paid any support money to my mom my whole life), I'm now homeless and have spent the last 2 nights on the street, I went to my local housing and asked for help, they know about my previous suicide attempts and my battle with depression as I had to disclose that info to them, but they still wouldn't offer me any immediate help, the only reason I'm still alive is because I had to use a makeshift noose (tied 2 neckties together to hang myself with and one of them couldn't take the pressure and ripped and split, it was the good tie that ripped as well, shows my luck right now. I don't really know what to do, I am still considering doing it again but I'll find a way to do it properly next time.
