What happened yesterday and what helped me (repost, rephrase)EDIT: **tl;dr** notice - if you don't want to read all this, but are interested in "what helped me" part, please skip to the last paragraph.

This is a repost of what originally contained my recommendation to everyone to do something that helped me which I was unaware was a violation of the rules - I apologize for it and thanks for the notice. The post is virtually same as it was before except the rephrasing of last paragraph (I don't recommend anything this time around :) ). If I still come across as obtrusive, then sorry for that, I just wanted to share my experience. I hope it will at least comply with the rules.

Hi. First of all a warning - this post is giant wall of text. tl;dr - to learn what helped me when I was suicidal yesterday - skip to last paragraph.

As I write this my heart is pounding with nervousness. Also I warn you of pissoble broken English.

So, I have been in relationship with my girlfriend for about 3 years now. I am 29 now, male. During my life I have always considered suicide to be an option. When I was in my teens I expected I will kill myself between the age of ca 18 - 27. I wasn't really depressed during that time, because I knew that I will end my life anyway which was really calming thought. I also developed OCD at that time. When my mum who was very close to me died I moved to a flat where I lived alone for about 3 years. It was at that time when all shit break loose in my life.

My OCD went full blown basically destroying my ability to do anything without redoing it several times over draining all the energy out of me except the fear of doing anything because I would most likely 'need' to redo it over and over again anyway. I started to experience severe depression and hatred for my own life and the world outside. I experienced extreme negativity whenever I returned to that flat and as I have been so depressed, no option of getting out of there seemed to be achievable. I started to plan on finally going through with a suicide researching the most efficient guaranteed and painless way how to kill myself. As I live in a country where obtaining a firearm is legally restricted and requires effort, money and passing psychiatric evaluation which rendered that option basically impossible for me, I finally settled for jumping of the tallest bridge in the country. I didn't want to cry for help, I just wanted to end it once and for all. I planned a time period in which I will do it. But I couldn't. I couldn't because I realized that I just can't end my own life in a state of such an immense negativity all around me. I don't know if you experienced that feeling but it is really crushing. Enormous everyday pain and no way out of it.

At that time I also met a girl who seemed to be interested in me. When I wasn't alone in that flat I have been able to be really easygoing and I suppose that also quite an interesting person, who no one would probably guess that he otherwise hates his existence so much. We started to meet each other quite frequently, when my depression and OCD allowed me to do that.

Some time later, I finally got pissed at everything I was going through and decided to go on with my plan to move out of the flat and out of the city. I asked my dad, who I didn't speak to for a long time and who knew nothing about what I've been going through, for money to do it and he helped me. When I knew that I will move elsewhere I also asked my friend to become my girlfriend, as I was thinking that she may be interested in it too, and she agreed to.

I moved with my girlfriend to another city in the country. I planned to find a high paying job in the field I studied and was interested in and it happened. I also decided not to succumb to my OCD anymore, which however I 'wasn't able' to do. Or maybe I was able, but at any rate it didn't happen. Anyway at a new place I didn't at the beginning experience my OCD problems too much. About half a year after I moved to new city, I had a severe OCD episode that made me consider suicide once again as the only option. My girlfriend helped me tremendously and I started to take medication for my OCD. The medication was SSRI at a dose several times higher than what is prescribed for depression. Some time after that I noticed changes in my perceptions of the world, as if it wasn't me who experienced perceiving it. I noticed becoming unable to feel emotions, not feeling anything good or bad, just not feeling anything at all. However the OCD has been easier to cope with. After some time I stopped taking the medication because of increasing unpleasant experience as if a different person has been acting my life out, compared to what I thought that the normal I would do.

My relationship to my girlfriend has been quite up and down, most of the time I didn't really connect to what she told she feels to me and I considered her to be just a person who decided to hang with me in my life, which I didn't mind but also didn't feel I need that. I've been acting accordingly to that not being too emotionally open when being with her, sometimes being annoyed, especially when she did something that interfered with my OCD. At times I was depressed, hardly ever taking any initiative in talking to her. A few times she decided to talk to me how she feels bad about the way I act towards her and during such talk when I've been really thinking about it deeply, experiencing sudden flow of my emotions and I always came to realization that she really means a lot to me, often emotionally breaking into tears and apologizing to her for how I treated her. However a few days later I usually found myself acting the same way I did before without any emotional attachment to her or anything, including not being able to reconnect to how I felt at times when we talked about the way I act towards her. I considered that to be just the way I am and that she can decide to leave me if that is a problem for her. That went on for about one and half year up until Friday last week. She told me that the mood I often have and my apparent unwillingness to commit to treating the OCD that negatively affects our relationship and the way I don't act too pleasantly towards her makes her not enjoy the time that she spends with me too much anymore, and that although she likes me, she would like to spend some time without me and with her family and decide if she prefers to be alone. I listened to her and at that time being emotionally detached, I just agreed to 'respect her decision'.

Yesterday, my girlfriend's decision to possibly leave has hit me with full power, bringing with it feeling that all the time she's been with me, I actually wasn't alone and that I learned to consider her presence next to me to be 'of course' a commonplace. Suddenly a totally crushing thought struck me that I will be all alone again, bringing with it the horrible memories of time when I have been living alone before. Heavy emotional swings caused uncontrollable bursts of tears with only one idea obscuring everything else - that I will be alone again, that there is no future for me except falling into uncontrollable agony and that all that I can do about it is to kill myself immediately or live my life forever in the state of unbearable negativity unable to even kill myself to bring myself out of it. Like if some black hole has just eaten everything that I ever had, could have, be or experience in my life and me myself were closing on to the event horizon of it, forever to be devoured and eaten by it. No future anymore, but still existing in absolute NOTHINGNESS and unbearable pain of knowing it. The agony I felt was totally unbearable and uncontrollable. There was nothing else but it. I knew that there will never be anything else but that. My hands were trembling uncontrollably, tears pouring out of my eyes and saliva flowing from my mouth opened in a grimace twisted by all the pain pushing me down and surrounding me. That happened couple of times over with ever increasing duration and intensity of perceived pain. My hands trembling I come to the kitchen for a sharp pointed knife putting it against my heart trying to fit it between my ribs. I knew it was just a gesture and that I won't stab myself, because the chances of successfully killing myself that way were statistically low, and that rather than that it can lead to life of tremendous physical pain or even permanent hospitalization on top of all the pain I felt already. That thought only just added to all the pain and misery. Strangely those states of uncontrollable tears and pain have been alternating with states of total emotional detachment from anything, not feeling anything. In that periods of time I started to relatively calmly research available suicide methods especially taking interest in hanging myself. I knew that the all encompassing state of unbearable pain will come again to devour me, however.

Seeing as this is already very long text I'll try to be briefer now. Experiencing all that pain I finally realized that I can't handle it myself and decided to text my girlfriend pleading her to come back to my place because I am unable to handle my current state alone. Fortunately she was on her cell phone and we stared to talk and she gradually calmed me. When I was a little more calmer, she reminded of something what helped me a lot in the past but I lost my awareness of it. Quite a long time ago I came across videos from **Eckhart Tolle**. She recommended me to watch some of it again. Little reluctantly I agreed. I decided to watch a video where he talks about suicide. And a lot of stuff that I went through that day clicked. I realized that what I went through corresponds exactly to what he is talking about. My extreme resistance to the ideas of 'no future' that filled my mind. My inability to realize that what went on through my mind at that time and what was causing me tremendous pain were just **mere thoughts**. It were thoughts that I believed absolutely. I have been totally unaware what is going at all, totally lost and absorbed in my thoughts, unable to have even a slightest clue to question what is going on. Unable to raise to awareness of what is going on in my life. Then I watched another video where he talks about pain in life. Then a video where he talks about what he calls 'heavy pain body'. How it comes back time and time again to fuck up your life, if *you* let yourself be unaware of what is happening. How you can be actually **aware** about that what's going on in your mind is just your thoughts. That **your thoughts are not you**. That if you are unaware how you can have the experience as if you are your thoughts - believing everything that happens in your mind to be really you, believing - or even having feeling of knowing - it is all real. How almost every person on this planet is living in that state of continuous stream of thinking totally believing all it tells you. Believing that it **is** you. That it is not really a problem if you live happily like that, but when you have an extreme negativity in you - perhaps leading to being suicidal - that dwelling in that state of unawareness can really, really fuck your life. And that the extreme pain you experience can actually push you from the fake illusion of you being your thoughts into a state of real understanding. Awareness, presence. Supposedly, if you surrender fully and absolutely to all what is at this moment, if you give up all the resistance to what is going on, even if it looks impossible to not fight that feeling of utter desperation, which in fact is just an illusory you - the ego -, you came to a state of total awareness and begin to see what is really going on. I cannot claim that I achieved that state permanently. I even cannot claim that I believe absolutely in that. Neither can I claim that it is not just a load of BS. Maybe that's my ego speaking or doubting. Maybe my it is just me and I am really a person, who resists suicide but will do it anyway when he finds enough courage. What I can say, however, is that being reminded about what *can* be going on, instead of what going through all that pain just accepting it all at face value has helped me tremendously. 


So, there were few videos that helped me that I'd like to share and it's up to you if you will take a look at them or not. I can imagine how crazy it may seem that watching some video can reverse suicidal state or help you in your suffering, but I don't claim that - it is quite possible that even if you watch it, that you won't find it helpful at all or find it to be a load of BS. I feet it really helped me and because of it, I wanted to share it. Maybe you will decide to watch it and find it helpful as well, who knows. You can always comment on with your opinion. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ja75T5wF1U https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCMunBFFY_A
