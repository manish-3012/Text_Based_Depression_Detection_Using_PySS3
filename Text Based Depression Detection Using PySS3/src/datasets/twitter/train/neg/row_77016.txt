Whatâ€™s the big deal about life or death?Last time I went through a suicide crisis I went to the hospital for a psych eval and the nurses asked me how I would feel about not waking up tomorrow. I was indifferent. The nurses went on to tell that to other doctors. I donâ€™t see what the big deal is. Even when Iâ€™m not suicidal I still think this way. Why is death the worst thing that can happen to a person? Donâ€™t we all die? Why do I need to be grasping for life every second of every day?
