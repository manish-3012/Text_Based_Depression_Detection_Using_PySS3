Just sparing some optionsEverything isn't even that bad. Not broke, good remote job, going to buy my first brand-new car soon. I just like to think that if everything goes to shit I will still have some options available.

So I'm actually educating myself on the suicide technics and preparing some equipment. I.e. I have an exit bag(scuba mask + supply of helium) and a ratchet strap(to choke myself with) as I found these to be the best kinds of suicide with high lethality and easy-to-get equipment. Plus, both are discreet and provide flexibility in location. I even carry a ratchet in my backpack when hiking in the mountains, so I could one day camp somewhere in the woods and finally end my life if I choose to do so.

Not feeling miserable or anything. I actually feel almost nothing, everything seems indifferent to me.

Anyway, have a nice day, random stranger =)
