Seriously suicidalIdk what to do, feels like there's something out there lining up everything just to make me feel worse. Everything is going wrong, I don't have a car, my job fired me for standing by my friend, my family won't talk to me, I'm basically homeless all I do is sleep at friends houses. Gosh I just wanna swallow a bunch of sleeping pills and never wake up. Everyday feels like an eternity, and every moment that passes strengthens that feeling, I just wanna end it all, I'm broke and homeless with no family, I'm probably gonna kill myself within this month. I just can't do it anymore. All I wanna do is cry and die
