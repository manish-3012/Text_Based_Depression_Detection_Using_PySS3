Why shouldnâ€™t I honestlyEveryoneâ€™s gonna be better off in the end. I mean yeah some people might be sad but theyâ€™ll get over it eventually. When they do, theyâ€™ll be better of without me. Less stress, less money having to be spent, most annoying person in their lives gone. Everyone wins!

But seriously though, I feel like Iâ€™m about explode and thereâ€™s nobody I can take it out on or talk to about without ruining my relationship with them except for myself. You know what that means. Yeeting! :)
