I don't think that I can handle this right now.I'm not okay anymore. It's not even anything that happened, just all of a sudden I'm not fine. The last time I remember this happening was last year, when I had my first big struggle with anxiety and basically lost myself. For the last week I've had this horrible feeling inside of me, like someone had reached into my chest, grabbed my heart, and started squeezing as hard as they could. Usually it goes away. This time it hasn't. It's so bad I can physically feel it and it's consuming me. I feel horrible and empty and sad. I know there are people around me, but I'm so lonely. I don't feel pretty or loved or wanted. I don't know where it came from or why or how long it will be here, but last time it happened I started cutting because physical pain was easier to handle than whatever this is. I totally ruined the skin on my arms and legs. I don't want to do that again but I don't know what else to do to make this go away. I'm scared and I'm just...sad. I get so disappointed every morning when I open my eyes that I didn't die in my sleep. I have so much medication in my house, I know I could overdose if I weren't such a coward. The urge is getting stronger and I don't know how much longer I can resist it.
