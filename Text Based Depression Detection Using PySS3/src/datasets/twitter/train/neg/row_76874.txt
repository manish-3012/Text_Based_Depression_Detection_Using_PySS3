I feel like everything is falling apart around meI feel like everything is starting to crumble around me.

Iâ€™m 18 years old Iâ€™ve just recently graduated high school and started university. I still live with my parents and they support me.

Iâ€™ve failed the my first semester miserably and now I have to basically retake the whole first semester and Iâ€™m too scared to tell my parents on the off chance they kick me out because Iâ€™ve been creating to many problems for me and them.

I always feel like my friends donâ€™t actually like me and Iâ€™m always scared that theyâ€™re gonna cut me off because talking and joking around with them is probably one of the small things that are making me happy.

I have so many problems around me and itâ€™s staying harder and harder to focus on myself and trying to fix my problems.

Iâ€™m always overthinking things on the daily and Iâ€™m always stressed.

Lately Iâ€™ve been thinking of ending it all because I feel like nobody will give a shit when I die and I wonâ€™t have to care about my problems anymore, itâ€™s been so so hard to stay motivated in my life. I hate waking up in my bed at the morning because itâ€™s just gonna be another day of stress and sadness.
