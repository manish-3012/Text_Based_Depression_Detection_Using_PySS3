16/Engaged/Not sure If it to right person.I wanna kill myself. Literally have taken 5 ðŸ’Š have more. I'm 16 been depressed since I was 12. Lost my mother in October of 2014. She was all I had.. When I lost her my love for the man I couldn't stop think of for three years and dated two was no longer who I had in mind to have a life because he pushed me away and I have fault because I pushed him away too... I'm currently engaged to the guy who was my Bestfriend the last 5 months of my relationship. Me and him have been thru everything for our age.. Idk if I'm making the right choice or marrying for all the wrong reasons. I wanna leave home but can't if I'm not married. I wanna have my siblings and be their guardian... Don't wanna wait... I wanna be a mom to them... Idk if I'm tripping but I thinks they be better odd with me then my shitty uncles. My sis 14 and moved out today . so it bad now I have no one. But my fiance.... But I miss my ex at time.. And wish he was my fiancee but don't want him help. Am I just crazy...
