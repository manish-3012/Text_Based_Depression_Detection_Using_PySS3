Just a post to vent and to share...Songs... they express how I feel better than anything:
 
[This is the first song I head after my dog died... it will haung me forever...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8Yr_BGEOdk) I was there for her... but it was not enough... the night she died... the night my best friend died... I was not there for her... that was the first song I heard... it was depressingly fitting...
 
Then this is how I feel about friendship: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z8cnXVGm1I
 
And then this is how I feel about my dad... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUwjNBjqR-c
 
I deny myself depression....
