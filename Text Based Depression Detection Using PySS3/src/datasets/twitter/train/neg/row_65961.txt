Exit bag new yearsMy mom asked me if osap loans are forgiven at death last week.... everything is pointing me towards doing it, a part of me wants to volunteer and have a pet and that's how I will live my life but idk how to get out of school and deal with family or survive with no income volunteering. I want to live a simple life and be useful. I am not happy on the path I'm on right now. I have to figure this out this week. The 9th is the last day to drop this term. It's either do this or keep going and fake my life until I self implode or end it this new years after grades come out.
