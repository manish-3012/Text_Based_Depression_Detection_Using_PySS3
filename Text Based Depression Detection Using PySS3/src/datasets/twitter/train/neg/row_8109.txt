I have nothing to say but Thank you.I just wanted to come on here and say thank you to all the kind people on this subreddit. 7 months ago I was in a really dark place and didn't think that I could make it. I honestly believe that the only reason I got help and got out of that dark place was because of this subreddit. I've since deleted everyone of my posts from here. I did this  for closure, but the loving responses I got from everyone here will always stay in my heart. To anyone coming on here to "scream into the void of the internet," or to talk about what they can't tell their loved ones, you are being heard. There's a light at the end of the tunnel, so to speak. To anyone who comes here occasionally to help someone out, and those who talk with other suicidal people about that dark place, you are the lighthouses helping to keep people safe. &lt;3
