A friend of mine just attempted suicide. What can I do to help his recovery?Information about it has been really vague and scarce, but all I know for sure is that a friend of mine who shall remain unnamed tried to kill himself last Monday. He's been in counselling since. He showed no signs of depression, he was probably the happiest person I know. How can I (if I can at all) help him?
