A way outHi,

Not sure if I am at the right place. I was just feeling so lost and somehow just ended up here. I am currently pursuing an undergraduate degree in STEM with a particular accent on cancer. Spent the last year of my life on my research, non-stop, nearly every day whilst trying to keep on top of my lectures. In the end, it has yielded a lot of new findings and should hopefully help with the understanding of cell cycle progression. However, I just feel dead inside. I lost most of my friends , not like I had many from the beginning. A few dropped out. Did not really have anyone to talk to. The research proved to be so complicated for me personally, I am not really smart, that I contemplated suicide a few times as a way out. Never went through with it. Parents would be so disappointed. Always tried to show them that I am not the most stupid in the family. Now that I have obtained all the results, my dad just dismissed their significance and questioned whether I am actually studying. This just completely destroyed me. I am so lost and just want a way out. Feels like now is the good time to go and just kill myself. Supervisor will be able to make better use of results anyways for his future research.

Thank you for reading.
