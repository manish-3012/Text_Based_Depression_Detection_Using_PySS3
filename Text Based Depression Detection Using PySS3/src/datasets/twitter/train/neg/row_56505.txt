No reason to live, life just keeps getting worse.I've always been depressed but now I think I've reached the breaking point. I have always failed at every single thing I've tried, I am a 17 year old highschool dropout who hasn't spoken to anyone outside family in 2 years.

 Things have just been getting worse, I have 0 motivation and I am very antisocial. The sound of people laughing and talking has begun to grate on my nerves. To make things worse, I have recently begun having some diabetes-like symptoms, particularly tingling and numbness in my fingertips and toes.

 Honestly there are 3 things stopping me from committing suicide right now, I have no suitable way to currently do it. I would feel horrible about my cat who really likes me, and I'm in love with a fictional character (I know it sounds pathetic,  but that's because it is). I have a doctor's appointment in 2 weeks, if I do have diabetes I seriously plan on using the insulin or whatever to commit suicide, but I don't know if that's possible. I just see no reason to continue living, I am too apathetic to even cry anymore and have no talent, skills or place in this world, and life feels like it needs to make things worse and worse for whatever reason. I think it's time to go before things get much worse.
