I was never wanted and yet here I amyk i found out or was reminded yesterday that my parents didnâ€™t want a second kid so then why the fuck am i here??? like what the actual fuck were they out of their minds after 8 years theyâ€™re like hmmm maybe we can bring a piece of shit into this world to balance out the goodness of our first kid 

they have no idea what a favor they wouldâ€™ve done me, themselves and heck the whole world if i wasnâ€™t here i mean wtf is my purpose to bitch about my life waste money time and virtually everything that i ever get
