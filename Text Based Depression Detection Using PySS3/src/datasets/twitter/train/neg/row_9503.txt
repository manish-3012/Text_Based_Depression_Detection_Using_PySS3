What's the best thing to hang yourself with?I've tried computer cables but can't get the knot to tighten appropriately.  They're the only, er, hang-y things I own, so I guess I'll hit up the hardware store tomorrow.  But, and this is embarrassing, how do I know which rope or cord or whatever to get?  I'll be doing it off a doorknob if that makes a difference; it won't have to support my full weight.  I don't think anything could fully support my fat ass.  Tired of trying and failing (and then giving up and just going to bed.  I have so little motivation to do anything I can't even keep at this.)

I want to die because the medication I'm on has turned me into a shitty person and I have no one left in my life.  I don't want to start over.  I don't want to get better.  I CAN'T get better because these fucking birth control injections have fucking ruined me.  I'm just done.  I'm scared to die though.  Contemplating eternal nothingness freaks me out.  Which is also stupid, but...we've covered this.  I'm stupid and crazy.  Obviously.  

I feel bad about my mom.  I'm all she has left.  But she'll be better off without me and I know she'll see that in time.
