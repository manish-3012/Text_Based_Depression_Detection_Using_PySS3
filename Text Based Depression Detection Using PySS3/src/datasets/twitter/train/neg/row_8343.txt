Fucking done ( pardon language)It's so much bullshit when people say suicide is a permanent solution to a short term problem. It doesn't get better and people say it does which pisses me off. There is nothing left for me to live for and everytime I'm suicidal I never think of anyone I'd be leaving. I just want to go and be at peace with myself. I'm going to end it Wednesday and leave everyone. They are better off without me.
