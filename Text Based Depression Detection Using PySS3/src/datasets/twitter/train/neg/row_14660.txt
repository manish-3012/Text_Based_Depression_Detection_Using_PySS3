I feel aloneSomeone I know asks me every now and again if I donâ€™t crave sex. I donâ€™t; Iâ€™ve never experienced it, and therefore donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m missing. I do miss a lot of things though. I miss feeling of being desired. I miss the touch of another person. I miss the carefree days of some years back, where nothing mattered and everything was good. I miss the time when I was with friends every other day. I miss the time where
I could talk to someone about everything. I miss being able to entrust someone my feelings. I miss being able to entrust someone the truth. I miss feeling real. I canâ€™t discern my lies from my truths sometimes. I donâ€™t know how I feel. Iâ€™m disconnected from that. Iâ€™m not dead and I donâ€™t want to be, but what Iâ€™m currently doing doesnâ€™t feel like living; it only barely counts as existing.
