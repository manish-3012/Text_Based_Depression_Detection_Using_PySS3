Today is Motherâ€™s Day but I couldnâ€™t be more depressedI honestly just hate my life so much. I canâ€™t even remember the last time I was genuinely happy. All I know is Iâ€™ve always lived my life wishing I had a family that loved me. Something Iâ€™ll never relate to.. iâ€™ve always felt just felt so empty and dead inside cuz I was never shown  any love growing up so now I literally just donâ€™t fucking care about anything or anybody since no one ever cared about me and it sucks and I wish I didnâ€™t  feel that way but I do.. and Idk how to change that. Iâ€™m so tempted to catch corona virus on purpose just so I can fucking die already. My mom didnâ€™t give a single fuck about me as a child so I developed asthma. Which is why Iâ€™m tempted to catch corona virus so I can die already Iâ€™m so tired of this empty life I live with zero love from anyone
