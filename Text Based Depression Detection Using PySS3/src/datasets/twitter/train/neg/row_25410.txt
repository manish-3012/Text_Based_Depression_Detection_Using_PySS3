This week I cut for the first time in over a year.While I have been having suicidal thoughts i don't think I'd go so far as to actually do it. 

That being said, I feel like my life is spiraling out of control. Again. I have no idea what to do. I spend so much time trying to help everyone in my life, but then when it comes time for me to ask for help, or even just have someone to talk to, they turn away, they change the subject, they start talking about themselves. 

The person who I thought cared most about me says she's busy constantly, but then goes and makes plans with other friends. I know, selfish of me to think that's wrong. But like, would it be that hard to just tell me no? This is probably whats fucking me up so bad right now.

I've tried getting lost in my photography and other hobbies. It only works temporarily. I've even tried drinking. Again, only temporary. I still come home and feel nothing. So much nothing, in fact, that I picked up my knife, breaking my one year and 1 month streak of having not cut, just to feel something, anything other than anger. 

That's another point, how weird is it for me to simply feel nothing. Nothing at all. Occasionally anger, but mostly directed at myself. I've always thought I had depression because I would go days on end with no motivation and a general feeling of gloom. But now it's evolved. I still have no motivation, but now instead of feeling sad, I simply feel nothing.

Whats weird is that I feel as though I'm making all of this up for attention, but if that were true I would be able to come home and snap out of it right? Like there is nothing wrong with my life, I have a good family, good friends, freedom to do what I want. Yet, I still feel like shit constantly. I have no idea what to do. What do y'all think? Am I making this all up?
