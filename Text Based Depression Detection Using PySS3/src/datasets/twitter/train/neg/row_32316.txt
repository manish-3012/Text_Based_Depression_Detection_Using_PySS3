I kinda want to kill myself because of my boyfriends mom. Help.I have been having so many problems with my boyfriends mom. She's crazy and she pretty much only lets me in the house if I work for her. There are always chores I have to do when I come over. An when I confronted her about it she acted like a 15 year old. She made me feel really unwanted and like it was all my fault. And now I am rejected from her house.  And now my boyfriend is defending her. I already cut. In throwing away all of my pills and razors.  What should I do. I feel so unwanted and hurt I don't know what to do.
