I'm anxious and can't sleepAlthough I'm exhausted. 
I have nightmares, it's becoming more and more clear that I'm past my prime, which was pretty lousy. 
I've lost the battle over the past, and I have nothing but misery in my near future. I can't see nothing beyond that. I go to sleep alone at night and I don't have anyone that I can really share my life with. You can usually be that close only with your SO, and I don't have one. never really did.
