Good advice on how to kill myself?Iâ€™m so, so exhausted. I was a child with great potential, but I made the most stupid choices in order to be â€œselflessâ€ and now I hate my life. I had great dreams and ambitions of helping others and traveling the world to find true friends. 
The world is shit. Itâ€™s a fucking shithole. Iâ€™ve come to the conclusion that regardless of the good intentions that individuals have, that many people are inherently stupid and selfish. The world is run by money, and even the most noble professions are limited and corrupted by money. 

How can I kill myself? Iâ€™m thinking of buying a rope and going into to nearby woods to hang myself, but I donâ€™t want to traumatize anyone by having them find my body. Could I slit my wrists and walk into a lake? Would slitting my throath be effective? Iâ€™m scared of the pain, but maybe it is effective and quick enough to make up for the pain. I canâ€™t get sleeping pills, and overdose, I think.
