I don't want to live anymoreI'm a 17 yr old female and I don't think life is worth living anymore. I feel like I've been stripped of my basic humanity. In numb. I'm tired and I just want to kill myself. My depression has progressed so far that I can't even cry any more. I want to so bad and I feel like I'm not even human anymore. I have no friends, no one close to me and my family takes this all as some joke. I want help but no one wants to give it. The girl I loved doesn't love me back anymore. All my family does is fight with eachother and its so loud in my head and in reality. I just don't see the point. I'm done.
