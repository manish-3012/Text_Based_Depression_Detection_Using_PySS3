i have to tell someone even if it's to strangers.ive suffered with mental health problems for years and i have a confession to make, though i'm alive now i've tried to kill myself 58 times that i can count. im so ashamed, its so awful, im still here, but the number wont leave my head and i thought the first time was the worst ive run out words for this. theres no words to describe how much shame i feel. i wont kill myself i want to live, i have moved past that for the most part, but it hurts so much
