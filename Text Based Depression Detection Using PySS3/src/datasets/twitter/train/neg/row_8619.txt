Feeling like shitI'm 28 years old and have done essentially nothing with myself since I was about 15. I haven't been able to hold a good job for very long, and have been unemployed for about a year now. I was just denied the best job opportunity of my life because I failed the drug screen, (smoking pot now and then helps me deal with depression) and I'm just about at the end of my rope.

I don't know how to face my friends and family anymore. Putting on a smile and lying about how I'm feeling to everyone isn't fun at this point, but I also can't bring myself to tell anyone how I'm actually feeling. How much I hate myself. How much I'm tired of being a fucking waste. So I'll post it anonymously on the internet.

I've had suicidal thoughts before, but never acted on them, mostly because I do love the people in my life and don't want to make them upset over it: mostly my parents. My younger brother already thinks I'm a piece of shit, and that fucking kills me too.

Anyway, as I was driving home from the lab I was crying in my car telling myself over and over that "When I get home, I'm going to kill myself." I got home, went to the basement, made a noose out of an extension cord, stood on a chair, and put it around my neck. Then I broke down crying again and went to my computer to try to cool off. That's what brings me here.

This is the only time I ever came close to harming myself in any way, and that scared the shit out of me. I don't WANT to do it, but being a lazy piece of shit nobody for so long is really fucking my mind up. I'm in a long rut, and I feel that it's not so simple as picking myself up by the bootstraps and getting my shit together.
