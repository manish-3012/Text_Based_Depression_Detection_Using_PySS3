I'm going to betray my familyI can't keep going on like this. I don't want to hurt them but I can't live anymore, it's already gone on for too long. I wasn't supposed to make it this far, now because of my choices my health is falling apart anyways so I might die before I even get the courage to end it. Even if I chose right now to live and move forward it would end the same way. My mom is getting worse and worse by the day. I'm pretty sure the day she dies is the day I finally lose it. I don't know what I'll do but it will likely end with me dead on the sidewalk. I am completely fucked.
