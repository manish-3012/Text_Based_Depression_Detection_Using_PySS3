After having an awful mental breakdown last night and listening to $uicideboy$ - Antarctica, I wrote thisI canâ€™t be the only one who feels alone

Iâ€™m a stranger inside my home

Evil thoughts, they always roam

Cut my wrist till I see the bone

Tortured soul, Iâ€™m so abused

Racing thoughts, remain confused

This game of life, Iâ€™ll always lose

Kill you or me, canâ€™t seem to choose  

Forgot the feeling, itâ€™s been a while

Will someone teach me how to smile

I still feel like Iâ€™m a child.

This thing called life is a pedophile.

Look in the mirror, stare in my eyes

Iâ€™m the one who caused my demise

Iâ€™m psychotic, thereâ€™s no surprise 

I hate you all, your love was lies

God left us, no point to pray

The devil says he came to play

For your safety, please stay away

Iâ€™ll kill myself another day
