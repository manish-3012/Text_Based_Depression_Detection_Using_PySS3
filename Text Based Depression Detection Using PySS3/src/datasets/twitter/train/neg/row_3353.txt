My life is getting better but Iâ€™m more suicidal then ever (update)I explained this in a different post that got deleted so Iâ€™ll skim over this as short as I can make it:

December 15: started dating my girlfriend and I love her a lot and we already joke about marriage, mutual neglect from our parents have made us love each other a lot and get attracted fast

December 8th: contemplated suicide to the point that I had a loaded gun to my head and and told my girlfriend (then best friend) and all my friend groups goodbye

February 14th (bday): my parents get in a very heated argument about my moms lack of ability to sleep due to her Insomnia and my dad is forced to sleep at our familyâ€™s store

February 17th: parents tell me there getting a divorce and Iâ€™m scared because I know the legal battle will be messy for my sister

With all of the points Iâ€™ve shown above (except the first one) I have decided that I will kill myself February 20th 2020 but I really donâ€™t want too I really donâ€™t because I love my girlfriend so much and if I can just live to 18 I can be free away from my parents but I canâ€™t do it I do know if I can
