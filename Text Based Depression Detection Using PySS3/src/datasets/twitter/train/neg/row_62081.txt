I just want someone to talk or type to or even someone to hear this and het it off my chestFor the longest time I've been feeling depressed with the occasional thought of ending it all. The only reason I haven't is because I know I don't have the nerve to do it.
I've been depressed because my parents barely talk to me and I an constantly berated at school for being overweight. Barely any of my friends even talk to me and most of them I don't even consider friends. My tastes in games and humor don't help. I don't like being put in pictures and when my family puts me in them I look dumb and they mock me for it and they still wonder why I don't like being in pictures, after they ruined my self esteem. My own mother even called me an asshole for not wanting to be in a photo. My parents haven't even been able to pick up on the fact that I'm depressed. The only outlets I even have are Reddit, YouTube, and Video games. Your support would be appreciated reddit, thank you for reading and sorry for any grammatical mistakes I've made as I'm on mobile.

tl;dr: feeling depressed and would like some support from the internet
