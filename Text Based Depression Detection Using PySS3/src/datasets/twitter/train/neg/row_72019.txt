Suicide makes sense when I have HIV, am gay and everyone around is so greedy and mean.I was raised thinking this is the best time in history to be alive but I feel so much despair. I live some place where the people are as a rule very anti-gay, which is the case in every major US city, and I am on the verge of losing health insurance because I'm poor and Trump and conservatives are in power. I have HIV and wish and dream of having access to assisted suicide. I feel so alone and life is horrible.
