I don't knowWhy I'm making this. I guess it's a last ditch. I'm very near killing my self. I've struggled with a gun to my head countless times. Never having pulled the trigger. My fiancÃ© aborted our boy without telling me and then left me. I'm absolutely dead inside. The only thing I feel at all is morbid depression. She was my life, we were starting a family. I loved her more than life in every sense of the term. I miss her a disgustingly. My world. The other morning I woke up in the hospital with no one around confused as to where I was and how I got there until I looked on a tray besides me and saw my empty bottle of adavan and pain killers, looked in my phone and saw some pretty cold texts between the two of us. Pieced it tougher. I went on suicide autopilot and swallowed enough prescription drugs to kill a horse. I don't know how it didn't work. It made me sick. I gathered my shit from the room and left without saying anything to anyone. These last few days have been getting worse, and I don't think there's anything left for me. I love her so damn much. And she killed our baby without even telling me. I want to die. I don't see any way around it. I know people have been through worse than this, but I'm just not strong enough. I know I'll hurt people but I want this disgusting pain to be over.
