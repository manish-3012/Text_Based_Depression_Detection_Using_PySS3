It feels like all too much.I made in-depth plans for my suicide twice now. Both times I ended up being admitted to the hospital before attempting.

I don't have plans right now, but just the knowledge of the last plans I made--how easy it'd be to implement considering I took all the steps up until the last one (stepping off the ledge)... it's like a constant temptation weighing on my mind.

I'm done planning because both times I was caught. This scares me more because next time I feel it'll be impulsive. Just 1, 2, 3 GO. 

I'm not sure what to do. I don't want to go back to the hospital again. But just thinking how easy it is, it makes me want to give in so badly.

I want to be gone. I want so badly to be gone. Is it really that bad if I were?

I don't know what to do.

I just know I want to jump.
