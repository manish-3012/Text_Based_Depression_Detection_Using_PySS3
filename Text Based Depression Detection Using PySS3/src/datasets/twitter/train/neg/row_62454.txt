This is the end.This is it everyone. This is the final hour of my life on Earth. I have everything ready to go, my suicide note, and I am going to spend my last hour recording messages for all my friends and family. Clearly this world wasnâ€™t meant for me, and I wasnâ€™t meant for this world. So goodbye. Fuck it all.
