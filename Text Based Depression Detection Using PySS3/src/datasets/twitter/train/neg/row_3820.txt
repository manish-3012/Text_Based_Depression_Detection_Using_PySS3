This is my endWhere to start? I'm lost, I don't know where to go from here. Everything keeping me here is gone. I feel ashamed, embarrassed. I'm a joke, I'll never find love, I'll never have a life and i'll never live. 

Today I just found out that I've been a laughing stock at my work because i asked out a co-worker. It's going around like wildfire. I'm a shift leader, Basically a manager, so my boss is going to find out, and fire me for harassment. I'm just waiting. I just wanted to be close to someone, but fuck me right? I don't deserve anything, I'm worthless aparently. Well goodbye, thanks for reading.
