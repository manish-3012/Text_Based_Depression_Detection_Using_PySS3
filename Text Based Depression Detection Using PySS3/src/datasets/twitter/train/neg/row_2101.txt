Life is just a distractionThe past few months for me have been difficult. Life has been stressful, I'm not taking care of myself anymore, everything feels pointless. I don't want to try to exaggerate my feelings, as I know how much more others have gone through.
So, these last few months have been filled with not so good thoughts. Thoughts that I never shared to anyone so as not to be a burden. In an attempt to distract myself I tried listening to music nonstop, singing, drawing, reading, drowning myself in schoolwork. Anything and everything to keep myself busy and my mind occupied, just so those God damn thoughts won't creep back into my head, though they always find a way. Just in my experience, life is a distraction.
