A constant cycle of wanting to live, and then wanting to die.This cycle started 4 years ago, when I had my first big clash with my parents. They told me I was an accident and they would be better without me, so naturaly I wanted to end it. I didn't.

I felt really sad and empty for about 2 months, then I stopped and kinda felt good again - I thought my parents were just angry at that moment, and that they'd never say such things seriously, but oh boy was I wrong. I was happy for about a week or so, when a new argument started (in case anyone's interested, it's about my bedtime), with the same outcome as last time. The cycle continues - feeling shit for a few months, slowly recovering, some shit happening again.

My only escape were my friends, but due to the covid lockdown in my country, i haven't seen them in a month, and I won't see them any time soon as well. I'm feeling down as ever and just want to end it once and for all so I don't have to experience the dissapointment after every recovery.

Sorry for my shitty english it's my second language.
