Random thoughts of what it would be like to kill myself in numerous ways.It's never really serious.  It's usually just the imagery of how I would do it and where.  It's usually just the simple thought of what I would do it with and who would be affected.  It could be with a knife or a gun or pills or whatever.  I haven't really ever completely planned on actually accomplishing this, but the thoughts are becoming more frequent.  I'm actually fairly happy, but I just can't seem to stop thinking about killing myself.  It's actually really relaxing to just know that if worse comes to worst; I'll always have that option.  Is this going to get progressively worse?  I'm really not 'depressed', but I've noticed the frequency, and I could use some feedback on whether or not my mind is going to make this a serious problem...
