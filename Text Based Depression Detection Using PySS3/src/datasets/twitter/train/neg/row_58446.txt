Just some thoughtsFeeling pretty low as of late and on this cold Friday night alone I was once again brought into the dark thinking that is depression/suicide. 

I searched through the internet and found many sites saying it isn't worth it and to talk it out or there's always someone who cares. Blah blah blah. Same old same old. 

Then I found this and many other threads about such dark times and seeing so many people going through what I am going through is truly remarkable. I'm not sure whether to feel happy that I am not alone or sad that everyone else has to suffer the way that I do. 

I, as many others on this post I imagine, feel alone and am honestly tired of being told the same thing over and over. There's always highs and lows in life, but as of recent the highs I have now are what my lows were a mere 2 years ago. 

Everyone has their story, as do I. Whether to share or to keep is up to the holder of such deep thinking. 

Sorry for the wall of text.
