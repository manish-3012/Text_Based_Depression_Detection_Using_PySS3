Make the darkness come outI want to cut apart my arms
Let the pain assuage my doubt.
Watch the blood pool in the bathtub
Until I bleed the darkness out.

I want a bag over my head
Run the air down as I about
Feel the hot tears cloud the plastic
Until I breathe the darkness out.

I want to crawl inside a dumpster
Stick a gun into my mouth
Squeeze shut my eyes and squeeze the trigger
I want to blow the darkness out.

It doesn't matter that I hurt
They beg that I would stay
It makes no difference what I want
I breathe, cry, feel-- darkness every day.
