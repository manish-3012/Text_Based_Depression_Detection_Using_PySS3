I'm officially committing suicide next OctoberI fucking hate my life. I've been suicidal since I was 11 years old, and since then, things got worse for me. I hate living in an area where winters last until fucking April and I have a feeling that this winter will be the worst in my life. On October 11, 2019, I will walk to a forest and I will hang myself. I can't fucking take this shit anymore.
