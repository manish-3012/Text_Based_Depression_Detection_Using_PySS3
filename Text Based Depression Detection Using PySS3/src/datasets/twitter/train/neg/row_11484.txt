I can't exist here anymore.I feel so fucking useless existing here, and having derealization/depersonalization I feel like I don't even exist at all. no will will ever love me in the way I need someone to. I just want to be someones SOMEONE. which I know is a lot to ask. I know it's a lot to want to be someones only but the thought of being someone's is the only thing that keeps me going. I was second hand denied by the first guy I've felt a genuine connection with in more than a year, and I just feel so fucking unlovable and useless. I know people are going to tell me m family and friends love me and I know that, I already feel bad about how I don't appreciate them enough. but it's not the kind of love I need. and I know that it's so stupid that I need romantic love to be able to live but I do. and I also know people are going to tell me to just wait and eventually someone will come along but I can't fucking wait. I need it now. I need to be loved by someone now and if I can't be then I can't live.
