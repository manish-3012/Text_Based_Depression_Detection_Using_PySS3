I might kill myself soonI can't do this anymore. I'm just 17, and I can't deal with this anymore. I don't fit in anywhere not even with the weirdos. Life is meaningless to me and the only things keeping me alive is my art and family, but I'm disappointing my family and I am losing motivation to draw. My life doesn't fucking matter, I'm a piece of shit. I wish I had a gun to end my life. God knows I deserve it
