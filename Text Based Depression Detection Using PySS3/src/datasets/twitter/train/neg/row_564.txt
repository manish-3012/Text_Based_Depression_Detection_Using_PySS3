I want to dieEveryday I wake up convincing myself not to just end my shit. I was hospitalized for ideation, and diagnosed as bipolar with PTSD. Since then, I had to move to a new state that I have no friends or connections or job in. I have negative moneyâ€”and even more-so after a hospitalization. My boyfriend broke up with me. I live with my parents which are the biggest triggers that I have. I feel as though I have no purpose and no reason to carry on. I canâ€™t go back to the hospital, I see a therapist weekly and go to a support group. I donâ€™t know what else to do.
