I'm an ugly girl and I hate myselfI'm so depressed, everywhere I go there are absolutely stunning girls. And even the ones who aren't conventionally pretty carry themselves in such a way that they're attractive.


Me, I'm ugly, gangly, lanky, awkward, and have no idea how to fix it. I've tried makeup, I've tried clothes, I've tried imitating people and I can't do it.


I hate how ugly I am. I hate my genetics and my hideous face and disgusting body. I have a really disgusting smile, it's like an ugly version of Natalie Dormer's because my mouth is uneven. I can't even take one photo without making myself cringe.


And it's not just appearance-based, I have a bad personality, a temper, no friends, no job, no hobbies, no future. All I do is sit at home and reddit. I'm basically the female version of a neckbeard. I'm so tired of my life.
