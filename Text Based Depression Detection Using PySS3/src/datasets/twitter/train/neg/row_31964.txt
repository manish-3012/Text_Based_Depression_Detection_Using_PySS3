I'll never be a good personThe reason I have no social skills and always say the wrong thing to people isn't because I have trouble communicating or expressing myself, it's just that I don't care about other people and I'm selfish. I can sugarcoat it any way I want to but the fact is if I really cared about other people and really wanted to make friends it would be easy for me, and if I really considered other people's feelings I wouldn't constantly put my foot in my mouth. All I want to do is be alone, I have friends who care about me and my mom loved me when she was alive but I never appreciate the people who reach out to me. Their care and time are wasted on me because I'm only barely a human being and I take advantage of everything that is given to me with no desire to give back or become a part of a social circle. It's also the reason why I can't trust anyone and why I assume other people are thinking negative things about me: even though I play the victim in my head I know it's because I understand that I can't be trusted and because I think negative things about others, and I assume everyone else is as shitty a person as me. I have tried to change myself but I can't make myself care, I can't make myself think like a normal person. All "changing myself" does is cause me to act even more fake. Nothing will cure the core of my being which is that of a self-serving narcissist. The best thing I could do to repay the kindness of those close to me is to relieve them of my burden.
