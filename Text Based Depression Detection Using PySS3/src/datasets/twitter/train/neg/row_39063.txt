47m, 3 adult daughters out on their own, 2 grandkids, divorced 3 times, social anxiety and clinical depression since childhood, 3 attempts over the years, next will not fail. Can't seem to proceed without figuring out how to deal with finances, letters, etc...For the financial advice part, I asked for advice before but not under these circumstances so please don't hate.
