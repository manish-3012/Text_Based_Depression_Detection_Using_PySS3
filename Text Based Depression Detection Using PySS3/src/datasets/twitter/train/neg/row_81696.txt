I canâ€™t relate to counting downI told my close friends that I would be dead by 21, Iâ€™m 18 turning 19 in December and everyday is hell. I donâ€™t leave bed, I barely want to get up to pee. Days on end fucking up my personal hygiene. I stare at the ceiling for hours. I have no one. I just moved states and itâ€™s been harder than expected. I canâ€™t take the thought of staying here and continuing to live this sick life. Nothing to live for, nobody to love, nothing to do.    I donâ€™t cry anymore and canâ€™t remember the last genuine cry session I had. Everyone in my life hates me and nobody would miss me. Even the people who know Iâ€™m suicidal donâ€™t give a shit, I stopped talking to everyone. Iâ€™ve gone mute. I just nod my head. I think Iâ€™ve started to lose my mind, I hear things and see things that arenâ€™t there. Itâ€™s like Iâ€™m constantly taking double takes and itâ€™s scary. My dreams have turned into my worse nightmares and I just canâ€™t catch a break. Iâ€™m not sorry for my family either. I wish I wasnâ€™t alone battling these demons but theyâ€™re winning.
