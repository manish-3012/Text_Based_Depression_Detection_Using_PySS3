What am i running from?I can't go on recently. Everything i know is slowly Fading and I'm debating with myself if i can go on. Not that i want to die - i just want to be relieved of my pain &amp; suffering. I feel super lonely and nobody understands mental health. It sucks also not being able to seek medical advice because of my job. 

Because you cant see mental health. Nobody gives a fuck.
