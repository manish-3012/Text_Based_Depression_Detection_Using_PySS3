I feel like death may be the only way outI feel trapped. Trapped in my marriage, trapped in my job, trapped in my own repeating pattern of anxiety and depression. I don't have any hope. I feel powerless. I feel like I don't have control over anything, which is why I think about suicide so much. I feel like I would be taking the ultimate control. Death feels like freedom sometimes. Like, only in death can I be freed from all of my cages.

I don't know why I'm here, I'm so sorry. I just don't have anywhere else to say these things. I don't leave my home very much and my only real interaction with anyone other than my wife is through social media.

I'm just so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
