I just don't feel that I deserve to live anymoreI've done something awful. And I can't deal with it. I wrote a letter to an institution about a doctor I saw and I realize now that it was misguided and wrong. It was such a Karen move. I didn't completely understand the situation and the doctor definitely had a negative reaction to it. I was in a bad place when I wrote it and listened to the wrong people. I just don't think that I deserve to live. I really just feel that I'm an awful person in general and I keep making mistakes. I've hurt people. I've let money destroy relationships. I'm just going to hurt more people.  just don't feel there is coming back from the things I've done. I want to be better and try but the guilt and shame is eating me alive. It's making everyday such a struggle. I don't want to worry everyone in my life. And I can't tell my therapist because she just asks me if I'm "committed to not killing myself" and I feel that I can't even talk about my suicidal thoughts. 

Getting through each day consists of trying to work at my job during the day but I'm worried the guilt and shame will make it so I can't work anymore. Then at night I talk to friends and try to watch mindless television or drink wine but I know all these terrible things will just come out one day. 

I don't know how to move forward.
