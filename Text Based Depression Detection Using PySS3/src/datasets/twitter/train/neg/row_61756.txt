Tired.Not my first time posting here, but my first time posting on this account.

Where do I begin. Grew up with a narcissistic+dysfunctional family, bullied in school, abused by my first boyfriend (6 years), just a generally messed up life. I didnâ€™t really except any of this until I had a nervous break-down last year, developed panic disorder and eating disorder, and put myself into therapy. All along I thought I had been the one who was the problem. 

Things were really turning around. I was making moves to move to a new city with a friend, planning moves with my career and my art, and really looking forward to healing.

And then the coronavirus hit the United States. My friend and I werenâ€™t ready to settle down in time, we couldnâ€™t get supplies to weather a shutdown. I had to go back to my family. Because of social distancing I canâ€™t hide out in my usual haunts away from my family. I donâ€™t have any friends in this town. Thankfully our house is big enough that I can hide away somewhere most of the day, but whenever They walk in the room itâ€™s a jab at  something that Iâ€™m doing or eating or wearing. 

Iâ€™m just really tired. 

I think Iâ€™m grieving, too. I felt loved, heard, and wanted for the first time in 25 years when I was with my friend. I also realized how messed up I was because of my background and I was honestly looking forward to getting better. 

I donâ€™t know how long this quarantine is going to last. I donâ€™t know how long I can handle this.

Iâ€™m tired.
