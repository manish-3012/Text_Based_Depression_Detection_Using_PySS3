even when i'm happy i still think about killing myselfFor the past couple of weeks, i've been in a really bad place (not to say my normal mental state is good, but the past few week have been especially bad) and seriously thought about killing myself constantly. I couldn't even go a couple hours without breaking down. I finally got out of my slump at the beginning of this week, and i started to feel happy again. Today was the happiest i've been in months. But even when i'm happy,  i still think about killing myself and i don't know how to make the thoughts stop. i've had serious thoughts about killing myself since i was a kid and i always thought that things would get better. I thought i would eventually start feeling better, but i never have. The thoughts are getting to be overwhelming and it's interfering with work and school and my relationships with other people. This is too much for me to handle. I don't want to deal with the thoughts anymore, and nothing i do ever helps. Even when i'm happy i still want to kill myself. I don't know what to do anymore.
