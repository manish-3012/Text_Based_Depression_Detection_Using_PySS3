i just dont know mani wanna be concise in conveying what i want to say but i dont know how 

i feel like it's amazing how motherfucking complicated this bullshit has to be i just want friends, a genuine relationship maybe
it breaks my fucking heart how this socializing shit feels like a fucking maze nowadays

I think I'm fucking delusional and fucked in the head
y'know what i mean
Man i am so tired of feeling like i am breaking the elephant in the room that is "being edgy" 

Fuck that shit why is it so hard to get some compassion nowadays because "everyone else is suffering"

I think the root of my aspergers (yeah im pulling the fucking cripple card because fuck the shame associated with "just not keeping your trap shut because everyone else has mental health issues but aren't complaining man im being fucking stabbed in the heart right now) is the whole fact that i can't have the ideal world i want where none of this shit is needlessly complicated

I just wanna bawl, shout, fucking cry! Why does finding a shoulder to cry on feel either too weird to do or it feels like I'm one-upping someone's problems

Jesus Christ sorry i just want to be fucking cared for, i've had help before and it worked but sometimes i cant fucking do this anymore
