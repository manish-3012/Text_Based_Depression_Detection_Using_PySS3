A dark placeI feel like this year has robbed me of so much happiness. And I know Iâ€™m not alone in that. I am so frustrated with the lack of control I have in my life right now that Iâ€™m really struggling. I have to work from home right now because of the pandemic and I get very little human interaction. Some days the only human I see is my husband, but we havenâ€™t been getting along very well this year and he recently expressed heâ€™s very unhappy in our relationship. I feel really alone and every day I wake up and try to find a reason to get out of bed but there really isnâ€™t one right now. Sometimes the only reason I get out of my bed is to feed the fish. Iâ€™ve tried counseling and so many different depression meds, this year is just different. I feel like I canâ€™t get a win. And Iâ€™m in a really dark place.
