I'm Just About to End All of My Suffering today.I cannot live like the way I do anymore isolating myself from everyone else, but its like, I don't really have a choice. I've tried communicate with people that I meet from all over and try hard to relate to them, but most times, it just doesn't work. I've suffered from horrible anxiety and depression for most of my life and at one point I knew what it feels like to be completely alone to the point that no one truely cares about you. Now I'm still In that same situation where I have literally no one to go to for comfort, but I've learned to suppress those feelings, but it just makes me feel like more of a fuck up. I'm completely alone to the point where no one would care if I live or die, I just feel so alone in this world and don't know what to, but its like no one really cares right ? Not even enough to read this.
I'm just soo alone and have no idea what to do other than the one thing we all know to do. I just can't live like this anymore, its killing me from the inside out.
