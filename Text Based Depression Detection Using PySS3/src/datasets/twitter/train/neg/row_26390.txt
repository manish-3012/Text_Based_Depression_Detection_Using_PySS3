Iâ€™m at my breaking pointBy now, my coworkers are celebrating that I got fired. I have no one else and I just want to be held but Iâ€™m fat and ugly so thatâ€™s a fucking bust. I want to die, but people rely on me to take care of their dirty work so it seems selfish to take away their easy out. Hey have no identity, I am no one without my last relationship. Iâ€™m pathetic and I want to die. Funny enough: Iâ€™m currently *surrounded* by other people and I couldnâ€™t feel more alone
