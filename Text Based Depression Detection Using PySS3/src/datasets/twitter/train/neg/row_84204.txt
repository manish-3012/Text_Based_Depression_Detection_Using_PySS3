yeahhhhhhh I'm not gonna make it through this stupid lockdownI just found out the stay at home order in my state is now through 4/30, not 4/17 like we had been told previously. I was just barely hanging in there for 2 weeks more of this. I really dont feel safe now.... I'm thinking about calling the cops on myself so I dont do anything but I feel like a spoiled bitch for reacting this way to it
