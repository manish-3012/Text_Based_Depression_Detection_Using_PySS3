Here behind my wallI don't think my problems are solvable.

I detest who I am because I can't maintain self-discipline, but changing that would require self-discipline.

The problems that the outside world places on me are both constant, insurmountable, and seemingly specifically tailored for me to the point that it seems unrealistic to think they are just change.

I want to die, but I'll never commit suicide because I'd rationalise my way out of that too. Every day, though, I want more intensely to be kicked out of my house and just ... lie down on the side of the road and starve. The only way to die that doesn't require me to put in any effort, so at least I can die as I lived. Perfect.
