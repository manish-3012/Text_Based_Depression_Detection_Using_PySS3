Felling very overwhelmedLike the title says, I'm feeling very overwhelmed. I started meeting people online for the first time and I'm waiting for a job to begin. 

I feel like my chest is going to burst. I don't know why. I just feel so nervous and anxious. I feel like crying but also not crying. 

My life probably isn't very tough by most people's standards but it's almost too much for me to handle rn. I don't want suicide, but I'm just feeling high-strung.
