i can't do anything right any moreno matter how hard i try, no matter what i do or what i say, i can never do anything right in the eyes of others any more. i'm nothing more than a failure, through and through. i'm just a lonely, undeserving failure who should've died months ago. every time i think things are getting better, i end up cursing myself and things get so much worse. maybe i just don't deserve to be happy.

if things don't get any better by the end of the year... i'm not sticking around. i can't any more. everyone else is leaving me or turning their backs on me, so i may as well do the same. it's better that way. they won't care anyway.
