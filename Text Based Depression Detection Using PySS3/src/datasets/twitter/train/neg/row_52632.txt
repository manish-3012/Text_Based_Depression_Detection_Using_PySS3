Im readyIm ready to do this. Im ready to get it over with. My life really has no purpose. I suck at everything i try to do. I dont even have real friends, the ones i thought were real well i just learned that they are bitching me and excluding me, doing activites without me. Im just done. I dont want to get better. I dont see the point. My life wont ever be worth anything, except maybe my parents but meh, they dont really care about me either so theyll get over it. Im done. The only happy though i have is knowing my pain will be over in a couple of minutes, hours max.
