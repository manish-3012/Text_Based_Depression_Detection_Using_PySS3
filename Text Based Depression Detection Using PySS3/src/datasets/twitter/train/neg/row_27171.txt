What is the point? Iâ€™m tired of trying to figure it out.I have struggled with intrusive thoughts for a really reallly long time. Theyâ€™ve always been there but as of late itâ€™s gotten to the point where itâ€™s not just something that pops up sometimes, itâ€™s ALL I think about. because of everything going on right now in the world, I seriously donâ€™t see the point anymore. 
Whenever I try to think about my future, I see nothing. I struggle so much because I WANT to be happy, but I feel like being alive will NEVER make me happy. 
The world will always be shitty, no matter how many happy moments you have. I feel like for every â€œhappyâ€ moment you have in your life, thereâ€™s 50 shitty things that happen. The bad will always outweigh the good. 
I just donâ€™t see the point to life anymore. 
I know this sounds so shitty, but Iâ€™m so surprised more people donâ€™t feel like this. 
Like how do people just do stuff..like all the time....and happily? 
For the past week, all I can think about is killing myself. I hate that thereâ€™s no easy way to go. I hate that in even trying to end my suffering I have to suffer. Like what the fucking fuck? I wish there was a way to just think yourself dead. Like If I just keep thinking about being dead while asleep Iâ€™ll just die. But no. All of the methods are so difficult and hard to do. Like seriously who the fuck has access to any of this shit. I canâ€™t even fucking hang myself because I live in a tiny ny apartment and thereâ€™s no solid place to tie myself up. So fucking irritating. 
I donâ€™t know know when Iâ€™ll kill myself, but I know it will 100% happen.
