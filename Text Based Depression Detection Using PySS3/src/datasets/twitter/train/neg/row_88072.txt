I think im about to do it.Whats th purpose of this life really? Theres never really a moment in my life when am not worried.  So many fucking problems but i cant find a way to solve em. Stress ruined my life ,i lost mt face and never got it back and then everyone said i faked it. I dropped out of highschool 3 times in a row now its gonna be 4th time and i know i wont be able to bear the embarrassment., I tried mt best but nope hard work just never pays off for me. My parents hate me so much for being a failure , all i am is a disappointment for them. The only reason i never killed myself is them. I know theyre not gonna be able to bear the loss but seems like i have no fucking choice. I cant do anything.
I have a gun right next to  me and i guess i better shoot myself right now because Life just never gets better. I always give up on killing myself and think i should give  this life another shot but nope i always end up like this. I alwyays regret not killing myself.  And i think i should really just end it all this time.
