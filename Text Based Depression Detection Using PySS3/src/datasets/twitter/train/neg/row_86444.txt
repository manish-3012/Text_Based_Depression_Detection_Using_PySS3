i need helphello everyone, i am writing these as i am crying, iâ€™m desperate for help

to explain my situation, i recently learned that my dad has been cheating on my mom over 6 months. my mom (obviously) is a wreck right now. my dad and i havent been contacting other than a few messages since i learned that. my dad always calls me or texts me though, i just dont respond. he tells me he didnt lie or cheat. my mom constantly talks about this and i have to hear it. i know its normal but i think i will seriously go insane

i have told this to my mom, that i dont want to be a part of this, she said okay but she still keeps going

i try not to tell these to my close friends bc i dont want to be a burden to anyone. i shut myself completely but i am dying inside

i have summer school and i have to read books for my classes but i cant focus, i cant do my homeworks and i think iâ€™ll fail my classes. my gpa was 3.6, i am sure that wont be the case when summer ends

i am seriously thinking about suicide 
i need help
can someone who is willing to listen to me and be understanding message me? thank you
