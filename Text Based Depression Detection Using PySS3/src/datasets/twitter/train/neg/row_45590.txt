Second Suicide AttemptI know no one will probably see this or care but I am literally so close to attempting suicide for the second time in the last like five weeks. I am 18 years old and I tried overdosing on so much shit on May 2nd but I survived it and went through hell. I basically fucked up my system and had to be in the hospital for 2+ weeks, involuntarily obviously. Since the incident, I was put on the exact same meds that got me there in the first place (because impatient unit doctors fucking suck) and I've been officially diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. My life is a fucking mess rn. I'm probably not going to graduate high school (I'm a senior) and I don't have anyone left in my life except for toxic people that I let back in. I drove away the people that actually cared and I'm at a point where it really won't matter if I die like I had wanted to in the fucking first place.
I really have no future and I can't keep living like this
I even tried reaching out to people before this as a last resort and they didn't care

I just feel so lost
