I know Iâ€™m in hellit seems very likely. and I donâ€™t wanna continue feeling existentially cursed. Every event seems to be directed at me, and my downfall. And Iâ€™ve fallen. And I keep falling. Every thing I do, seems to exacerbate the external circumstances. I canâ€™t accomplish ANYTHING. I say â€œcanâ€™tâ€ because Iâ€™ve been optimistic, and continued to fail. 17 years of my life. Extreme psychological abuse. Psychopathic mother. Even after Iâ€™ve escaped, and dealt with the past, reality is, I still exist. My existence seems inherently painful. Full of anguish I suppose. Surrounded by my own failures, and inability to adapt. Cursed is how I feel. I continue to try, results similar to the opposite. so Iâ€™m close to giving up. I seem to be a beacon of stress, my aura causing others to feel similarly. Exhausted efforts to try and help me. No results. I have nobody left. And Iâ€™m not exaggerating. Nobody seems to understand the inner turmoil of failing everything i try. That misunderstanding leads to strain on relationships. Iâ€™m seen as lazy. Not willing to try. But nobody sees me how i feel, trapped inside, begging for mercy from my mind. All I want is my brain to listen. but since I can search for answers so well, but Iâ€™m failing terribly at studies,(my iq is too fucking high) itâ€™s a choice. Iâ€™m BEGGING for mercy. But I only descend farther. Iâ€™m ready to give up, but whatâ€™s the point?? Iâ€™m trapped in this reality. I tried offing myself a few years back, when I was with my psychopath(yes PSYCHOPATH, narcissist ) mother. over 100mg oxy. A handful of clonazepam. I ran into the woods. Far as I could. Yet, I STILL WAKE UP IN A HOSPITAL BED? this makes no fucking sense. And it makes me feel trapped. So I search for liberation.
