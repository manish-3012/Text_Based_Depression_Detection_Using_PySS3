I'm going to kill myself tomorrowSo, yea. I tried the whole "treatment" thing for 6 months, and I still feel depressed and hopeless. My therapist has been great. She supports, and challenges me. I love talking to her. My meds haven't really worked, but I didn't think they would. Im depressed for no reason other than I'm lonely (I have lots and lots of friends) so I am going to kill myself around 8pm tomorrow. I cant really go to anyone without getting yelled at or put in a fucking psychward. So....im in a bit of a hole. Any ideas on how to get out of this?
