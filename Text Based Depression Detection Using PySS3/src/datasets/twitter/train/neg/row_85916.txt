LeavingAfter I've been with my friends for a few hours I get this awful feeling in me. I want to go home, I'm not wanted here, I just need to climb in bed and cry. It almost always happens that way. It's not necessarily random though, something always happens to set the mood off. Usually something I internally find "offensive" and never anything truly meant to hurt me. Like, I'll be with my friend and her boyfriend and they start talking to eachother and mention things they do together and I just don't know why I don't get invited to these things sometimes like....I get it's your relationship but sometimes I don't know why you can't just hang out with your friend. And then I just feel like, fuck boys, fuck life, I'm not wanted here. Today I was invited over but something in me was just like...ok they want you to go home now. Other times it will just be me and my friend and strangers will start conversations with her or flirt with her and I'm just like...ouch. The pain in chest begins and I just want to go home and I think, wow I could really just go flying over the bridge and it would be over. No one would feel like they have to talk to me or whatever. It's not just friends that make me feel this way but my own dad just never calls. He calls because he wants me to walk his dog, or he wants money or he wants to know where my brother is....he never talks to me. I've felt this vibe from him for so long, he talks to my brother all of the time and he never talks to me and I don't understand what I do wrong. I think he makes me feel worse than anyone ever has and I just don't understand. I just think, fine you don't want to talk to me, I never have to talk to you again my life changes in no way, where already half way there. I just feel under appreciated sometimes idk I guess I take it to the heart when maybe it doesn't have to be that way. Maybe I'm just delusional, but maybe me being here wouldn't reallf matter. I don't know
