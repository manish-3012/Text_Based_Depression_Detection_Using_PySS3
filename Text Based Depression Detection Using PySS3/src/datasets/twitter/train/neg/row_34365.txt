I attempted suicide August 23rdI woke up in the hospital and just havenâ€™t felt the same since. I overdosed on pills, I took about 140 Wellbutrin and had to get my stomach pumped and intubated. They sedated me for a few days and then I went to a mental health hospital. Nothing feels real anymore, Iâ€™ve been sober ever since. I used to drink everyday. Everything just feels different now. I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m happy Iâ€™m alive or just indifferent. Why does nothing feel real?
