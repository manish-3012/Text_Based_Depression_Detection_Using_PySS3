My mom is meanI went to the army for my mom to help her out. She wrote letters about how I was an angel and she missed me, how she cried for me. I got depressed and suit deal and was discharged. My mom praised me for a bit and now treats me like shit. She never apologizes for anything hurtful she says and if I cry she gets after me for being sensitive and basically rolls her eyes, which makes me hurt even more.

Just today, I put the left Iver's in the already packed fridge full of expired food, and told her and she gave that side glance with raised eyebrows looks like "yeah..." And I asked if I did anything wrong. She said no,and that that was the only thing I've done and she's impressed in a very condescending tone.

After all I've been through, that broke me down. I was doing absolutely fine after the army, actually happy and that little comment made me appalled. I now don't look at her the same. Every time she smiles at me like were friends again makes me sick and I have to leave and she acknowledges it, but never says anything about it. That has always been a very prominent thing with her. And I get ridiculed for crying. I get targeted.

I'm not safe in my own home and it gets to the point where I'm afraid to be anywhere near them. My mom is mean my mom is mean my mom is mean.

If she were to find me in the state i m in, shed dismiss it as me being weak. She's been through a lot in her years, so you'd think she wouldn't want her kid to go through the same thing. But I'm nothing to her
I feel like I'm nothing to her. I feel like if I were to die, she wouldn't care. She wouldn't
