What do you do when you do not like the people supporting you?There is one person, family or otherwise, that I consider a friend-- someone who doesn't frustrate me after 20 minutes with them. I always liked to think I was someone with a long fuse, but I just find myself collapsing internally spending so much time around these people.

I do not have much choice in selecting those around me. My current state has been living with my parents and basically having only the will to death the past few years. I don't kill myself because no matter what, I will make people miserable if I kill myself. The right thing to do right now is smile and bear it because if I showed more signs of depression or even told any of the people around me that I disliked them, it would make multiple people miserable. The reasons sadly don't matter-- the effect would be their misery.

I just feel so trapped.
