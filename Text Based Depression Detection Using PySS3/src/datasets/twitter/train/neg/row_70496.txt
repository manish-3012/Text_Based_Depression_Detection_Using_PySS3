If I check myself into the hospital because I am suicidal, will they still see me without health insurance?I have been very very depressed for a long time and to make a long story short, I KNOW that suicide is viewed as â€œselfishâ€ but I feel like thatâ€™s the only way to stop hurting. I know I need help but unfortunately I do not have health insurance therefore I canâ€™t afford to see a psychiatrist and possibly get on meds. If I go to the ER and tell them I am suicidal, will they still see me? Or will they turn me away for lack of insurance? Somethingâ€™s gotta give.
