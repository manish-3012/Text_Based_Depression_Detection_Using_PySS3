really suicidal because i smellYou know that coworker you gossip and laugh about with your other coworkers about how gross they and they must never shower and spray febreeze around cuz of how awful they are? Well that's me. I have always smelled bad. I recently finally went to the doctor -- they acted like they didn't even believe me and couldn't figure out what was wrong. I have an appointment with a specialist only because I asked that's months away.

I don't want to go outside anymore. Probably going to quit my job. I do everything from washing my underarms with peroxide until they bleed and anything else you can think of, I don't get any better. And my blood work came back normal, so they'll probably never figure out what's wrong with me. I already had bad depression before -- literally every good opportunity I had to change my life for the better went down the drain because of it. So now I'm going to probably die all alone in a stupid minimum wage job in 50 years when I could've done way better. So what's the point of it all, you know?
