Who caresOn nights like this I don't know what I'm hanging onto. Maybe I just want someone to see through my lies, call me out on my shitty "I'm fine" look, someone to just ask if I'm fucking alright. Because I'm not. And there isn't anyone.

I can't stop these fucking tears, the ache in my chest, the fucking thoughts that won't ever go away. But who even cares?
