Throwaway for a reason. Everything in my life is nearly gone.My family hates me, my dad attacks me and makes me want to hurt myself, I'm becoming homeless, my girlfriend is threatening to leave, my friends are all gone, I'm losing all my support, people are avoiding me, I keep getting called useless and pointless by everyone, I'm in debt to so many people, I keep letting everyone down and disappointing people mostly for reasons that I can't control or because of oversights from me, every time I pull myself out of the pit I just keep falling back in again. It's not that I want to die. I just don't feel like I want to be here and alive anymore. I'm spiraling to rock bottom and now I just feel that there's no way out anymore.
