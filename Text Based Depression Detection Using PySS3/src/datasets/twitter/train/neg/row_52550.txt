not for my family or friends, but my petsi feel like absolute shit, almost everyday something will send me in a spiral and iâ€™ll learn more convenient ways to kill myself, start planning who iâ€™ll give my valuables to, what iâ€™ll destroy whatever things i donâ€™t want anyone to find and what iâ€™ll put on an aggressive note, but my mind always comes back to one place, my pet turtles, their names are naomi and shelly, red eared sliders, theyâ€™re not babies. it fucking sucks, i love the thought of how much more stressless my family will be without my presence (after the inevitable mourning). iâ€™m constantly disappointing and never really succeed to much, my future doesnâ€™t have anything written in it. i just donâ€™t trust anyone to take care of my turtles as well as i do, and how they follow me, and hiss at all of my other family members. a friend gave me shelly then i got naomi so sheâ€™d have a buddy, and i think of them going to her, but things have not been stable with her, and i kind of fucking hate her now and donâ€™t want her with my babies. my family is mediocre with them. iâ€™m not going to dump them into a river or something, i want them to have the best, huge proper habitat where theyâ€™ll have plenty of space to just be joyful turtles and all. i love them so much, i fucking hate myself and what i mean to others.
