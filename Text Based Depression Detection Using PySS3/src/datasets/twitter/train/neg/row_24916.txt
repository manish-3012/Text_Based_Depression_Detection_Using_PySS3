Feels like I'm suffocatingI feel so trapped in life, its really scary. Nothing is working, meds, therapy.     I feel like the only way out is death. I don't want to die but my mind is so fucked up and I'm barely holding on, its such an uncomfortable and frightening feeling. I have people that love me but the feelings of hopelessness are still there 24/7 and I'm desperately trying to find something to stay alive. I haven't laughed or felt pleasure for a few months now. Nothing distracts me from my feelings anymore, its just this constant feeling of despair. I'm not sure how long I'm going to last, I can only take so much.
