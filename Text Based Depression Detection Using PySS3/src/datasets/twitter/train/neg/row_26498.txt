Ending it nowFinally decided to end it today. About 5 mins away. Written out my note and managed to keep it pretty concise and to the point. I was scared before but strangely I'm not now. Writing it out has given me some peace with my decision. Either way I have been lurking here for a while and there's some good people that have posted on here. I hope whatever decisions people on this sub make just make sure it isn't rash or impulsive. I thought about this for a very long time and I'm finally ready to go. I hope you all make the right decision for you
