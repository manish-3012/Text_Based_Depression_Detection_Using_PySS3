I'm not sure where to go from here.Excuse me if this post is all over the place. I just have to get all of this out.


I thought about killing myself today. This wasn't a fleeting thought, or just something that randomly crossed my mind. And all I could think about is how easy it would be for me to do. The relief it would bring to those around me.

I got in my car and was on my way to the gym,  but once I got on the road, I forgot what I set out to do. I went back home and sat alone in my living room instead.

I now have to force myself to do the things I used to love. All of my favorite things are just things now. I haven't thought seriously about hurting myself in years and today, I just feel like something broke inside of me. Like there's nothing left. No good, no positivity. Just a void and a shit ton of broken pieces that everyone around me is forced to pick up. I am a burden. I unknowingly externalize my illnesses and force them onto those that I love. They don't deserve that. They try to help but they can't. 

I've cried, I've screamed, I've reached out for support, but I believe the time has come where I just sound like a broken record that no one wants to hear. And that's where I am now.
I'm broke, depressed, anxious, and now I guess I'm considered suicidal. I don't know what I think making this post is going to do. Maybe it's a last ditch effort to possibly pull myself out of this.
