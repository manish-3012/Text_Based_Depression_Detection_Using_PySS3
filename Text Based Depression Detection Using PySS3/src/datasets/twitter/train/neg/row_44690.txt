Husband admitted to the psych unit on suicidal watch, any advice welcome.The title pretty much says it all. I had no idea that my husband was feeling this way until he came home from work today and collapsed in my arms.  He said that heâ€™s been lying to me.  He said the last few days, heâ€™s made plans to kill himself. He told me that he had it all planned out, but he had actually had an ok day at work, and thatâ€™s what stopped him.   I had NO idea he was suffering. I thought we had good communication. I am in total shock. We got him checked in this evening. I am crushed. I could have been a widow.  If you have any insight, please feel free to comment.
