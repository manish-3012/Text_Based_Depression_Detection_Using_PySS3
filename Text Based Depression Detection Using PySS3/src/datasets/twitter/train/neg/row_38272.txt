My only promising method is looking screwed. We're slaves. RantI am so. gutted.

Fuck!

I have tried so desperately for so long to kms, every avenue is blocked without unthinkable pain. 

FUCK this society that forces a shitty life of servitude and pain!

FUCK IT!

The system is as corrupt and unfair as it is ancient. 
Thousands of people vote with their lives every year just to have it made harder for those in the future. The message is that our suffering is irrelevant because we are slaves
