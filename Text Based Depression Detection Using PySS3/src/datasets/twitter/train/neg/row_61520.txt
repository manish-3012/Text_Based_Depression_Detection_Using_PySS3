unfortunately soitâ€™s been one hell of a ride. short and filled with difficulties but itâ€™s been pretty good. met some incredible people who have shown me kindness, compassion, and sometimes made me feel happiness. From average life to tragedy, homeless, abuse(mental and physical), self harm and now Iâ€™m at the end of my journey. Iâ€™m going to miss the hell out of somethings but this is what it has come to. tried earlier this year and I failed. hope 2nd time is the charm. canâ€™t live with myself and living causes me pain and donâ€™t want to constantly be a burden to everyone around me especially my mother. I know my dead would bring great relief to a lot of people and I donâ€™t blame them. anyways thank you for reading this and unfortunately there isnâ€™t much you can do. sorry for this being messy and take care
