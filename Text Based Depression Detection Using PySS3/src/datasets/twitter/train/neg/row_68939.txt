I'm here to often... I'm such doodooTldr: I love my wife to much to end it. Ive had depression since I was 8, it kicked right after I was sexually abused as a child. Ive hated myself ever since... Anyway I'm here because I couldn't put the pizza from the oven into a plate. Read that again... I'm too mentally challenged to put a pizza on a plate. Pretty much sums up my life, in too stupid to do anything. I have 0 motivation to do anything and I'm bored for everything. Nothing interests me anymore. So I'm just patiently waiting for the day my wife finally opens her eyes and realizes I'm a loser so I can show myself out from this pitiful life.
