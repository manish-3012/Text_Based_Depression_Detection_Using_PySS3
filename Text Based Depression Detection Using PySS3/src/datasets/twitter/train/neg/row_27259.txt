Psychiatrist recommended that I should go to the hospitalMy psychiatrist recommended that I should go to the hospital so that I had a controlled environment where I they could find what medication is best for me. I am extremely scared to do it, what is it like? Will I be forced to do things I don't want to? Will I be mistreated? I'm very scared of the idea, should I take their advice and just go?
