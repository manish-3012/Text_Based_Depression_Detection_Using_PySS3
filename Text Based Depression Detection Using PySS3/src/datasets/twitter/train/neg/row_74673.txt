This is my last post. Iâ€™m done. You wonâ€™t be hearing from me ever again.One last rejection, one last friend zoning. I canâ€™t take this anymore. If it turns out that yeah, some people ARE meant to be alone, theyâ€™ll never find anyone, thereâ€™s a 100% chance Iâ€™m one of those people. I refuse to live like this, and there is a pocket knife right next to my head on the bedside cabinet. 

Donâ€™t try to save me. I just want to die. Fuck the world, and fuck you people who can effortlessly have what I never can. 

Bye.
