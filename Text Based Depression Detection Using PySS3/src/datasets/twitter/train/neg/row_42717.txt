xiâ€™ve been trying to die for a long time now. heck if you hand me a gun i could shoot my self in under 3 hours. 

i just need to clear my devices. have a drink. write a note. then do it. 

thereâ€™s nothing in my life i want to stay alive for. 

i have been crying for maybe 6 straight days. 

i havenâ€™t eaten very well. or hydrated. 
my head is pounding. 
and my brain wonâ€™t stop mercilessly tearing me down. 

i have to fight. to make it through a day. 
frankly i donâ€™t even know how to make it through today. 

maybe if i take it moment to moment i might be able to stay alive. 

but i canâ€™t. 

i donâ€™t see how to. 

i _need_ to die. 

i am bitter. that for some reason my brain employs this surgical instinct to keep me here. 

some nights, i hold a knife up to different parts of my body. 
my chest. right next to my heart. 
my wrists. 
that little pulsing place under my neck. 

i beg myself to do it. i think of how terrible everything is &amp; why i want to die. 
but . i just. donâ€™t?

i am gonna try again today. 
i am gonna get drunk this time. 
then just start. i can cut all three places if itâ€™ll increase my chances. 

the more blood i lose, the more likely my death.
