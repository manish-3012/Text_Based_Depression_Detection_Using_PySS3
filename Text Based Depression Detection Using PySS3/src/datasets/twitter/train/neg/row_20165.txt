Seems like getting a job is helping but stillI have the desire to be free from suffering forever but I'm taking it one day at a time. I'm working closer in the same city as my mom in long beach. Before a guy called me to work I was struggling , going crazy hearing voices , and was planning on leaving my place and go to the park and just go there each day and rot away and die . But since this guy has called and I did my first work yesterday and made a 100 bucks . Hopefully I can make rent in three days or before the first so I can travel back to Ontario and give my roommate the 500. Again , I'm still desiring to be eternally free from my suffering but with this job it seems to be a bit more motivating so I'm going to try but not give any promises and take it one day at a time. And good morning everyone
