I just rewrote and updated my suicide noteI donâ€™t have any plans in place to do it at the moment, but I was feeling like I wanted to die again so I decided to take the time to update my suicide note that I have in the notes on my phone, as it was outdated and from a time when my motive was slightly different. It actually surprisingly helped me get over the feeling, which is something that I didnâ€™t expect, though it does make sense because Iâ€™m getting all of my feelings regarding it out. At least now if I ever get the urge and opportunity to do it and I decide to seize the opportunity (which is unlikely since Iâ€™m waiting for something thatâ€™ll make it easier), my note will be updated and ready.
