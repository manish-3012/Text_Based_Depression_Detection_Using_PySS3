I donâ€™t have any emotional supportI canâ€™t talk to anyone close to me for several reasons and I know I should call like a crisis line or see a therapist but those things seem so clinical and like youâ€™re not really connecting with anyone on a emotional level but I feel so suffocated and isolated and canâ€™t think of a coping skill to save my life  besides keep everything to myself and then when Iâ€™m in private I just suffer. I take sleeping pills and cut myself to try to find some comfort because no one will comfort me and I donâ€™t know how to comfort myself
