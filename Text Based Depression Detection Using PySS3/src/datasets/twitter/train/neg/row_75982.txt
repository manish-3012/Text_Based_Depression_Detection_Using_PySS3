Why do people keep saying it's my fault?I attempted suicide last month, on november 27th. That got me into the hospital and into the psychiatric department. I stay there 5 days a week and return on weekends now. 

My nephew (almost 30 years old, 4 kids with 2 different women, used to be a soccer player, now works in a factory) came here and told me that im doing all of this on purpose, that the things im doing are stupid and that im giving my 3 y/o brother a bad example. (Look who's talking) 

My dad just sat there watching tv and said nothing. My nephew told me that nobody understands me, and that i can trust some strangers and talk to them (psychologists) but not my own family. Nobody understands. Im not going downstairs until he leaves. Merry fucking christmas.
