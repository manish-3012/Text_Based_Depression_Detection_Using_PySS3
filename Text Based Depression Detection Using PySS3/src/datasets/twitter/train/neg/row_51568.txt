Why does this keep happening to meIt happened again. He was my best friend and I thought it was wonderful and respectful and he's left now too. Won't tell me anything but to fuck off when I try to find out what I did to make him so angry. 

Why does everyone do this to me? I can't even hold it together for a shift at work and now im breaking down crying in the fucking bathroom. 

What's wrong with me what did I do
