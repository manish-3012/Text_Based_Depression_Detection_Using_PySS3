A rambleIâ€™m struggling, as Iâ€™m sure many of you out there are. The holidays can be the worst.

This holiday season has been especially hard for various reasons, and Iâ€™ve made it known to my boyfriend that I need a little extra support. 
A little more love than I usually ask for. 

What do I get for reaching out and being vulnerable?

Iâ€™m told Iâ€™m too sensitive. 
I expect too much.
Iâ€™m weak for showing my true feelings. 
â€œHave you tried not being negative?â€

This is what I get for reaching. 
Not help, but shame.

Everyone will say they are available, but when it comes down to it..

No one is ever really listening
