Iâ€™ll amount to nothingI canâ€™t get a job and if I donâ€™t get a first job then I wonâ€™t have experience to get another job and Iâ€™ll be homeless and I donâ€™t know what university to get into because in my generation you need super high marks (&gt;90%).  And whatâ€™s the point anyways even if I get a doctor I wonâ€™t make enough money for buying a house and Iâ€™ll just spend all my time working a job I hate until I die I wish I could be that one in a million rich person but I wonâ€™t do thereâ€™s no point
