I can't continue aloneFirst off. Throwaway. But I'll check back. 

It's been a month since I snapped and moved out on my girlfriend. We were having a rough patch. I took our dog. One of our 4 cats. And left. It took me less than a day to realize my mistake. But by that time she had ran to her moms. With the other cats. We started to work it out a couple days later and I thought everything was in the clear.

A few days after that she said she wouldn't be able to get over the pain I caused her. And I've been basically alone since. I moved back to my parents. But I have no friends here. Just my dog and cat. I've seen her a few times since. And she usually replies to my messages. I still love her so much. And she has told me recently that she still loves me.

Today I got some flowers and dropped them off to her. Had a brief chat. And left. All she really said to me is that I just don't get it.

I can't continue on without her. She changed me so much as a person. I went from a boarder line alcoholic/drug addict womanizer to a guy with a woman he adored and wanted to spend the rest of his life with. Except for that day. When we fought. I lost my cool and when she went to work I left. My life has been hell since. I'm so alone. I think of her constantly. I dream about her. I wish for a perfect life with her. 

I've thought about how to end this.  There's a really strong current off a fairly accessible cliff near by. A couple people have disappeared in that area before. I think that's how I want to handle it. Not tonight. Maybe not tomorrow night. But it's there. A life without her isn't worth it.
