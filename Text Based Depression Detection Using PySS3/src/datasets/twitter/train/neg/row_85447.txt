I did it againIn May, almost June actually, I overdosed on prozac because I tried to die. I got better, I was only in the hospital for one day and I got better. But there's something wrong with me. I did it again. The only pills I had in my reach were paracetamol pills and now I took 25 pills and I might die. Of course, that was what I was trying to do but the only thing I can think about right now is my family. I'm a minor, and in my country my parents could go to jail for having a child who attempted suicide a second time. I don't want to do that to them. What is wrong with me. I'm so terrible I need help. What is wrong with me.
