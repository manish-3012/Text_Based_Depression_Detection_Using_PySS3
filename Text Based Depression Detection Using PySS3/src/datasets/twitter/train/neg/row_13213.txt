I'm finally ready to die.I've written my notes to those close to me, I have everything. I've finally accepted the fact that my life was always supposed to end like this, since the day I was born it was set and stone that I was to take my own life. Fall Break starts on Thursday and I'm ready for it. Finally. Wish me luck, I'll at last get to know what happens after you die. I'll be free from all the pain and suffering. Free. I'm finally ready to die.
