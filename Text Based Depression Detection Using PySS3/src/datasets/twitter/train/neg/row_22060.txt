I just can't fucking do it.I can't do it anymore. My university is going to dismiss me after this semester because I had two terrible semesters in a row. I can't even explain how, I just can't find joy in anything I do and I feel so stupid and worthless and I can't do anything right. I have failed myself and my family. I will have to start paying off student loans this summer through a minimum wage job that I can barely pay my rent with. I have no friends in the city I live in. I can't write anymore, I can't find happiness or any kind of joy in the things I use to. 

I am so tired of feeling worthless every day I wake up. I am tired of year after year having to tell my family what a complete waste of space I am and that I need to try different medications *again* and find a psychologist that I can magically pay for *again* and that I need to borrow money from them to pay my rent *again*. 

It's just the same fucking cycle over and over. They don't deserve me. I have put them through so much already. I hate seeing their faces when they think I've been doing well for so long and then I tell them what's really going on. That I've never been well in the first place. They deserve a daughter that can make them proud and take can be an adult, not me who just constantly fucks up always sick, a loser.

 I don't see the point in living if through the majority of my life all I've felt is pain, rejection, worthlessness, and losing people close to me. Who would want to endure that till they're 80? I can't fucking do it anymore.
