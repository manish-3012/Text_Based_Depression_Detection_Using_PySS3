OverpassI donâ€™t really think thereâ€™s anything enticing about unwarranted consumption anymore. I used to want to do things &amp; be someone else or the same person doing something new every day but now I just see everything as transactions of consumption &amp; fulfillment of desire. I think Iâ€™d like to jump off this overpass near my apartment soon. I have to work at 8 am tomorrow so I think Iâ€™ll fulfill that obligation but Iâ€™m just tired.
