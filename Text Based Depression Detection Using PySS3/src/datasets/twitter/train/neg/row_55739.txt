I can see into the future.I can see it clearly in my eyes. Curtains up. Set the scene.
Some time in The future.
I sit alone on a hideous couch. Only the light of the Screen illuminating the darkness. Unshaved for weeks.. Reeking of booze and despair. In a run down apartment. In a rundown part of the city. Staring at the screen with glazed over and dead eyes. Next to me a bottle of bottom shelf piss. A microwaved meal. A rattling fan. On the floor a strange growing mountain of empty bottles, empty boxes of wine, trash and other random things I just couldn't be bothered to pick up. On the shelves dead plants cause they haven't seen daylight in weeks. Eventually Ill pass out again like thousands of times before. This time my heart will stop beating. My remains will be recovered months later because neighbours complained about the smell. They'll throw my rotten carcass into a hole in the ground. Take my earthly belongings to the dump. And with the last pile of Earth thrown on my grave this Rotten story of my life will come to a fitting conclusion. Curtains down. Only there will be no applause.
