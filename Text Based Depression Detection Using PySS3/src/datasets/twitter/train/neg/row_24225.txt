Sometimes I feel like a secondary character in the story of my own life.More often than not I feel like I'm just watching my life go by. Its sort if like I'm not in control but at the same time I feel as though I am and my actions are all futile and attribute nothing to a greater story. I feel like I am punished for achieving or being happy by the world, and no matter what the negative environment I'm in crushes me into a fucking lump. No matter what I do I feel like I'm just a useless secondary character in some story. Its fucking sickening, and no matter what life choices I make I am punished and put down.
