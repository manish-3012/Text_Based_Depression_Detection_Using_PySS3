I'm TiredI'm doing my best but nothing seems to be going right these days. I just replaced my phone screen last months and got a case for it and everything but it broke again this week, I've been actively trying to exterminate the ants in the house but just this sunday ants got in my PC and messed it up while I was at work. I've spent most of my savings trying to fix it but it's just not working the same, and now I'm having a harder time working on documents for work. The worst part is that I can get the money to completely replace my stuff if only my aunt would pay me back but they're in a rough spot too. 

Sorry if my problems seem shallow compared to you people but I'm just tired and frustrated. I feel like every new problem is slowly eroding my will to live and like there's a voice inside me telling me just to walk straight into the ocean and this is the most tempted I've ever been.
