I lost everything and drove everyone awayMy dad was brutally murdered when i was 12. My boyfriend raped me when I was 13, my mother kicked me out of our home when I was 15.

The pain is indescribable. It is very much something you can't appreciate unless you've experienced it. The betrayal. The anger at the world. The broken feeling. The emptiness

Time heals only so much. The rest you're on your own. I have nothing left. I may as well be dead, I am dead inside.

I have borderline personality disorder. I drove everyone of my online friends away. I no longer have anyone irl. I ache with the need to tear my world down and burn every last good thing to the fucking ground. I'm destined to a life of being the emotional equivalent to burn victim.

Life is pain. It's like your heart is an open wound being awashed with salt. I'll never have my father back, my mother is halfway there sometime, she never wants me back. I'm too damaged through drugs and self harm to appeal to anyone. 

My psychiatrist refused to help me find therapy. I'm supposed to humiliate myself by calling an ambulance should I get this bad again. 

No advice is going to work. I'm 19 stuck with a severe mental illness. I feel tortured by my experiences and by the suffocating loneliness. 

There's no hope for anything different. Time doesn't heal everything. I'm ready to give up.
