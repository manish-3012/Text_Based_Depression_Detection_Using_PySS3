im sorry I couldnâ€™t get help, I really screwed upmy parents are getting divorced, after 20 years, my mom said she couldnt handle it anymore, so she kicked my dad out the house

my dad brings home the most of the money we use to pay for groceries, taxes, and necessities

i dont even know who, or where im supposed to live with

my mom makes a little under 30 an hour, while my dad make way more, so thats a reason we can afford to live our life/lifestyle 

im much closer to my mom, and if i chose to live with her, i dont know how im going to survive 

thinking about everything, i still dont regret telling her that she was a selfish asshole, and my reasons for saying that were: i donâ€™t know what I would eat, I donâ€™t know where we would live, and i sure as hell dont know how i would be able to afford college 

after telling her all that, she told me to shut the fuck up, so i ran down to the basement and im hiding in the guest bedroom on my laptop listening to beautiful by eminem (good song)

like he says in the song:

â€œNobody asked for life to deal us

With these bullshit hands we're dealt

We gotta take these cards ourselves

Flip them, don't expect no helpâ€

I dont think I can do it, school is a shit hole, most of my friends have left me, Iâ€™ve been tired of everyones shit, so initially im very depressed, and this divorce isnâ€™t helping me at all

i really wanted to have a good life

but ive already guaranteed myself I cant, though it might not be true, im just blocking out every idea that doesnâ€™t support my sick guarantee 

anyway 

theres nothing stopping me from killing myself, (im really sorry, I know ive got to be more positive, and get some help, but I really dont want any), the divorce was really the breaking point, so i just wanted to tell someone how I felt, because I have no one else in the world, but a few random people on the internet 

im a stupid, overweight asshole, that didnt do shit to help this world

i have two siblings, two asshole parents, and me, myself, a wasteful douche bag

I know this isnâ€™t what this subreddit is about, but goodbye
