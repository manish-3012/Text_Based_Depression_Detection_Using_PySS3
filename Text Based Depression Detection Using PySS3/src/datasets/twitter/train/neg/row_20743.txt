Lately feeling downLately my depression has flared up, as i began understanding there's nothing much for me in this life. I'm male 25 years old, without job, never been in any relationship, heck never been in any intimicy. When i look around people at my age and even younger are succesful at lifes. Often i just think, maybe it would be better if i would just end my life, hoping my next would work out better.
