Just need to get this out thereI used to think I was suicidal. When something â€œbadâ€ happened, I would think â€œman I wish I were deadâ€. But really I knew that I had so much more to live for. 
Now, I feel like I really donâ€™t have anything to live for. It started about a year ago when I was having sex with a girl. To make a long story short, she landed on my dick wrong and it hasnâ€™t worked the same since. No more random erections and I need constant stimulation to maintain 70% of the erection that I used to have. It goes away if I stand up or if stimulation stops for 30 seconds. Sometimes it doesnâ€™t work at all. Yes, Iâ€™ve gone to the doctor and they couldnâ€™t find anything physically wrong with me. They told me itâ€™s anxiety related, however I donâ€™t understand how itâ€™s anxiety related when I canâ€™t even get a full boner while masturbating. Anyway, I graduated college a month after this happened. I moved back home with my parents and got a job in my hometown. Thought it would be good for my mental health to move home. Iâ€™ve gotten into 3 big fights with my dad since moving back, and after the most recent one last Thursday he told me to move out and that he canâ€™t stand to be around me anymore. So I plan on leaving ASAP. On top of this other shit, Iâ€™ve been talking to a girl and I actually like her. One of my best friends knows that I like her. I brought her around my friends last night and he constantly hit on her and flirted with her. Iâ€™m the butt of all the jokes in my friend group. They have no respect for me. The one thing I had going for, a girl liking me, and my friend tries to ruin it. I was out with them tonight but left because they were all too mean to me. Making fun of me at every opportunity. So basically, canâ€™t have enjoyable sex, recently (pretty much) cut ties with my parents, and my friends donâ€™t respect me/try to ruin anything good I have going for myself. On top of that I hate my job and have been looking for a new one. Iâ€™m honestly looking at things logically here. I want this to end, I know thereâ€™s a chance that things turn around for me a bit but things are going wrong in so many dimensions right now that the odds are very much against me. Iâ€™m currently staring down a lethal dose and the thought of dealing with none of this in just an hour seems very nice.
