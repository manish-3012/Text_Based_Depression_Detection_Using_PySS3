I thought the antidepressants would helpI started taking them about a month and a half ago. They seemed to be working really well but now it's really really bad. I'm in a dark place. I don't want to be here but I don't see a way out. I just want this pain to end. I know what I need to do to make it go away. I don't want to feel anything anymore.
