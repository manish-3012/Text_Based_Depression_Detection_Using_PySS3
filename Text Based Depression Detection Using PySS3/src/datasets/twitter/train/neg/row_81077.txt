Lost.So, Ive been suffering from depression and suicidal thoughts for a while now. But i'll cut to the chase.

I got my BA in theater, because thats what i want to do. I dont want to be famous, i dont want an oscar, i just want to be able to live by working in theater. Which, as many of you can guess  is fucking. retarded.( i even studied multiple aspects of theater so i could still work while not being an actor, because being an actor i know is fucking tough)

Im multiple of thousands of dollars in debt. I cant move out of Akron because of it, or fear that when I do leave akron ill be just as miserable and no friends and ill jump in front of a bus.

I dont want to live anymore. I have no money. There is no way that ill be happy in life anyway, so why dont i just fucking end it now?

***Edit***
So, I got a call from the Walnut Theater, saying that i get to audition...so thats a plus..

Mines--Xbox360 just RROD. Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu

I also appreciate everyones help, ive been trying to just get by, and just pickign myself up again and again is getting tiring and some days i just dont want to do it anymore..
