I just don't know what to do.Here I am again up late, contemplating my own life.  I am so miserable.  All i feel is sadness.  Im going to fail a class again.  I feel like shit.  I retook it for a reason.  Im so goddamn embarrassed when my grandma called to see how college was going I just hung up and cried.  The stress of always being a failure eats away at me every second I am awake.  Every time i take my meds i can barely control myself from swallowing the whole contents of the bottle and just ending my suffering.  I feel so embarrassed that i am asking random strangers for help and not family and friends.  If my parents found out I was like this I would never hear the end of it and I would break my moms heart which would bring me to a new low in mylife.  I hate to see her cry and i hate that i am not making her proud in school like i should be.  I just want it all to be over with.  I just cant take it anymore.  I havent had anyone close to me in over a year.  I dont remember what its like to be intimate with someone to really feel what its like to be alive. And the last person i was intimate with tore my heart out and left me to rot.  Did anyone help me when it happened? no of course not.  No one cared. I just feel empty and useless to those around me.  I havent had a good nights sleep in years.  I just cant sleep.  I lay awake in my bed thinking about ending it all.
