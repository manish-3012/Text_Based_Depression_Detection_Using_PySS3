I molested my friend, broke his trust, destroyed friendships, proved myself to be the biggest hypocrite and I cant live with itI am a fucking hypocrite, abuser and a coward. I got drunk and molested my friend who has already been through a lot. I am unable to live with myself. I feel like shit. I think everyone would be better off with me dead. I should have thrown myself of a building by now. If I had a gun I would have shot myself instead of posting here.
