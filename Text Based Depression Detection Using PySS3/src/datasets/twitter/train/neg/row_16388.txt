I really wish I didn't have to deal with the thought of people blaming themselves.I can't tell how many times the thought has crossed my mind that if I were to go through with it, it would be terrible for the people around me to blame themselves. I really don't wish this upon anyone, I could never handle that much guilt. But goddamnit I would be lying if I said it doesn't get harder to not be selfish like that every day. Who knows, maybe they won't care.
