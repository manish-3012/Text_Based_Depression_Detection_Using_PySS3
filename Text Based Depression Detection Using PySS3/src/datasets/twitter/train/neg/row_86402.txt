Any tipsSo I'm 14, and I've been depressed for as long as I remember, it's gotten to the point where I want to die every time I feel an emotion because of how exhausting it is.  I won't be killing myself soon but In a month or two, Second time trying in 5 years, first time I was too scared to die, but it's funny how fear fades after a while.  I want people to forget about me, is there anyway I can do that best.  If you do want to keep giving me "reasons to live" it won't work, I'm failing in school, I only have a couple of friends, I have a dead beat job at a pizza place, and no love interests.  So please don't waste your energy, I'm a lost cause.
