No oneEverything about me is wrong. I do not deserve to be here. Maybe that's why I keep feeling so out of place, like I'm slipping through the cracks of reality? Maybe I'm not supposed to be here. Reality is just realigning itself to push me out of it and show me that I need to go.

I have no one. No one knows me. No one who has known me has wanted to keep me. I am alone and I do not belong in any spaces. Not even the ones I technically fit into. They're reserved for better people. Love is conditional if it ever existed to begin with, and attachments are a folly. Everything will ultimately be taken away, because I do not deserve it, and I'm not meant to be here.

I want go home, but home is nowhere. There is no place for me in this life. If I kill myself, it will be a brief pain, and the world will go back to normal, continuing on like it should. Just one less surplus cog in the machinery, as insignificant as a grain of sand. The air around us is already polluted. One less greedy pair of lungs to steal what's left of it would be a blessing upon this earth. I am worthless, and I am rambling. I stop, now.
