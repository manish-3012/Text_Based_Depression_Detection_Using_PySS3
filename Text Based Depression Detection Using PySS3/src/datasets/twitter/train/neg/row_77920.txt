I ruined my lifeIn January I was sexually assaulted by my boyfriends roommate. My boyfriend and I had been dating almost four years at the time and I loved him more than anything. I spiraled after it happened. I broke up with him, tried to find solace in someone else, pushed everyone I cared about away and created some fake version of myself I thought would keep my emotions at bay. Here we are now, in September and everything comes rushing in. I want him back but I ruined everything, and every relationship I have. I have no one to blame but myself for being alone in this. Iâ€™m so tired of feeling like this. Itâ€™s been three years since I was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder and Iâ€™ve never felt like Iâ€™ve gotten control of my life, my moods, my decisions. I canâ€™t be mad at people for not wanting to be around me but it feels too lonely now. I have no one left to turn to or to talk to. Two weeks ago I made an attempt and got scared then got help, the next day I felt weak. I donâ€™t know how to get out of this dark place.
