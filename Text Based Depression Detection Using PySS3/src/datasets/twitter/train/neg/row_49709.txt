i posted this in another community but im still not okay soi dont know if this needs a trigger warning, i just need to vent.

hi. so if you look in my post history you will see about my pregnancy scare and then i posted everything worked out bc i thought it was my period and all that but it was a miscarriage. i wasnt expecting a kid and i didnt want one but i still feel like a piece of me is missing now and all of my trauma that ive worked so hard to get past is back in my head in reoccurring thoughts and nightmares i have no interests anymore i hate all the tv shows i used to love , the only thing i want to do is sleep but when i sleep i have awful nightmares. i dyed my hair and cut my bangs the whole breakdown thing but i dont feel any better ive never felt this awful before. im not gonna kill myself or anything like that, i just cant shake this feeling i wake up every single day and just feel so empty like there is no reason to even be awake i try to hangout with my boyfriend i but i cant even stand being cuddled or kissed and i just cant stop crying all the time for no reason and i try to hangout with my friends and family but i just zone out the whole time. (sorry for my run on sentences and probably grammar issues)

*in the original post i said i wasnt gonna kill myself or anything like that but it still doesnt mean i dont want too*
