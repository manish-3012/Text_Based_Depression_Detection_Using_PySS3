I'm afraid I might end up killing myselfOkay, so I'm not really new to reddit but this is my first time talking about this on this site. Just needed to get this off my chest.

I'm just a couple months away from graduating college, but I'm under a lot of pressure right now and my anxiety is out of control. I'm having suicidal thoughts and I'm really scared. The same thing happened when I was about to graduate high school. First came the anxiety, then there was a suicide attempt, and then the worst depressive episode I have ever experienced in my life. I don't want to kill myself as of right now, but the idea seems less and less irrational as time goes by. I feel like I could just lose it at some point and just do it without really thinking that much.
