preparing myself mentally and physicallyI don't know why i feel like this. i feel absolutely terrible right now and recently i started to have random light headaches aswell...
i just want peace. i want this feeling to stop thats all i want but it never goes away. once a while i get this terrible feeling inside me that i dont know hot to explain. maybe its because im not social? because im home 24/7? i dont know what else i can do. i dont enjoy anything anymore. i know i need help but i cant get any help.

&amp;nbsp;
I have started to accept that death may seems to be the only way out for me. i am prepared to die. mentally and physically.

&amp;nbsp;
i ate my last meal yesterday and right now i am going to drink just water to flush out my organs. after a week of drinking just water i am going to overdose myself with my epileptic pills (Depakine ethic &amp; carbamazepine) in the hope that it may kill me. i used to take them a long time ago but i stopped because...I don't remember... i just didn't wanted to take them anymore. i got a bunch of these left. 

&amp;nbsp;
i made this topic so i can write my last words. as soon as i decided that its time for me to go. i will write it up here, swallow my pills and enter my bed. in case i change my mind for whatever reason i wil try to write it down also.

Thank you for reading
