Iâ€™m tired of being aliveI have several mental illnesses, chronic pain, no job, no friends, no reason to want to live. I know how Iâ€™d kill myself and could easily find a time when it would take a while for someone to find me. The only thing that has been stopping me is my family. I know they would be devastated and my dog would always wonder when Iâ€™d be coming back. Now though Iâ€™m not sure if thatâ€™s enough to stop me. Iâ€™m just exhausted and suffering. I donâ€™t feel comfortable talking to my parents about this but I donâ€™t have anybody else I can talk to.
