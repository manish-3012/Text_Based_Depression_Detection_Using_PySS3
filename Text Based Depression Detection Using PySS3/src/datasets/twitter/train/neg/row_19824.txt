I am fucking pissed right nowForgive me for swearing but obviously Iâ€™m a suicidal. But I went and talked to my school counselor and social worker. To get help. They believed me and helped a bit.
Talked to my dad who took me down to the hospital to get checked out.

And at the end of the visit they decided I wasnâ€™t that big of a threat to myself and basically told me to go home. I told them I wanted to KILL MYSELF and that I had a plan and location to do it. Several in fact in case I need backups.

I know with COVID and everything itâ€™s hectic and all at hospitals. But I mean there are mental only places. 
I donâ€™t wanna be here anymore and Iâ€™m sick and tired of being in pain and fear. I went and got help like Iâ€™m â€œsupposedâ€ to. Instead of just actually going for it. And they turned me away. Deeming me not suicidal enough for hospitalization???

APPARENTLY because I donâ€™t cut myself  Iâ€™m not that bad. Like excuse you, Iâ€™m already in fucking pain all the time from ptsd and all the other shit.
Like scratching my arms until they BLEED and banging my head against the brick wall and attacking myself isnâ€™t more painful than a few cuts on my arms.
Excuse me for liking a specific pain over others

Like bitch what!?? Iâ€™m just so frustrated right now and need to vent. I went against all my gut instincts and actually told adults and went to a hospital. Only for them to tell me that Iâ€™m not even important enough as a suicidal for help
Like oh my fucking god. 

And now my family knows and are watching me like fucking hawks. I canâ€™t even go to the bathroom without one of them demanding I open the door.

Big let down to ask for help because I want help and then get fucking turned down!!!
