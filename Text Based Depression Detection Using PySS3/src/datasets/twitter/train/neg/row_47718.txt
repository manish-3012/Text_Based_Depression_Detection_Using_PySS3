There's so little keeping me alive, I'm afraid it soon won't be enoughI was never suicidal until a few months ago. Then, a lot of things happened and I basically lost everything and nearly everyone I had. I've been having thoughts about dying and killing myself frequently, but I wouldn't do it right now. I have a family who cares about me and I don't want to do it to them.

But then again... I have no one to talk to. No one listens to me. I can't communicate the immense pain I feel to anyone. I'm stuck in this paralyzed, desperate state for so long. I want to feel relieved. I want to be happy again. And at this point, I don't see happiness ever coming back to me. I feel like I will be this blob forever. And I don't want to.

Maybe if I ended it, I would go someplace happy. Or not, but at least the pain would be over. I don't know how to feel or what to do... If anyone has any kind words to spare, please, share them. I really need it.
