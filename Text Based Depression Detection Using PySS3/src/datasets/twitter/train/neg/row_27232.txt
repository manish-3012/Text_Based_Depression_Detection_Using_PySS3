anxietyat night things become dark (not just literally) i'm in drug recovery and been clean for a while...now i'm getting worse depression and i fear having a complete meltdown. i'm going to be graduating college in May..

i'm cutting myself almost everyday now..i don't want to stop  

i'm scared and mostly want to die..
passively suicidal..

i have so many good things in my life and i still can't cope.
why?

i also need methadone.
i'm tired, i'm tired.
i should stop trying...probably feel better to give in.
what's the point?!?
