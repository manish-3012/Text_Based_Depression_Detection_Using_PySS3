I don't know what else to doI don't want to reveal much online, because people frequent Reddit and might know me.  I've been on and off of antidepressants for the last couple of months, just being messed around constantly.  Every day I get frustrated at myself over my situation, the way I am and how I can't tell anyone.  Honestly, i'm sick and tired of everyone telling me it will get better, whether it will or not.  The point is, I don't know anything any more, and I can't tell my family because I'm scared of how they would react.  I already know that they don't like people like me so I need to keep my life under wraps.  They're all the most loving, caring people, and every day I feel so incredibly guilty that someone like me has this kind of family when other, more deserving people don't, and so scared that I will lose everything I've ever known.  And, every single day I think about how good it would be to just let go of everything.  I already take things sometimes that I shouldn't take in order to forget about life for a few hours - I might zonk out on painkillers for a while, or take a packet of nytol to escape reality.  I'm not an addict - I could go without them, but I choose to take them every now and again because I can't deal with the way things are.  Cowardly, I know, but that's me in a nutshell.  I so desperately want to get better but deep down I know it won't happen so I don't know what options I have left.
