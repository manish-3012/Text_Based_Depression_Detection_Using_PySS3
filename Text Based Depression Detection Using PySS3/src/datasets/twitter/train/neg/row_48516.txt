I feel terrible.I feel terrible.

The holidays are here. I hate the holidays. My grandma passed away on Christmas Day 2018, and I havenâ€™t been the same since. From the day forward, my entire life has spiraled out of control. I went from being hardworking and ambitious to barely being able to hold down a job, &amp; having suicidal thoughts and anxiety to the point where I now see a psychiatrist who recently strongly recommended I be put into therapy. Well a friend I made at the job I was at when my grandma died, is dead too. I found out tonight and he has been dead for weeks. I feel terrible because we stopped talking. I felt like I was being used and that my boundaries werenâ€™t being respected. But to hear tonight that he passed away is making me backtrack. Why am I such a terrible person? Why did we have to stop talking? Why do I just ghost people when I feel like Iâ€™m being disrespected, even after Iâ€™ve communicated my feelings? Why am I like this? Why??!!
