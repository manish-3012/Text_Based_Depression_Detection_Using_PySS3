Just finished writing a noteLike the title says, I just finished writing my note. Tonight is the night I'll kill myself; I've been planning it for a couple weeks. It's remarkable how little I have to say that's worth writing, in my note or here. I hate everything that I say, every justification for ending it, but I hate myself more. I know I'm a bad enough person that this is the right thing to do. As I send this, I'm walking to a bridge near my house. Not sure if anyone will read this, but if so, I love you and have a good night.
