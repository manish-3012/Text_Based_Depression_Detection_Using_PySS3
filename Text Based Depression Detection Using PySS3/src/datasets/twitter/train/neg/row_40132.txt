I think I'm Finally Ready to Kill MyselfI'm a person with zero redeemable qualities and pretty much everything about me reeks of awfulness. I have lived a life of immense privilege with wonderful parents, reasonable enough natural capabilities (normal intelligence and no deformities or diseases), and largely devoid of persecution or bullying of any kind. I've had the ability to have $100/week therapy sessions for two years now and am at one of the best universities in the country and certainly the best one I'd have any hope of affording. Yet, all I've done is waste whatever is given to me and stomp it on the ground like a horrible disgusting child. I am taking the minimum number of units I need to be a full time student and taking almost all super easy breadth introductory courses, yet still doing mediocre to failing in every single one of them. I've taken all I've been given and decided to be a lazy worthless piece of shit who does nothing at all with it. I don't give back to the world in any way other than taking in massive amount of privileged resources and spitting back out utterly worthless shit. After I donate whatever money I have left in my bank account to a good cause I'm pretty sure I'm going to off myself for good for the good of humanity since I know deep down I'll always be a leeching selfish piece of shit who hurts this world horribly just by existing and drawing away resources from the more deserving. I'm going to sleep on it for a few days and make sure I'm making the right choice but I'm almost certain that I belong dead and forgotten.
