From death with loveSuicide is the third largest cause of death in young people in USA and I think this will be the biggest cause of death in coming days if we don't have a nuke war. 

I spend time around and I see you people helping others by picking up a point to somehow trigger the momentarily love of life. This is actually insane because the person may stop for now and will do it later on. Life was shit, life is shiter and it will be the shitiest soon as the world is becoming a damn better place. Too many people in the world. Remember the dialogue of transformers movie "We don't need you now because we can make you now". This is a fact. 

I am close to reaching the boundary line of neglecting the situation of the world without me. The World is nothing just a bunch of lies. You were told made up lies and you are being told made up lies. 

I had really beautiful ideas of life and career after graduating and once I was graduate I saw that the world is really ugly. There is no point of doing good or bad at all. It is based on lies. If someone wants to go to permanent sleep then what's wrong with it? Eventually, the person is going to die sooner or later. Life is NOT beautiful. 

I wish that my mom and dad get an STD for not fucking without condom. Parents should never be respected because they are the actual cause of the whole trouble.

I have a question though. Will I die if I sleep 20 hours day, or may be I can get a serious disease from it?
