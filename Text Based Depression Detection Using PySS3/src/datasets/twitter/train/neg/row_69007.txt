Hate Livingi personally hate living.
i don't know about other people, but i do.
i don't see the point in living. yeah i may have one or two good moments, but the rest is just pure shit.
i feel like my family hates me. i'm fat. ugly. non-useful. untalented. i can't even get a decent grade in english and it's my main language.
i act strong but deep down, i'm just a girl who wants to be held, and be told "its going to be ok". just a little love without being made fun of. i'm extremely exhausted of living. i honestly think happiness hates me. 
**i don't even know where i'm going with this post.** i just need to vent a little. 
ok, i'll tell you about me? i guess?
i'm 15. a fuck up.
no good for nothing. i'm failing every class except vocal because she passes everyone. 
i can't do anything right.
i cut myself.
i haven't done it in 3 days.
i've tried committing suicide 5 times. all fails.
how? **drowning myself in the tub**
i seriously can't look in the mirror without wanting to hang myself.
i'm just too scared to kill myself.
