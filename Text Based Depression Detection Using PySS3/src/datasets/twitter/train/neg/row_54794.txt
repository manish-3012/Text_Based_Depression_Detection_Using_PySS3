SelfishI feel so selfish. I'm self-centered as hell, every single conversation becomes about me. People mention that I make things about myself and I can't help but feel bad. I've been struggling with depression for a long time, and sometimes when I screw up badly with being so self-centered and selfish, I just want to end the misery other people seem to endure being subjected to my presence in their life. I don't feel like anyone really loves me, they're pretending to give a damn in some vague feeling of responsibility. I hate the feeling that my life is completely set in front of me. Someone close to a dear friend of mine died of brain cancer - I mentioned, like an idiot, that I was glad that I myself had recently been told that I didn't have a tumour in my head, after a few days of waiting anxiously. They told me to fuck off, and that I was disgusting for making it all about me. I can't say anything in response to that - they're right, it was disgusting and celf-centered and a stupid thing to ever even try to bring up. In the end, it brought back feelings of wanting to end it all. Maybe then they'd be rid of the selfish jerk they're constantly forced to be around. I feel hopeless. I feel like I've ruined another friendship. I feel like my life is a mistake.
