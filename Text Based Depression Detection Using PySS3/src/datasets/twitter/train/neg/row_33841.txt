Terrified.I don't know where to turn. It's getting bad. I can stand who i am. Im misreable. I've been so sad for so long and its not getting better. I don't want to have to deal with it anymore. I sound crazy i know but i cant help feeling this way. I know somethings wrong with me but im not sure what. Im terrified.
