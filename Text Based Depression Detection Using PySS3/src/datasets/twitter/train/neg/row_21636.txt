The word â€œgratitudeâ€ is pinning me further and further into this deep hole that I wonâ€™t ever be able to climb out of.I rather just end it here.
The more I hear and see that word, the Iâ€™m getting one step closer to ending my life. 

I know Iâ€™m not crazy but damn I wish I were so I could just do it and it be ok.
