Another year olderWell, it's official, I'm now another year older. I've never really cared about birthdays before, other than being a child, because I never really felt special at all during my life. It's always been just another day. But there was always someone to fuss over me, whether it be my mom, or a girlfriend, or whatever. This year, I'm alone. I'm scared. I'm honestly terrified to be alone with myself. I've suffered with anxiety for years, but depression is something new for me. I've moved cross country and I've made a grand total of zero friends since I've arrived. I'm right now sitting in my quiet lonely apartment shaking and crying, with this burning pain of agony in my heart. How do people love or function like this? 

I'm just looking for maybe some advice or kind words to help me get through today. To help me get through the next hour if need be. Thank you.
