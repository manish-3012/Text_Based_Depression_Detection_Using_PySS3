I feel like I have no oneIâ€™m not sure what to do &amp; I have really no one to talk about this.. Iâ€™ve been struggling with my eating disorder more than ever lately and itâ€™s really starting to take a dull on me.. Not only that - Iâ€™ve been clean from cutting for over a year now and the urges are there again.. I hate it, so much. 

All of this is so hard to deal with, especially on your own. I have no supportive environment around me and never really did. I donâ€™t know what to do, who to reach out to. I feel like everyone has enough of their own problems and I donâ€™t want to annoy them with mine. I donâ€™t know. I feel so fucking lost and empty.

Honestly.. Iâ€™m just extremely tired and done with everything. I wish I didnâ€™t have to live because I hate putting up with this. Living feels more like an annoying chore than anything. Ugh.
