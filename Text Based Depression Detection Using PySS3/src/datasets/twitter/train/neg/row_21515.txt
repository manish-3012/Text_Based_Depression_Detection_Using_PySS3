Maybe life is all a big game and who ever suicides win and get a amazing afterlifeMaybe someone created this game of life to see who would be smart enough to suicide and save themselves unnecessary pain. So only those who suicided get an amazing afterlife as their reward to not tolerate this bullshit life on earth.

I was thinking about this, life is so ducking unpredictable and I wonder why weâ€™re here. It almost feels like someone is calling me back to kill myself, like I should because it would be better for me. Because the afterlife is probably way better and is waiting for me once i suicide.
