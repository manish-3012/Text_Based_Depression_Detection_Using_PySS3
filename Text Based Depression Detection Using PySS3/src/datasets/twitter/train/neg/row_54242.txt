It's so hard to not give up. The thought of giving up, but not, means I just keep wasting away and digging myself even deeper, never getting anything done.So you know how imposter syndrome people think that they're huge frauds who haven't ever actually done anything well?  
  
  I *actually* haven't accomplished anything ever and have made it through life with bluffing and luck. I have no idea how to stop being a useless piece of shit and every passing day of extreme procrastination and excuses, the anxiety piles up exponentially. Not only have I dug a nice, deep, depression hole, once I get out of the hole I'm faced with K2 that I swear, once upon a time, was just a speed bump.  

   I don't deserve anything I have and am having a lot of trouble feeling like it's possible to crawl out of this hole. Life is hard. Death is easy. Guilt for keeping the people/animals around me happy/functioning holds me to the struggle, but every fiber of my being wants to give up on everything. Everything.

I nearly made this post on a tightknit forum community, but really, I haven't told anyone in my life how bad it is. How much of a fraud I am. How much I want to die every second so I don't have to live with the guilt any more. I'm so incredibly open about every aspect in my life that people think I have no secrets, but keeping this in has become such a huge one that I am beginning to feel like I live a double life. No one can know how often my wrists itch invisibly, or the real reason I go for smoke breaks.

Thanks for being a place I can let this out for the moment.
