The edge of a pistolHave you ever felt the edge of your own pistol? Usually itâ€™s not supposed to point that way but you want it to. I suppose I should come up with a good place that I feel comfortable with to do it. Honestly with time Iâ€™m getting more comfortable with putting my gun to my head right on my right temple. I guess there other ways of doing this but this pretty effective and I wonâ€™t feel a thing. Iâ€™m not sure when I should do this but I might know where. Idk weâ€™ll see.
