I dont see any point.I feel like a criminal. I have committed the heinous crime of verbally abusing an ex. I had stayed in it longer than I should have. Lashed out verbally when she left me. Stalked her online. 

I sent apologies months later, but that had some things which shouldn't have been said, like 'I wanted you', etc. It pulled her back, and I had to push her back again.

Its been 10 months since we broke up. This is getting out of hand. Nothing means anything in my life anymore except this time period. I am still conflicted about her, maybe she was the best I'll ever have, but hey, I have been No contact for a few months and I won't change that in a lifetime.

I can't fix myself. There is simply no point. I can't change the past. This has forever tainted my life and I don't know. No point.
