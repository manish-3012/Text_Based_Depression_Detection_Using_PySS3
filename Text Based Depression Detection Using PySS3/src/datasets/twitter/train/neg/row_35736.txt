Sorry dadI was ok I was  fucking ok then I had to go take a nose dive into an empty pit of disappointment and fucking sadness then I stopped caring about the fucking world and the wounds on my wrist are deeper than theyâ€™ve ever been. My dad was the only one no matter what the fuck I did he didnâ€™t care and he loved me and he never cursed and never yelled but than after 2 weeks and 2 inches of guinea pig poop piled up bleh ok but I didnâ€™t have the will to clean he yelled and cursed like never b4 and I lost all hope he was the one thing I hung on to the one tiny little sliver of hope I had left in my life and today I think is the end I canâ€™t fucking do it I want to live I want to grow up and have a family but at the same time life isnâ€™t ducking easy and I just can tonight might be the last time I fucking breath. And u no what I DONT FUCKING GIVE A SHIT!! Also Iâ€™m only 14. But I prob wonâ€™t have the guts to kill myself so update tmrw i guess. Or not Who the guck noes
