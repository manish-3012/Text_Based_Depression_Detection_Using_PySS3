Anyone here have BPD?Iâ€™m trapped with this. Iâ€™ve been an outsider my whole life and only connect with people very rarely. Itâ€™s not that I canâ€™t get along with people, I just never feel I fit in (probably because I was isolated and bullied throughout childhood). I can be involved in a group activity but still feel like Iâ€™m on the outside looking in (itâ€™s a cliche for a reason). Iâ€™m so stuck and I am planning on ending it next month now (need money for supplies). 
And Iâ€™ve tried therapy but I canâ€™t live a life where I will be abandoned again, I canâ€™t take the risk. Itâ€™s too painful, words canâ€™t describe. I am living in a world which I canâ€™t cope with. I feel like I am living artificially.
