Being suicidal really impacts my life and I really hate myself for it.I've been depressed for years now since I was a teenager. I've always been the disappointment of the house. Out of the two children in the house my sister set the bar really high for grades so when it came to me even the highest grades had already been done before so I couldn't add anything new. (No hate for my sister, for some reason she still believes in me but I know I just keep disappointing).

I've been imagining a different life where I wasn't such a disappointment since I was 12 and wishing day upon day that it could be true. I keep thinking about ways I could have done things better and spend the majority of my day in regret, panicking, or trying to distract myself from both of those things. Eventually I realised that the only possible way that it could come true would be if I killed myself. Nowadays I spend the majority of my time wishing either that I could be that ideal person or wishing I had the will to end it all so that I wouldn't be such a burden on my family. I've tried 3 times previously but keep finding excuses not to another time because if I tried I know I wouldn't be able to do it and I'll just feel even worse with the outcome. 

The thing is that I've spent so long trying to build up the courage to kill myself that I've ignored real life. It impacts on my ability to plan ahead and organise myself because planning ahead anticipates me being alive then and I don't want to be alive. Does anyone else struggle with this? And if so how do you deal with it? Right now I'm throwing my life away and not doing anything to help the situation because any time I imagine myself being successful it's always the other guy.
