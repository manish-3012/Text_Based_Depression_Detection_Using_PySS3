Come back youtuber9001, I'm still here for you and am going to continue to be.Its not pointless and you weren't wasting my time at all as you say. 

We were just getting started and getting somewhere. I'm *not* going to forget about you. But it is up to you to come back, although I'll be on the lookout.

There's work to be done on the specific things you want to accomplish. It is not necessarily fun and interesting, but it will get you to where you want to go. Give it a chance.
