Told my friends I was suicidal and they told me to get over it.I'm a senior in high school and yesterday I made the decision to drop out and be homeschooled instead of continuing to put myself in an unhealthy environment. When I told my friends about it they all said it was a stupid idea, I was never going to get a job, I'd never get into college, and I would never be happy. Then I said I wanted to stop going to public school because it literally drains my will to live and they told me to get over it because life is hard and everyone else feels the same way, but they keep going. 
That's not true and even if it was, congrats! I'm not other people. I am me and just because someone else can handle the same amount of pressure that does not mean I can. 

Today, my friends are ignoring me, insulting me, and saying I'm stupid for doing this. I have to go tomorrow and Friday and I'm terrified that my friends are going to bully me because that's all they've been doing today. Is there any advice I could be given??
