Iâ€™m 13 and Iâ€™m SuicidalUh hi, Iâ€™m 13 and Iâ€™m suicidal I really at this point just donâ€™t care about life, I mean why care... when I was in 5th grade (so I was like 10?) my cousin commented suicide and then maybe a month or so later my uncle did the same, my mom was really fucked up (sorry for swearing) she um well has a bad drug problem my older sister was basically my mom and my grandma. My dad left when I was 3 and keep coming back just to start shit like he would say how me and my siblings were worthless and didnâ€™t matter. My uncle than died a couple days before my birthday and so my birthday was spent at a funeral...also my siblings and my mom and step dad lived at my grandma and grandpas my â€˜parentsâ€™ would always fight like boom 3 am fighting 2 pm fighting, some times it got physical but I donâ€™t like talking about those in the summer after 5th grade I began to cut it was weird but I liked it, I hated pain but as soon as I had that dull blade itâ€™s like I blacked out and was a different person. That went on for awhile till my sister found out and told my mom finally I stoped for a month or 2 and it went on. After Christmas My great grandma died and she was like a second mom to me like I loved her so much and at her funeral i saw her corpse...it was wierd I kinda expected her just to wake up you know? But she didnâ€™t...umm a couple months ago I moved in with my biological dad because my mom tried to kill herself in front of me she just kept screaming about how she wants to be with her brother (my uncle) it was wierd I guess, my dad is cool I guess but he doesnâ€™t exactly accept me being trans (FTM) I honestly donâ€™t give a shit about living and want to die but I have birds and my sister but honestly my anti depressants are not working and all I can think about is death which is okay I guess. Thanks for reading I suppose.
