I feel like giving upAnother disappointment. Another setback. Another failure. One more drop in my bucket of sorrow. Reddit, my bucket is damn near full. I'm exhausted. I try to be the best at everything I do but I always come up short. A little, a lot, it really doesn't matter. I'm never at the top and that is what does. I'm tired of living this subpar life. What's the point of living if you don't have a reason to? I'm just second rate at everything anyway. No one cares about second place.
