Knowing that Iâ€™ll die I honestly donâ€™t give a fuck about my math grade anymore.I have a D in math. Iâ€™m not doing the homework or anything now because I know Iâ€™m probably going to die soon. My dad keeps telling me to retake this math test but I wonâ€™t. Iâ€™ve always been terrible at math and Iâ€™ve just stopped caring about it. Everyday is the same day over and over. Somebody just kill me already.
