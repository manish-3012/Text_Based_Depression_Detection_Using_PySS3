I dont want to try anymoreI literally have nothing going for me anymore. I fight with my parents constantly, I'm self conscious about my body, I'm afraid of being alone but I hate being around people. I get made fun of everyday. I dont think anyone cares about me. I don't want to keep going, I dont want to try.
