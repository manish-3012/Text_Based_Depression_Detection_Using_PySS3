I am a coward.I have always been afraid of walking in crowded places. Even just making noises in public transport. Afraid of making a scene that would bring everyoneâ€™s attention to me. That feeling that everyone is looking at me. Because Iâ€™m different. Because i dont want to dissapoint everyone. And i dont want them to see that weakness. So everyday i try to be someone im not. But i want someone to feel what Iâ€™m feeling,someone to ask if im doing fine, if im ok. To notice me, to pull me out of this darkness.I Just want them to â€œseeâ€ me. Im tired. Almost at my limit. And today i couldâ€™ve save a kittenâ€™s life but i got too scared. 

I was on my home from work. Riding a bus, as ive always done everyday. It was really dark outside.Looking by the window i saw a little kitten on the middle of the road. There were people walking on the sideways and they cant even see it. That little fluff crawling its way out of deathâ€™s door. I couldâ€™ve stopped and saved her but it wasnt my bus stop. There were a lot o f people on the bus. I feel like theyâ€™re looking at me. I felt like they could read whatâ€™s on my mind I couldnt open my mouth to tell the driver to pull over. My bus stop was near. So i told myself that ill just ran to save her when im at my bus stop. And so i did just that. I waited. I got out of the bus and ran. Ran. Told myself that its just around the corner. 8 minutes had passed so i hoped shes still alive that i wasnt to late. And there i she was. Lifeless. Not even moving. There were people looking at her. Disgusted by the sight. They couldâ€™ve saved her. I couldâ€™ve saved her. But i didnt. It was my fault. I got too scared to move, to speak up. A life was lost because of me.
