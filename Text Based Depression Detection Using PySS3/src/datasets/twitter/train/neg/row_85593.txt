Don't know what to do.Ironically I used to be a counselor.

I'm still recovering from an incredibly emotional break up, she called herself a 'Claire Underwood' type. I thought she was joking at first but no, she filed a restraining order against me just because I asked how she was doing some 6 months after we split. Right before we broke up I had a nasty fall; broke a lot of bones and racked up a heavy debt.

After that I was temporarily crippled, then she left me, then I lost my job because I had to work from home more than they wanted. I was seeing a counselor for depression and as soon as I told her I no longer had insurance she dropped me with a dubious explanation.

My savings ran out sooner than I thought. I might not make rent next month. I need help and don't know who to turn to. I have a lot of great friends and don't want to disappoint them. Yet lying awake at night the only solution in my mind is to jump of a cliff.
