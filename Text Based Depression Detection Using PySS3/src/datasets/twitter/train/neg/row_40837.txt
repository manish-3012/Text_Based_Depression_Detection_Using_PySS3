Hooray! I hate myself and I'd like to die, please.I've been dealing with bipolar disorder for my whole life, only recently diagnosed, as well as eating disorders, for which I've been hospitalized twice. I'm on medication, and it only sort of works. I've been on everything and I'm so tired. Nothing works.

I'm a manipulative piece of shit. I want to be close to everyone, so I lie about my friend loyalties so I don't have to choose sides. I'm in it too deep now to back out, and there's no solution to this aside from losing all of my friends. I'm so fucking lonely that it doesn't really matter, anymore. The only person that I would ever pursue a relationship with is an asshole that would hurt me as I've watched him hurt so many others. But because we're hooking up, I've felt myself start to have feelings I really don't want to have. I know I should stop.                    

I'm a bad person. I'm terrible at school, I'm in fucking community college, and barely scraping by, despite being intelligent. I have no motivation. I'm a slut who would only date people who are into weird kinky shit, and even then I'm an awful partner and too insufficient on my own to ever last in the long haul.

The last time I had posted here months ago on a throwaway, the only real responses I got were telling me that I was a bad person, and the reason I was so alone was because I'm such a slut, so... I don't really know what I'm expecting here.

I just really hate myself and I'm trying to not hurt myself more right now. I've already self harmed tonight, and I've calmed down enough to care for my injuries. I don't see the point in staying alive when I'm so awful. All I do is use and hurt people. I don't deserve to be alive. I just want to sleep forever.
