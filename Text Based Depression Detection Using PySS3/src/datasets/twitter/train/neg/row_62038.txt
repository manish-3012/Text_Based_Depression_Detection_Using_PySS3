I'm so done. I just want to end it all.I feel like my life is falling apart. I feel like I'm going insane. My relationship is falling apart. My boyfriend and I took a break for 3 weeks and then got back together. The relationship was just full of anger and hate because of his over controlling mom who hates me. She is such a psycopath. She's extremely bipolar so one second she can be fine and the next I am scared she is going to hurt me. Since my boyfriend an I got back together on the 18th we have been happy until Sunday. He told me he was going to make time to see me and his mom ruined it by making him work for her. All she does is control his life anymore and keep me from seeing him. We are falling back into hate. I don't know what to do. I just want to end everything. My relationship that I have been building for a year and a half is being torn apart. And we have been best friends for almost 3 years. I just don't even know what to do anymore. I feel like I'm going insane. I want to fix his messed up life and I can't. I feel helpless.
