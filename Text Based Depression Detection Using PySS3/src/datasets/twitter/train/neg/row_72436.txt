7 DaysA last cry of help. 
Last year had a lot of ups and downs for me. The stability I always had was gone and this year has been a emotional roller coaster. 

Everything and beyond has happened. Close friends killed themselves, relatives died, I loosed friendships. In the last 12 months I canâ€™t remember a day I could consider a good day. Iâ€™ve not been able to do things I like without worrying or leaving it for the next day. Sleep has been my only friend. I love sleeping cause itâ€™s the only time I can come to peace with myself. Iâ€™m failing in school I canâ€™t contentrate. Everything is a complete disaster. 

So Iâ€™ve managed to do a list of things I wish I had done the last year. And I have 7 days to complete it. Iâ€™m killing myself in 7 days.
