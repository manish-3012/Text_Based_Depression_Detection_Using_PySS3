Iâ€™m trying so hardYesterday I said I was going to kill myself over a F on my assignment. My boyfriend just ignored me.

Today, he got angry with me for making a joke that Iâ€™d leave him for Ellen page. He said, as revenge, that heâ€™d leAve me for his ex. As a joke. Then he did his usual of going to bed.

Iâ€™m trying so hard to make everybody happy. Iâ€™m trying to get through college, Iâ€™ve had two abortions I didnâ€™t want because I knew nobody else would appreciate me if I didnâ€™t. Everything I do is to make everybody else happy, and Iâ€™m sick of it.

Iâ€™m 24, I live with my parents, Iâ€™m not able to find a job, and as of ten minutes ago Iâ€™m single. Iâ€™ve been in college for the past six years, with no luck on enjoying, let alone passing, a course. Iâ€™ve had two abortions I didnâ€™t want to have because my boyfriend wanted me to. Throughout the first one, he was constantly telling me to leave him alone. I was constantly depressed for three months after, and he would always tell me to leave if I was going to act like that. The second one, he didnâ€™t do that as much, but I wasnâ€™t as depressed. I guess I was just used to it.

I think Iâ€™m ready to leave now. After he said heâ€™d leave me for his ex I just thought... Iâ€™ve never thought to joke about that, Iâ€™ve never thought of leaving him for my ex, how can he sit there and joke like that if it isnâ€™t true? 

So I think Iâ€™m done. Iâ€™m done trying. Iâ€™ve tried for thirteen years to get better and Iâ€™m tired. I canâ€™t handle a job. I canâ€™t handle school. I canâ€™t even handle my boyfriend who Iâ€™ve been with for nearly six years. 

I canâ€™t do it anymore.
