This is itIâ€™ve been thinking about suicide every day since March. Iâ€™ve had ideations before, but this is chronic. Iâ€™m not seeing a way out anymore. Iâ€™ve been trying so hard to get out of this rut, but life keeps throwing me aside.

In tons of college debt, gf of 4 years completely shattered my world, my acl injury hurts all the time, itâ€™s fucking depressing ass winter, and Iâ€™m stuck in a soul sucking job because the job market is so shit right now. This isnâ€™t living. Iâ€™ve been dead for a while now, I think.

Canâ€™t see this going on much longer. Thereâ€™s an ending.
