20yo Male SuicideI put the gun to my head today. It was empty, but I thought if I just kept going through the motions of cocking it, putting it to my head, and pulling the trigger, then when it was the real thing I could do it without a second thought. Maybe it is because the gun is colored or maybe it is because it is smaller then most pistols, but it seems so innocent. Never before has it been so easy to even â€œpracticeâ€ suicide before. I have had a good* life. A family and a group of friends that love me. I am blessed with capabilities and ambition/prospects. But, recently I have just been â€œoverâ€ it. I wake up in a slum, I go through my day binge eating, gaining weight, which hurts my self-esteem problem. Although many people love me back, the few/one person I love (in the romantic sense) never loves me back. 
I keep thinking if I get this guy to like me, then it will all be ok. My life will be ok. I will finally be happy. He is everything I have ever dreamed of having in a boyfriend. Even though I really believe he is the one, I keep asking myself- â€œis it healthy to base oneâ€™s happiness on ONE person?â€. I know the answer- itâ€™s no. But, still. I like him a lot even though he seems uninterested. 
My family loves me, well the important ones do anyways....but, I still feel like I canâ€™t do it. I donâ€™t want to be sad anymore. Yet; when I think about killing my self, I feel like I wonâ€™t do it. I imagine living a miserable life- never pulling the trigger. Why? Idk. Hope maybe. Hope that either I will accomplish my life goal(s) or that I will get the boy I like. But also because I donâ€™t want to disappoint those who love me most, my siblings. I am not lying when I say I wish I had no one- at least then I wouldnâ€™t have anything to hold me back. I could just finally do it.
