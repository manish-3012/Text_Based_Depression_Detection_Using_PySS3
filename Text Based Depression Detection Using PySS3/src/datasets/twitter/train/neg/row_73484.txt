These thoughts won't go awayPassing thoughts of wanting to no longer exist. Some days it comes and goes, but other days it makes its mark in my mind and stays...like today.

The only thing from keeping me from death is the fact that I have a few friends who have lost loved ones via suicide. They tell me, "I can't lose you, too"

But isn't that selfish of them? To allow me to live and suffer with this pain and these thoughts I can't get rid of? 

I want to leave in the most discrete way possible. Or maybe an accident. I'm tired of waking up every morning thinking about my past, constantly ruminating. 

Talking to friends doesn't help; how much longer do I have to hear "it gets better" or "its just a phase" before I actually lose my mind
