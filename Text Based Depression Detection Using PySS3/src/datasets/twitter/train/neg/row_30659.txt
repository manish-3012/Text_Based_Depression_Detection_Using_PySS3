death is inescapable and all-consumingthere's nothing left for me.
every truth in the universe is too strange and divorced from the human experience to have meaning. all the things that matter to me are broken. the human brain is not supposed to contain this stuff. I feel like something horrible is going to happen to everybody.

what do I do? I'm only another half-of-a shitty life event from ending it. I don't want to die but I have a lot of thoughts about killing myself and it sometimes feels like the only option. I just want to go to sleep for years and years. nothing makes any sense.
