I feel like I'll never find a purpose in life and that I'll never be happy.I'm feeling pretty hopeless about myself. I don't think I'll ever be anything. I'm so insignificant and unappealing as a person. I feel like I'm so incompetent and inept that nobody will ever enjoy my company. I can't keep a friendship for longer than a week, ill never have a relationship, I don't have a job, I don't have any skills, I have no interests. Its like my life is so empty and voided because of my sheer ignorance.
