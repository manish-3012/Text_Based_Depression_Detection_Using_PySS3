The universe is not working in my favorDo you know how difficult it is being a Hispanic male with BPD? Do you know how much pain I have to encounter dealing with mental health stigma and absolutely nothing going my way? I am obsessed with a girl I dated who wants nothing to do with me, I think about her EVERY DAY and I know itâ€™s my stupid disorder thatâ€™s keeping me stuck this way. I was BANNED from participating in my student government because of my BPD â€” NOBODY UNDERSTANDS!!! I JUST WANT TO DIE!!!! Iâ€™m homeless having to live out of my car every once and a while. Every day I consider ending it because I donâ€™t want to see how my disorder is going to fuck with the rest of my life. 

I think today might be the day. Iâ€™m currently in class dissociating HARD â€” I canâ€™t even pay attention. Every little thing someone does triggers me and it HURTS SO BAD
