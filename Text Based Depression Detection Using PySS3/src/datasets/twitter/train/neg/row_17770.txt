I'm going to hang myself, and I don't think my parents will even care. (possibly NSFW)I am 14, male, and I'm an asperger, I've diagnosed myself with OCD and ADHD, I'm genderqueer pansexual and homophobic which is a problem, and I'm done, I'm gonna hang myself next time I can go outside with my scarf. my dads barely here, and when he is, he never listens to anything i have to say unless it will affect him. and my mums here all the time but because of my ADHD I always manage to annoy her, my OCD makes me want to slit my fucking wrist in. cuz it makes my whole life a routine. i wake up, brush my teeth, go to the bathroom, wash my hands, annoy my dad/mum indirectly cuz of my adhd, have dinner, brush my teeth, go to the toilet, wash my hands, go to bed. rinse and repeat. that's not all of it though. there is a lot need to talk about so message me, please (don't know how to pm)
