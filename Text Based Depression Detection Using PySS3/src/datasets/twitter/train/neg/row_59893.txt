I'm tired of suffering &amp; I'll be glad when my life is overI see no purpose in living because I'm an ORPHAN! I have NO family! No children, nothing! I hate my life! I have NO friends! I'm recently divorced from passively abusive husband. I made 1 good friend but I've only been knowing him 6 months. He &amp; his wife treat me pretty good. Without them no one. I don't even have anyone to fulfill my burial arrangements.
Thanks. I have tried very hard to make new friends. I never thought my life would end up like this. I came very close to carrying out my suicide last year; down to my outfit, where I was going to jump. I was scared I would go through with it. I need someone to handle my burial wishes. Everything is paid for. My xhusband tells everyone he doesn't want to talk to me, see me or get back together. I left him because not once did he ever even hug me, never touched me...the lack of intimacy was unbearable!; plus he lost everything we had; kept getting us sued, and sued. Liens, judgments, he became homeless...I ran away. I was forced out of my marriage. Some say he should be glad I would accept him back. I hate my life. I have no life I may as well be dead. The only thing I do have is my health, education (2 college degrees) &amp; looks. 

Churches are a freaking JOKE! I tried saving myself, Baptist, Christian, Islam, then Jehovah Witness Kingdom Hall, where the speaker was speaking on suicide; I gave him my cell # with tears in my eyes and this Elder/Leader never called! I'm tired of trying. Thanks
