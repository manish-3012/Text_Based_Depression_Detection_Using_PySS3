Depressed, recently relapsed into self harm, getting slapped around by life every day.It just feels like life decided I was never going to make it years ago, and sometimes I don't know why I shouldn't just give up. Every tiny thing I try to do goes wrong so often it feels like a joke sometimes. This past week, I got held back from graduation a year by a fucking clerical error, I missed a doctors appointment (to get antidepressants) I made months ago due to an auto accident, I broke my glasses that I need to drive, and I started self harming again.

My struggle with mental illness and with myself keeps me spread thin already, and life constantly kicking me down like this makes living feel like an insurmountable task. I have a support system, and I love them all dearly, but its just so hard to justify trying sometimes. Part of me just feels like I should check myself into inpatient care, part of me wants to fight through it, but most of me just wants to lay in bed and do absolutely nothing

I havent had any of my psychiatric medication for almost two months now due to stupid bullshit on my part and doctors being difficult, and every attempt to get back on them just keeps fucking up.
