No matter what I do to try to avoid the thoughts the feeling only grows strongerIâ€™ve been trying to keep myself busy from thinking about suicide. I figured tonight I could just talk to my friends to keep busy. Then as I was scrolling through my friends I realized I donâ€™t have a close friend I can speak to about this. Iâ€™ve never had one. Iâ€™ve only had people who can tolerate me. Iâ€™ve been distracting myself by picking up on instruments. Guitar, Ukulele, and even DJing now. Even though I genuinely enjoy them everyday Iâ€™m just really really sad. If anyone is out here right now. I just.. need to hear that everything will be okay. Iâ€™m optimistic now but itâ€™s slowly decaying by the day. Iâ€™m slowly losing hope as I sit on the ledge of this overpass tonight..
