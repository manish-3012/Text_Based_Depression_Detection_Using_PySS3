Don't know what to do anymore.For the last 2 years now my life has just been falling apart and i just don't know what i should do anymore. It's only been getting worse aswell and it kinda feels like a hit the bottom. And it feels like people are pushing me away even though they don't even know what's going on. Which kinda makes me feel alone, unwanted, unloved or whatever._x000D_

I know you'll say that I should find someone to talk to but the truth is i don't know anyone i trust enough to talk to about this. I'm not really comfortable to talk about it at all, not even on here. It took me quite a while to post this. I guess this is some kind of last desperate try._x000D_
Anyone got any advice on what to do?
