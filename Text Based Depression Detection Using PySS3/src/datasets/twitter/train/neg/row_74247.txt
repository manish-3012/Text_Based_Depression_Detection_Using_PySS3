I am lost and there is no way out.This is my first ever post in reddit. I've reached my limit im desperate at this point i guess that's why im venting to reddit huh? About me; Ever since i was a child i would hear my dad yell at my mom and disrespect her. He ended up cheating on her and thats when my mom had enough so with no money we moved out. Years go by i start to grow up a little and think more. at 12 i realized that my dad abandoned his children and wife for lust. That led me to do things i dont feel comfortable sharing. Well everyday for the next 4 years the weight on my shoulders gets heavier and heavier. Then i met a girl. I fell in love with this girl and she would tell me likewise. I ended up trusting her with my secret and told her about my depression and since then she;s turned her back on me and done things to me but i cant let go because she is my light and the only person i talk to because i drifted away from my friends. She would hurt me and i'd mutilate myself and take pills and all this and it was then that my mom had enough. She cried and begged me to not see her and her parents too didnt want her to see me. So they decided that we never speak again. Now, im all alone with my thoughts with my pain and memories of her. I have no friends no one to talk to nothing. I have tried to end my misery and leaving this world but im too much of a coward to do so and for some reason when i take 1000+ mgs of wellbutrin i cant seem to overdose even though the overdose dosage is as low as 600mg. I don't know what to do and i'm lost. I really don't know why im making this in the first place. I guess maybe there is someone who wants to speak with me i dont know. I just don't know.

i didn't know where to post this
