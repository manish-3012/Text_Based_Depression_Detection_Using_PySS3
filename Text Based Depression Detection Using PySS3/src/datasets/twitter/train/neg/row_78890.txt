I'm "just tired."I've been ignoring my depression for too long. I've been out of therapy and off meds since I turned 18, and was dropped from my dad's insurance. I'm nearing 24 now. I can't do this anymore.

I know I have a family that loves me. I know I have friends that love me. I know my fiancee loves me. I just wish my thoughts didn't get so dark all the time.

I don't WANT to want to kill myself. I don't WANT to want to harm myself. I don't WANT to stare at my fiancee's blood pressure pills and wonder how many it would take to stop my heart. 

I'm a good person. I go to school full time and work 2 jobs. I volunteer. I am a girl scout troop leader. I am a shoulder for everyone to cry on.

I know I could cry on their shoulders, as well, but I feel selfish and whiny. I don't talk about it. I pretend it's under control.

I just don't want to do it anymore.
