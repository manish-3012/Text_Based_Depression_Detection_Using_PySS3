Really need someone to talk toI'm not sure what to do anymore. Not even sure that posting on here is worth it. It's funny, I'm supposed to be happy, moving in with a long term boyfriend, in the "prime of my life." Instead I'm a disabled waste of space, both physically and mentally. My meds have stopped doing a thing, it seems, no matter how often doctors desperately try to come up with the correct combination of toxins that keep me from going psychotic again, and now I've just stopped having feelings. The few times that I do, I feel like there's a pit in my chest so deep that you could just rip my heart out. The girl who was doing the best out of our recovery group relapsed earlier this week and passed away from a heroin overdose, and I think to myself, hell, if she didn't make it...where are the rest of us headed? All things considered, it absolutely should have been me. I truly wish that suicide wasn't such a big burden for everyone around me. I don't care if it's pathetic, I'm begging from an escape from this pain. I try to stay positive, shove positive messages down my throat, but they all feel empty and forced. I'm really unsure if things will even get better anymore.
