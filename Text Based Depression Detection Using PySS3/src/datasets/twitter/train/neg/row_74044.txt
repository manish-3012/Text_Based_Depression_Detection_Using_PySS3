I'm not okay and I am starting not to care.I'm just.. I don't really even want to talk. I don't want to straight up kill myself because I've tried before and it made everyone miserable and I obviously failed. But I just don't even see the point in things anymore. Nothing gives me joy or hope. It's like my life is just one long day where nothing ever changes. 

I'm just to the point where I want to break things, hurt myself and just. uh I don't even know. I can't get out how I'm feeling into words. It's pointless to try.
