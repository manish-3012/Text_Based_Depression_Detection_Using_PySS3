My friend recently came to me and said she has been considering suicide and I honestly have no idea how to help.I really want to help her and I think her seeing a professional would be a good option but I donâ€™t want to impose or overstep. I know that I need to be sensitive and I just want to say the right things. 

If this I the wrong sub then please point me in the right direction.
