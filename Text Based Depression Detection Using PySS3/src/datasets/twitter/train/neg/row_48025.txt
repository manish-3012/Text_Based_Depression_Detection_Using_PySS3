I'm struggling to stay alive in this worldI'm seriously considering taking my life once and for all. I can't take it anymore. I can't take feeling like absolute shit and feeling barely okay for an insignificant amount of time. I'm tired of waking up and wishing I could go to sleep and never have to wake up again. I'm tired of not being good enough, or even enough for that matter. I'm tired of looking around and seeing everyone else doing better in life than me and wishing more and better for me. I'm tired of seeing everyone else around me be in happy relationships and getting married while I end up in failed relationship after failed relationship after realizing that I'm just not good enough no matter how hard I try. Whenever I hear someone say 'dont worry, it'll get better' I have to wonder if they're being serious or if they're just hoping that I cling onto that even though it's meaningless and an empty platitude. Sometimes I think the universe is playing a sick game with me in testing my patience to see if I crack. I don't even think this is to "make me stronger" as some would suggest, but rather I think the universe wants me gone and hates me for whatever reason. I don't know where to go from here. I don't have the strength to go on. I'm too tired to keep this up. I guess I'm looking for someone to help change my mind because I don't know what to do anymore.
