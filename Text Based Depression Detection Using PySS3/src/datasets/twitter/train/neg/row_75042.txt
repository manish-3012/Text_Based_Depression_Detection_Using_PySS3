Anyone else not want to do it, but feel that they have to?I keep waiting for situation with my health to improve. Honestly, I'm pretty content with being myself. I like my job, family, relationship, etc. It's just that my health is deteriorating and making every single day a living nightmare. It's impossible to treat and it makes me scared of what will happen in the future. I am miserable to be around for the last 8 months or so and I don't expect any of this to spontaneously resolve.

I wish I could just be myself. Without problems. Without visible symptoms. Does anyone else feel this way?
