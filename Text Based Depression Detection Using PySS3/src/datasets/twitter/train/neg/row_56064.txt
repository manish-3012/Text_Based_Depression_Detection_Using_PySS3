I donâ€™t know if I can do it allMy bpd is  killing me. I thought if I loved someone hard enough they would stop leaving me if I was good enough and was kind enough and sweet and forgiving and all the things I should be then people would love me back but Everyone always leaves from my mom to my dad and grandparents every lover all my friends and I canâ€™t tell if itâ€™s my fault or if this is just how the world works and Iâ€™m not understanding and connecting like I should 

Therapists always ask if I ever made a plan and I never really did I was just always hoping something would kill me like cancer or something but tonight it started coming together in my head i would have to clean my room and write everyone letters and see my sister one last time and leave something for my boyfriend to remember me by and Iâ€™m so scared of myself now but  Iâ€™m so tired of waking up to another unchanging day unchanging life and itâ€™s so so so so lonely I hate myself  how can you fix your mistakes when you are the mistake I wasnâ€™t meant to be here I feel it every day in my bones I donâ€™t think I was meant to be here 


I used to be happy and nice and kind and hopeful when I was little and yesterday I just saw myself in my mind the little girl I used to be and I know I let her down in every way and I canâ€™t stop crying Iâ€™m sorry to her
