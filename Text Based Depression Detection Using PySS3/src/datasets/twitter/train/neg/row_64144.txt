Can't take it anymoreI'm 15. I don't feel love for my family anymore, and I lost all of my friends. I can't find any more love and the people that kept me happy are either dead or almost. I push everyone away from me. I don't want to live like this. I can't take it. If I don't post again after 1 month I'm dead.
