Isolation is bringing me closer and closer to the edgeI'm not sure where to begin with this.  I'm 24 years old, soon to be 25.  I live with my parents, although I may be moving out towards the end of the year.  I have lost all of my friends over the years.  They've all just stopped talking to me.  I keep trying to find a girlfriend but unfortunately I am not appealing enough for anyone to want me.  My self esteem is at an all time low.
I am tired of being alone and yet, I almost don't even want to put myself in a position to be hurt again by trying to find new friends and a purpose in life.  I'm nice to people, I treat people the way I want to be treated.  Yet nobody wants me.
I was a failure and underachiever in high school.  I haven't gone to college and have no motivation to go.  I'm getting to the point where I don't know what else to do...
