The Agonizing Last Words of Programmer Bill ZellerI felt compelled to post this here after reading it. I do not mean to post this as a defense of his decision, but rather as something to learn from. He never shared his abuse with others and felt betrayed by those who shared some of the private things he told them.

Having recently had some moments of wanting it all to end, this story really hit me, and I want to share it so that others will reach out. I feel that far too often those of us who are depressed and/or suicidal feel we are perceived as far more of a negative influence than we actually are. 

So to those of you who want to end it all: please reach out. You are not the only one who has faced the issues you are facing. Your situation is unique, of course, but it is not impossible.
