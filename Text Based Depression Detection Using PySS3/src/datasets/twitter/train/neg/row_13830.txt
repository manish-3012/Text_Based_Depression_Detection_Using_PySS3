i want to take my lifei dont feel happy anymore. i dont feel in control. all i do is cry. ive always had problems with anxiety and getting depressed but ever since my girlfriend and i broke up its been 100x worse. since the break up she has drawn me in and pushed me away until recently where she ended things for good. it has really messed me up emotionally. i feel so empty. i will wake up randomly at night and wont be able to fall back asleep because all i can do is think about this shit. i cant take it anymore. all i ever do is cry. no one really seems to give a shit about me. i feel unloved and unsupported now. i feel like a burden to the world and its just my time. i dont want to live anymore. i already know how i want to do it. im just so depressed i genuinely cant take this anymore
