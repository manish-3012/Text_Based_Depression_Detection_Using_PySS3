Need help for someone else...I was going to make a longer post but I'm not really sure how to write something like, will offer more info if you need, and I am sorry if this is not this best place for this. I [M19] have been close online friends with someone [F23] who has been struggling with untreated major/clinical depression for quite some time. We live far from each other, I am in the US and she is in the EU. We've had a good relationship that had started to go downhill and I got irrationally frustrated at that. We haven't talked for a relatively short amount of time but today she had called me after getting drunk at a party (with her other best friends, I consider that to be her primary support network) to tell me that she had came very close to an attempt earlier in the day. She had also isolated herself from communities we were in. It was a pretty fast call so I didn't have time to assess if they harmed themselves and in what way. She was in a pretty broken state when we started talking but by the end of the call she seemed more calm and collected.  


I am asking for a bit of advice on this situation, it had crossed my mind before but now its really apparent to me: she has been dealing with suicidal ideation for awhile now and I have very poor social skills and my attempts at helping her and listening to her struggles had gone very poorly, I was not good at it at all. I just don't know what to do now, I suggested professional help and therapy but I don't really know. We're so far away from each other I don't even know what to do in case something really does happen. I really need help. Thank you to whoever reads this, I sincerely wish the best on your struggles as well.
