I'm thinking about it.I just recently started talking to my ex-girlfriend, again.  She is now dating someone new and I don't really know how to handle this.  I'm extremely depressed and I'm thinking about hurting myself.  I never got over her and I was kind of hoping we would get back together.  I just don't know what to do.
