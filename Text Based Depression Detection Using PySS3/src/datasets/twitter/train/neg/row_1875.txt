I'm lost.Long story short.. I have nothing left for me. I'm 28 years old, I live with my parents, I just quit a 70k/year job because after a year of working 70 hour weeks, i thought i was going to end it. I'm supposed to start a new job on Monday, but i don't think i'll make it that long. I have 3 people dear to me. 2 of them are men, both of them are great friends, and the third was the girl who I thought i would make my wife. She let me know tonight that there's a snowballs chance in hell that's going to happen. The thought of me starting a family with her was the ONLY FUCKING THING that kept me going. I no longer have that. I'm just so fucking lost and don't know what to do. I'm sick of this pain. SICK OF IT. I don't want to cause the few who care about me pain, but I don't think i can fucking take any more myself........ After the shit i've seen and done in the military, i just fucking cant. I guess i'm asking for help... No... Begging..... I wish i had more options, but after so many years, those have been exhausted, and I just don't see the light anymore.
