I've been thinking lately that I want to kill myself.I woke up last night and couldn't get back to sleep for a couple hours. All I could think was how much I didn't want to be here. I feel like the only reason I'm living is because of the few people that would be sad if I died. My family and my boyfriend. I know it's really fucked up of me to be complaining about how much I hate life when there are people who care about me. Honestly though, my boyfriend is only into me because he's also suicidal and I'm emotional support for him. He doesn't know I've been like this. And my family are just good people so they naturally care about me. They're the main reason I haven't gone through with it. Just because I feel like I'd be selfish to them if I did.

There was a girl, who was a friend of a girl I go to school with, who killed herself earlier this month. I've been creeping on this girl's Facebook. And this girl was crazy popular. She was a humanitarian who was involved in a bunch of charities and she was super involved in her school. She was athletic and really pretty. She just seemed like she would probably had the kind of life I would want. But even she had her own demons. 

It made me think. I always think that the reason I'm depressed is because I feel like most people don't pay much attention to me. I've always tried to be outgoing and talkative. But for some reason I don't have friends. I don't know what I am doing wrong. But I just feel unimportant. I feel like I'm always left out. But I think even if I did have these things, I'd still be depressed. There's just something in my brain that is fucked up. 

I wish my boyfriend wasn't suicidal. I mean mostly cause I love him and don't want him to feel that way. But then I wouldn't feel guilty about breaking up with him so he can move on from me. Then one day I would just run away. Or do something horrible to make my family hate me. And then I could just do it. I could just end it all and be done with this world.
