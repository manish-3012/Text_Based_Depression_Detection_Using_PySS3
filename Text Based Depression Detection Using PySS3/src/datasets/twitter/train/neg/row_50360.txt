I have never felt like I truly belong hereHello. 

Iâ€™ve been dealing with severe depression and anxiety for 11/12 years. Maybe longer. I didnâ€™t start to seek help until 8-9 years into it. Recently (within the past few months) I was diagnosed schizoaffective. My initial reaction was â€œshockâ€ and I cried to a close friend of mine about it. I put shock in quotation because I donâ€™t feel that those emotions truly belonged to me. I donâ€™t feel human. I never have felt human. I think different. Talk different. Look different. I feel like an alien in my own skin most days. Itâ€™s a sick, crawly feeling I get when I try to put too much thought into it. Maybe itâ€™s part of the depression/ anxiety or maybe thatâ€™s just the new diagnosis. All I know is that Iâ€™m alone. No matter how many people tell me otherwise. The people Iâ€™ve had near and dear have always been as inconsistent as the next. Iâ€™ve tried building close â€œbest friendâ€ bonds. In my relationships Iâ€™ve tried being that â€œperfectâ€ significant other. It never happens the way I believe relationships with other humans should. I see people interacting differently with one another. Iâ€™m always the odd on out. Always. As far back as me being the kid on the playground no one wanted to play with. Up until now when Iâ€™m the last choice friend for when someone is depressed. None of my â€œfriendsâ€ give me the support I need and itâ€™s left me feeling like I need too much. That maybe itâ€™s just me. Iâ€™ve heavily considered killing myself this morning. Just to see the other side of things. I like to believe that itâ€™s different. Better. Most days. Other days I imagine it being a dark void. Something that will still feel better than this emptiness I feel inside. I donâ€™t want to be here. I never have enjoyed life in the ways we should. Iâ€™ve definitely tried. I know how to appreciate the little things and be grateful for what I have. Iâ€™ve done exciting things that donâ€™t excite me. Iâ€™m immune to it all at this point so life is just a drag. If Iâ€™m such an outcast. If thereâ€™s no where for me to fit in and enjoy this experience. Why am I having it? Why am I here. Obviously, thatâ€™s not a question anyone else can answer for me, but it plagues my mind. Day in, day out. Plagues my mind. I am so unsatisfied and I donâ€™t think that will ever end.
