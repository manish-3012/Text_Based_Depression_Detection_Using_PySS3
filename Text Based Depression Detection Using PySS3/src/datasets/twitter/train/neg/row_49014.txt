I finally feel okay.There's a saying about all of us going out kicking and screaming before we die. I took extra Adderall today cuz fuck it you know. I've knows for awhile that nobody likes me. The one person who ever showed me any kindness has left me. She only responds to me out of pity or when she needs money. She doesn't really appreciate it, I get a half hearted socially mandatory "thanks" but it's constantly hundreds of dollars. I absolutely 100% love this woman, I wish I was medicated sooner but being medicated down doesn't mean shit because nothing has changed.

Besides that I have no friends, never really have honestly, I moved around a lot so I don't have that unbreakable bonds that friends from childhood have. As my best friend I could never find again after we moved. I used to search MySpace all the time and when Facebook came out I still couldn't find him. Sorry man, I know you don't ever think about me though.. nobody does. 

So the Adderall keeps me too high to cry, while the shots of bleach tear of my stomach. Deuces everyone, the drugs were fun but the rest of my time here was shit. Sorry I couldn't do better.
