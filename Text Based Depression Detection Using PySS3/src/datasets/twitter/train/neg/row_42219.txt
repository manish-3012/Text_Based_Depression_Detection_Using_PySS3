Dunno why I post here, I'm not even suicidal, I'm just really anxiousI'm 26 now and I'm still not fixed on what I shoud do with my life. That's only part of the problem, I made poor choices in the past, and now I have to pay for it. I wasted three years in college going from one area to another but, I never completed anything. Then I took a year and a half class in graphic design and I kept working in this area for four year even if I didn't like it, because I was scared to death of going back to school (I'm still). Now, i thought it was about time I start doing something more interesting, so I will begin a bachelor degree in September but I'm reeaaalllyyyy anxious. I learned by experience that it's usually better to jump in the fire and get out of your comfort zone but, still I have tons of thing to worry about. I still have a debt to pay related to my car, and I will have spend quite a bit more to rent a room, close to the university but still my wage will get lower even if I can find a high wage job while studying at the same time. What's really frustrating is when I hear people telling me "why are you dropping a good job?". They are probably the kind of person who will do the same boring job for all their life without asking any question but still, I find it really frustrating. 

The other part of the problem is that it always fell akward for me to engage conversation with someone else so I grew up as a loner. I'm scared because I fear I will not be able to get to know people. What worked for me, in the past was to volunteer for a suicide hotline, it helped build confidence but I don't know if I'll be able to continue to do this while studying at the same time. Especially knowing that I will be far from the place I always lived in the past.
