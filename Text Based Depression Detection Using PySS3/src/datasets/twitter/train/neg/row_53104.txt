I'm so scaredMy wife is having an affair. She is refusing to stop. She says that she still loves me. But get mad when I'm upset about it or when I want to talk to someone other than her about this. I can't even talk to my father about it because she doesn't want him to hate her. She keeps dangling us getting being exclusive likke a carrot on a stick to keep me calm. I have my gun hidden in my room and a 15 page letter written for whoever finds. I'm so scared and alone right now.
