Long time reader, first time poster.Hey SW. Let me begin by saying that I truly adore this community and respect it greatly.

Thing is that tonight I've spiraled out of control and find myself feeling more down than usually. If I could find someone to talk me down of the ledge right now that would be greatly appreciated.

I've probably done all the drugs that are out there, and more. I don't really enjoy any of them, but I drink like it's going out of style.

Is there anyone out there that would like to help, and if not even just talk. Anything would be good because I'm really at the end of my rope here.
