The only thing I had in life was this and now that's gone too.My life has been shit forever. The only thing that makes me happy is lifting weights. I've had chronic pain for a year in my shoulder. I can't even lift weights anymore. My doctor is saying it's a torn labrum likely and there is no way to fully restore it.
