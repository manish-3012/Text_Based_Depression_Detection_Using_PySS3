I donâ€™t knowI feel like Iâ€™ve been succeeeding or at least feel less shit about things but today nothing particular happened but I feel like the mood is back.

I feel awful. Nobody in my real life has time for me. Theyâ€™re all busy and I know they are. But theyâ€™re too busy for me. In any case itâ€™s not like Iâ€™d want to trouble them by saying I feel really shit. Thatâ€™ll make things worse and all the â€œsuccessâ€ Iâ€™ve had is just disappearing.

Iâ€™m grasping at strings just for now. And I feel like I have no one all over again. When people say theyâ€™re there for you theyâ€™re there but when you actually need them theyâ€™re nowhere to be found. Theyâ€™re there when itâ€™s convenient for them to. But unfortunately I canâ€™t feel terrible when itâ€™s a good time for them. I canâ€™t control anything. If I could I wouldnâ€™t even want to feel this way.

Am I spiraling again? Or am I already out of control?
