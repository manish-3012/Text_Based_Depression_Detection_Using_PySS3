How do we get to this point?  Just for background - I've dealt with major depressive disorder since I was 15.  I had an abusive childhood, dropped out of high school at 16, got my diploma equivalency, worked some, attended community college.  I graduated nursing school in 2008.  

This all sounds good on the surface - I am (reasonably) happily married, employed, have a roof and food.  

But I still fight off the thoughts of inadequacy, despair, certain death.  Trying to do my job with this is like trying to hold a conversation while wearing static-filled earphones.  I fall into old patterns of self-harm, drink too much, play too much sad music.  I take medication - it took months for the worst side effects to disappear.  

I was written up at work for bad customer service - I came across as glum and brusque.  

I want to blame myself when something happens to a patient - like I should have been perceptive enough to notice a problem far before it was clinically evident.  It's ridiculous but pervasive.  

Mainly, I consider timing.  Prior suicide attempts (three, one serious) increases the risk of completion.  I have a tiny voice in my head - "When? Tonight? Next week? Next month?  O.D. on Easter afternoon?"  

How do people get to this point, when it seems so normal to go over and over the ways it could be done?  Why does it seem so logical to enumerate the reasons for suicide?  Is it the coward's way out, or am I a coward to continuing to live?  

Guess I just want to talk.
