I don't want to live.I just honestly don't want to live. Like, literally. There's nothing that I want. Nowhere I want to go. Nothing that I want to do. I don't want anything. There's no point. I'm just sitting around, waiting to die. Why don't I just do it myself? I can't stop my mind. I can't do this anymore guys.
