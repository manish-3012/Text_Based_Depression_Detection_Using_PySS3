I feel like I am nearing the endI am not too sure if I am in the right place but I have been having increasingly more real thoughts of suicide. 

Last night was the closest I have come to it.

I have had thoughts about it before but now my life seems shitty enough to go along with those thoughts that I am worthless.

I lost my job and I had to move back in with my parents and I spend all in bed.

I was doing better for a while but then I got the flu and now that I am better from that I feel like a piece of shit again.

I also have no one to talk to about this... not everything.. I feel like I have lied about  somewhat of my life to everyone I know... not to mention the relationships I did have (friends and my girlfriend) I haven't talked to in the past few months since moving back home.

I know there are things I need to do but I can't bring myself to do them(I mean to better myself) and I can't seem to do them.

I am just wondering if I could talk a little bit about myself to someone, get my lies off my chest or something.
