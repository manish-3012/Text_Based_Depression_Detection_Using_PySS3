In between suicidal episodesI'm not suicidal at the moment, but I will be again soon. When it comes I remind myself that it's just thoughts, and that it's temporary, and that I just need to wait it out. But when I'm not suicidal, I find I'm just living not to die, in case sometime something or someone will come along and inspire me to want to live. In the inbetween time I just pass the time with anything that makes the feelings of hopelessness subside: self harm, pornography, netflix, cat pictures, video games, hot showers... basically the same way I pass the time when I'm suicidal. I can't bear to be out in public, and I'm lonely in my apartment... Today I held a knife to my throat all morning because it felt comfortable, like a security blanket. I almost fell asleep on it. I don't know how long I can go on like this.
