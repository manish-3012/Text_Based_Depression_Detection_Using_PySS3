Convince me not to kill myself.I have 300 mg of methadone in a shot just waiting to shoot up \(I bought it on the street\) My life sucking sucks. My mom is mean to me, shes never EVER said "good job" to me\- NOT ONCE. Even before drugs. Even when I was a good daughter\-by her standards\- shed always find something wrong w me. I can't bring myself to feel. I have no empathy. I don't think I can love, I just use and manipulate people for money. I hate everything.
