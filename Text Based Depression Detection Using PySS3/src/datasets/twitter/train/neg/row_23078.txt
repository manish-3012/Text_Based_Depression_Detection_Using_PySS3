I don't want to grow oldIf i won't commit suicide now, it will eventually happen in the future. I find being old boring and sad. I feel like no one cares about old people unless they are family. The physical pains that will come with it and seeing your loved ones dying one by one is not something i want. I don't want to lose my hair, get wrinkles and be creepy. The point of this isn't to insult old people, I would just know if anyone feels the same way.
