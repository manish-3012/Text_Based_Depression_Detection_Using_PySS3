Should I get rid of my blades?I have been planning to kill myself for about a year now. Its 2 days away from when I was going to kill myself and I decided not to go through with it. I have some will to live, but I think Iâ€™m still suicidal. I feel like the smallest thing would push me over the edge, and I think I want to give life another chance. I feel like would I give in and kill myself if I had a bad day on the day I was planning to die. I got rid of anything I could use to kill myself and Iâ€™m considering getting rid of my note. I still have my blades that I use to self harm, I was originally planning to kill myself with them, but I later realized that it would be too painful. Iâ€™m wondering if I should get rid of them. I wonâ€™t stop self harming, and I would probably self harm something more dangerous if I got rid of them.  Should I get rid of my blades?
