Anybody else not committed suicide because of other people?The only reason I haven't ended myself is because of my mother, I know it would kill her if I did it. When my mother passes then I'll have nothing to live for and will almost definitely end my life but until that day I'll suffer some more just to keep her happy. I love you mum.
