I canâ€™t turn 18Itâ€™s still a few month until my birthday, but even thinking about it puts me in so much distress. Turning 18 is nothing but a reminder that Iâ€™m a failure. All I ever did was to disappointment everyoneâ€™s expectations, even if they were incredibly basic things youâ€™d expect from everyone. In addition, everyone that means something to me will be gone around that time. Theyâ€™ll leave and Iâ€™m not someone you stay in contact with. Itâ€™s easy to forget about me. (My family gave up on me long ago so there really isnâ€™t anyone to else)
I absolutely donâ€™t want to be 18 (I hate that this number means so much to me even though I know itâ€™s just a number) and nothing seems to be okay during that time. How to prevent everything from happening is the easier part, but to come up with a detailed plan is somewhat harder. My mind has been on it for the last few days, sketching out more and more complicated ideas. Thinking about dates, logistics, notes, expenses, methods, places - nothing I really want to share.
But thereâ€™s two fears continuously emerging: the fear of failing and the definite decision that comes with committing suicide.
(I donâ€™t know why i typed this out, itâ€™s probably really incoherent and leaves out too much. I kinda needed a place to ramble, sorry)
