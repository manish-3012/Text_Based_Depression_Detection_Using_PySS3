I don't want to care about anyone anymoreIt's so painful, and thinking about how painful it will be for everyone else is just even worse. My death will make my mom, friends and ex bf sad for years. I just want to ran away from everything and everyone and kill myself. Somewhere where no one can find my body. Idc if the case gets a lot of media attention, I just don't want my mom having to find me.
I'll back away from everyone and maybe that will make it easier. I'll stop feeling guilty for being so fucking depressed around anyone too.
I'll spend my last days watching shows, helping my mom sort out her life, paying my debts and then i'll go somewhere remote to do it. 

This is the only thought that brings me comfort.

Soon.
