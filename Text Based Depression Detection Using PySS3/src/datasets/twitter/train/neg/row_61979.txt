Will the Hemlock Society help you if you want to die for mental health (as opposed to physical health) reasons?From what I remember, they have activists who can help us exit with nitrogen bags. I would MUCH rather have a professional help me with this as opposed to trying it myself/potentially endangering my family members. DAK if they are willing to help people with decades of documented mental health problems?
