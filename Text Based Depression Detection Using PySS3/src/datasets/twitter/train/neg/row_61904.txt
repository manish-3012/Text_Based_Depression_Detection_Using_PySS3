I want to kill myself but I donâ€™t know whyIâ€™ve been depressed and wanting to kill myself for 2 years. I have no idea why. I have parents who love me and everything I could hope for. But everyday I contemplate stealing the key to my dads gun case and ending it all. I cry myself to sleep every night I donâ€™t care about anything in my life anymore. I donâ€™t care about school. I have had a weight issue all of my life. I think it might have to do with school but even during summer. The only time Iâ€™m happy is when I smoke. But overall I just want to end it.
