Iâ€™m done...... The pain will never leave....It took a lot to post this...... A LOT..... Over an hour Iâ€™ve been sitting here wanting to press Post.......... I have never had anyone to talk to about things like this.... My entire life... No one cares how Iâ€™m feeling...... No one here, or anywhere..... But I canâ€™t leave without letting the world know why......

My partner of seven years just told me heâ€™s leaving me. For good. 
That he hasnâ€™t loved me in a long time (maybe ever) and that heâ€™s leaving. 
Heâ€™s washing a large portion of his clothes right now. And getting ready to go.....
Iâ€™ve given him everything for seven years..... EVERYTHING....... I dropped out of college because of him. I lost my best (and only) friend because of him. My family all hate me because of him. I have given him everything....... And this is how Iâ€™ve been repaid... Like a FOOL, I was hoping for a promise ring sometime this year (Iâ€™ve never gotten any jewelry from him, but weâ€™re *very* poor), but instead Iâ€™m slapped in the face with this.... I donâ€™t see a way to even live without him.... Nothing any one says will change that.... 

Iâ€™ll be homeless... Alone.... Thatâ€™s not what I want..... Iâ€™d rather just go now......

My family all donâ€™t care.... I live with my adopted s grandparents.... Who I have to take care of 24/7..... I do everything for them, but they have Parkinsonâ€™s and Dementia..... So they treat me like shit..... They always yell at me and they act like they hate me all the time..... I have to tel them â€œnoâ€ sometimes..... And itâ€™s all really hard to deal with all the time...... Right now is the worst time in the world to find a job...... Iâ€™m literally two-steps now from perpetual homelessness, and literally. Theyâ€™re nearing the end of their life.... And no one cares about me..... About how Iâ€™m doing........ No one. NO. ONE. Cares...... 

I canâ€™t take it anymore. I really canâ€™t. I canâ€™t love another person as much as I did him.... I gave EVERYTHING to him........ I lost my virginity to him..... He has been my....everything....... And now Iâ€™m sitting here balling my eyes out about someone who doesnâ€™t love me. He says itâ€™s because he canâ€™t change to be the person I want, but I know itâ€™s bullshit..... Everything in the world is bullshit..... Iâ€™m done........... Goodbye..... I canâ€™t take this life anymore...... I know there is no God...... No afterlife.....
