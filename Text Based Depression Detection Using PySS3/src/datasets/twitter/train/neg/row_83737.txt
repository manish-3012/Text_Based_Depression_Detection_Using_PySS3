Anyone feel like they are totally alone?Whenever I read personal experiences about depression or suicide, there always seems to be that one person in their story that pulls them out of it. You know, that loving parent, the caring sibling, the spouse, girlfriend, best buddy, co-worker, anyone at all! 

Even here, I read about people breaking up with their boyfriend, loosing a close friend, the loss of a loved one.

I guess my point is, it seems like almost everyone, even in the most hopeless cases has at least one person in their life that they can count on, or at least could count on in the past. What are we supposed to do if we have nobody? 

I lost all of my friends years ago. My parents have given up on me, and I hate them anyway. I don't work with anyone. My extended family is distant or dead. My last girlfriend was in middle school. When I'm feeling down, I have no one to rely on. 

I guess this is mostly a rant, but it helps even if I can find people to relate to online. Does anyone here feel totally alone, as in there isn't even one person in their life that they can count on? And if so, how do you deal with the darker times?
