Girl Ghosted Me After 3rd Date25 M, USA

Met girl on Bumble. 

Date 1 = great

Date 2 = a few days after date 1, good; just made out a bunch

Date 3 = day after date 3, not good; did more than making out but less than sex

Now = a few days after date 3, she completely ghosted me ... blocked me from all social media and phone number

Prospective reasons why she ghosted me: 

1. She wanted to come back to my place after date 2 but I'm a recovering addict who currently lives in a sober community that doesn't allow guests and I didn't feel comfortable telling her this

1 A. She wanted to come back to my place after date 3 but I still didn't feel comfortable telling her my situation because I didn't know her that well and we immediately start making out, no time for conversation but we do go back to her place

2. During the 3rd date, she gives me direction on what to do sexually and I didn't really understand her, her directions were largely unintelligible and not because I was doing a good job. She then says she has a "migraine" and asks me to leave. I go to kiss her on the lips and she gives me the cheek.

Other:

1. I tell her my situation the day after date 3 and apologize for not being forthcoming, telling her I've never been in the situation before; and I find that she deleted me from all social media and blocked my number.

What to do next time:

1. Be more forthcoming with girls in the future about my situation and if they have a problem with it, they're not the girl for me

2. Realize that I'll be out of my sober community soon and on my own so at least that won't be a part of the equation soon; I'll just have to let girls know I'm sober and don't drink or use anymore 

Fears:

1. I'm going to constantly wonder what exactly I did wrong and how I can fix it

2. I fear I may try to reach out to her constantly, knowing she clearly doesn't want to talk to me.

Just had to get that off my chest.
