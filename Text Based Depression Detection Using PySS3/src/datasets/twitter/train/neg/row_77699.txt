Not doing wellUsed to be, I'd talk openly about my mental health. But back then no one cared and I never realized how much easier that made talking about it. Now I have people in my life who do care and I haven't been able to open my damn mouth. People care and would come help me if I just asked and I cant tell them I'm suicidal. I live alone so it would be easy to do without being interrupted. But I havent told anyone I'm this deep in. Maybe this time I don't want to be stopped? Idek
