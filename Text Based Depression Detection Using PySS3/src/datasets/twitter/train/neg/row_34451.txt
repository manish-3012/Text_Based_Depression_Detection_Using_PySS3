I'm ready but i don't know how to go...I've  decided it's time. After 25+ years of depression in my 39 years being  on this planet i think i gave it a fair shot. I've been ready for a  while now. The problem is that i don't know how to end my life.

I  live in the Netherlands so guns aren't an option. The only high  building in my city is pretty much jumper proof since too many people  went there to jump. I don't have my own place and stay at a friend so a  method where i commit suicide at "home" may get my friend in trouble.  Besides that, seems like a shitty thing to do to one of the few friends i  have.

I'm not sure what i expect from this, maybe there is someone out there having the same dilemma.

Anyway, thanks for listening
