Trying to sleep is so much fun...It's funny how fast I can switch from totally tired and exhausted to extremely awake...
As soon as I`m in my bed I start to think about to many things, it doesn't matter if I'm exhausted and had not enough sleep the past days.

Those thoughts keep me up for many hours, tried to ignore them and listen to music bit nothing helps. 

Now again, I went to bed two hours ago, totally tired and now I'm far away from sleep.
The whole time I'm thinking about killing my self, how I should do it and when I'll finally gonna do it.
