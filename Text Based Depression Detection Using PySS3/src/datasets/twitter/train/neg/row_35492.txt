What's wrong with wanting a permanent solution to a temporary problem?In my case it hasn't been so "temporary". I've been struggling with suicidal thoughts for five years already. I have loving parents, I'm attending medical school, according to some standards I've hit the lottery of life. Well, I'll be completely honest and tell you that I feel like I drew the short end of the stick. Everyday I feel like a failure, I feel miserable being surrounded by people I dislike, I am tired of living in a perpetual state of anxiety and panic and cramming my head with hundreds of pages of information on a weekly basis and probably for life. "Do something you enjoy" Do people even understand that depression makes you unable to enjoy things you used to enjoy? "Then take some time off school or drop out of medical school altogether" I already tried taking some time away from academia, they were the worst two years of my life. Believe me, if I drop out of medical school, I will default to a NEET. If I had lots of money, I would've dropped out already. But my parents will need me when they grow old because they don't have stable jobs. So I need to become a successful member of society to make them proud and pay them back for all the bullshit they've went through just to raise me. But at the same time I wish I could just switch my brain off and stop having to worry about 10000 things at the same time. I'm a solidified mass of depression, anxiety, panic, regret, and stress.
