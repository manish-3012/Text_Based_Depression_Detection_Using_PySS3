I am almost readyIâ€™m just so tired. Iâ€™ve struggled with depression for 5 years and with the breakup with my physically abusive ex in January Iâ€™m just exhausted. I always told her I wasnâ€™t going to happy until one of us died and itâ€™s been 8 months since our breakup so I guess Iâ€™ll finally do it. I lay awake every night thinking of suicide of the blackness Iâ€™ll finally get to have or Iâ€™ll think about killing my her which makes me hate myself even more. Iâ€™m in therapy and itâ€™s so hard and itâ€™s not helping. All of my friends are starting to slip away because Iâ€™m sure Iâ€™m boring when they â€˜check in on meâ€™ and Iâ€™m still sad. Iâ€™ll open up I just donâ€™t have anyone anymore. No one cares. Iâ€™ve already wasted a fourth of my life so I donâ€™t even know what the point is. Iâ€™ve been starving myself on and off since January so hopefully Iâ€™ll just have a heart attack and die so I donâ€™t have to buy anything to take more space up on this planet. God Iâ€™m so selfish, Iâ€™m adopted my parents expected a normal kid and they got this. A kid who doesnâ€™t even want to be here.
