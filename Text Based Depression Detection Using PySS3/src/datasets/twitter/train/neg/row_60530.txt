If I do not get over my trauma does that mean I am weak?I do not have the financial oppurtinity to give money to a psychologist (Someone mentioned that I should look for psychologist in my college, my college is small and there is no such thing.) And I have been looking for some therapies especially the CBT. Yesterday I had pretty bad nightmares from my ptsd and went to sleep at 2 am something. My biggest problem is whining, despite downloading many self improvement apps on my phone I do not improve much and constnantly whine about the past. I feel like my past would haunt me until the traumatic experience repeats but this time I "win" by my own standarts, because in my life my experience is that I never could manage or control other people's behavior so I had to ask authority to make them stop and stop being hostile towards me, who suffer from intense anxiety and cry a little too much, since people are dumb and think this is weak or wrong. I tried many pills and apps to control my emotions - constant crying and anger issues but nothing helps much, if I am not depressed,numb I still feel them and overflow them and it sucks that I have to change my entire being and not some parts of my self (flaws) cause some people are predatory morons. I am tired of my past defining me and living in it and it taking away my now. I want to live in the now but do not know how.
