ventthis is just going to be incoherent rambling because i donâ€™t want to annoy anybody i know irl. i feel so suicidal. i feel so much like giving up. the only thing keeping me from doing it is the idea of my family and friends thinking it was their fault. i hate myself more than ive ever hated anyone. i hate my ugly fucking face and my inhuman body. i hate that my passion is ridiculous and impractical and iâ€™m never going to work a job that isnâ€™t minimum wage shit. i hate that iâ€™m so selfish and vain and canâ€™t stop being that way for some reason. i hate my home and how disorganized and messy and gross it is and i hate myself for being too lazy and depressed to do anything about it. i hate that people love and care about me because theyâ€™re wasting their time on someone dumb and worthless. i wish to god i could get seamlessly killed in a car accident or something so that nobody in my life could blame themselves for me being gone and i canâ€™t dare to do it myself.
