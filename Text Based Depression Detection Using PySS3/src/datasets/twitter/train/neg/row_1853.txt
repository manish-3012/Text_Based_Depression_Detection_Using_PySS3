Iâ€™ve tried to reach outI have tried countless times telling friends that Iâ€™m not happy and havenâ€™t been for a long time. I have had suicidal thoughts for about 5 months and like a month or two ago told my best friend that I wanted to kill myself. All he said was kinda â€œouch.... Idk what to sayâ€ but not really put like that. He just said thatâ€™s not good. Birthday was a week ago. Not one of them said happy birthday to me. Iâ€™ll never find the girl that I need to pop in my life. I gave up a few years ago trying to get with girls. Always rejected, called ew and just never gonna try again. Iâ€™m so broken dude and nobody cares. I hid it for 11 months before anybody knew, and even when I tried to open up they just donâ€™t care. Fuck.
