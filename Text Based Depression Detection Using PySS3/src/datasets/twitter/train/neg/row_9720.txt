Wanting to end itSo here is my deal. Im currently 18 one year removed from high school. In high school I battled major depression on and off mostly on. I didn't dare tell a soul about it. I think about killing myself all the time because of what I think in my mind. The worst part is I can't even control it. Like this shit I think about is so fucked up that I'm not even going to say what is is but trust it is bad enough for to want to kill myself. I have no idea what to do because now I'm finally not battling depression but know this shit keeps happening. I like living but the shit that comes into my mind is just unbearable. I just want it to stop. Can someone help me
