Ready to end itIâ€™ve got what I need in my hand. It smells a little like dryer sheets, since it was sitting in a box with some. I have The Simpsons on in the background (â€œyou only move twiceâ€). I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m hesitating, other than that Iâ€™m a coward. I mean itâ€™s a good episode but Iâ€™ve also seen it about a million times.
