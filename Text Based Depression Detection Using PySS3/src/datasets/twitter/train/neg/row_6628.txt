Is it normal to think about it?Is it normal to consistantly think about suicide? I mean, I don't consider myself capable of making such a selfish decision (that being said, I am in no way saying i'm better than those who think about it, nor do I look down on those who think about it or go through with it. I don't know how to explain without sounding like a douche, and for that again one million apologies.)

But on to the rant. Im deleting this in the future.

I constantly find myself feeling empty, like why am I putting forth so much effort? I have a good life, good paying job, going places my future seems bright but I always dig myself a pit. Once I'm deep enough I always wonder, why am I putting so much effort? I hate myself. I hate my image. I hate everything.

I have no SO, but even so, I dont want anyone. I don't care for being affectionate. I find it harder and harder to walk around with a fake face. I hate lightly stepping over peoples emotions always trying to find the right or most comforting thing to say. I find it also hard to understand people, like most people I know have the most mediocre problems that are easily solvable with common sense. But because I'm a "good person" I don't flat out call them idiots or pry when they are clearly making the wrong choices.

What is wrong with me? I recently started to sober up because of my waist getting bigger. But now I'm miserable because I crave liquor even more. (I only drink on the weekends) and even so, I used alcohol as an escape from my mental state.

What is depression? I feel needy in asking if I am depressed. Is this depression? Does feeling worthless constitute being a depressed sack of useless shit? Why am I so good at keeping it in, in public but when I'm alone it crawls up and starts thinking that suicide is a reasonable option?

Does anyone else feel like this? I can't be the only one. Is this normal?
