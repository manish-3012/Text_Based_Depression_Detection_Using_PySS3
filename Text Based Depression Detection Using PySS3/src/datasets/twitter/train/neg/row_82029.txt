Best friend had to stop his SO from jumping off a bridge last week. He leaves for another country for ten days this week. How should we support his wife during this time?My friend's wife is a bubbly and energetic person who came from a violent and abusive family. They're far from home now and have a fairly strong but somewhat spread out social group. I've known them for about a year now and we all quickly hit it off (my partner is her best friend, he is my best friend). 

She has fairly strong PTSD from her upbringing and has dissociative disorder, so one day she'll be suicidal and the next day she'll wake up singing. This has been an obvious strain for them and things are hard.

He has to leave for an important and long-planned business trip this week and we're worried about what to do when he's gone. He stopped her from jumping off a bridge last week and she has a week break from her obligations starting this week, giving her a dangerous amount of free time to be contemplative.

She's been upfront and rather deadpan about the whole ordeal with my partner and reached out to another close friend of hers about it as well. I don't know the best way to get her through the week. We live about 2km from their residence and I work a couple blocks from it. 

I was thinking about having her have lunch with me a few times that week and offering our air mattress so that she wouldn't need to be alone. I could try convincing the husband to skip the business trip, but the wheels are in motion and I'm not sure that it would actually happen. I don't know, we just need some advice. My partner and I work on different schedules so we could "flood her with friendship" if we needed to, but I don't want to crowd her. I also wouldn't know how to make sure I'm aware if she ends up on a bridge again.
