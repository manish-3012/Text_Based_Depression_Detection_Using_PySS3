im so tired. 18Fi tried killing myself on sunday. (01/05) wanted to try carbon monoxide poisoning. didnâ€™t work. tried hanging myself a couple months ago. got too scared midway and stopped. iâ€™m so tired. iâ€™m so sad. so depressed. so weak. i hate myself. i try to make others happy but iâ€™m never happy. i havenâ€™t felt true happiness in so long. i forget what it feels like. i have a good life. why am i like this? im too scared to tell my boyfriend. he knows iâ€™m depressed but i dont think he knows how bad it is. it feels wrong to tell him how i feel. in my head, girlfriends arenâ€™t supposed to do that. theyâ€™re supposed to make their s/o happy. make them feel loved. not tell them theyre depressed and that they want to kill themselves. no, that wont make them happy. thereâ€™s thid deep heavy sadness in my heart. iâ€™m too scared to tell my parents. im too scared to make a therapy appointment. i know they donâ€™t want to hear that theyâ€™re only daughter is a suicidal piece of shit. i know they love me, but they scare me sometimes. because i cant always make them happy. iâ€™m so fucking dumb, always okay-ish grades when i was in school, and now that i work, i can barely do anything. i suck at my job but i only took it because i thought it would make them happy. that i have the same interest as my parent. but iâ€™m just so depressed and unhappy with life. i love the people around me, but i just cant. its so hard. iâ€™ve been depressed for so long and in these 6 years iâ€™ve only told one other person the whole thing. this person doesnâ€™t even live in the same country as me. i feel so alone even though i know iâ€™m not. i keep distancing people from me. i just want to die. iâ€™ve come to terms with it. there really is nothing much i can do because iâ€™m so weak mentally. but iâ€™m so weak that i dont want to go painfully. i thought carbon monoxide was gonna work. i hate myself. iâ€™m sorry this is so long. i just wanted to ramble.
