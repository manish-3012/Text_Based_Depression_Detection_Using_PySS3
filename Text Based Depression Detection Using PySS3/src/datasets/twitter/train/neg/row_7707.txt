Friend told me to kill myselfI attempted suicide in September. The other day, my friend and I got into an argument. Shes veru pro life. I'm very pro choice and I would get an abortion for medical reasons if I got pregmant. I tried not to talk about abortion with her but she'd always bring it up and call me a baby killer. So the other night, I told her if she can't support me in my choice for my own life, then she's not my friend. So she told me to try killing myself like I tried a few months ago.

I don't know what I expect people to say here. I just needed to vent because it really hurts. I'm not going to hurt myself just because she said so. I'm better than that. But the betrayal still runs deep...
