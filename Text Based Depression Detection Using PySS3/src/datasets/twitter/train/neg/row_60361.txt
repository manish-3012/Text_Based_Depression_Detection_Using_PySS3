I don't wanna live, but i don't want to kill myselfI can't remember the last time I went a day without considering suicide. About two months ago, i biked to the highest bridge near where I live, but physically didn't have the will to jump.

This is how it's been for about the past two years; I hate myself and want death, but I don't have the will to kill myself. Honestly, if tomorrow I get diagnosed with cancer, i'll be happy. Instead of acting on my suicidal thoughts, I just spend every day drowning in my lack of motivation. My grades have fallen dramatically (I used to be a 4.0 student, now there's three classes that I'm nearly failing), and as a result my parents have entirely lost faith in my future (as have I). My closest friends can't help me, quite a few of them are considering suicide themselves.

does anyone have any advice on how i can get the motivation to actually live?
