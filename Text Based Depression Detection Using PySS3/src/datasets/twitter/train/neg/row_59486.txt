Been a week since i tried, still nothing **trigger warning**So i tried to od on paracetamol last week. Well, up until now I'm still not feeling anything. With what i've read it, the amount i took should've been well within the no-going-back stage; but as you can see I'm still here. Very frustrated and confused. Any thoughts?
