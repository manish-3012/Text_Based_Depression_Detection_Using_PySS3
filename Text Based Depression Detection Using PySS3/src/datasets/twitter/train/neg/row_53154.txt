Today I just got fired from my job.Apparently I canâ€™t do nothing right, even though I give 110% from me every time I cant never succeed, Iâ€™m starting to think I just donâ€™t have a propuse in life, Iâ€™m not depressed neither sad, Iâ€™m just accepting my reality, I donâ€™t even have to balls to finish it all, Iâ€™m just lost in life.

I donâ€™t have nothing to live, not own family, assets or a hobby.

Maybe tomorrow I will recover or maybe not, either way i hope everyone thatâ€™s going through this type of situation get the help or the hope I never got, if i decide to go I will be sad for my families but also happy for myself.

This is not a goodbye letter i just I need to tell someone because I feel like if I tell someone I know they are going to confuse it with depression or some shit like that.
