I think I'm doneI'm a college student that's absolutely miserable. I hate everything about me and I really just want to end my life.
I have an eating disorder, I either restrict, binge and purge and just feel awful about myself.
I have difficulty concentrating and paying attention to things because of my depression and everything's just exhausting.
I've had "friends" betray me to other people, and have had those people write about how much they hate me, how I'm "two faced and manipulative" and desperate and obsessively seeking validation when I had no chance to explain myself, I wasn't told about anything privately and that person knows I have anxiety
I have trouble fitting in at school, I barely have any friends and I'm struggling with coursework because of my OCD and depression.
I legitimately feel like I'm not capable of having a loving relationship and when I think I'm better, life just piles it on like what happened with my "friends". I've had "friends" claim that they were only friends with me because they felt sorry for me and I had no other friends. I can't comprehend such cruelty. 
I'm so, so unhappy. I feel so disconnected and dissociated with everything and everyone around me, I feel like jumping off the golden gate bridge and ending my life as soon as I can. I just feel like a massive coward because I'm so afraid of the pain. I feel like I'm suffocating. I can't live anymore, I try to cling onto things from childhood that makes me happy but it has no affect because I can't FEEL anymore.
