I can't handle it anymoreI grew up and still live in an abusive household, and i still endure it every day. I've had depression for years and it started to get worse 2 years ago with a lot of deaths in my social circle, extreme loneliness and several other factors.
My depression causes sleeping problems and concentration problems, which makes it hard to study. Because of this i will probably fail my last year . My parents are hammering me down because of my grades getting worse , which amplifies my depression and thus starting a vicious circle amplifying itself. My parents will either kick me out or beat the living hell out of me if i don't succeed or both. I've got nowhere to go and i can't tell them or my friends because it will worsen the situation. I've already lost friends because of my depression.  I've tried to kill myself twice now, once by OD'ing on painkillers and my most recent attempt was cutting my wrists. My depression is getting worse and the thought of ending myself is always there. I can't deal with my situation anymore and i want to end it all. There is only 1 person who cares about me, on the other side of the world, and she would never know if i killed myself. So why should i stay here?
