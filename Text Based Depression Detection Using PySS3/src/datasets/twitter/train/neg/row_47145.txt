Why can't I be happy?I want to be happy. I want someone to love me. I want something to happen in my life. I want to have some goal. I want to care. I am so empty. I want to care. I can't do anything. I don't get why or how people have emotions. I don't get it. I want to feel things again. Whenever I something I have to hurt myself. I want a whip or cat o nine tails. I keep wanting to whip myself and my brain keeps showing them against my back. I can't do anything without thinking about how bad my body parts feel. They are so irritated. I can't do anything without having to maintain my body parts. I need so much water. All round my hands and feet. I can't leave my house. Too many germs. What do I do? The most obvious route is suicide, smallest amount of effort, least amount of skill required. I can't do anything else. I have no talents nd I dropped out of highschool. Too shitty to do anything else. I WILL fail. There isn't any other outcome.
