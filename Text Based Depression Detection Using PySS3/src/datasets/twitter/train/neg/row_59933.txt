The weather is getting warmer, the days lighter, and it makes me feel like shitI canâ€™t explain why, but I absolutely hate this right now. I just want everything to be dark. Black. I want to crawl inside a dark space and never come out. Like, I feel so shit and everything that happens to me is shit, so why the fuck is the sky so blue? Grey and rainy days make everything feel so much more balanced. I canâ€™t wait for winter to come back.
