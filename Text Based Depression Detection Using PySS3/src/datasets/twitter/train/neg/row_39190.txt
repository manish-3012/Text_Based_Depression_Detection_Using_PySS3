I just wrote my suicide note to my best friend*****, 
if you find this, that means I have left this world.
First, don't blame yourself. PLEASE. 
I know you tried your best and I love you for that. You felt like my other half. You were my best friend, my guardian, and yes, my family. 
Tell ****** not to blame himself either. 
I really did love you guys so much. 

But, I can't take this anymore. I feel like a wheel, eternally stuck. 
I feel like I'm not going to do anything with my life. Like I'm not going to be of use to this world. 

I feel like I was faking a smile everywhere I went. I felt empty, useless. 

Please, I love you. I'm sorry if killing myself is selfish, but I wanted to be free. 

Remember, I love you. 
I didn't mean to hurt you.
