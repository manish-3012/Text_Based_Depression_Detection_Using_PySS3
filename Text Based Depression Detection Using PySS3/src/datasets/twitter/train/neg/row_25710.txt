I feel like I'm drowning under my own depression.I don't even think there's another way to describe this feeling than emotionally massacred.

I've been fighting it for so long. Trying to keep my head up, trying to be that positive person in the room..... trying to hide it, trying to fight it, trying to ignore it when it's overcoming me, but the depression is like this endless tsunami that just won't let up, won't subside.

I used to be able to cover it up pretty well. But now I struggle to keep the tears in, and as soon as I'm alone, I'm an absolute mess.

I really just need an internet hug right now if you've got one to spare. This depression won't stop and it feels like I'm drowning. I need some inspiring words, kitten pictures, lame jokes... anything.
