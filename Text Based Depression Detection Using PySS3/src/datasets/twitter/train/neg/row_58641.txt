SundayI'm not even using a throwaway, which kind of shows just how apathetic I am at the moment. 

A whole bunch of shit has been happening and I'm not handling it well. I've kind of made up my mind that this coming Sunday will be my last one. It's kind of poetic really, and here are the reasons why. 

1. I was raped two Sundays ago. More info on that is in my post history. 

2. I was raised Mormon, but am no longer a member - so what better day than on the "Lord's Day"? 

I've begun the process of pushing people away, so they don't get hurt - but that is taking too long I guess. People will be hurt, but I won't be anymore. 

I already have my letters to people written, I have the means, and I even have a place for my kitty to go. It's kind of all set. I am just so fucking tired. I'm tired of being the needy bitch one moment, and the "leave me alone" lady the next. I'm tired of pretending I'm okay. I'm just so goddamn tired. I'm tired of being a bother and burden to people. If I do this - they won't need to deal with my shit anymore. 

Edit: I went to the movies with a guy tonight - and he was surprisingly understanding. Maybe I can hold out a bit longer.
