Depression and negative thoughts...I don't know if it counts as I don't think about suicide in the way that I imagine most people do.. but nearly every day I'll be doing something simple like driving and just think to myself "what if I just drove into that tree?" Or I'll think "today is the day, I'm going to crash and die today" and then I safely make it to my destination. It's pretty much a daily occurrence. I often think about how my family will react when they hear news of my body being ejected from my car when it rolled over into a tree. If it'll make life easier or harder on them. I don't know if this actually counts as being suicidal because I don't think I have the willpower to actually take my own life. I'd probably fail at killing my self too. But it's something that's on my mind daily and I felt like sharing it.
