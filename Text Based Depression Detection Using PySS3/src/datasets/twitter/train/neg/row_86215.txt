loneliness...I have nobody in my life ... none truly understands me. Everytime I think about how lonely I am, how other people have relationships and people that love and care about them it hurts so much inside I even feel it physically. I see other couples, other people with friends around them I feel horrible because there is nobody in my life...

I just wish this pain would stop I only want somebody in my life I am tired of living in this everyday pain  it hurts too much :(
