Been out of hospital nearly 3 weeksI was in hospital for a month after a suicide attempt... At the end of the month I felt a lot better, they put me on a few different meds and antidepressents and I though I was going to be better...  
But now I feel as bad as before I tried to kill myself again...  I'm thinking about it again everyday, I don't know what to do..  I was so happy when the meds took all this away I thought it was a miracle... But seems it didn't last :(
I just wrote out a plan for the next few months and I have a firm decision that If I don't feel better after I do everything in my plan... And my ex still ignores me and hates me after I do everything I plan to..
Then I'll end things then..  At least then I can say to myself I gave it everything I could.
My story is truly horrible... I plan to write it in to a book before I end things.
