I have absolutely no desire to live. I have several children and I do not want to livePer the subject.   I dont want to live.  I see too much pain and suffering in the world.  Sure, I love my kids, but I would rather die than continue the pain I endure everyday.  Every fucking day I go trough the pain of existing.  

Tried to kill myself 1+ year ago. Found out there was too much ventilation in my garage.  Saw a psychologist, he gave me drugs that did fuck all for my disposition.  Fuck it, I dont want to live.
