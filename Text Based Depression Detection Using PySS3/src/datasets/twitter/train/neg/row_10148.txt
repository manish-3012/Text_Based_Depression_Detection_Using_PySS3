Just remember...No matter what happens, I care about you. I want to hear your problems, I want to help. I think you matter and honestly, to the girls out there, you ARE beautiful and to the boys, there is a girl for you. I know what its like to be in your place. To have someone blame you for everything wrong in your life, to be told you're fat or ugly every day so you start to actually believe it. They're wrong. High school ends, College ends, eventually you have to realize to live for yourself. Not for everyone else.
