Been laying in bed crying all dayHead is spinning, getting chills. Keep dissociating or whatever, don't think anyone cares but Been just thinking about ending it for the past week. Every time I get up to do something my brain just thinks about how I could just not and die instead. Not good. I don't want to die, but I'm miserable. Tired of these mood swings. Somethings got to give I guess.
