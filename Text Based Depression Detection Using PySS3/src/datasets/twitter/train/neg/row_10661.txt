I think tonightâ€™s the nightI just donâ€™t see myself moving forward with anything anymore. I hate who I am, I hate everyone around me, I hate this fucking world. Why do so many people get to be happy and treat everyone else like shit and nothing bad ever happens to them. My life fucking sucks. I was already set up to be a train wreck of a human being after having a fucked up child hood and being physically\verbally abused since the 5th grade. Lifeâ€™s just not fair and I know it wonâ€™t get any better. Fuck everything. I donâ€™t even care enough to elaborate anymore. Iâ€™m signing off.
