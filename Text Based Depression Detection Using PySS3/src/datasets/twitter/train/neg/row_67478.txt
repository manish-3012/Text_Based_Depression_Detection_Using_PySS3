I'm so close to the edge.If my family or friends find out, it will be nothing but "You're  not thinking clearly/right in the head. You need help." or "You're sick and need to be treated against your will." or I'll be flat out institutionalized....it's been made clear to me by family that if I ever admit to considering suicide, I'll be immediately institutionalized.

I give up I want to die. I wish I could go now.
