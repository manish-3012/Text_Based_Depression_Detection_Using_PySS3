I canâ€™t do it anymoreI was happy for a while living with some roommates, but I was only there for a short amount of time as per agreement while I looked for a place of either my own or a permanent roommate situation. I wasnâ€™t able to find anyone else to move in with, and I continue to still not be able to. I donâ€™t know anyone who I can stay with while I look for any either. I canâ€™t rent an apt because of a broken lease from years ago. I was without a home once before and I canâ€™t do this again. I would rather be dead than live through this again, and I mean this. If I canâ€™t find anything in a few days Iâ€™m going to end it instead of suffering again. I canâ€™t do it and I wonâ€™t do it.
