I give up.I've tried posting to this subreddit, but i guess no one knows what to say to my previous posts. I guess that's okay--I've already given up, so trying to help me's probably pointless. I just kind of needed to vent, like i am now.

i don't want to be alive anymore. The guilt is overwhelming for wanting to die,a nd i feel stupid becaue there's probaly an afterlife anyway, and even if it were perfect i'd turn it down. what kind of lsoer moron am i , right?

i give up.
