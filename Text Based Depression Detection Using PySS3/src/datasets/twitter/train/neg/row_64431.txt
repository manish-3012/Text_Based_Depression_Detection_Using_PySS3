Do you ever imagine the futures of others because yours is non-existent or too shitty to think aboutI was in my linear circuits lecture today and the TA was teaching because the Prof was gone and the prof for that course is a very crappy teacher, while the TA is very, very good at it. The whole class gave him a standing ovation after the lecture, and I was really happy for him, he looked so happy lol. I thought to myself at that moment here's a brilliant guy with a successful career in front of him and I'm sure he'll still be teaching classes and doing a great job of it long after I kill myself and I'm gone and forgotten.
