Please dear godMercy kill me because there's just gonna be a lot of suffering for me in the future and a lot of hurt and bitterness and hopelessness. I stay alive because I can't just my family by killing myself but I pray I get a terminal illness so I die naturally, or someone shoots me or I blow up. I'm also too scared to commit suicide myself. Please.
