Tried to commit suicide a couple months ago. Thinking about trying again.Hi. I tried to commit suicide a couple of months ago. I won't talk about the method, but obviously it didn't work. I worked really hard to get everything together. Cleaned the apartment, paid the bills, laid out the notes and a copy of my financial statements and which numbers to contact. I planned it so well and I didn't succeed. I didn't tell anyone and just kind of trudged through the next weeks. The feelings are coming back now, along with a lot of anger. I feel like I went into a daze after the failed attempt and now I'm out of it. I've given myself a date to try again and I'm really scared. It's similar to the feeling I had the last time I tried. It's a weird combination of scared and at peace. Anyway, I figured no one would read this, so I just wanted to get it out. I've been spending a lot of time surfing reddit and posting random things. I thought it would be good to just get this out now. Thanks for listening.
