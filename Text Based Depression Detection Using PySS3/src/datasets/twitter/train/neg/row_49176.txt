I read the news today after a break and I don't want to keep going anymoreI feel like something very, very bad is going to happen in the near future. I have legitimate fear that things are going to get really bad.

I don't want to be alive for it because I'm a coward. My parents escaped a corrupt dictatorship to come here and be free and something feels like it's brewing here too.

I'm scared. I'm a coward. I always knew I'd be the first to off myself if I were in an apocalypse movie.
