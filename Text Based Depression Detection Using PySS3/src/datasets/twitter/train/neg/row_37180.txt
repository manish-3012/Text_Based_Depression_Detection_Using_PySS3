The strongest and scariest feeling that I ever felt.I feel ready. I've accepted that my existence is pretty much worthless and doesn't affect anyone related to me but my parents. They are the only reason I haven't tried yet. It pains me so much to read people's posts on suicide bereavement and imagine they could be my loves ones but I feel each day more hopeless and without energy to move forward. I've tried multiple treatments and have been just experiencing side effects of medications. What pains me the most is the fact that even if I try and succeed nobody would ever understand my reasons and I will just be a prick that decided to get my boarding pass to the unknown earlier.
