BirthdayWell it's my birthday. I'm turning 22, I feel like it's all just going to go downhill from here. 

I'm alone, I got ditched by friends who share a birthday with me and I just feel all around shitty. 

I just need someone to talk to. I've been thinking about killing myself for the past year and I just feel like this would be a pretty good time to do so.
