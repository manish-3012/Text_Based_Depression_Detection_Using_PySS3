Can't stop thinking about suicide by drug overdoseI have been reading about suicide methods and know that drug overdose is one of the worst ways to go. It's a torture, it takes hours and the success rate is low. 

Therefore I know my thoughts are irrational. But I keep thinking about overdosing on my medication and mixing them with alcohol. Can someone persuade me what a bad idea it is?

Having said that, I hate myself for being still alive after thinking about ending everything for so long.
