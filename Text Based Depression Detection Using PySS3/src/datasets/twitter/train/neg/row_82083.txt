Is it just me or is most social interaction fake?A lot of people on Twitter that I know preach self-care and mental health awareness/help, but in reality when confronted with someone who is mentally unwell, they completely ghost that person and avoid them.

Everyone is mostly gone from my life at this point. Honestly, Iâ€™m just waiting for something durable to hoist me up for hanging.
