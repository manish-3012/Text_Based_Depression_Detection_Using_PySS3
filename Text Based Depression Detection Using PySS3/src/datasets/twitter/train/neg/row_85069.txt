Can't get over my exWe broke up 2 years ago and I still haven't found a way to accept it or let it go. The breakup was my fault I went against her needs. I was horrible to her at times, it makes me sick. I know the usual "actions have consequences" I just can't live with my self anymore, I hate myself. I let the one person who actually have a fuck about me get away. I feel ashamed, hopeless and depressed. Once she left, I lost my degree, lost my friends because I was too depressed and have been jobless for the past 2 years. She gave me happiness I'd never known existed, I got lost in the sauce and fucked it all up just to lose everything. I can't do anything anymore, everything feels pointless, my life is on hold and all I want is her back. I'll never have even a slither of a chance if I'm in a worse place than when she left me. I can't even muster the motivation to shower anymore I go 2 weeks without showering sometimes and don't feel anyway about it. My appetite is rediculous low too, I've lost 5kg in 2019 which I just can't make sense of. All I want is her back but its too difficult to get her back and there's no guarentee she would come back if I was a better more desirable person. So the only conclusion I come to is suicide, I think about it a lot. I don't really care the pain everyone else would feel. I'm just too coward to do it atm but I know my capabilities for improvement and it doesn't look well. One day I will be less of a coward and get freedom from this life.
