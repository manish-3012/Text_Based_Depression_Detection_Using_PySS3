My dad died three years ago today. I think I'm brokenI've been thinking about suicide since I was 12 or so. As far back as I can remember, I've been pretty sure that's the way I'd die. By my own hand. I suppose on my own terms. I told myself if I ever felt like I wasn't putting enough "good" into the world, that would be the day I do it. Humans over value life, and if mine isn't good enough I should just let go. I feel like I've hit a wall.

I was doing alright till the end of highschool. Right towards the end of it, my mom started seeking divorce with my dad. Then he was diagnosed with cancer. Then they tried to keep it together, which was hell on earth. Eventually, she moved out and 5 hours away in the middle of the night. I was left to care for my dad and my younger siblings, and I don't blame her. It was brain cancer, so his memory was messed up, and it was just horribly antagonistic. He got worse and worse, the cancer spread, he lost the use of legs, he stopped being coherent, and eventually he passed. Three years ago today. My siblings eventually moved up by my mom and her new husband, because I was 19 and couldn;t afford house payments. I tried keeping college going, I tried keeping jobs, but everything falls apart.

I'm currently 22, I'm currently living with my girlfriend. I don;t know what's left fotr me. I'm unemployed, drunk, and tired of being me. I can't be better, I can't work harder, and I don;t know if there's really anything left for me. Isn't it easier to just lay down and go? To just be gone, and either celbrate with him or never feel anything again? Why do anything?
