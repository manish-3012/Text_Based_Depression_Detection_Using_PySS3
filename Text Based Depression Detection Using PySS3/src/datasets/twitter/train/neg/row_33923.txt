Losing controlI feel like I lost control about myself and my mind.
I often dont realise what Im doing the whole day, because my mind getting into an autopilot - mode.
I dont really feeling anything anymore. I forgot how joy feels and I dont have anything I really care about.
I dont really care if gonna die today or tomorrow or in  1 week. But sometimes Im becoming conscious about  this mental state of beeing autopilot and doing nothing about it.
