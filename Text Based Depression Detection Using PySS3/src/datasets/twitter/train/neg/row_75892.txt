I get itI donâ€™t think I have depression just a shit ton of self hate. Iâ€™m never gonna be good enough and Iâ€™m just a disappointment. Iâ€™m a loser and itâ€™s always been shoved up my face my whole life. School is what hurts me the most. Iâ€™m only okayish when Iâ€™m not in public. I hate people because I fucking hate myself. I wanna â€œbetterâ€ myself but I think Iâ€™ve tried too many times. I donâ€™t get why living is worth it
