I have no hopeI have chronic fatigue syndrome with comorbid depression, ADHD, and bipolar disorder. Iâ€™m dependent on amphetamines to do anything and I need higher doses of them than I am prescribed. The comedowns are, well... letâ€™s not even go there. Iâ€™ve tried living both on and off amphetamines, and life doesnâ€™t seem worth living either way. Itâ€™s just that when Iâ€™m on them Iâ€™m destroying my body for the sake of being able to function (am in first year of university, will fail if I donâ€™t use them. And when I run out of my monthly script I must switch to rcs or oral meth to continue to function). Thinking of just ending it because Iâ€™ve very much searched for hope to no avail. I really do try a lot, I work out, do cardio, and have a healthy diet. Nothing helps. Sometimes I feel like Iâ€™m crawling in my skin trying to stay awake, undergoing what seems to be literal pain (this especially happens in class). The only way to make it a little bit better is to be in bed, even if its day, even if Iâ€™ve already slept 10 hours. Iâ€™ve seen several doctors, psychologists / therapists, and psychiatrists. Iâ€™ve been on an SSRI which made it worse, bupropion which I didnâ€™t feel, and the only thing that helps is high doses of amphetamines (well, first lower doses helped, for about a year. But not anymore). Worst part is, nobody understands me, not even my parents. My parents were awful and my sdad was emotionally abusive to me my entire life. I never felt appreciated or good enough, I was always treated like an awful person. Outcast in school for being weird, and teachers made me feel like me uncontrollably falling asleep was my fault. Throughout childhood I felt like all my symptoms were my fault. Even some doctors canâ€™t seem to understand. My parents, and the rest of people it seems just think itâ€™s a matter of â€œtrying hard enough.â€ So really, whatâ€™s the point?
