day by day it's more impossible to copeI'm incapable of feeling joy or happiness, the only things I feel are melancholy and despair. Even if my life weren't awful, it wouldn't matter because the only positive emotions I ever feel are when I make dumb jokes to cover up the pain. I'm utterly alone, not because no one is around, but because I can't connect to other human beings in any meaningful way. My life so far has been nothing but constant pain that ebbs and flows, sometimes it subsides but it never really goes away. If I can't get this sorted out by the time I'm 30 (not that far away), I'm just going to end it.
