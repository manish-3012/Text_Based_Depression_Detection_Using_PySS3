How to help/get help for suicidal girlfriend?Hi, new to reddit. I hope someone can help and that this is the right forum. 

Me and my girlfriend are both 20 years old, together 7 years. My girlfriend is homeless and living in a shelter, barely scraping by with her severely disabled mother and I fear her suicidal jokes and mentioning have gotten too frequent and dangerous. Over the course of a year she went from joking "kill me now"-- to saying she wants to die but could never hurt herself as she is afraid for her mother and too religious to risk going to hell-- to now tonight saying she feels she might just snap one day soon and do something without thinking. What do I say?

She has paranoia that a therapist will keep records of her or take pictures of her and post them somewhere public where the world can see her records. Even if she would agree to go for help, she cannot afford therapy or medecine. I could convince her with time, but does anyone know of any more long-term resources for a homeless person without any income or insurance? I will provide phone numbers for suicide hotlines and call police if she is in imminent danger, even though it would leave her mother unable to fend for herself in any way. I'm just desperately researching now for more help.

I am unable to bring her and her mother into my house as I still live with my parents, grandparents, and 3 young siblings in one small apartment.


If this is in any way violating rule 3 by asking for specific advice,  sorry.
