2020 is going to be rough for a lot of peoplePeople never really gave a shit about depressed people to begin with, but now they REALLY don't give a shit lmao. If you're white and depressed/suicidal, you just shot to the back of everyone's "who gives a shit?" line. Good luck getting any sort of sympathy or therapy or even an acknowledgement of your existence.

Not to mention the millions of americans who are missing rent/mortgage payments. The millions who don't have jobs to return to after quarantine because of budget cuts or companies closing down completely.

Suicides in the US were about 50k a year and slowly rising for the last few years. There's no way we don't hit 6 figure suicides this year
