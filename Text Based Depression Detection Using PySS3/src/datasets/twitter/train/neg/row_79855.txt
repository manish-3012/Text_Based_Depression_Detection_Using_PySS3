i was closethe guilt weighs so much on me and it's eating me alive that i had to get it out somewhere that people could respond to, but not know who i am.

last month, i bought 2 boxes with the intention of using them as part of the plan to kill myself. there's 2 parts to it, but i haven't obtained the second part, but earlier this month it got so bad one night that i opened a box with the intention of "fuck it, i'll just go ahead and die since i won't be found anyways." i didn't carry out with it because i've also had nightmares of my friends and anyone living nearby finding me dead and they're the last people i want to find me. i don't want to be the reason why someone suffers. i don't want them to see my cold, dead body. 

but because i didn't carry out with my plan that night, i'm still painfully alive when the last thing i want is to be alive. i don't want to wake up every day as a disappointment. i don't want to wake up to do anything. i just want to sleep forever. i don't want to be a burden, i don't want to continue being fake happy, i don't want to pretend that everything's perfectly okay when the truth is that nothing is okay, there's nothing for me in this world, i'm not fit to be an adult, i'm not fit for any job, any place, or any position here. i can't do anything, nothing feels right. everyone talks about being in that perfect place where they're meant to be but i can't feel the same. i'm trapped, trying to escape, but everywhere i escape to doesn't help. it makes things worse and i'm getting the reality that...i don't belong here and i'm better off dead. so why did i close the box? why did i choose to not die that night? why am i still holding on?
