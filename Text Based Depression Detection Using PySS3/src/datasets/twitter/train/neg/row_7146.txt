just attempted, but failedme and my family was about to go somewhere today so i saw this as my chance to be a stubborn brat and do everything i can in my power so they will go without me, leaving me alone to get money and buy sodium nitrite and all the important drugs to OD on. but being a incompetent fool i left the house and came back 2 times just because i hadn't researched properly as to where the shop that has sodium nitrite is (it doesn't help that i don't speak the language of where i live) and now im just tired and miserable because by now the shops would have closed by now. im just hoping they won't notice anything being off but it still makes me anxious af. i saw this subreddit as a place to vent and i guess im doing that right now. ill still get my chance sooner or later so as long as they don't figure ill find a out of this life so i guess there's a silver lining somewhere
