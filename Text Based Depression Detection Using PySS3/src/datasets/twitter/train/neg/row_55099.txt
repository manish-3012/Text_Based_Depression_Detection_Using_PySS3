Iâ€™ve always lurked here but never postedSo I figured I might as well vent to some strangers because I feel like a burden on anyone else. Plain and simple, I just donâ€™t want to be here. But I donâ€™t want to hurt my family or my boyfriend. He knows my reddit, but I donâ€™t think he ever really checks my social medias much so he probably wonâ€™t see this.

I donâ€™t know what my purpose is in life. Iâ€™m basically taking up space and doing nothing valuable with my time. Iâ€™m 25f, Iâ€™m not working right now, and I havenâ€™t gotten my license yet because it scares me. I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m doing with my life.

Iâ€™m a burden to everyone around me. Iâ€™m helpless, pathetic, probably even a coward because I donâ€™t have the courage to just leave this earth. I just canâ€™t because I know how much people would be hurt, but at the same time I have this thought in the back of my mind that maybe theyâ€™d be better off without my miserable presence in their lives.

Itâ€™s easy to fake happiness, at least for me. But sometimes I bottle these feelings in for too long and they come out the wrong way, I can be a huge dick head and hurt peoples feelings when I donâ€™t want to. 

Iâ€™ve disliked myself for as long as I can remember. I donâ€™t like what I see in the mirror. I compare myself to other people a lot. This alone has just been enough to make me want to die. My boyfriend always says Iâ€™m perfect for him, but when I look at myself I always think there are so many things about the way I look I should improve.

I have this stinging sadness in my chest everyday. I wish it would just go away, but I donâ€™t know how to make it. This whole pandemic and the uncertainty of the future is amplifying my sadness and I dunno what to do anymore. I wish medically assisted suicide was allowed. I wish me leaving wouldnâ€™t hurt anyone. I wish I didnâ€™t have to feel this way anymore. 

My heart goes out to each and every one of you feeling so much pain lately. I hope we all find out how to be happy, or even just â€œnormalâ€. Whatever that means.
