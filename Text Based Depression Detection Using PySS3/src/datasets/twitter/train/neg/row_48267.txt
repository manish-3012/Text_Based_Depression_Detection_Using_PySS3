I posted here before. I am still aroundI dont know what to do anymore. My new medication isn't taking any of these feelings away. I honestly dont even know if this is treatable depression. My life is going nowhere. I'm 25, I am terrible at and hate my job, my wife and I do nothing but grow further and further apart, I have no friends as I have driven away everyone out of my life, and I have no relationship with any of my family. I feel so alone in my head every day just replaying these feelings over and over with no one to talk to. The only singular reason I haven't killed myself yet is because I am the sole provider for my wife. It isn't even out of love at this point I just know if I committed suicide the insurance money wouldn't even be enough to keep her afloat. I cant afford therapy and I dont qualify for any sort of assistance. My boat is sinking and I have nowhere to turn to.
