You know itâ€™s gotten bad when you actually hope there isnâ€™t an afterlife to remember any of the painItâ€™s been 7 years now of surviving this, but the thoughts grow ever more present by the day. This pandemic sure hasnâ€™t helped make me feel useful. Sitting here endlessly job searching to get back into my career, another relationship gone completely confused as to what happened, had to move in with a family member, so far behind at 28. I just canâ€™t see much reason to keep fighting anymore and i feel like Iâ€™ve finally lost this battle.
