Stuck in placeItâ€™s difficult to move on and be fully functional in my life and in my future plans when suicide always seems like a secret back up plan. 

Iâ€™m 22, feeling a little behind in some aspects of my life, and canâ€™t seem to get out of a rut. Feeling very stuck right now. Had to take the semester off, canâ€™t add to my savings currently, and on the rocks with my partner. I love them and I donâ€™t want to lose them. 

What are some coping mechanisms I can utilize to ensure that I am still moving forward even when things seem lost in the fog?
