One way out I guessFor the past week or so I've just been so dull. I tried choking myself several times already. I have no motivation and it's so fucking hard to get out of bed now. I keep on missing class because of it. I'm so fucking anxious about Eveyrthing these days and I feel like everything's falling apart. My mom keeps telling me I'm ugly and stupid and lazy and to stop being childish. I can't get a fucking job or can't even get out of my room a lot of the time. I basically stopped eating and I've started to cut again. I feel like all my friends are leaving me or ignoring me and quite frankly I think I deserve that. My family says I'm a shit person always yelling at me mocking me when I get scared of their loud noises. I haven't cried so fucking hard in so long like I did today. I'm not sure what to do man. I feel like there's one way out of this and quite frankly I think it's better this way.

I hope this fucking works goodbye
