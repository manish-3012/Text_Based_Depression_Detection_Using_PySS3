GoodbyeThis is probably going to become a throw-away account, possibly my last vent before i littitimatly decide to throw myself off a bridge. I cant take it, ive been suicidal since i was 9, i understood it, i self-harmed... i fifnt want to be here because i hated myself and i was tired of everything around me.

But now i am at peace, no longer in pain, locked in the bathroom while my friends text me endlessly about how im "ignoring" them, but in reality i dont have the confidence to even say a word to them knowing it might as well be my last.

Ive planned it all out, this is just a way of dying, knowing somebody noticed, and i feel cared about and worth it for the last few seconds i can ever memorize.
