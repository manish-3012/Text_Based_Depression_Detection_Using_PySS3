Goodbye to a WorldAmy. I donâ€™t know what to say other than I am so sorry I did this to you. Please know I love you more than anything in this entire world and I feel horrible for this. I need to be at peace. For years I have struggled and struggled and the pain has only grown worse. I will miss you so much. Iâ€™m finding it incredibly hard to put into words how much you mean to me and I am so sorry for this. I wish I could just move past the darkness in my life and live happily ever after with you, and in spirit I will. I will always be beside you. In the toughest of times I will be right there holding your hand. I know youâ€™re crying right now but please donâ€™t. You are strong and will find your place in life no matter what happens. You always have and you always will. I love you so so much. Take care of Henry for me.
