Advice please. â¤ï¸Hello. My names kayra. I'm 14 years old and in my second year of high school, my friend committed suicide and I have no freaking idea what to do with myself. She passed away little over three months ago, and I'm a mess. I get counselling once a week, I'm on anti depressants and I constantly ask my self what if I had said something to her or told her that we loved her, would she still be here? Would she be okay? Would she see how many people truly care and adored her. I miss her everyday and the thought of never seeing her ever again brakes my heart and I don't know how to comprehend and understand the fact that she's never coming back. I couldn't go to her funeral either and I regret that everyday. I keep having dreams about her and I keep seeing her lifeless and it causes panic attacks and suicidal thoughts. I wish I could just see her once again, I really don't know what to do or how to deal with this. Can someone please just help me.
