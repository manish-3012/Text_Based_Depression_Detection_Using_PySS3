Who wants a ride on the rollercoaster?Yep. Here I am, in this subreddit for obvious reasons. I hate it all. I'll give you the quick stuff: parents were extremely manipulative and abusive, not anymore though. I am 23, graduated from college in May with a degree in math. Had to move back here because I can't seem to find a job. Loans come due in a couple weeks. Have enough to pay for a couple months and then I'm dry. I got a broken foot too, so no temp jobs or anything that requires functioning on 2 legs.

Don't have any friends. Parents don't give a shit about their faggot son, I only keep in touch with one person besides them and he is in no way able to support me emotionally, no fault of his, some people don't have the tools. Maybe someone here will. Does. Something like that. 

All I do is drink and apply for jobs but neither of those things seem to be getting me anywhere. I'm so alone. If I were to do myself in, no one would notice. All my friends from high school went to different colleges, all keeping in contact with each other and retaining the friend groups, sans me. Never met anyone in college that stuck. Phone goes for days without a text, or anything. 

It's so humiliating. Having nothing and no one. I try to drink it away but I can't. So I resolved to buy a gun with the little money I have before the loans eat it up. Pop one, go out messy. Maybe the guy who has to clean it up will tell someone about what I did, maybe I'll live on in some way. No one will miss me. No one remembers me alive. No one loves me, and why should they? Who can love someone they don't even know exists? 

I even picked out the spot. I'm going to do it in the old culvert by the pond in the park in the neighborhood. No one will notice me for weeks. But that won't be much of a change.
