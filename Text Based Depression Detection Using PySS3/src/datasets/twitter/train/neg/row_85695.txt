Iâ€™ve never fit in, never close to anyone, then I met the love of my life, we broke up 3 years ago, together for 11, and Iâ€™m still stuck. No one likes me. Iâ€™m not a typical woman, and being a lesbian is harder than you think. I just want to fucking die already. I am not made for this society.No one cares anymore. Itâ€™s like I died anyways.
