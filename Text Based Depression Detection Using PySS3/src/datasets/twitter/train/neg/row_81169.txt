I need your helpSo Iâ€™m having a hard time with women and itâ€™s making me suicidal. Iâ€™m on the medications lithium and Latuda and Iâ€™m wondering if this has an effect on how you emotionally reciprocate with people, because at one point I was actually kinda good with girls. If this is the case then wow, itâ€™s amazing how psychiatry can fuck your life over. 

Also I was wondering why doctor assisted suicide isnâ€™t legal is the US. Is it legal in Europe? Iâ€™ve been in some wickedly dark places recently where there seems to be no solution and the isolation and separation of reality between me and others seems to grow wider. 

If I had the option of doctor assisted suicide that would be pretty nice even if I had to go to another country.
