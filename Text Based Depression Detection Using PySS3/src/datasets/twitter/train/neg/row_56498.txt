Not sure how to get helpHey guys,

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm feeling a bit stuck on who to reach out for help to. I've been feeling suicidal for these past few months. 

I've tried reaching out to friends but as I'm quite shy and introverted  I don't have much to choose from. My former best friend basically cut contact with me  for a month after I confided that I'd been having panic attacks and trouble sleeping. Many of my friendships are based on me being the listener and the caregiver. It's funny because I used to feel assured because I have always helped people in need that should I ever need help there'd be no problem, needless to say that's certainly not the case! Honest to god if I felt there was any friend that I coud trust to reach out to I would.

As far as family goes I'm an only child, my mom passed away a few years ago and my dad has actively encouraged me to kill myself and is well aware of past attempts. If I confessed to him the politest response I could expect is rolling his eyes.  I grew up far from extended family so I wouldn't even have their numbers to call.

I saved up and started seeing a therapist but accidentally left her card at my dads and he made an app with her to quiz her about what I'd said about him and to complain about me. This might sound stupid but opening up to a therapist was a big deal to me. My parents drummed into me to NEVER reveal anything about them or anything that happened at home to anyone else - this ranged from being berated for weeks as they overheard me excitedly tell a friend as a child that I had been to the cinema (I genuinely haven't a clue why things like this were an issue) to not being permitted to confide in anyone when my mom got cancer. I've been depressed for years, during my teen years my parents and said therapy wasn't an option as they were afraid that a therapist would turn me against them. With her illness I couldn't discuss it with my parents and was forbidden to speak of it with anyone else. In hindsight I was so dumb not to reach out to someone as they feared outside judgement far more than they cared about me but I was naive I guess. The thoughts of going back to that therapist after the issue with my dad is not an option. The trouble is I find a lot of therapists don't really want to take on a severe case, Ive been turned away once before from a therapist that didn't deal with suicidal patients.

I guess my point is I'm in a bit of a tight spot. I feel in my heart if I reach out again and it doesn't go well I could really struggle to ask for help again. I'm so afraid and alone
