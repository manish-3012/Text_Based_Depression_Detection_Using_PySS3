What's the point in life anyway?They tell you that it's happiness, but they never really say what happiness is. It's just a silly concept of a perfect life that doesn't really exist. If there's one thing I learned in life it's that it fucking sucks. Nothing ever happens as you wanted it to, and even in the rare occasion that it does, it's never as good as you hoped it would be. Everyone keeps telling me that school and college is the best period of life, but school sucked and I can't imagine college being any different. If it really just gets worse, then why just not die young anyways? Why not just do drugs non-stop until you overdose or live a hedonistic life and die young, without enduring another moment of pain? I can't really think of a more "happy" life in this shitty world.
