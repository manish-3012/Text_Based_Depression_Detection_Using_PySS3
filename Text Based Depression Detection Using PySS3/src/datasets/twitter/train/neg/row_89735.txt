So needyI'm such a needy piece of crap. It sounds stupid but I can't even get my ex on the phone (and it's fair if he doesn't want to speak to me I guess) but I'm so fucking needy I messaged asking if phone calls are off the table forever.
He probably thinks I'm so fucking pathetic and I'm starting to really believe that I am.

Gonna switch my phone off for a while so I don't disturb him anymore. I'm so dumb, I can't even accept that silence mean you don't want to speak.
