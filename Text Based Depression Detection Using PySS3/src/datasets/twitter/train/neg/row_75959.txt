Not sure what to do anymoreI have my brother's wedding coming up in 2019, so I have that to look forward to, but other than that.. yeah I don't know. 

I just give up, I hate the planet we live on, I hate people. People are so self centered and cruel, and I've even been guilty of it myself at times, and I hate myself too. 

I'm seeing a shrink next month, maybe he can help. I don't know. This will be the 4th time I've entered therapy since the first 3 didn't work.
