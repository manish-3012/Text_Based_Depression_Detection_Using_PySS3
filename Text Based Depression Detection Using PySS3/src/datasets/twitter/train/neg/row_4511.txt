Anyone else hate their body so much they want to die?I am so sick of being in this awful body. This body that canâ€™t forget all the terrible sexual abuse Iâ€™ve gone through. I hate my boyish body and small boobs and the fact that my husband will never be satisfied and will always watch other naked women. I work out twice a day and eat well and work so hard but I am always going to be so unattractive to myself. It kills me inside and I just hate myself so much. Thereâ€™s so much pressure to be attractive and itâ€™s not worth it. 

Obviously this is only the tip of the iceberg but itâ€™s what Iâ€™m struggling with today.
