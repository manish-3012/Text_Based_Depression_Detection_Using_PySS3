I need a gunMy entire life has been a big fuck up. When I was 6 my parents got divorced and I had to go to my dad's house where he would abuse me physically and mentally. Now I'm 14 and I'm close to falling school and have no people who care about me. People tell me it will get better but every day I get up and it gets even worse. Almost everyday I wish I was an abortion in one of my mom's periods or I die in a car crash. This is going to be my 12 attempt of suicide and I need a gun to make sure I don't survive. I have tried going to therapists but thry just make me see how I should end my life. A lot of the time my "friends" will make fun of me for my religion and I really don't blame them. I weight 180 pounds, have a stub for a penis, and hope that once I die my mom and dad will see it as a message as how terrible of parents they are. If anyone owns a gun I really need one thanks.
