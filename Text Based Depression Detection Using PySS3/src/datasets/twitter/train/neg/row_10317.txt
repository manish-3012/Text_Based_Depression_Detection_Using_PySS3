I feel like thereâ€™s no point anymorebasically the title. I donâ€™t feel shit anymore. Itâ€™s my freshman year of college and I just wanna die. I canâ€™t seem to make myself enjoy anything bc the whole time Iâ€™m thinking abt how everyoneâ€™s looking at me and how they all hate me. Every conversation I have people just ignore me, no matter what I do I feel like Iâ€™m always alone. At least if Iâ€™m dead I wonâ€™t annoy them any more. My classes arenâ€™t any better, I canâ€™t make friends and I have panic attacks every day bc I donâ€™t know what the fuck Iâ€™m doing. This is gonna sound so shitty but the only reason I havenâ€™t killed myself yet is bc I donâ€™t wanna inconvenience the people who live in my dorm haha. I donâ€™t even know why Iâ€™m posting this. I guess I just want people to know.
