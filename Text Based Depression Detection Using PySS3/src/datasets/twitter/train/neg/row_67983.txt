I'm tiredI'm not sure if I want to die, but I know I want to just stop. Take a minute, step out of my life, and stop to put my head down. I want to get out of myself and rest but I can't really do that, can I? I need to work enough to cover medical bills. I need to stay here for my husband. I need to clean. I need to pay bills. I need to keep going. 

Except I just don't want to anymore. I don't want to be in my city, except I have no choice but to be here. I don't want to be in my country, except I can't leave as we don't have the money or resources to be here. Likewise my husband doesn't want to leave his family.  I want to have a child, but I could never afford to give birth let alone take care of one. 

I just feel like little by little I'm burying everything I want under obligations, expenses and... just an understanding that *I can't do any of it.* It's no one's fault. It's just how it is. It happens to everyone. I'm not trying hard enough. I'm not doing enough.  I'm not enough and it's no one's fault really; It just happens that's how it is. I can't envision the future. I can't imagine myself in a year, let alone five. I'm just trying to get through each day and week to get to the next. 

I realize I'll have these breakdowns where I become aware of everything. I will become aware of what I want and don't/can't achieve, and I'll become sad. I'll get anxious. I'll get upset. Then I'll forget all about it and move on for another few months. 

And I guess eventually I won't be here anymore, and nothing will change when I'm not.
