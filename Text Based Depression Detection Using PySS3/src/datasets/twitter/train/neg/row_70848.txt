Don't know if I want to die or just not remember.So I'm older than 25 and younger than 35. Ever since I was in my early teens I have wanted to not exist anymore. Tried to kill myself 3 times over the years. It has gotten worse though. A couple years back someone I was engaged to slept with pretty much every friend I had (we had been together for many years and nothing like that had happened before) over a short period of time. There's more and much worse to it if you could even believe it's possible but I will leave it at that. Like I said it's been a few years since that happened and it destroyed me so much that I haven't been able to make a friend or have any kind of relationship, sexual or otherwise since. The darkness is just overwhelming at this point and I don't even know how to feel feelings. I think the only reason the first three times failed is because I'm actually terrified of how I will be portrayed when I die and the fact that I can't answer the question of what happens when I do. So here I sit next to a lead pipe wanting to bash my head in hard enough that I don't remember anything about my life but not hard enough to die because I am lost. I've tried everything. Meds. Therapy. It doesn't seem to help. I don't even believe in god and I feel like he's out to get me. I don't even know what to do. I just don't want to know anything that's happened in my life. Captcha wants to know if I'm human. Good question.
