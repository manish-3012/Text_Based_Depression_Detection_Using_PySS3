I want to be normal againI don't want to have asperger's syndrome anymore. I don't want to be gender dysphoric anymore. I don't want people to think I'm crazy anymore. I don't want to be hated anymore. I don't want to wait for the super-slow insurance company anymore. I don't want to be stupid anymore. I don't want to live anymore. I hate my life. I'm probably gonna jump in front of a train soon. A girl in my area already commited suicide that way. So can I. It's funny. Just last year, I was an intelligent straight male getting all A's and B's. Now I'm a mess.
