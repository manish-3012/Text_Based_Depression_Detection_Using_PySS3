Friends come and sadly goLast night, one of my best homies, MC, opted out. He lost his sister last year due to a car accident and three weeks ago his uncle opted out. Last night, MC opted out. We where tight. We gamed every night, went shooting on weekends, we played disc, we had lunch together and had dinner with each other's parents. 

I had no indication of his plan. He was damn near my brother and didn't speak up. We've laughed and cried together, been to hell and back and went back for the shits and giggles. His uncle and I where tight, him and I where tight, all three of us where tight. Uncle dying sucked ass but we where living and he wasn't. Living wasn't the same after uncle dying.

It's sad to see my best friend go.

If you're sad please call someone.
