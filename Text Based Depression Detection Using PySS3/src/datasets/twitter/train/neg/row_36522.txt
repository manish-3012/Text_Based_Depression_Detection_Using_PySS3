Gf just told me she slept with someone else, was already very low, but this has put me on the edge.My best friend and the person I want to spend the rest of my life with just told me that she slept with someone else. I was already very anxious and low, but never expected her to do this to me. All she ever does is tell me she loves me and wants to be with me, and she still says that now. What the fuck? How does that work? How the fuck does someone say one thing and do the complete opposite? I dont want to be alive. I am doing my best to control myself because I know that rationally I cancome out of this. I just dont want to.
