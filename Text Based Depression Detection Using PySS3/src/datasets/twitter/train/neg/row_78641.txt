What was your first suicide thought that you remember?I remember being maybe 7-8 and telling my mom that I couldnâ€™t kill myself because I would want to see how the season of my show ended.

I feel like that should have been a red flag for her I also started writing my first suicide note at like 9 

What is the first thing you remember?
