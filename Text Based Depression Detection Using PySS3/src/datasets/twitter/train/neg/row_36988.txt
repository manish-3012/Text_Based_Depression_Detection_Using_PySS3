[Vague Venting] Typing this made me feel a little better.It's been nearly two hours and I've typed and erased over and over again. My mind goes blank when I absolutely need it even for the smallest of tasks, but it's a hurricane when I want peace and quiet. I long for someone to just come along and "fix" me, but I know only I can do that. Until just a moment ago, I thought it was me versus the world, but in reality it's my own self whom I'm up against right now. A thorough self-analysis is what I need--honestly, I feel everyone needs this. But everything I [try to] do feels like an impossible battle. My energy/motivation/willpower comes in bursts, and just as quickly vanishes. If only I could make my mind up to do something as easily and adamantly as deciding not to do something. I know what's stopping me. It's irrational fear. It's that uncertainty of happiness. It's that unforgiving anxiety when I try to move forward instead of backward, but more like not moving at all. It's that wave of apathy that comes before and after each one of these. It's felt like this on-and-off for a few years, but it's become full-fledged for this past year, as I have been doing absolutely nothing (well there's the problem). I drag myself to the next day everyday in hopes that something will be different, but instead that hope dwindles little by little. I don't remember the last full day where I didn't think about suicide. I've let this emptiness shape my identity and erase my goals. I don't feel useful to the world right now. To get to the main point, I know I don't want to kill myself, because I know that potential is dormant within and I know there are so many beautiful things I've yet to experience. But when that apathy rushes over, I just cease to care about absolutely anything and it's terrifying every time I look back on it.
