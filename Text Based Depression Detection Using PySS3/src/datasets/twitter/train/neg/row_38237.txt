Attempted and rescued.I will be brief. I am 20. Medical Student. I have lost my will to live. A close friend was weird with me and we had been having arguments for 2 months and he was trying to get away from me to spend more time with his best friend who eventually caused my friendship with my friend to end. In the final argument 17 days ago, he came to my room to take me to college because I was skipping university because I wanted to avoid him. And when he came to me he asked me my expectations. Asked me what I was expecting of him. And to tell him what exactly, so we could (he could) form rules for our friendship. Boundaries. Rules. And regulations. I did not reply to his text and did not talk to him since then. And he did not bother texting me back or anything. I was about to kill myself that day. I told my family and they asked me to come back home. And I did. Then I came back after half a week and saw him outside a lecture. He came to greet me. I didn't reply and turned away. Then he didn't make contact. Neither did I. And then I saw him. And his best friend. Together in the university. And I saw his indifference. Like I didn't exist. And I did the same. I became indifferent to him. But I could not bear it for long. I was dying. And then I finally did it. I abused and pushed him in the university and his best friend too. And I was about to stab his friend with a pen. And then I went to a pharmacy and got sleeping pills and ate them. But got saved because a friend panicked and told everyone. And now I don't know what to do.
