I want it all to endIâ€™m an autistic 20-year-old with depression and anxiety. The reason why Iâ€™m here is because the world has gone to shit. People are dying from COVID, climate change is becoming an irreversible problem, poor people are getting poorer, and governments arenâ€™t doing shit. I keep thinking about ways to kill myself because thereâ€™s no hope for me. My parents understand me but are too optimistic. How do people think all this is ok? Are we becoming sociopathic?
