Need to tell somebodyI don't know if i'm just being melodramatic, I'm sure there are people here who deserve help and attention more than I do. 
But I feel I at least need to type this(God knows I cant tell anyone)

For a while now, probably 2-3 years, I have been growing really apathetic towards things. But I have my moments of sadness. 

It just seems as if I don't really matter I kinda just fade into the background, no one has ever really asked me how I am doing. Hell, I haven't been given a hug or any sort of compassionate contact in well over 5 years.

just yesterday was probably one of the worst nights of my life. I stood on a bridge for 20 mins just contemplating jumping. The only thing that stopped me was that I would inconvenience my parents with funeral costs. I ended up crying myself to sleep again that night. 

I don't care if anyone sees this or not, it's just nice to finally express it in some way.
