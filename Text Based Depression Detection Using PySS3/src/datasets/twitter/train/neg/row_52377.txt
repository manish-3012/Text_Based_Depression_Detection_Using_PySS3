Rejected and unsureI recently got rejected by my crush after confessing my feelings to her. She did it in the nicest way possible and we talked like normal human beings (both 16 yo). At first it didnt hurt but that was 4 days ago and now it starts to kill me. I thought about going to sleep forever before but the thoughts get louder and louder. I have some things that still keep me in this world but i feel so much emotional pain that i am pushed close to the edge. I dont know what to feel. She basically rejected me because she doesn't really know me, but my anxiety keeps me from talking and socialising with her. I am 16 and from Germany and i thought i should share my story here, maybe ill update this post.
