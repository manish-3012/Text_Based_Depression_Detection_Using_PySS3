I just feel depressed and lostThere are days in my life where i just feel useless and lately i've felt like my life isn't real and i don't know why i feel this. I've tried to cope with drugs and just this year i was smoking about half a pound of weed a month. I thought that it would help but it didn't. I don't really know what to type here but my life feels meaningless. I have attempted suicide twice now, with my second attempt landing me in the hospital again and then ended up in a mental hospital just a few days from my birthday.The odd thing was that i actually enjoyed myself there during my last day. I had cuts on my wrist and i had to wear bandages for a few weeks until the cuts healed and all throughout those weeks people at school would ask me what they were for and obviously they knew but i never said anything. I just started community college again after failing misriably at my old college which was up in northern california, I just recently moved back home from there after certain situations forcing me to move there for a time, and Im sorry for all the rambling i just don't know what to write about since i just feel so depressed and anxious lately. My hands actually shake sometimes because i'm  so anxious at times. My memory lately is shit and the smallest things get me so angry idk why.
