Fuck itThe anniversary of my girlfriend dying is on sunday. I have had 10 other friends die in the past 3 years. What's the point anymore? I tried to go out and have a good time tonight and the girl I tried to be with after struggling for 4 years form my gf dying tells me I am a piece of shit and I am worthless. She is probably right. I am about to graduate college. But all I can think about is my gf and friends that won't be here graduating with me. Fuck it. Fuck everything.
