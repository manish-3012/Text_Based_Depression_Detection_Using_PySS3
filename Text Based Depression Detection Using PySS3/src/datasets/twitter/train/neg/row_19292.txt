I donâ€™t hate myself at all. I think Iâ€™m a good person, but I want to die.I feel as though thereâ€™s no helping me, as every person Iâ€™ve talked will try to give me a talk about how Iâ€™m a good person who deserves to be here. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m bad at all and think I do deserve to be here, I just donâ€™t want to. Iâ€™ve been through really bad shit, and turned out to be nice and caring. But Iâ€™m still depressed as fuck and I still donâ€™t want to be here. I donâ€™t think of myself as a burden or anything of that sort, I just donâ€™t like the life Iâ€™m living and it has always been that way. I mean always. So Iâ€™ve seen a few therapists, but itâ€™s always only made it worse. I can tell that theyâ€™ve all gotten to points where they genuinely donâ€™t know what to do for me anymore. After some of the sessions start to go nowhere, I just stop seeing them and try a new one, but have the same outcome. Iâ€™ve tried a handful of medications too, but nothing has helped. The only thing keeping me from ending it right this second is not wanting to hurt people around me. Iâ€™m just waiting to die and subtly taking worse and worse care of myself. The closest I got was giving myself a kidney infection and I was hoping for sepsis to set in, but my partner caught on to me not feeling good and made me see a doctor and made me take antibiotics. I just want it to look like an accident because Iâ€™ve seen what suicide does to the people in their life. Every night I go to sleep, I hope with all of my heart that I wonâ€™t wake up.. just to be disappointed when my alarm clock goes off. Though lately, suicide has seemed a lot more enticing. Maybe itâ€™s all the time I get to think because of quarantine. Iâ€™ve got a lot of alcohol in my possession at the moment and want to drink myself to death because I canâ€™t keep going for other people. It doesnâ€™t feel good. It sucks really bad actually. I need to think about whatâ€™s best for me and I think this is it. Iâ€™m not going to be happy and I donâ€™t even want to be.
