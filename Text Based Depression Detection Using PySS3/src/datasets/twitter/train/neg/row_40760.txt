Trying to find a reason to keep on going.For the pass several years of my life I have gone through event after bad event. It started after my freshmen in college where I was kicked out because of my grades were too low because I was worried about my sister. From there it hasn't been fun, two of my sister's sisters were nearly killed, one was raped, I work a job I hate, family members continue to do things that harm the health of my grandparents. I suffer from anexity and depression with nothing ever seeming to work for long. I found a girl I fell for and she vanished, made friends who care for me but can't be there for me because what I am suffering from. When I reach out for help no one is there to lend a hand. Some people think I have no reason to feel this way but I don't know the reason why I feel so drained. 

I have been to a therapist and seemed to only take two steps back, I have taken medication and now it seems not to be working. I reach out for help and no one is there. I have tried self harm and the only feeling I get is I hate myself for being weak. I want to be the hero but I just can't anymore. I honestly don't know how much longer I can hold out.
