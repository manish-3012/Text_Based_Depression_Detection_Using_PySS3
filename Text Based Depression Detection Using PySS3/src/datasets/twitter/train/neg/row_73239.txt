sitting in my bed alone, cuddling a mountain of stuffed animals, I feel so empty, I just wish with all my heart I had a childhood, I wish I hadnâ€™t been beaten and raped for so long, Iâ€™m a 23 year old girl I try to give myself the childhood I never had but no parents will ever love me. I should die.I feel so alone whatâ€™s the point of me even trying anymore Iâ€™m so sad so lonely
