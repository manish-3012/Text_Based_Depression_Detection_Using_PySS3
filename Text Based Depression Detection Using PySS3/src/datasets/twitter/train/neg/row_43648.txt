I want to get betterI'm sitting in a hotel room and was seriously deciding if I should kill myself earlier today. Everything just seemed to shatter. I don't want to have moments like these anymore, I just want to be better. Every time it happens I feel like a failure and burden. 

How do I accept progress and stop expecting immediate results?

How do I talk to someone without feeling like a nuisance?

How do I not get overwhelmed? 

I am so scared I may kill myself. I don't want to hurt the people who care about me.
