i donâ€™t know what to do anymore.about a month ago, i attempted suicide. it was an impulsive decision and a pathetic endeavor. i honestly donâ€™t remember my feelings leading up to the event itself, but i do recall my tipping point. it was the stupidest fucking reason, but i donâ€™t regret that reason because i guess itâ€™s important to me. 

my experience in the er was awful. i felt trapped, as if everything was caving in on me.  i ended up lying about my mental health to the doctors, nurses, and social workers so i could be discharged as quickly as possible. 

following that attempt, everything has changed. everything that iâ€™ve tried to keep together has fallen apart. nothing makes sense anymore. i cant focus, i have no motivation, i barely eat or sleep. these have happened for months now, but theyâ€™ve worsened so much recently i donâ€™t even feel like a functioning human being anymore. i see a therapist now and iâ€™m scheduled for an appointment with a prescriber, but that doesnâ€™t help. i donâ€™t want to get better. i say i do, but thatâ€™s the biggest lie iâ€™ve ever told. nothing matters to me anymore. i just want to die. iâ€™ve constantly been thinking of dying, and i think i just might try tonight.

i donâ€™t want to reach out anymore because no one truly wants to listen or understand. iâ€™m sick and tired of my friends pretending to care. i hate how they tell me to stop being sad but then casually throw around mentions of suicide as a joke around me even though iâ€™ve told them to stop. my parents arenâ€™t much better. they say they only want the best for me but accuse me of being lazy and not trying even though for a moment, i genuinely did want to get out of this horrible position. i hate the fact that my father thinks this is just a phase, and how he tells me every teenager is suicidal for â€œa little while.â€ 

i give up at this life, and i donâ€™t know what to do with myself. itâ€™s eating me away.  the only option at this point is dying.
