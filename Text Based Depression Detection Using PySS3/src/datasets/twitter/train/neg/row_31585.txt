Almost hospitalized and my parents were told. Never been so scared of losing my freedom despite knowing it is for my safety.Told my therapist (maybe a mistake) how bad my suicidal thoughts had gotten and how I donâ€™t know if I can be safe. Her response was asking me to call my parents to drive me to the hospital. It took two hours to convince them to just let me tell my parents about my thoughts and then go home. But if I have a breakdown or get worse my parents agree I should be admitted. So terrified. I donâ€™t think I deserve a bed and donâ€™t want to lose my rights and control over my life. Yes, I know my depression is the reason I want to die, not my life, not my circumstance, but itâ€™s just getting worse. Maybe new meds will help.
