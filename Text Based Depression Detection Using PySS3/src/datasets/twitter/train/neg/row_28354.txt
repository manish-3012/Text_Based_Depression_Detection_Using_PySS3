itâ€™s late at night when nothing feels realnothing is tangible. this is the time of day when it is the easiest to struggle. free from prying eyes. i could feel okay all day and the sun will set, loved ones go to bed, the world shuts off, and itâ€™s just you. 

i wish i didnâ€™t have to do it for them. i wish i didnâ€™t owe it to myself to keep going, either. thatâ€™s the harsh truth suicidal people deal with; i was given this life for a purpose, and is that purpose to die at my own hand? it happens to people quite frequently. their lives were ultimately meant to end that way, because they did. i canâ€™t stop wondering if that is what iâ€™m meant for. i like to believe itâ€™s not true for some reason. maybe iâ€™m supposed to impact other peopleâ€™s lives and live a fully fleshed one of my own. then why was my life chosen as one of suffrage? is it a lesson to be learned? am i paying for crimes in a past life?

but none of those good things can be proven to exist when itâ€™s not right in front of me, or anyone for that matter. you can look at a picture and say it exists, but that was a moment that passed. itâ€™s gone and thereâ€™s no proof it happened in the first place. well, according to descartes, it doesnâ€™t exist at all. and maybe thatâ€™s true. but for now iâ€™ll act like itâ€™s not. and iâ€™ll do it for those i love. and maybe even for me.
