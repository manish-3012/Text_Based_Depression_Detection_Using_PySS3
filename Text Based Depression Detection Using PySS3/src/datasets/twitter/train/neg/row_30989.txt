There's no pointI'm an Atheist British teenager, and I don't see the point of life anymore. My family treat me like I'm a three year old, my dad does nothing but call me a "dunce" and a "dimwit". My lifelong group of three friends have said TO MY FACE that they only hang around with me because they feel sorry for me. The one girl I thought understood me has moved to a different continent. We were born for no reason, I live for no reason... Perhaps dying is the only reasoned thing I can do in this stupid life.
