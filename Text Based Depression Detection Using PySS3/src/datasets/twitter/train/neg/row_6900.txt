Scared of the abyssWell I'm not exactly suicidal anymore, but only for good reason. I'm extremely depressed because I am alone and have no family left. and also I just had a terrible past, abused severely as a child and a broken home I'm 18 now almost 19 and am a recreational pot smoker.( helps me cope And sleep) Well I went from being okay and at peace with the thought of death. But I realized something after I tripped way too much acid for the first time. I realized there's nothing after death and it's terrifying I looked right into the abyss and nearly lossed my mind in the process I just want to better my life now but I have awful trust issues since I was never shown love as a child only physical abuse, neglected and abandonment as a child I'm not really sure what to do.
