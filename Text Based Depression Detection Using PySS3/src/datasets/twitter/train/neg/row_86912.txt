I want outThis is my second post to this subreddit now; my first one was a few days ago.

To recap, I was recently diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder and put on Zoloft. The medicine feels like its working, for the most part, but later in the day I feel worse than before to the point that all I want is to die.

At the time of my last post, all of my friends save one had given up and stopped talking to me. The only one that stayed helped me get treatment and knew exactly what to do to make me feel a million times better. Now, she's given up on me too. For the first time that I can remember, I'm all alone.

I feel like all I do is screw things up. I was almost fired today because I fucked up so badly, but the only thing that saved me was that I used to keep trying new things and trying to make things better. Recently, I just dont feel motivated the same way as I used to and if I screw up one more time, I'm out the door. 

Today was the first time that I thought about how I could kill myself. At this point, I want nothing more than to die.
