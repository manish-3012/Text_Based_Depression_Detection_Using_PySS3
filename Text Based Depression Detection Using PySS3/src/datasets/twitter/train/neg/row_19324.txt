EffortIt is an effort to breathe

It is always a really hard time of year. My brother took his life 2 years ago 39 my dad 10years before that. It feels as if yesterday. Time and time again I believe the food in others does this make me naive that I expect next time to be different that people know I will say yea and hardly ever refuse these days it is for sex mainly because I have become fat old and an embarrassment for my daughters All I have is him the abuser my ex my fiancÃ© His words cut into my skin without me even having to use a blade the crocodile tears he says I cry the Walt from them burns my face I donâ€™t know how Iâ€™m going get through the depression the blackness the still is suffocating me
