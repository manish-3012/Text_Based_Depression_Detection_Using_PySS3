I have everything Iâ€™ve ever wanted and more. And I want to end myself more than ever before.Thereâ€™s no trick - I come from a wealthy family, I study in one of the most prestigious colleges in the world, I have a boyfriend who loves me more than anything and I love him back. So far Iâ€™ve had every opportunity people can only dream of. 
But nothing seems to make sense - I donâ€™t enjoy anything, I feel apathetic most of the time, I drink alcohol at every opportunity and recently I disassembled a razor and made 25 cuts on my thighs. I donâ€™t know why thatâ€™s happening. I donâ€™t know what to do.
Ending it all, rationally, seems like the dumbest thing ever. I have everything. I have a future. But still I feel like I NEED to kill myself, like there is no other option.
I canâ€™t tell anyone about this - itâ€™s just stupid. People around me donâ€™t know whatâ€™s going on with me because I canâ€™t show it - Iâ€™m always cheerful and funny, as usual. I feel wrong, I feel like Iâ€™m just being melancholic, but I want to go.

Please help me. I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s wrong with me.
