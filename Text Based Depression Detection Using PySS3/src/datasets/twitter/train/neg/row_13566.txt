So lostI don't know whats happening anymore. Everything bothers me or makes me feel weird for some reason. It's all adding up and I just want to die so bad. I don't know if I want to kill myself or not. I can't tell. I'm so overwhelmed by all these different things I'm feeling and I can't even decide how bad I want to die. 

I hope something kills me soon so I don't have to do it myself.
