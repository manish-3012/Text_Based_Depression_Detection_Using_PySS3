I feel guilty for throwing myself out of a moving caridk what got into me... Ive always dealt with suicidal thoughts and depression (I THINK) but I never thought I would actually take action in hurting myself... but I did... and now my body is in pain and im hurting... now I cant work... I MADE EVERYTHING WORSE like I always do.... and I just wish this never happened or I wish I was dead... 

I did it infront of my boyfriend and I feel so ashamed.... he tried holding me back but my urge was so intense, I FELT SO DESPERATE, that I jumped out of the car. 

my boyfriend is genuinely so sweet and loving and I feel like such a piece of shit. I feel like im screwing him up mentally... like how traumatic must it be to see your girlfriend jump out of your moving vehicle?? I want to be a better person but I feel like I fail everyday... 

and its weighing on me... I feel this pressure to be "better" for my mom and for my bf but I cant get to where I need to be and it makes me hate myself more than I already do...

honestly... Im scared for the next episode. Im actually really scared of what I am capable of doing to myself when I get overwhelmed. What made me want to jump is always feeling alone and misunderstood even when Im around those who "love me most" 

idk im scared and I think I need help but I dont know who to talk to... i have no friends and my only fam is my mom... who i cant share these feelings with bc theyre so dark and intense she doesnt need more stress in her lifeee
