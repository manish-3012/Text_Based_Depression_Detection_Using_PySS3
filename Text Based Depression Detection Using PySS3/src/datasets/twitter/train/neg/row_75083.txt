I feel like finishing what I started 21 years agoBecause I'm about to loose it all.

My life has no value, no one wants to give help, just preach and judge.

I sit here, crying my eyes out... because I see no solutions, no way out.

Not spending Christmas with my family is hard, but if I lose her...then this will be it.

I just don't know what to do anymore, when even my posts in /r/Assistance are getting downvoted.

Should I just give up?
