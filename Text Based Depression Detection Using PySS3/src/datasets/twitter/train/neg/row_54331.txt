Just got out of the Hospital after a 48 hour hold3 days ago I tried ending my life and even made a post about it you can check my history to find said post. I tried ending it and failed, was sent to the hospital had my stomach pumped and was held for 48 hours. I wish I never made it through and wish I didn't survive. I can't take this life anymore, being single, alone, having absolutely no one in my life. I just don't want to be alive anymore.
