Iâ€™m 12I want to kill my self, but I donâ€™t want to make my family and friends sad but what do I do I mean weâ€™re all going to die so whatâ€™s the point in living and in a million years I wonâ€™t even be remembered and knowing how mean people are , in the real world I canâ€™t imagine how mean and cruel they are and I know not everybody is that way but most people Iâ€™ve met are. I just want help (but I feel weird talking about it) or a break from life but that break will never happen until I die can anyone relate to me
