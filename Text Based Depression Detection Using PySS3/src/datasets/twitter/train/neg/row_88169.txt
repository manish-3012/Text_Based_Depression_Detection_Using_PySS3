Just wanna not be aliveOk ill try and keep this short, and also idk where this is headed. But I've had anxiety through the roof for a few years now, and super depression since my senior year of high school. Like it's gotten so bad that I've attempted but never follow through because the thought of being dead terrifies me. But I hate being alive, nothing good comes from what I do. I literally fuck everything up, if there's a way to fuck it up. I'll do it. I'm practically failing out of college because I hate this major, I'm trying to switch but it might be too late. I'm sick of how I am as a person talking behind other people's back about other people. I'm sick of being alive, it's gotten to the point where I would rather sleep than be awake. If anyone reads this, thanks for the taking the time to do so. I'm most likely not going to do it because I'm to afraid, I just had to get this off my chest. I feel like people would think I was crazy if I told them this in person
