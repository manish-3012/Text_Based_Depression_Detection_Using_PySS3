Iâ€™m so alone...I donâ€™t fit in anywhere, I donâ€™t belong anywhere. 
Whenever i need someone everyone leaves me, Iâ€™m just being a pathetic idiot and over dramatic about everything. I have no-one. Everyone always leaves. 
Iâ€™m alone and Iâ€™m fed up of being alone. No-one cares - not even my family. 
All they care about if not burying their child before them. They donâ€™t care if that means I suffer until the end.. 

Iâ€™m so so fucking alone.
