Suicides are not the real victims. For them it is over.From a post on another sub reddit

OK, here we go. I wanted to avoid a wall of text. However a poster in here pissed me off.
I was 13 when I revived my mother from her 2nd suicide attempt. We were living in a warehouse formerly occupied by migrant workers. At 18 I found a runaway and tried to save her for 3 years. I was 21, Mom drowned herself in the ocean a block from my house. I spent years carrying a silent rage I did not know was there. I drank a lot, had friends, spouses telling me I was a different person at these drunken times, I seldom remembered any of it. I continued to seek women that I could "save". It never worked. I have an extremely lucid and vivid dream-life, in 32 years I never spoke to or had my mother speak to me. Only last year I dreamed that Mom and I were together in a car, there were eligible women there with us as well. I went into a store, came out and found she had moved the car and gotten it stuck behind the store. I woke up as I tried to strangle her. I have since had normal dreams of her and we speak together as I have with my father all along. I have lost many friends and loved ones to death lately, this has caused some sub-conscious change within me. I should have had therapy years ago. I am sure it would have helped.
So OP if you can't shake this, get some help. You may be carrying trauma you are unaware of. I thought I was fine, I wasn't. It may not take much, if a year goes by and you still feel this, by all means talk to a pro. You are way too young, a grand, full life awaits you. Don't let her ruin it for you.
