Why is suicide not an option again?Excluding the presence of all religious beliefs, why is suicide not an option again? In a competitive and connection-based society such as America, with sometimes little financial mobility if you're given the wrong set of cards, it would make sense to kill oneself. From a realistic standpoint, if I'm already at the bottom yet trying my hardest in school or work and I see no progress, why not allow me to kill myself? I don't think I care about the opportunities life has. I am inferior/seen as inferior in many ways, half of which were due to just being born. I don't see a point, yet I try to help other see the point. Kind of hypocritical of me. It is also hypocritical to make this post yet take a month to make a plan and/or I'll feel better in 6 hours because I'm stupid and emotionally unstable.
