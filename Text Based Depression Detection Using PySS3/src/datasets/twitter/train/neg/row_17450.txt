Nothing left to live for.My wife died by suicide just over 3 months ago. I moved continents to be with her and now I have nothing. I've lost everything. My wife, who was my best friend in the world, our apartment (it was leased in her name), our car (her dad bought it for her and took it back). All the money I had transferred into her bank account so it would be easier for us to withdraw (we had an appointment on the Monday after she died to change it to a joint account). Our cat, who is now living with friends of my wife's daughter. 

I literally have nothing. Our immigration papers hadn't completed being processed when she died and so my spouse visa and work permit got turned down. Having to wait on a decision on a different visa now. I don't get any social assistance from anywhere and am now resorting to begging on the streets to get enough for one meal a day. 

I miss my wife so much. My heart is totally broken by her death. She was estranged from her daughters and I have no family so it was me and her together. 

I feel that my life is hopeless. I've lost the one person who loved me, my world has come crashing down around me. There is only one option left. To join her via suicide.
