Time just seems to go on and onI've never had a group of friends longer then a year... I'm 13, Yeah I know I'm at the perfect age to be all depressed and that emo shit, but this is different...

I'm such a failure, loser, emo freak...I feel like I was a mistake made by God, I made a group of friends with such great people but I'm the reason they split apart.

June 6th 2013 around 3:40 PM was the last time I was truly happy, now I just want to end it all knowing that I will never be happy as I was back then... I've had to say goodbye to 20 friends in the past 4 years... It's just mental torture 

The reasons I should kill myself keep growing, while the reasons I shouldn't keep shrinking
