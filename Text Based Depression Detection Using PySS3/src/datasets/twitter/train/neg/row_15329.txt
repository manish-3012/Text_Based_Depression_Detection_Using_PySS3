I'm like a joke that's so uninteresting no one even cares to hear the punchlineMediocre personality + appearance. I believe I'm beyond the point of just being a basket case and am just ill company at this stage. Don't read my dribble any more it's a load a shite, seeing as how I can surprise people with what I'm capable of , I like the idea of my thoughts being recorded.
