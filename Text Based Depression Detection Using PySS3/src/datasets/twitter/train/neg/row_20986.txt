UnluckyI just feel bad for myself and unlucky. My mom does not deserve to have a daughter, my brother does not realize how lucky he is to be second born, to be male, to be the youngest, to have everything I'd kill for and take it for granted. I am out to my partner/boyfriend as transgender (I just say partner or other half mostly he's a cis dude tho) and my parents have no idea that I am two and a half months on testosterone. I just do not have much hope. There are certain aspects that are fine, like being let into frat parties every single weekend without worrying to get a wristband, or break in, and all the stuff I see my friends and partner go through. But I would love a life of male childhood, never knowing what a period was, having biological kids with my wife, video games, and being a son. I will never have that. It is useless. I just do not know anyone. I just got unlucky. I could have been second born and male....I wasn't. My father's child before me who passed away along with his wife was a boy, died minutes after being taken out of his dead wife. Life is so absurd, if that woman he married and first child would not have died I would have never been here. That would have most likely been for the better. Life is so ludicrous and so retarded I see no point, if I came out as trans my parents would stop sending me to college and I would have to fend for my own. I love it here and I love living away from them and I am 33% done with my English degree. I am about to finish my freshmen year. I am so sad when I see little girls born, the cruel lives I know they will live. I feel being born male is the highest of privilege which I will never have. I just do not know what to do anymore. I am so lost. I just want God to take me.
