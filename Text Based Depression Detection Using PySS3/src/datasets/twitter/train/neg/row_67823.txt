I canâ€™t die ;,(When I was 14 I tried to take it all, didnâ€™t work. Have been in car wrecks where I should have died, have overdosed on drugs many many times, have had seizures, have had people point guns at my head, have robbed the wrong people that shouldâ€™ve taken my life. I physically canâ€™t die. Iâ€™m trapped in this sick reality of life, and it is very hell like. Having to deal with people who have a smile on there face every fuckin day and just bothering you with kindness and sincerity when you canâ€™t be content with any situation youâ€™re in. My life is a never ending cycle. Go on a long bender, work a shitty job, and then get sober and get a new job find a new place to live just on repeat and repeat. No matter what I try to do differently or how hard I try to better myself I always end up in a constant isolation separated from the cruelty of this world. If things donâ€™t get better soon Iâ€™m going to blow all of my money on cocaine and jump off a balcony. The worlds ending anyways in the next 4 years anyways but you didnâ€™t hear that from me
