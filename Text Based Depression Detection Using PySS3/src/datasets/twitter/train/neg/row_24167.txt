I survived the nightCame close to ending it last night. Sat in the bath tub with a box of razor blades for about six hours. I managed to hold off until my partner got home - she dried me off and made me cocoa.

Going to see my therapist who will probably contact the crisis team and put me on watch. My partner now has all my meds and blades so hopefully that will keep me out of danger.

Thanks to everyone here - your kind words give me hope.
