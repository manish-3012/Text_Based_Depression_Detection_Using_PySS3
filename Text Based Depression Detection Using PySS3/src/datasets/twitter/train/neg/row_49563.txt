ThoughtsI'm not sure this is the right place for it. Just something to get off my mind I suppose. I've been suicidal for a while. I can't bring myself to end it. I've come to the conclusion that I am replacable for most people, but not for my parents. They've invested so much in me that even though I really want to end it all, I can't bring myself to do it because of them. Because I know how hard it would be for them. Life hurts. But the image of my mother crying at my grave hurts me more. At the same time it's what I really want though. So I've decided I have to stay alive until they pass away. I'm gonna let them live their lives to the fullest. But when they're gone and I've buried and mourned them, I'm going gently into that good night. Sorry for being a bother. Thanks for reading fellas. Hope it all works out for you all.
