Idk what to do anymoreI feel like I do so much yet not enough. 
I work hard just about every day and I have literally anything I could possibly want yet I feel like it isnâ€™t enough. Despite working 10-12 hours a day I feel like I could be more productive. Thereâ€™s so many other things Iâ€™d love to do but I canâ€™t seem to find the motivation therefore I am the one holding myself back. I feel I am â€œsuccessful â€œ for my age but I want to be more than successful. Idk why I feel like this when everything is great. Idk why I canâ€™t settle for what I have. Idk.  Itâ€™s a burning desire to be even more successful. A burning desire to take everything to the next level yet I hold myself back.  Idk how to get around this obstacle that Iâ€™ve created for myself and i feel stuck, frozen.
