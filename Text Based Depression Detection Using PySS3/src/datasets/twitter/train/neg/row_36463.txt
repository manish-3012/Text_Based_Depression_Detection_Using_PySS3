Just fucking fuck itIm over. Theres so much misery in this fucking world. We put all this effort into just getting out of bed in the morning, into just making it through one more day. And for what? To live longer with the misery? We all end up dead anyway.

I have a good job and a nice house and you know what gets me? The people i come into contact who have no hope. Those who live in public housing. Those who are just waiting for their next hit. But maybe they're not so bad. Maybe those who still hold out hope are the real lost causes. Maybe there is no hope. Were all gone in the end.

Fuck this world. Fuck my existence. Fuck depression. Fuck life. Fuck you.
