I am so goddamn tired of being angry, useless, or sadBeen in breakdown mode all day and I'm scouring my apartment for places to hang myself. How the fuck does anyone hang themselves in their own home? What fixtures can hold that kind of weight? I'm not actually asking, but just utterly dumbfounded at how a 6ft closet could suspend anyone at all. 

I tried to be useful today and set up my new internet router. Obviously doesn't work. No access to documents or account details that would help. I know this isn't a big deal in the slightest, but it has been setting me off all day. I'm cycling between hysteria, crying, lying quietly, and fighting the urge to punch and cut myself. Sometimes I feel like I'd rather be alive but more often there are days like today where I wish I had the balls to at least hurt myself. 

Another day of being a gross failure, because that's all I know.
