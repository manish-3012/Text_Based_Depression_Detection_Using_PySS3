Is suicide really worse than living a terrible life?I posted this a year ago but I just feel like this matters now.

 

Loneliness and depression is something I've studied in the months following my suicide attempt. It's crazy, terrible, hurtful, and when you have no one to listen, it all feels like there's nothing to live for anymore. The pain of the present blinds you of the potential of the future (I'm a 16 year old with a great resume for a good college). It isn't just me or you feeling this; there's scientific reasoning behind it. While our communities have evolved to make social interaction less vital for survival, our bodies haven't evolved to sense that it isn't, so we have social pain. the pain becomes chronic leading to great stress that is 2 times deadlier than obesity and as deadly as smoking a cigarette a day, yet we have our priorities misplaced.

The most dangerous thing about loneliness is that when it becomes chronic, it can become self-sustaining. You become more receptive to social communications but more sensitive to negative stimuli. You perceive the world as against you, you avoid people for fear of rejection, you feel unwanted, you say no to parties which in-turn leads people to view you in a negative connotation, exclude you, and plunge you deeper into loneliness.

This something that should be talked about and even taught in schools rather than making suicide a bad wordâ€”something to not joke about. Only by understanding your loneliness can you escape the vicious cycle that leads you to two options: Suicide or miserable living
