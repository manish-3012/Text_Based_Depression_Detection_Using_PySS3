Trigger warning: Don't read if you're suicidalHi, 

I just OD'd myself with paracetamol. I took 10 grams. I googled and it said it is enough to kill someone. I'm not scared or anything. I just want to hear my boyfriend voice one last time. But he is not answering his call. Can't blame him. It is 12.45A.M. here. 

And also my country is also locked down. I'm in home with my parents. I'm worried it might be difficult for them to arrange funeral or something. I don't know.
