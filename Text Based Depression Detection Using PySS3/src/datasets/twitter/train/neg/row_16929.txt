Alcohol PoisoningI've attempted suicide multiple times in the past, but I've obviously messed all those up.  After doing research, I've decided to give acute alcohol poisoning a go.

I'm a wimp so I want this to be painless, but based on my age and weight, I've deduced that I could get myself to an ABC of about .41 in maybe less than half an hour.

What would the results end up looking like in reality?
