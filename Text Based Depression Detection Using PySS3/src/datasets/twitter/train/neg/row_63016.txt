I think my boyfriend may have attempted last nightI went to a charity event last night.

He texted me something a little weird but I didn't realize that it could've been construed as him thinking about suicide. In fact I bet it was.

After the event I texted him still not realizing anything was wrong and he berated me for leaving him alone at home and told me not to go there and not to contact him.

I called him this morning. My number isn't blocked (sometimes he blocks my number when he gets angry with me) but he didn't pick up


We don't have any mutual friends and I don't know how to know if he's okay. If it turns out he's fine and i misconstrued what he said and I call the cops, he will never forgive me.

I just want to know if he's okay
