Suicide as an optionThings are only going to get harder from here on out. Iâ€™m too dependent on one person for happiness and itâ€™s not going to get any better. I wake up every day looking forward to something that half of the time doesnâ€™t even happen. 

I spend most of the time thinking about all the details, about how Iâ€™m not going to be strong enough to sit in a classroom for four fucking years so I can go and get a service job somewhere. Iâ€™m going to have all this time on my hands but I know Iâ€™m going to waste it, Iâ€™m not social, Iâ€™m not motivated enough to exercise so I look like shit, Iâ€™m not smart enough to make it in the school I actually want to go to. 

Iâ€™ve never been more serious about ending it now that I know Iâ€™m not going to be strong enough to keep going. Itâ€™s not fair to others that I keep using their time and money on my shitty pitiful existence. 

Iâ€™m not strong or smart or special and I deserve everything coming to me. Nothing is getting better, and nothing is going to get better. I donâ€™t know why I bother hurting myself when I should just pull the trigger.
