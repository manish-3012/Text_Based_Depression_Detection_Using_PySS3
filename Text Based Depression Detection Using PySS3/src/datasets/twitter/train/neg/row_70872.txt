I'm lostI'm tired of trying. I try so hard and I fail at everything. The only reason I cant take my own life is because I'll probably fail at that too. I'm tired of being depressed I've been depressed since I was a little child. If this is what life has to offer me I don't want it. 

I have no family support, no real friends. I have nothing I am nothing. I'm worthless I'm a loser and an idiot. I mean I was an accident I wasn't even supposed to be born. I should just fix that problem. I cant keep up this act while I'm dying on the inside. I don't know anymore.
