Thinking about ending it tonightI just got out of a 9 month relationship with the girl I thought I loved. Now Iâ€™m stuck getting shit grades, even in math class which is one of my best subjects, straight fâ€™s last 4 tests and quizzes, canâ€™t remember the last time Iâ€™ve felt accomplished. I take math at a sophomore level in 8th grade. I know how to do the work but I donâ€™t do my homework because I feel down all the time and donâ€™t ever have the motivation. I feel like curling up in a ball in the woods near my house and just waiting until I die of the cold.
