Got home from therapy and it didn't do any goodI just need to vent or here from somebody.

I think I am getting closer to my breaking point.  It's just everything with my health and the seizures the depression and the anxiety.  I don't know which way is up and which is down anymore.

I'm not even hanging by a thread anymore, I'm hanging by a fingernail.  I know that's a weird analogy but I don't know if anybody knows what I mean. 

I know I'm probably read rambling and doubt anybody is going to respond. But I figured I'd try. 

I feel like cutting bit don't want to relapse after almost 7 and a 1/2 years.  I've only had 2 lapse in that time. And right now the cutting demon is sitting on my shoulder whispering to me sometimes yelling. I just want to give in, I want to be in control of the pain instead of the pain controlling me. 

Been thinking even while I was in my therapy session of how easy and how many ways I can make everything stop. 

I just don't know what to do anymore, I'm really close to just giving up
