Might do it...I don't really know where to start with this, but I hate my life. I've been considering killing myself for a long time, but I haven't lately because I met a girl that actually makes me happy. We were hanging out yesterday and we cuddled for the first time, and I was really happy. But my parents were yelling at me for some reasons that Im not gonna say, but now I hate life again, and I'm considering killing myself. I don't know what I'm gonna do now, maybe I'll kill myself, maybe I won't. I honestly don't know anymore.
