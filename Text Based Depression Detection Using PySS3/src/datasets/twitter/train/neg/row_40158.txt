cya in another lifedon't give me bullshit about therapists and psychiatrists, don't tell me the world is beautiful, whoever does is a fucking moron, don't tell me that i can do anything because i can't, don't tell me that there's plenty of stuff to do because there isn't.

You're all gonna say "don't do it" because you're gonna feel bad if i do, let's face it. Selfish bastards. You're all slaves. But me? No. I won't be a slave anymore.

good riddance.
