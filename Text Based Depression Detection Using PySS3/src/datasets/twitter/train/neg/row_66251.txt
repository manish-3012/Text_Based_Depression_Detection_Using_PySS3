Lost HopeI keep hearing that if you arenâ€™t doing okay you should reach out to people. 

I donâ€™t really have anyone I can reach out to. 

Iâ€™m not doing okay at all.   Very little in my life makes me happy - being an aunt, spending my summers at the pool with my pool family, and my job are all I have. 

This virus has taken away the pool this year, drastically impacted the way I do my job (all I do now is answer an email now and then ), and made it so I canâ€™t see my niece and wonâ€™t even get to meet my nephew when heâ€™s born in a couple weeks.  My sister informed me today it will be â€œmonthsâ€ before she allows people around her kids. 

I have nobody to talk to and spend day after day sitting by myself in a 700sq foot apartment with a third floor balcony the size of a bathtub.  

My friends and family are all isolated with other people.  FaceTime can only work for so long. 

The weather has been cold and rainy so a park isnâ€™t an option, the libraries are closed, the craft stores are closed, I canâ€™t spend money frivolously anyways since Iâ€™m at risk of being laid off.  

Honestly right now? Iâ€™m finding it hard to find any hope to keep going.  This isnâ€™t living.  And now my states health director is trying to push for this to stay in place for 18 more months. 

I will end up killing myself if thatâ€™s the case.  Because this isnâ€™t a life worth living.
