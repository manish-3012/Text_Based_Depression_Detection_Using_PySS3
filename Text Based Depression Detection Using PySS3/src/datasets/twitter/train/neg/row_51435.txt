Illusion.Everyone thinks I'm smart and doing well. I'm failing a class. My friends abandoned me, I'm certain I have schizophrenia but I don't want to tell anyone. Soon my failing will be known to my parents. I don't want to see their anger and disappointment. I'm not who I appear to be. I feel like I'm bundling everything inside and soon it's going to burst. I don't want to be there for it.
