Never have i wanted to kill myself more than I do right now. And I'm probably going to.I can't break the cycle. 

I live on my own. that makes me depressed so i binge eat. Everyone I know is happy with someone, and I will never be so I binge eat. The more i try to lose weight, the more I fail and binge more. 

I can't stop eating. I will never be happy. I haven't been truly happy in over 6 years.

I'm sick of it. I have some poison here. Yes i know it will be painful, but it's all I have. Maybe when it's done someone will sympathize... maybe.

my 27th birthday was a few days ago. I realized my life is more pathetic now, and it gets worse every year.
