I should be dead.I've hurt someone very badly. I don't deserve to be alive. I had one suicide attempt and this person told me that the doctors shouldn't have rescued me back then at the hospital. This is all my fault of course, because I did something very bad to this person. Even here on reddit one person told me once that I deserve everything bad that happens to me recently. I won't make another attempt to kill myself, because I don't want to hurt my parents... But living with the awareness that I destroyed someone's life is the worst.
And the worst thing is that I really didn't want to make anyone suffer. I wanted to do my best and yet somehow I found myself being the biggest whore out there. For wanting to please everyone.
Sorry for my rant. I just wanted to say that to someone who will understand.
