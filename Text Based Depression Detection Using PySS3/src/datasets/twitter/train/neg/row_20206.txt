My psychiatrist just told me he'd call the psych ward on me. I told him I had Reddit. He then threw the idea of the psych ward away. Thanks.Long story short. I've had impulses where I'm really really close to taking my life and I told my psychiatrist about one of them. He then said that it was ok to have them and all of that.

Just now he called me up one day later and said he didn't realize how serious it was and that he wants me to be safe, he wants me to have someone I can call. First it was my mom, I told him that's a no go. Then my dad, another no go, then it was the psych. He told me he'd call psych no matter what I wanted and that he was sorry for it.

I then told him that I got Reddit as my "safe guardian" and he backed off, telling me that it's great that I have Reddit and therefore don't need the psych but he wanted to increase our talks from once a week to twice a week.

So, thank you Reddit ðŸ˜ You saved me from the psych ward where they're abusive af.


TL;DR I told my psychiatrist about suicidal impulses, he wanted to call psych, I told him no and that I had Reddit as a safe guardian. He said ok and won't call psych.
