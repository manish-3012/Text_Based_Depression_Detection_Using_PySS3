I hate lifeI donâ€™t really see a point to living, In constantly in a depressed state of mind, constantly thinking about how everyone hates me or would be better off without me, no matter what people say to me or no matter how much someone says I matter it never gets through to me . The only way I can describe it is feeling like a complete burden to everyone I know. Everyone sees me as a miserable piece of shit and thinks I just make this all up or that Iâ€™m just like most anxious about people. I canâ€™t even drive anywhere without thinking of killing my self in some horrific car accident. I donâ€™t want to hurt anyone by the process of suicide and I wish that I could have just never been born. Iâ€™m so sick of this feeling every day and night, I throw up almost every morning and I feel like Iâ€™m never going to change for the better. Iâ€™m at a point where I canâ€™t talk to anyone about how I feel so Iâ€™m not sure why Iâ€™m reaching out here. Maybe itâ€™s just cause I want comfort in knowing thereâ€™s someone else out there that feels my pain on some level. I wish I could be normal. I wish I didnâ€™t disappoint everyone I knew, and I wish that I could just be happy.
