i have no idea what to doTW: sexual abuse

I'm so fucking scared. I have to go to my brother's wedding tomorrow and my mom won't give me any choice. I'm 16 and my mother is incredibly controlling of me.
He molested me for a majority of my childhood and I just really don't know what to do. I don't want to see him. I don't want to dance with him. I don't want him to touch me.
 I was going to contact one of my teachers that I have come to trust, but I don't want to bother him and I don't want him to worry about me.

I fucking hate myself and I wish I fucking killed myself already. I've already tried a few times and it's never fucking worked. I'm sick of remembering my childhood. I hate how my brother took advantage of me, and I hate the emotional and physical abuse my father put me through, im stupid, terrible, iim just sick of everything. I just want to die alreaadyy, I fucking deserve it anyway
