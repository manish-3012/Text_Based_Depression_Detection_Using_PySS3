I'm so tiredI've been dealing with depression on and off since I was 11 (it was situational at first.) I'm almost 23. Antidepressants don't work and I want to give up. I've been suicidal maybe hundreds of times and close to doing something several times but I never have because despite not being sure what I believe in, I'm scared of the possibility of there being an afterlife and going to hell because I don't really believe, because I'm bisexual/pansexual, and because I might have killed myself. I think I also managed to find a spark of hope each time. I've also never done it or even attempted because I didn't want to hurt family and what few friends I have, even though I think they'd be fine eventually and probably better off.

I'm failing two of my three classes and I missed the deadline to drop them because I thought I could fix them and because I didn't want to disappoint my parents.

My partner of technically 7 years is tired of dealing with my depression. He's worn out and it's hard for him to be patient and I'm sorry. I've almost told him a few times to just leave. But I'm selfish and I can't do this without him. He's my best friend.

I'm just so tired and I want to just sleep and not wake up.

I don't have a therapist/psychologist and my next appointment with my psychiatrist isn't until the end of this month.
