I don't want to exist anymoreI recently hurt the love of my life to where sheâ€™s thinking about leaving me. Just hearing her cry and feel sad makes me not want to be alive anymore. I have so much debt with school and I canâ€™t get a job because of COVID. Lately Iâ€™ve just been thinking about the gun I have and just driving out to the middle of the desert to end it. Iâ€™ve made the worst mistake of my life and now my wife will never look at me the same way again. That alone makes me think that I donâ€™t deserve to be alive anymore. I donâ€™t know what to do. I feel like Iâ€™ve been shoved in a dark hole with no way out. I just wish I never existed. I donâ€™t want to be alive feeling these emotions anymore.
