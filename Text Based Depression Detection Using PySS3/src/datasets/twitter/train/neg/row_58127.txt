Posts here are basically ignored unless you're in immediate harm. RantAnd even then, there's an almost toxic mix of suicidal people that are actually quite aggressively attacking what non suicidal people say, it's quite unpleasant and drives those voices off. 

And because of his Reddit works, people who are suicidal but not looking like they're in immediate harm, their posts are ignored, with at best a 50 50 chance of getting an upvote for support. We all might as well just lock ourselves in a room and disconnect, lol. So ironic. This place is across between a factory and a dumping ground. 

Someone might say "let's create sub for people who are just more passively suicidal". But then that's just one more nail in the coffin for a healthily functioning community, isolating the most suicidal while the rest have jollies in their sub. But something about Reddits system makes for a very isolating experience even when the two groups are in the same sub. 

Forums I used to be on really worked better for some reason

Sorry for the wall of text, I hope someone agrees. I hate this place lol :(
