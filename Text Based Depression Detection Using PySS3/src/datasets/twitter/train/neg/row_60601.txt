Basically an unloadI know no one wants to read my shitty problems but this is for my own benefit. So the other night I was going to kill myself, I stood on the railings of a bridge trying to get the guts to jump then some guy pulls me back over. I mean I'm 18, I told my mum what happened and I have a doctors appointment.. they don't listen though. It's just "hormones" I've been told this since I was 12 years old, despite the fact I was badly attacked by a dog previously to that they can't seem to realise I need help. I've been on medication for the past 3/4 years or so which hasn't helped me in the slightest. I've tried getting it changed only to be told to "let it get into my system" the NHS is beyond a joke.
