Is it normal to go through the stages of grief when suicidal?Throwaway for obvious reasons.

I suppose I am a step or so above passively suicidal?

When I think about actually suiciding, I go into a sort of mourning which also includes denial, acceptance, etc. 

Is this something that is common? Am I misinterpreting my own feelings?

I am nervous posting this.
