I think today is the day.For various reasons, ever since two weeks ago I have intended to actually kill myself. I mean I had always been open to the idea that if things got too hairy I could just scotch myself my entire life but I never contemplated actual suicide up until then. Last Friday was that day I was going to do it, but I changed my mind and though that I could still live life, but recently I have changed my mind. I saw my therapist last night and I was actually feeling very good and had no intention of doing so (although even after I decided not to, it has been lurking in the back of my head as a safety net). My mother found my note the day after I changed my mind while rummaging through my room and told my therapist. I clarified that I didn't want to kill myself anymore, but he told me to call him if I was thinking about it again. If I wanted to kill myself why would I call someone who would try to convince me to not do so, although I suppose thats what I am doing now (by sharing with you).
