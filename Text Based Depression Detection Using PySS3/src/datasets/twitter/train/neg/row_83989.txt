Itâ€™s suicide prevention day, and the world just wants me gone.This last year has been an utter disaster, punctuated by moments of sheer beauty and love.

But Iâ€™m running out of gas.  I canâ€™t handle any more curveballs, any more weight upon my back.  And yet, it just keeps coming.

My efforts to reach out to my wife for help have not been met with kindness.  Sheâ€™s angry.  She blames me.  She responds with the very responses Iâ€™ve told her push me farther past my breaking point.

I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m supposed to be here any more.
