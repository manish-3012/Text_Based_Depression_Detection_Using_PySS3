I survived by the grace of god2 weeks ago on Monday I lost my job, Tuesday my gf cheated on me and left me, Thursday my dad died, last Monday I told one person I was going to hang my self then my ex gf rushed to my house to see me hanging and he brought me back to life but now everyone thinks I'm that unstable guy, the crazy one no one will talk to me I'm now a outcast of society. I am only 20 years old
