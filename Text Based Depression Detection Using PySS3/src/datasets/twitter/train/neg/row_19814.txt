I want to throw myself in the street and let a car drive over meIâ€™m a mess right now, and I donâ€™t want to do this anymore. I donâ€™t want to exist in a place that causes me an insurmountable amount of pain on a daily basis. I donâ€™t want to do it myself, but I wouldnâ€™t mind laying in the street and having a car drive over me and get it over with. Not like the people I have around would give much of a shit if I wasnâ€™t existing anyway.
