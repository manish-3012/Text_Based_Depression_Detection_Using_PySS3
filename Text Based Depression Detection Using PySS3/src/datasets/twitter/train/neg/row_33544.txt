Feel like I'm unattractive and no one is ever going to want me. (rant)My friends all keep telling me I'm physically attractive, (long hair, perfect slim body etc.) and that my personality is amazing yet I haven't been in a relationship for almost a year. I felt like that person didn't even find me attractive. 

 It's depressing me to the point where I just want to end my life now so I don't have to worry about dying alone? It's a fear of mine that I'm going to end up friendless and without romance in my life and I just can't deal.
