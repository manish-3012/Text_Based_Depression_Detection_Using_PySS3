Everyone says not to, why?I'm so sick of this. No one appreciates my hard work or how hard I try to be a good person. I'm 19 and I go to school full time and work part time, and I take care of my pets, clean my room/bathroom, cook meals, and generally try to be good around the house. I live at home and all I get from my parents is shit. About three years ago I spiraled down in my depression and attempted suicide thirteen times. Shows how bad I am at it. Well, now I'm an insomniac so I have sleeping pills I didn't have before. It would be so easy. I know everyone says not to kill yourself, but why? Really? Who can really say the world wouldn't be better off without me? I know this is probably my depression talking through a few days of missed meds (which I've been on since 16). But really. Who says the world is better with me rather than without me? My mom is threatening to kick me out. What would I do? I can't bring a 40 gallon and 10 gallon terrarium with stand and light/heating/supplies with me anywhere, and my job is a research position, so I have practically no money. If I get kicked out of my house, which would be for no reason except my mother's mental health issues and my father's fear of her, I'd be better off dead anyway. I just feel like no one even loves me.  
  
Ha, why should I expect the internet to care?
