Unachievable goals &amp; being alone (x-post from /r/depression)I live in a reasonably large county in terms of population. Tonight was one of multiple festivals in the area, and I was helping my parents sell tickets for a large raffle (I'm mid-20s). I'd day about 2000 people were there in as wide an age variety as possible. Yet everywhere I see, everybody had a group or special someone to be with. Not me. Not ever. No friends could/would come out. And I feel like that 'not ever' with a special someone is destined to be a 'not even once in my life.'

When my only dream in life has been to meet somebody to call my partner in life and to not have ANY success ever? Living my life seems like a waste. Just loneliness and suffering. And I see no reason to continue if that's the case. I really don't see a point in going on if all I'm going go experience is loneliness.
