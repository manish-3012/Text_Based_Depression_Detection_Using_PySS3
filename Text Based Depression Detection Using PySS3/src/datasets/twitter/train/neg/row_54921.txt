Itâ€™s hard to feel like I have a place in anythingIâ€™ve recently come to the conclusion that I donâ€™t care about anything in my life. I donâ€™t even like entertaining my friends in school or doing well. My mum looks down on me and makes me feel worthless whenever I do bad in my studies but I have lost all self worth and validation from her approval. I donâ€™t care how my future turns out, I donâ€™t have any hobbies or passions I wish to peruse, I just wake up and do what Iâ€™m told. Iâ€™ve been to college on select courses and even there I feel out of place. I donâ€™t even feel sad anymore, whatâ€™s the point ? Iâ€™m just going to hurt myself and make no difference in the end. I donâ€™t even wish to seek help or try and get people to pity me, it wonâ€™t fill me up or give me some kind of reassurance. Iâ€™m a dick as well, I donâ€™t want to be itâ€™s just easier to pretend to be a bad person because itâ€™s makes people get less attached to me .The only reason I made this post was to try and put my thoughts somewhere where other people could share similar things in there life with me. Iâ€™m so tired of the cookie cutter responses to my situation, â€œthings will become betterâ€ or â€œyouâ€™ll get over it, it just takes timeâ€. I donâ€™t care about how I feel in the future I care about how I feel right now and how more than anything I want tie my belt around me neck and hang myself from my door. Itâ€™s was so hard to act happy today, I donâ€™t know if tomorrow will be better.
