I feel numbI spend the day pretending everything is OK, I call my mum (I live in a different county for uni) and act like I'm eating well and that I'm happy and I have friends. I thought I had a friend, a best friend and then he goes and treats me like shit. I'm sick of being stepped on, I want someone to genuinely care about me, I'm so alone in this world. Someone stop me, tell me I'll be ok.
