Back to the Library.Last night at work I spent some time staring at myself in the mirror wondering who Iâ€™d become under this immense depression. The person who I was two years ago would be so disappointed, so confused. I wondered how my boyfriend could ever love me as Iâ€™ve failed to love myself. 
So I went home to sleep instead of finishing already over due school work and decided to sleep through all of my classes the next day, and just kill myself instead of worry about all of my family, friends, and work Iâ€™ve neglected because of my depression. 
Upon finally getting out of the house around 2pm, I changed my mind and headed to the library after picking up a fuck ton of adderall that I planned to split with my friends. When I got to the library and tried to focus I just broke down and had to leave. I drove to the mountains with a plan to OD on the adderall. 
Iâ€™m not sure what stopped me. This has been on my mind incessantly for months or years on and off.  
Whatever the case; here I am. Dragging myself to get back on track for the millionth time. I just want this all to end.
