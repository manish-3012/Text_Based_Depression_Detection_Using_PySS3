Could admin or anyone help me?So, this is going to sound really stupid.  I have had issues lately (depression, etc.).

But, recently, I did something silly on reddit.  I made a post and then deleted my name from it on accident.  I tried to get my name added back onto it, but couldn't.  I've contacted reddit mods for the thread, etc. but got zero help.

After doing all that, I basically actually considered taking a bunch of pills.  I'm not joking.  This probably sounds really stupid to people, or think that I'm trolling, but I'm not.  

I just really would like my name added back onto the thread I made so that at least one thing could go right in my life.  Could someone help?

You can PM me to.  I'll respond.
