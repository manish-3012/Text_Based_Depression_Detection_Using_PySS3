The endI feel like I'm just at the end of my rope.  I met somebody online that was genuinely intrested in dating me, only to turn me down when she saw what I look like.  My aunt just died and I had to watch them scatter her ashes.  This wonderful human being who was there for me all my life and they just...dumped her into the water.  My few friends I have are getting annoyed at me constantly telling them all this, I can tell.  They don't start conversations with me anymore, I have to start it.  I've waited to see how long they took, and after 3 days I was so lonely that I acted like I was perfectly fine and messaged them joking around and stuff.  I've lost friends because of my depression before, I can't lose more.  And now, I'm writing this, at 3 in the morning, the only one awake in my house.  I may live in a house with a nother, father and brother, but in all honesty, I've never felt so damn lonely.
It's killing me, I'm at my wits end.  There's a train track by my house, and I know I could just go down there, lay my head on it and never feel this way again.  Idk what I'm trying to achieve by writing this, I honestly don't know.  I just feel like I have to get it out.  Perhaps this is my final letter to the world, my last words.
All I want is to be happy.  I've tried therapy, I've tried meds, I've tried finding a job or talking to people but it doesn't work.  It never does.  I try, right?  I just want it to work out for once.
Idk if there's a god, I've never given it much thought.  I just hope if there is, he or she can at least send me someone or grant me the strength to keep going.  I don't want to die, I want to live.  But I feel like the only thing I can do at this point is die.  I'm so fucking scared
