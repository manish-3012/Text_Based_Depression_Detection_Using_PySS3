Why do people always tell you not to kill yourself?Whenever I talk to people about my suicidal thoughts, they always tell me to not do it with no real explanation as to why I shouldn't. When I ask them they say that everyone will be sad, yet temporary sadness can't even compare to the daily struggle I go through each and every day which leads me into wanting to kill myself.

Thoughts?
