I want to end this but I'm scared, broke up with the love of my lifeI just broke up with the love of my life. I want to kill myself. I can't imagine meeting anyone I'm that passionate about again, and I'm considering just shooting myself. I've lost touch with friends because I was so into the relationship. Now I have no one. As stupidly cliche as this sounds. I want to die.

Edit: I was verbally abusive at times in the relationship, and I feel like I deserve to die and love no one. I can't treat people right.

This was the love of my life, and I kept trying to be better, but I don't have it in me. I lost the love of my life because I'm not human enough to change. I tried so fucking hard.

Thinking about getting a gun.
