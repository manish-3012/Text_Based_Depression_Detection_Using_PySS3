What do you do when all your reasons to live are taken away from you?Growing up with super bad depression and constant suicidal thoughts, I learned to find atleast one person or thing to be my reason to live whenever I felt like giving up. I found a couple reasons and they worked for a really long time, but now every reason I had in the past has been taken away. The people and things I always thought of for living, are now dead and/or just gone. What do I do now? I can feel myself getting bad again and I seriously don't know what to tell myself when the dark thoughts flood my head.
