I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll get to graduateIâ€™m at uni at the moment and my mental health has created endless and repetitive cycles of self destruction and Iâ€™m getting none of my work done. I had three essays due at the start of January, none of which ever got handed in and I have a new deadline which I have also missed. Every day that goes by the mountain of work I have to do creates such intense stress and anxiety it makes me physically ill (Iâ€™ve had a mix of various colds/abdominal pains/migraines). I skip class because Iâ€™m stressed but that only makes it worse. 

I canâ€™t bring myself to admit to others how much Iâ€™m struggling and I feel backed into a corner of self loathing and self doubt, fear eating me up from the inside and sometimes when I lie in bed spending another evening completely isolated all I can think about is dying. I donâ€™t know what to do. I canâ€™t tell my partner this, thereâ€™s too much on his mind, too much stress in his life to let him worry about me but I know my behaviour makes him unhappy and he keeps asking such pervasive questions of me and I feel like I have no outlet or anyone to hear me. 

Iâ€™m sorry I donâ€™t ever post anything Iâ€™m just desperate.
