I'm aloneJust a "friend" to others for enjoyment, a ONS, a worthless piece of rotting meat. nothing makes me happy anymore. Im more than estatic about finding work and it looks okay from the outside but my life is in shambles. I'm stuck in an awkward phase still and I'm not sure if I can claw my way out of this mess thats my life right now. Some know, they feel my hopelessness but instead of caring, they rub it in my face of how well they are without me. they don't care about me, just use me because i'm convienient and it's always them that needs me and uses me for something specific and then I never hear from them again. This life just wasn't meant for me. I'm alone and it will always be that way. No one can truly love me the way I've loved them. I gave away too much and now I am alone and empty. I'm really just a hollow shell and most peoplecan see through me. Just like that. But again, no one gives a damn. Family, friends, relationships, all down the drain no matter how hard I try on my side to maintain everything. So no more maintaining and alone I shall be.
