3rd Time PostingWell, this is my third time posting here. First time was a year and a half ago, second was about 7 months ago and that one was about me feeling better. 

I've kinda just given up now. I don't know why I feel so depressed. At first I thought it was because I was ugly and had no friends. I fixed that, became popular, I go to parties and shit and I act like I'm king of the world yet I get home from fucking wherever and just want to lay in bed and never get up. Sometimes it shows at school. I won't be able to function, and my friends will try to cheer me up with their shitty jokes but they don't really care, they just want me to be funny and joke with them again. Then I'll be back on autopilot the next day, forcing myself to laugh at things while daydreaming of jumping out of an open window or shooting myself right when I get home. I think this is the worst it's ever been because I have to put on this big show for friends that don't care about me and for teachers and my family and if this is going to be my whole life I don't get it I mean how the fuck do people do this and have fun with it and yet it's so hard for me. Somethings not right. I guess I'll keep drinking and smoking and try to be funny and outgoing until I can shoot myself. I already tried to twice and pussied out but that was a year ago and now that I've seen what my life is I don't know if I can stand another day of this crushing sense of failure and whatever the hell it is that keeps me in bed, I can't really describe that feeling. I mean Jesus I'm like a fucking animal that needs to be put down. I can't do anything in the state I'm in and the state I'm in won't change. There's not really any other options.
