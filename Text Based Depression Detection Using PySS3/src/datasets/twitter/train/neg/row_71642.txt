I dont know anymoreOn the surface my life is perfect, I recently transferred from a pretty good university to a prestigious one. I was extremely excited and thought my life would improve and I would thrive. Now that I'm here I hate the people, me and my girlfriend are no longer getting along and on the brink of breaking up, and I have no motivation to do anything or be the the person I was once. Ive grown to hate myself for these reasons and wonder if it would be better to not be alive at all. The worst part is I have a supportive family and no real reason to be upset, which I hold against myself.
