I just cut myselfAfter a week or so of being clean I couldnâ€™t handle it. I grabbed my new blade that I had been saving and did three massive lines on my wrist. Iâ€™m losing blood fast, I can see the inside of my arm. It doesnâ€™t hurt but iâ€™m getting dizzy and feeling sick. I think I might let myself passout. Goodnight
