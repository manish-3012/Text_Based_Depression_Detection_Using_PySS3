Even when im well &amp; happy for the day i still don't feel content livingIm 21 but nothing excites me, I look forward to nothing, Im jobless &amp; just lay in my house hoping I have a heart attack or anything to take me away from this life, like im not meant for this life. Like it doesn't matter where I go or what I see or how beautiful the world can be, I just dont care to be around for it. I can have the best day ever but would still be glad if something happened to me&amp; I feel my soul is gone, I feel empty &amp; i know its gonna happen in a couple of years, definitely before i turn 30. Its sick of me &amp; selfish to my family &amp; i think thats the only thing keeping me here, i dont want to hurt them. But I can feel it get worse everyday, I get the urge alot. People have only acted nice toward me because they feel sorry for me, I was given away as a baby, every boyfriend ive had i always find out they only go out with me because they feel bad for me. because im ugly, my bf used to tell me i was ugly while i sleep, &amp; I had to pretend i dont hear it while dieing inside. My friends would get told 'why do you wanna be seen with someone like her'. I feel disgusting all the time. &amp; shameful. This earth was just simply not made for me, im gross, &amp; pathetic.
