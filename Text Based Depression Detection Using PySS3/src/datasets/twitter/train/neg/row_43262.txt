Iâ€™m stuck in a depression rut and I canâ€™t get out of itI seriously donâ€™t know how to shake off this depression. Iâ€™ve been on anti-depressants for a few months now but I donâ€™t feel any different. Iâ€™m on the waiting list for counselling but Iâ€™ve been told Iâ€™ll have to wait a year and a half to two years. I literally have no source of income just now so Iâ€™m barely eating and I canâ€™t pay my rent. Iâ€™ve got letters piled up from the council but Iâ€™m too scared to open them. If I lost my apartment Iâ€™ll kill myself.
I feel like Iâ€™ve done what I shouldâ€™ve done by seeking medical treatment but it isnâ€™t helping. Iâ€™ve been unemployed since February but despite being guaranteed a place back Iâ€™m too scared to. All I want to do is sit at home on my own and not talk to anyone even though I need to get back to work because I need the money.
Everything is awful and I feel helpless.
