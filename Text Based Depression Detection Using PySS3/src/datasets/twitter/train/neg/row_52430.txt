Always treated like a child/ lesserWhy is it that I'm treated like shit wherever I go? Like when trying to make friends at work, I usually mind my own business but I try to occasionally start up a conversation with someone only to be put down because either in just that unattractive or something I don't fuckin know. I don't have friends, I hate trying even though I don't have a harsh thing to say about anyone. Why do people suck :(
