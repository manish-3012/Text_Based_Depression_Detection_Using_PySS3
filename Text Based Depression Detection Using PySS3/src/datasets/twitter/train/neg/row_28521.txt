It's weird because I don't want to die though.I want to experience life and all its beauty! I want to go on my dream get away of floating on my back in the middle of the Dead Sea, where if I really wanted to I could just slip into the deepest crevices of earth and have the flesh of the unknown brush passed mine. I want to find a new life, but I can't. I want to live, but can't find reason to. I want to die and hope the next life I get will be nothing like the one I have now. I want to die.. But I'm scared this *is* the only life I get. I'm so empty and lost and I feel like I've been walking blind towards this beautiful utopia and I want to give up so fucking bad, but I keep thinking I'll be there soon.. So I keep walking.
