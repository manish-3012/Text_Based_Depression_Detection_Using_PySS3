what's the point?I always fuck up, no matter how hard I try no one can understand I try. I'm a failure, I'm constantly in fights with my mother and step dad which every time drives me to scream things I regret. I've had suicidal thoughts, and attempted. My life to many is worthless. I don't have friends nor do I care to have any. Help.
