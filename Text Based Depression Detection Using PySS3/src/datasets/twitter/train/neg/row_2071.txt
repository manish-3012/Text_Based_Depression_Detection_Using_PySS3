I donâ€™t have a good titleHello,

I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m hoping to accomplish posting this but Iâ€™m just hoping somebody can at least see it.

I feel like I am completely falling apart, and at the same time I feel so stupid for feeling that way. Everything that has happened is my fault, my entire situation is my fault.

I donâ€™t think my mind has ever felt normal, my family has a long history of depression but I always thought it could never happen to me so I pushed any dark thoughts far away.

My head feels like itâ€™s imploding every second of the day and itâ€™s getting worse, I still live at home and Im so torn because all I want to do is get out but Iâ€™m so scared of being alone with myself. I feel so trapped all of the time but Iâ€™m also scared to be alone. I miss my girlfriend so much, I left her and it was a mistake but I shouldnâ€™t go back on it, I left her for the most selfish reasons because Iâ€™m a cunt.

Im so sick of people telling me how well Iâ€™ve done already when I feel like a complete and total failure. I never feel like Iâ€™m going to get to where I want to be in life because I donâ€™t even know where that is. Iâ€™m fucked financially I have debts that terrify me and I donâ€™t know what to do about them. I know of all the proactive things that I should do but instead I just drink and distract myself with my head in the sand.

All of that is why I feel so fucking stupid, Iâ€™m not doing anything to help myself because I donâ€™t deserve it, I put myself in this situation so why shouldnâ€™t I suffer.

Iâ€™ve completely had enough, the idea of killing myself doesnâ€™t even scare or upset me anymore. But I canâ€™t do it, I just donâ€™t know how long that will last
