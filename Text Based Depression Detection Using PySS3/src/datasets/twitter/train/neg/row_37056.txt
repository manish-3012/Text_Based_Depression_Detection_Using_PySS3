I want to die but I am too scaredI want to die so bad. or not sure if I just want to disappear. can't tell the difference. I was never on drugs, I don't smoke weeds, I am not PMSing either. I feel like everyone tells me I am useless and worthless. In my deep mind I know that now one is actually saying that but also I am telling myself that it's true. I've been suicidal for a very long time but this time it's bad. Last time when it was this bad I was on birthcontroll but this time no I'm sober af. that's why it's bad. 
I hate everyone because I think everyone hates me but I have no right to take anyone's life so I should be the one who leave this world. 
I am workaholic and I worked so hard this last few years. and now I don't work much. I feel like my limbs are taken away. I feel dead inside. I told myself that I should be only doing what I like but that was wrong. nowI have nothing. 
People say everyone is scared and having hard time with their life but that doesn't mean I can't be depressed. I can't stop myself from crying when I drive and walking on the street. I am insecure more than ever. 
I can't afford to get therapist. I hate myself and blame myself everyday and I feel dizzy. my bf doesn't like me when I look depressed.
I think I never loved myself and therefore I don't think I truly loved anyone. or I ignored people who loved me and followed after and worked for people who treated me shitty and took advantage of me. 
As you can see I am very bad at writing. I am not good at talking either. I don't know why I am still alive. I am not brave enough to leave this world. I just want to disappear
