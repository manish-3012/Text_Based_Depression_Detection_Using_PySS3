Iâ€™ll stick around to do what I promised, but after that Iâ€™ll goI have half a mind to go now, but I have to finish what I started, canâ€™t just leave her alone.

Iâ€™ve already decided, not backing out this time. Iâ€™m tired of being afraid to let go. Nights terrify me. Iâ€™m really sorry, I canâ€™t see much to hang on for anymore. I couldnâ€™t be saved, nor do I want to anymore. I lived a victim of myself. I tried sobriety and all I realized is Iâ€™m too sober to be observing this depressing comedy of errors while maintaining the sanity of my indecisively indecisive wreck of a self. My days are blurry; itâ€™s a wonder I make it out of bed. I havenâ€™t seen much in a while. I donâ€™t see color, I donâ€™t feel laughter. I feel sadness, but itâ€™s more in a state of perpetual hopeless panic. I wish you could see what I see, at least I wouldnâ€™t feel so guilty. I lived and loved and laughed and cried, and Iâ€™ve run out of energy trying anymore. Iâ€™m a selfish coward. I hope everyone I knew knows their worth to me. I hope you find it in you to see past the grief, that Iâ€™ll be at rest from myself. I want to go a lot more than I want to wake up again. I loved every single one of you. I wish it werenâ€™t so, it wouldâ€™ve made it easier. Your memories are the only emotions to ever paint my gray existence, even if only briefly. You mean a lot more to me than I ever showed, Iâ€™ll go thinking about all of you. I hope that when I go, you wouldnâ€™t resent me. As the song goes, Leave Out All the Rest.

Love,
