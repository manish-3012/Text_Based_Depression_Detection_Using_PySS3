Been thinking about ending it since I was 16... 12 years of this shitI have no purpose. I have no passion. I exist and that existence inconveniences the people around me more often than not. I wish I hadn't been born. My parents lost their first baby to a heart defect, their relationship was crumbling, and I was a last-ditch effort to stay together. My mother moved several states away to test my love for her (I refused to leave my friends and my school behind). That was years ago. She rarely talks to me now and only when she has problems. My dad decided his girlfriend was more important so he kicked me out two weeks before I was supposed to leave for college. He stopped helping me with rent afterward. Jobs didn't pay enough. My grandmother stepped in but suddenly stopped because I didn't have time to visit between school and work so I didn't deserve the money. I was nearly homeless and am now in debt. I met someone and we moved in together, but he treated me poorly so I broke up with him. We're stuck living together. He spent 3 days crying on me, telling me he loved me and would get therapy to resolve his issues (he was abused as a child). He promised he'd treat me better. It got worse. Tonight he waited until I was leaving for work to start an argument. He had his friends on PS4 chat so they could listen to me break down and finally yell at him about how he was making me feel. He said he doesn't care about me anymore and that he'd like it if I never spoke to him again.

I was late to work for the first time ever. I'm angry that my perfect record is fucked now. My boss is already upset because I've missed the deadline for a mural I was painting while also doing my other job at the desk. I haven't heard my dad's voice in a year. When I was about to be homeless, he told me to live in my car. I can't because I live in Texas, have no AC, and sleep during the day (I work nights). I wanted to take my life at work so I called my mom instead. She happened to be awake, which is rare. I thought it was fate. I'm not supposed to die. But then I told her how I was feeling and she said... that there was nothing she could do. She said she needed to go to sleep because she has work in the morning. Does she not realize that she may not have a daughter in the morning? I don't want to do that to her but I'm so tired of everything. I've waited 6 years for things to get better. I've worked hard to make opportunities for myself but nothing ever comes of it. I'm passed over for promotions because I'm too crucial where I'm at. I'm stressed at work, I'm stressed driving my old car with its check-engine light on, I'm stressed at home where I can't cook because his dishes have sat there for 5 months. There's mold everywhere. He's so loud I can hear him through my earplugs when I'm trying to sleep at 2pm.

What's the point of all this? Try to make some money, it's still not enough. Get things done at work and someone's been there longer than you. The company sets us up for failure half the time. I don't want to work anywhere else... or anywhere at all. I don't enjoy anything. I don't enjoy anyone's company. I don't trust men anymore when they say they love me because it's never enough or they're lying. So I'll be poor and miserable... I'll be alone... That's it. That's my life. That's all I'll ever get. Debt. Betrayal. Abuse. Depression.

&amp;nbsp;

What's the fucking point. Why do I owe it to anyone to keep living like this. Why don't I get to decide if my existence is worth continuing. Fuck. I can't check myself into the hospital because then everyone will suddenly be interested and I'll fall for it and then I'll be hurt all over again when they stop caring. And it'll go on my medical record, I'll miss work and maybe lose my job because I'm unstable and I live in an at-will state.
