Have been feeling suicidal and anxious since a couple of days. I don't want to die, I don't want to self harm again, but it seems like the only wayI have a lot of trauma, PTSD, and my anxiety gets triggered pretty often. I also get extremely anxious when confronted (I have been a victim of intimate partner violence). My partner finds it hard to communicate her hurts with me, because I either end up shutting down because of anxiety or I end up crying. This makes her feel unheard, hurt, and sometimes angry. 
I was mean to her yesterday, and when she brought it up, I was defensive and eventually made it about myself. Since then she has been yelling at me, on and off, and blaming me for the all the violence I had had to endure in a previous relationship. A few days ago, she got a little rough with me, and because of the guilt, she started feeling suicidal. I heard her out and kept telling her that she couldn't die. Yesterday, when she was screaming at me, she told me, "You make my life miserable and don't even let me die." 
Today, she essentially blamed me for always being the victim, and for never doing anything for her. When I went to a different room, she assumed I was hurting myself and got livid. While she was screaming at me, I started crying. This made her angrier and she kept demanding that I stop crying, and told me things like "you are not a toddler", " Grow up", "what are you crying about."
 When I didn't stop, she told me that she would drag me outside so that the public can see me. Since then, I have this strong urge to just give up on life. I have invested six years in a relationship, have made a number of sacrifices, but it's all gone for a toss.
