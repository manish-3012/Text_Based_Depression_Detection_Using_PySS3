what's the point? there's nothing here.i recently gained 5 lbs, putting my BMI over the "morbid obesity threshold at 40.4. food is the only thing i have -- i have no friends or family who want to talk to me or spend time with me. if i were to take away food, i would have nothing in my life but watching old episodes of star trek and playing my NES emulator. there's just 0 in my life, other than food. but it's the old paradox: i can't get a girl because i'm fat, and i'm fat because i can't get a girl (because there's nothing else in my life, i resort to food for comfort and companionship and pleasure -- it's everything to me).

i had a sort of jarring realization the other night: i woke up, and my eyes bugged out as i thought "y'know, maybe  it really IS the best thing to do to kill yourself, irrespective of depression or hopelessness or mental illness." just objectively speaking, things are pretty bad: no job, no girl, no friends, no family, 121 lbs overweight...there is simply 0 in my life (except food). as a result, i'm morbidly obese. who's going to hire me? who's going to be with me romantically, or even in a friendly way? i have other problems, too -- mental illness and brain damage are the big ones.

i'm in canada these days, so getting a shotgun is difficult (my usual suicide fantasy when i lived stateside). i think what i'd do would be to lay my neck down on the train tracks -- go for decapitation by crushing.

i know that i can't go on being fat like this, but i just don't see any alternatives. i've tried to lose weight numerous times, and failed or gained it all back. i've reached the end of the line.
