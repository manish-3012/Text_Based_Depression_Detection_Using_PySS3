I can't take it anymore I keep crying at my desk. Someone just tell me it's okay and help me accept deathI've been mourning everyone and myself like I've already done it. In some sick kind of preparation for it. Not only will I be gone but so will all of you, you wont exist to me anymore is what I mean. It's been so hard and I'm so fucking tired. I keep alternating between the fear of letting everyone down and thinking about how much pain I'll cause, and on the other hand how it all really... truly doesn't fucking matter. More important and more incredible people than me have done this. I'm just an insignificant selfish piece of shit on the bottom of the world. 

Why can't it just be okay to want this and just have some comfort and help in doing it, ending my life. No you don't love me and you don't know me and just because we might share this disease it doesn't mean shit. I could be a monster for all you know. 
I'm just so fucking scared because it seems so inevitable now. I'm scared but I'm ready I keep thinking about how I'll do it and whether or not I'll have some last words to anyone. But I think why do that to anyone, better to just do it quietly and peacefully. I've built up the nerve for this before and failed and broke my leg and spine and went through the gauntlet of the American mental health hell. I think it's a split second decision in a way. And I'm even sure I'll regret it after doing it because of the pain. but I want this I want it so bad. I want to go past the point of no return and I want to feel like it's okay. And not just be wracked with fucking guilt because this is hard enough.
