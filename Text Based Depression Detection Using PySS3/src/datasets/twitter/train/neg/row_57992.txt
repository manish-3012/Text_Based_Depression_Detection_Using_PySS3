Thank you.I would like to thank all of you for what you do over hear. I have never been in need of your services, thankfully. But I know what you do matters. 

Two years ago today one of my better friends committed suicide to the complete shock of everybody. I wish he would have known about you all. I miss him dearly, I cannot wait to get my tattoo dedicated to him. Man (his name) was 16 years old when he took his life on the same date, 4-18 as his father died just two years earlier. He was always smiling, always happy, and loved helping everyone with their problems. The sad thing is that the thing I miss the most about him is the piggy back rides he used to give me to my 5th hour class... We got yelled at everyday, but we still did it everyday.

[Here is a picture of our rugby team just 3 days before he did it... He is the only kid smiling... Like always](http://i.imgur.com/Elhqi.jpg)

TL;DR I miss my friend dearly. I wish he would have found you guys before it was too late... Thank you all for doing what you do.
