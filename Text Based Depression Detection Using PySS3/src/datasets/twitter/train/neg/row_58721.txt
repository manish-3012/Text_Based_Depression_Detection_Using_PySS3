How do I keep going?For context, I have been fighting the urge to commit suicide for 3 years constantly, and occasionally for 5 prior to that.

In my case, I simply don't know how to keep going. The only reason I am still alive is because of my 2 children (my inability to see them being a major reason I am suicidal). I have asked those around me for help, and been told to think of my kids, which makes me more depressed, as since my ex-wife left and moved 1000 miles away, I don't get to see them much, but can't afford to move either. I feel alone,  as my family and friends only really see me if I make the effort to see them, I couldn't get into a relationship if I tried (I have tried, repeatedly) and I work nights so even if I wanted to see friends, they're usually too busy.
I recently read a list of 50 reasons to stay alive and found most of them to be wholly pointless, or more depressing. I don't know how to keep up the fight
