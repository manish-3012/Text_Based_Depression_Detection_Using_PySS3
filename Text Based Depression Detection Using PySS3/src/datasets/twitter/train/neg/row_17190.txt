I play Undertale every time Iâ€™ve been suicidal. A year later, Iâ€™m almost finished with the game, and I donâ€™t know what to do.Okay, so thatâ€™s probably the most cringeworthy title I have or will put in a post, but... Yâ€™know, Iâ€™m feeling like ending my life, so, fuck it, cringey posts is what the internet is for.

My apologies if this isnâ€™t in typical format, as Iâ€™m super new to reddit. But, in brief:

-Iâ€™ve been suicidal since I was 12. A long history of abuse from my family, sexual assault, medical trauma, lost a fiancÃ© to a drunk driver, abusive significant others, etc. 

-Iâ€™ve never been hospitalized, and Iâ€™ve always felt decently resilient. Through everything, I only attempted once, and that was really bottom of the barrelâ€”right after my fiancÃ© died, when my abusive mother was treating me like shit and threatening to make me homeless, and my abusive ex was trying to sabotage and separate me from my friends. It was like the perfect storm of shit and I had nothing.

-Iâ€™ve felt suicidal off and on throughout the years. In the past two years, it seems progressively worse. 

-As cringey as it may be, Undertale has been one of the key factors keeping me here. Every time Iâ€™ve felt seriously suicidal, even did the whole â€œwait 24 hours and see how you feelâ€ thing, Iâ€™ve always negotiated with myself and said â€œwell, I wouldnâ€™t want to die before I finished Undertale. Itâ€™s a great game, itâ€™s my favorite game.â€ And always, I play it, and it fills me with such hope and feelings of love and care that I end up convincing myself out of it. You can call the fandom cancer, you can consider this stupid or foolish, but I just ask you to think: do you remember the first time you played your favorite game, or listened to your favorite song, or read your favorite book? That deep resonation of love, awe, and connection is what I get every time I open up the game. It feels like a dear long-seen friend, one that I reconnect with. One that has kept me alive.

-Iâ€™m literally almost done with the game, and I just... I canâ€™t. I canâ€™t open it, because if I finish it, Iâ€™ll have nothing left, but sitting here I feel like such shit I donâ€™t know how Iâ€™m going to persevere without it. Iâ€™m at another point where I have no support, Iâ€™m at risk of losing everything, and I just donâ€™t know how to move forth. Most of all, Iâ€™m so just incredibly tired of all of this. Like many people here, Iâ€™m so tired of fighting. Iâ€™m even tired of redemption, of feeling good. 

And this all feels so silly, and Iâ€™m mad at myself for thinking it silly, and just... fuck. Please be kind, please try not to judge, and please just... just help me. Please.

P.S.: Sorry I didnâ€™t keep it brief after all.

Edit: I want to say more, but Iâ€™m going to sleep (not, uh, the forever kind of sleep, but the normal kind). Iâ€™ll respond more in the morning, but for now, thank you all so much for responding. Iâ€™m going to do my best to reply, but taking what you all said in consideration helped me calmed down. I canâ€™t thank you enough for your empathy, nonjudgment, and support. You guys really saved me here tonight.
