I think I OD'ed myself over the past 12 hoursUsing a throwaway here, cuz yeah. I fucking hate the holidays now. My family is gone. I'm in my late 40s and can barely leave my house anymore. I got on a binge of pills today (yesterday?) and haven't slept. I figured I'd just take what I had left and whatever happens, happens. I feel so alone though.
