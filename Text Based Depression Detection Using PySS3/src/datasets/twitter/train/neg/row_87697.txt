Iâ€™m having thoughts of ending my life.I confronted my husband about a text (a flirtatious compliment) that I accidentally saw on his phone, which I then scrolled a little further and saw few more of the similar fashion. I wanted to think it was platonic but given past history my mind refused to believe it. So when I asked about it he said the girl was depressed and he was trying to cheer her up was the implication of what he said. He never says nice things like this to me? Even when I was drowning postpartum, struggling with my appearance and all the changes that had suddenly become too real. 

He got mad at me for even considering it, and now Iâ€™m here crying and rummaging my mind for some solace but he is sleeping. I feel like I mean nothing to him. I am having so many conflicting thoughts. Am I overreacting? Should I apologise to him for looking at his text? 

I have handled my big feelings all on my own for way too long. I need someone to comfort me. But I also donâ€™t want to tell my friends or family whoâ€™s probably going to say very cliche things and I donâ€™t want to listen to that. 

Do I have a bigger problem here? Am I sick? Iâ€™m so lost.
