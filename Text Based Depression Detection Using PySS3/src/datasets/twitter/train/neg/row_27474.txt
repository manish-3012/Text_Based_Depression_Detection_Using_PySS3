I just wanna know hoe to get my hands on some heliumI have it all planned out like itâ€™s just another day. I could disappear for days and no one would report me missing. It would take days to find me and people would likely stumble upon the location by accident. Thereâ€™s no way to fail.

But I canâ€™t get my hands on the god damn helium. 5 months of wishing I had the guts to do it and 3 weeks of wishing I had the means. I fucking hate life.
