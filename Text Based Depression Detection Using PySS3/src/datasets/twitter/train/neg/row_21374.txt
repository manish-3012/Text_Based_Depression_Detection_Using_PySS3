I've been really close this week. I almost did Tuesday and I'm glad I didn't. It's hard to imagine who you're affecting (effecting) when you end your life. I'm seriously close to it because of various reasons but thank you.
I don't want to cause people harm and as horrible as it is, it's better to just exist in a miserable state than kill yourself.
I have lots of troubles but I can't imagine my parents bawling.
