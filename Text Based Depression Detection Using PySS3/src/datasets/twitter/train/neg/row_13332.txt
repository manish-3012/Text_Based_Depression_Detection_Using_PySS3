Iâ€™m a dad and a boyfriend but apparently not a good one of either.This is all over the place but PLEASE try to bear with me i quite literally have nobody i can talk to about this besides reddit.

Iâ€™m 21. My daughter is 3 months. My stepdaughter is about to turn 3.

My relationship is horrible. All we do is fight every day and apparently everything is always my fault. I have horrible anger issues and this leads to me hitting the wall or something during an argument. I try to do everything i can to prevent the argument but once it hits a certain point of it, i canâ€™t help myself but feed in. My stepdaughter saw me hit the wall before. Tonight she did it on her own and her mother that she learned it from me.

All my girlfriendâ€™s friends were friends of mine from before our relationship that are now better friendsâ€™ of herâ€™s. She tells them about how horrible i am and how â€œabusive and controllingâ€ i am and now they have this idea of me that i never want to be associated with. 

Sheâ€™s constantly subtweeting about how awful i am and itâ€™s literally to the point where if i leave, i fear sheâ€™s going to make a direct post about how â€œawful i amâ€ and ruin my reputation and make me lose all my friends or if i stay, itâ€™s only going to get worse.

I hate this all so much because i still fucking love her. I hear about how i â€œdonâ€™t pay attention to the kidsâ€ all the time and sheâ€™s told me before that she thinks iâ€™m a bad parent even though i do everything i absolutely can for my kids.

If it wasnâ€™t for them, iâ€™d have been out of here forever ago but i can never bring myself to do it now.
