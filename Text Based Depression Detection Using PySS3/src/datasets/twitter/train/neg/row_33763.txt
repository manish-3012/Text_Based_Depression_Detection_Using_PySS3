Depression is coming back...I've always had a "suicidal" part of me, since I was a kid. I tried twice, but both times my sister entered the room just in time and went to tell our mother who lost it and called all the "pros" there are.

I [M30] am now in a not so great relationship which will likely end this year if nothing happens.

The worst part with this kind of depression from which I suffer is that I don't know why I feel this way. It's the exact same feeling from when I was in my early teens. It's a feeling of complete loneliness (even though I'm not lonely, I, for now, have a gf and I have my two kids).

Is a feeling of not knowing what and if there can be anything done to kill the pain.

This feeling is the only one who ever made me consider finishing it all. There's no "antidote". 

I don't know what I want, so it's pretty impossible to find a solution, unless it's final.

**Anyone who can relate or who's in a similar situation?**
