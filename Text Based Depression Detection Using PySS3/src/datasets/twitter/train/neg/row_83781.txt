What is betterSo I have decided to hang myself and I need your opinion on something. Do I do it in my room for my parents to find me or do I do it in the woods for some random dude to find me. I have the means to do both but I don't like the fact that (not meaning this as a joke, hopefully people here went like Logan fucking Paul the piece of shit) someone could find me and record me and put me on the internet, I wouldn't care but if my family saw it they would be devistated.
