Close to suicideIâ€™ve never been the best at explaining my emotions but iâ€™m 18 currently and close to killing myself. ive had severe depression since 8yrs old and anxiety since first grade. i started cutting in 8th grade, have tons of scars on my thighs and just started again recently. i was too scared/embarrassed to tell anyone how i felt growing up so i never actually got a diagnosis but i know thereâ€™s something else thatâ€™s wrong with me cuz iâ€™m so fucked up. i could list a whole bunch of mental issues im suffering from, like dissociating, bipolar, smaller things etc. (i find it hard for me to not self diagnose, it gives me some sort of comfort if i relate to the symptoms of one thing because maybe then i know whatâ€™s wrong) from being molested multiple times before second grade, excessive yelling by parents at a young age (not exactly sure why but i canâ€™t remember most of my childhood, i guess due to trauma), choking myself when i was 9 multiple times, a bunch of other things like classic school situations, and a couple things iâ€™m not proud to admitso i wonâ€™t say led me to this state. iâ€™ve never had any real type of relationship with a girl, iâ€™m deathly afraid of talking to girls which makes me think iâ€™m gonna be alone for the rest of my life, both friends and partners. my best friend and only friend in the entire world, whoâ€™s helped me countless times because she can relate, barely cares about me anymore, sheâ€™s moving out of state and we havenâ€™t seen each other in forever even tho she said we would hangout before she left, and sheâ€™s leaving in a few days. i am sick of living this life that i hate, everyone says just hold on itâ€™ll get better but iâ€™m such a pessimist i truly believe some people donâ€™t ever get out of depression, or ever stop thinking about suicide or self harm, or anxiety. iâ€™m seeing a therapist and getting medication soon but i feel like none of itâ€™s going to help. iâ€™m at the end of my rope. i donâ€™t know what to do anymore. iâ€™m afraid of being a failure in life, i want to do something music but my anxiety prevents me from even recording anything. i donâ€™t have any energy or motivation, ive been drained of all my emotions and all thatâ€™s left is anger, hate and jealousy. i dropped out of school because of depression / marijuana addiction thatâ€™s still present, if i donâ€™t succeed at music iâ€™m gonna be stuxk at a shitty job i hate for the rest of my life. iâ€™m afraid of dying because who the fuck knows what happens after. all that existential crap debilitates me, the fact weâ€™re on a rock in space, aliens? i donâ€™t fucking know anymore iâ€™m rambling. 
i feel so hopeless, nothing matters anymore. thereâ€™s no point. i have some things that bring me incredibly small amounts of happiness, or a distraction from my problems but no energy to do them and i think â€œthereâ€™s no point if iâ€™m gonna kill myself soonâ€. i canâ€™t imagine me living another 60 years. i hate myself so much, i hate the world so much. i just want to end the pain. i donâ€™t even know why iâ€™m posting here. i have a plan to kill myself but iâ€™ll probably be too scared to actually do it. i have so many feelings towards my only friend, a lot of itâ€™s jealousy, anger, idk what else. she doesnâ€™t put any effort in the friendship, she knows i have bad anxiety socits hard for me to actually go out, after a fight we had i thought we were for the better but i still felt the same feelings after. a lot of things she said made m mad but if i tell her sheâ€™s just gonna leave me. iâ€™ve actually been trying to change, not do certain things i was doing to make her upset, trying to talk and have conversation more, TRYING to hang out and see her. but i guess she doesnâ€™t care enough to see me, even though she can see all her other friends so many times in the apparent â€œbusy schedule she has before collegeâ€. if i try to kill myself iâ€™ll end up in a hospital hold of some kind i just know it, iâ€™m scared of psych hospitals. i know iâ€™ll end up lying  to the doctors just to get out of there. iâ€™m truly afraid iâ€™ll try to kill myself soon. within the next two weeks. if anyone replies to this itâ€™ll shock me, iâ€™m surprised someone will care.
