TonightI will post on the Facebook group for pet rats, asking them to find a good home for my 4 babies. I care about them more than anything. Then I will text my boyfriend I love him and I will jump. I haven't thought about suicide in months but it's hit me so hard tonight it's unbearable. I'm taking my medication that has held for so long but it just doesn't feel like enough. My life is very stressful but honestly it's great, I don't know what's wrong with me. I just want everything- the anxiety the nausea the pain to stop. I don't really want to die but it's better than living life as the failure I am. I know I'm smart and funny and pretty and hardworking but there's something in me that makes me screw everything up. I have a clear plan to have my own home daycare in 5-10 years and I know I could do it,  I've already acomplished so much but the motivation I need to keep going just isn't there. It seams like the life of everyone I know could hinge on weather or not I get out of bed in the morning and I still wouldn't be able to do it. Am I just lazy or is it worse? Why can't I make myself do the dishes IT'S SO EASY. For every chore and task I fail to complete I just feel that much more pathetic and worthless. Maybe I should jump just to make everything stop
