What are you supposed to do when you're tired of talking?I've been suicidal ever since the time I almost attempted in 2006.  Anyone who's lived with this knows what it's like.  It feels like being an alcoholic but instead ideations of self harm are the drug I can't escape.

im self aware enough to know it's important to talk to someone when you're like this, so I do.  I talk to friends and loved ones who have a hard time understanding what I'm feeling but they mean well.  But increasingly when I get in a bad way I get less hesitant to talk with people.  It's like I've rung that bell too many times.  I'm afraid I'm just wearing them down with my negativity and soon anyone who cares will run away from me.  I wouldn't blame them.

So now here I am wanting to kill myself, felling like its a lot less of a matter of if but rather when, and I'm tired of talking.  I'm tired of looking for a sympathetic ear or a shoulder to cry on.  I feel like anything I could say has already been said.  Everyone's seen this episode a billion times and it's played out.

So what the hell do you do when talking to people no longer accomplishes anything?
