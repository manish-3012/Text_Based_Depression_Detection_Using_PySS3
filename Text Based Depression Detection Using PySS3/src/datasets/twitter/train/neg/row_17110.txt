They say one person can't make a differenceThey also say you can accomplish anything what you put your mind too.  


Please, I don't have the words just yet, I don't have the resources and I don't have the knowledge. All I have is a dream to help everyone I can.    


I hope you will hold on, just sit tight. There is no rush , you just live until tomorrow. Wake up in the morning and look at the sun, think of me.  Please know that there is someone out there who is putting his all towards a better future for you.  


I spent all my life destroying it to be able to create a new one for you, for me.  


 I am going to somehow do it. I will. We all just need to remember the pain will pass, we will be so much stronger than any thing. We will remember who we are forever and we will treat this world as it's ours.  
Because it is.  


You are worth it. Trust me. You have given a purpose to so many people. One day in the future you will look back at the nights your empty screams felt unheard. The nights you thought you did not exist. The moment's you thought happiness would never be apart of you.

We are all opening up to a new horizon, and I will be damned if I ever give up on any of you.  


Please, I beg you. Please just know I do love you, just as so many others do.
