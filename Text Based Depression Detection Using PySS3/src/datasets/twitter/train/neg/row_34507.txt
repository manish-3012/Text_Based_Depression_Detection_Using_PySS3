Family murdered breast cancer husband ABANDONED meI'm all alone. I'm fed up with working my ass off just to barely breath. I was ABANDONED by my husband fiance boyfriend (whatever he wanted to call himself or me) of over 18 years. I'm in his homestate hometown. No reason to even try to go back to my hometown no one is there. I can't take care of myself showering. Eating. 
My family was murdered in 2009. He was all I had left. But he abused me. I'm supposed to go to the police Monday and file rape and asualt charges. I already did that and it went nowhere. I can't stand what he's done to me. He vandalized my car and killed the motor. He has threatened to kill me in so many ways for years. 
I reached out to police and hospital about rape and pure exhaustion and cancer pain. They ended up taking me to a nut jail 51/50 hold. For what that I was raped. They don't know how to deal with cancer patients they were 16 hrs late on my meds I almost died in there. Anyone who ever says that's a good idea. They just made me suffer more. Has anyone overdosed on baclofen???
