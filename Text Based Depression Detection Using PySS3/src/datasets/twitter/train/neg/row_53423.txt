I don't know how to admit to my mother that I feel I am a failure, I am ashamed and I don't want to live anymore.I just need someone to know that I'm not okay, I feel like it is wrong to appear emotional or vulnerable to my friends or family and therefore I keep my personal struggles to myself most of the time, I feel that it is wrong to ask my mother for help as I feel my adolescent misdeeds and the negative relationship I have had in the past with my father have made me unworthy of her love and support. The reason I feel that I am failure is related to the fact that I am unemployed and have been since leaving school I have attended high learning facilities in the hopes of gaining the necessary skills to obtain meaningful employment though I achieved success in my education I just cannot seem to find work this has lead to obvious lack of quality in other aspects of my life mainly socially as well as financially I feel as if everything hinges on this one thing that always seems just out of reach. I feel so isolated and I see no other way but to end my life, please help me, I don't know what else to do.
