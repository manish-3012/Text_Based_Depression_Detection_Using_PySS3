Existential stuffCame to a realisation that ultimately my life is meaningless, and I highly doubt it'll get better. Often when I see beautiful people on TV or Internet, or just walking down the street I think to myself: "Wow, they do things. They accomplish shit". And then I can't help but think about me: weak and pathetic. My dreams are there only to be crushed. My goals are there only to be never reached. I seem to fail more than acceptable. What a fucking joke. And what's worse is the realisation that I'll never become great at something and I'll never know how it feels to be good at it. There'll be nothing left to remember about me. I don't think I can live knowing this. Maybe I should just end myself before it will all get even more pointless. Don't know what else to say.
Excuse the grammar.
