I don't want to do this anymore.Every day that passes by is a struggle. I don't eat. I can't sleep. I constantly worry about the future and what might happen. I feel like such a disappointment to everyone around me because I'm not strong enough to just be happy. I'm scared all the time.

I've lost so much weight. I have a bottle of pills in my purse that grows heavier every day. I can't live like this anymore. I can't do this anymore. It all hurts so much.
