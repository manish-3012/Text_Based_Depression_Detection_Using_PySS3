I can't get over being bullied as a kid. I'm going to end the anxietyIt hurts so bad. I'm 20 years old and I still haven't gotten over it. The things people used to say. It feels like knives in my chest and stomach. I want to throw up. I watched the 13rW season 2 finale, what happened to Tyler, and I was shaking the whole time. It conjured up all the same feelings, sensations. The nausea in the pit of my stomach each morning as I waited outside the school on that long line. The other girls, the boys, the things they would say. I feel so ashamed, embarrassed, for some reason. I feel so ashamed. Now I have a chronic diagnosed illness that causes constant pain. I feel like the bullies won. That doesn't make sense but it does in my mind. I'm in constant mental and physical pain and it feels like they won. And it's just going to get worse.

I'm too weak for this world. I'm too nice. I'm too kind. I'm soft. I'm soft and the world is too scary and people are too mean and I can't take it. People have told me "you'll never be able to live in the real world if you're this sensitive, you're too kind, you need to be tougher!" Everything hurts too much. The social anxiety, how the things the kids did to me are always in the back of my mind whenever I'm interacting with anyone. I can't forget it. I can't get over it. I've seen countless therapists. I've taken medication. It doesn't help. I want to throw up all the time. I can't get over what happened to me in middle school. I'm terrified of EVERYONE. Terrified. Terrified they're going to humiliate me and be mean to me again. I let people walk all over me. Literally nothing has helped. I want to die. I don't want to fight against it. I don't want to try anymore. It's painful and I'm so tired. I don't want advice or encouragement, please, I just want to die. I'm so so tired of trying. I'm so tired of trying to fight the fear and the pain.
