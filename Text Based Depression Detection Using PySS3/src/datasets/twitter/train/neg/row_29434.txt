For the first time in a long time, I feel okayI no longer have to worry about unemployment or dropping out of school, about my loneliness and the people who failed me, about my dark dark future. I feel like a heavy weight is lifted. Because that future doesn't exist anymore. I'm going in to take my last bath and I won't come back out alive. And I'm okay with that. I feel okay.
