I miss feeling actively suicidalA month or two ago I was incredibly suicidal. I would try to plan it. Every day it was a serious thought in my mind. With time I slowly become numb to it. This was for the better, right? But no.. It feels worse. I am not doing anything at all with my life. I am still unmotivated and lost and I have given up. I want those strong suicidal feelings to come back so I can feel something again and go through with it. 
This probably doesn't make any sense and I don't know how to explain it further but maybe one of you out there can relate.
