A friend is saying he will commit suicide today. I don't know exactly where he is and he won't promise anyone his safety or talk more to us about it. HelpEverywhere says to call 911 or his local emergency department, but what about when he's somewhere far away from me, and I also dont know his exact location? 

What do I do here? He is homeless and no one else knows where he is either. I have his name, his picture, his phone number, and the general area he's in (like, as in, just the state/county.......). He is heavily intoxicated and has a specific time he said he's going to kill himself. I helped him get off the streets and get resources just a few days ago, so I'm not sure what's going on now, but he wont talk to me further.

I'm really lost. Who do I call? What can I do? Is what info I have enough to find him? I don't know if he's inside somewhere or outside, I don't know how he got to the county he says he's in now, I don't know ...... I dont know. Please, any advice
