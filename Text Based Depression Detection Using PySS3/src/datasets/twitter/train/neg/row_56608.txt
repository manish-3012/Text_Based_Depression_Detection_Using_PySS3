I donâ€™t know where else to put thisMy fiancee just left me. Iâ€™ve been out of work for 6 weeks recovering from a knee surgery. Iâ€™ve been living off of 2/3 of my paycheck so all my bills are late. My depression is the worst I think itâ€™s ever been. Iâ€™m really thinking about killing myself tonight.
