I donâ€™t see a future for myselfI donâ€™t see a future for myself.

I am 19 years old, and Iâ€™ve felt this way for a while now. At least 5 years. 

I am I lost cause. I never excelled in school work or hobbies, never made any meaningful relationships. Iâ€™ve set myself up for failure on a fundamental level. Making long-lasting friends is hard and nearly impossible for me, and I have no clue why. 

I was born in a country in europe and have moved back and forth due to my dads job. This has caused me to have an identity crisis. This also forced me to have to make new friends all the time. I was never able to make strong friendships with people, and if I ever returned they would have vanished. Now that I have settled down and started university you would think that itâ€™d be easier, but no. I feel like there is something wrong with me.

Now with corona things have been impossible to bear. I started seeing a therapist not too long ago but I donâ€™t think it will help me in the long run. I envy people with strong friend groups, and wish I was in their shoes. Nobody else is to blame for how I am, itâ€™s all my fault.

All of this has accumulated and left me with a shattered self-esteem, both physically and personality wise. I try to stay occupied, but as my bad thoughts take over I can barely find the energy to do anything, and my grades and facings the consequences of that. 
 
The future I see for myself is bleak, and short lived. I feel like everything is starting to topple over, everything good I have ever had.

The only thing that has kept me from killing myself is my family. I have always seen suicide as a selfish act to those around them, but as the days go by being labeled as selfish and letting all of this end doesnâ€™t seem like such a bad thing.

Does anyone have any suggestions on what I should do.
