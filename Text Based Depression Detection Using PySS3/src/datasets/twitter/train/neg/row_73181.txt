Rough draftI know the word "sorry" seems empty, but I can't muster up anything else. All I can think of to say is that I completely know what I am doing. 


I leave this world because the mental illness mountain feels insurmountable to climb. Treatment, love and support from others, nature, kindness and many opportunities later and I am still standing here unable to feel hope or reprise.


I feel haunted by fear that no longer exists, but has burrowed into my body. I truly tried to have a different ending, one of resiliency and strength against trauma, mental illness and setbacks. 


 I don't know how else to stop the ache and guilt that eats at my core because I know there is light and life out there, but I am unable to welcome it inside me. I don't know if there is human left inside anymore and it pains me to be a fraud taking up space.
