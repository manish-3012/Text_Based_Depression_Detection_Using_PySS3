Tonight's the nightI'm not like anyone else, or at least anyone else I've ever met. I've been on meds for 3 weeks now to treat my "depression", but it hasn't done shit. I have felt worse and worse everyday until now, when I've finally realized what must be done. Everyone says that I have tremendous potential, and that I'll definitely be doing great things one day. My teachers are constantly talking about how I'm the smartest kid in class, but have the lowest grades because I don't actually do anything. They don't get it. When you plan on ending your own fucking life at 16, homework and grades don't mean shit. When you spend every weekend and night sitting home alone and crying yourself to sleep, whatever minor relationships you make don't matter. Why bother living if I'm nothing but a failure so far, my future is bright but I cannot bear the present any longer. Tonight is the night, yet I can only announce this to anonymous strangers online. Thanks for reading/listening.
