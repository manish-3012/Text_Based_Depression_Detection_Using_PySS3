I was doing oki think I was doing ok for a while, i was able to talk to friends and be productive for some of the day but now i am not so well anymore

it's kind of like a constant tug of war going on in my head where sometimes i think everything will be ok and i can do better but then other days everything kinda crushes me again

i am trying my best but sometimes i feel like it is not enough
