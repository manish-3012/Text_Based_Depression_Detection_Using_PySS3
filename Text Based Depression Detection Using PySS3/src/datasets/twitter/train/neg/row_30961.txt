Does anyone else get upset from reading posts in here?I mean, this is basicialy a place for people who thinks about suicide. This is also the reason why I subscribed, I have been thinking about suicide.

There's a lot of posts. Of course not all of them is real, but even if I read one of those that turnes into real, I would feel so bad.

I know world is big and reddit is worldwide site, but still feel bad. How we gonna know if someone really attemps suicide?
