Doc 2Logical thinking

All of my life Iâ€™ve been taught order and discipline when in turn, life is utter chaos and mayhem. Iâ€™ve always tried to be good, not to hurt anyone physically or mentally and in turn Iâ€™ve gotten hurt. Iâ€™ve watched people do things I wasnâ€™t supposed to do and sure, most of the times theyâ€™d get caught and punished. Iâ€™ve always thought that those people would not progress in life just because of that kind of behavior, but this isnâ€™t a movie isnâ€™t it, itâ€™s real life. The very same people that used to make my growing up harder are now living a more fulfilled life than me. With friends, girlfriends, jobs, money, cars. The list goes on. So, whatâ€™s the deal? Whereâ€™s my reward for leading a disciplined life? Here you go, cancer for you and a hot girlfriend and money for your bully. Seems right. This is what happens in puberty in my opinion. It is then when you burst your bubble and realize that it wonâ€™t be always sunny, heck, it rains shit most of the time. 
When you think about it, everything is for nothing. â€œNothingâ€ has a big point, a reason. â€œItâ€™sâ€ not existing because you were good or bad. â€œItâ€ is because it is. The true enlightenment brings doom instead of bliss. Our very existence is the result of a very lucky random coincidences. Not because of some divine beingâ€™s will. Thatâ€™s actually why people invented religion, not to go mad, to give purpose to their lives. A false purpose. We are all just animals, and our sentience is a mistake in evolutionâ€™s steps. Our core reason to be alive, as stupid as it sounds, is to reproduce. Thatâ€™s it. Everything on the side is there to fill up time until the next fuck because we have evolved so far up to double our life expectancy in just the last 100 years. Everything I do, everything everyone does, doesnâ€™t matter. We are all going to die eventually, and so are our children and grandchildren and so on. So why? Why bother?
