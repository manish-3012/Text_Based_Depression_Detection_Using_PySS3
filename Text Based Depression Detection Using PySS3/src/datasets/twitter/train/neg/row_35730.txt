coming to tough realizationsive been depressed/suicidal for a pretty decent amount of time, but recently a cousin of mine passed away from taking his own life. he was only 21, and im 3 years younger. it was my first funeral, and seeing my family mourning so strongly, made me rethink how I've thought about life.

he was SO loved, 400-500 people ended up showing up to the funeral, and they all were devastated. his friends all said he was known to take on the baggage of his friends an try to help but never had anyone there for him when he wanted to talk, which is exactly how i feel.

idk, seeing someone i personally knew and loved get buried 6 feet under the world he was supposed to walk on a conquer, made me think maybe i don't wanna be dead but just happy? i don't know to achieve said happiness though. idk. just some thoughts I've been having, thanks to anyone to reads.
