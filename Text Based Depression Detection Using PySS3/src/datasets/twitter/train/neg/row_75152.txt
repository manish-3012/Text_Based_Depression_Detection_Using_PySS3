I want to hurt everyone as much as they've hurt meI just can't take it anymore. I took a sleeping pill last night just to force myself not to do anything stupid
Been suicidal since I was 7, had so many hours of therapy and medication to fix my bipolar, OCD, PTSD, and it all seems in vain. Found out I have a dissociative disorder and I'm not the only one living in my body. The man I was seeing was helping me through all of this for a year now, but yesterday was so horrible. I asked why he actively hides me from his friends, that he knows everything about them but avoids letting on that I even exist when they ask if he's seeing anyone. He said we're "not in a fucking relationship" so why would he mention me. I love him so much it hurts, I thought he loved me.
I always think they love me. They don't. I've been abused, neglected, and left to struggle on my own my whole life. My family thinks I'm self sufficient, I've worked so hard to get to 22, but I don't want to live to see 23. I want to hurt everyone who's ever hurt me, I want them to have to cry at my funeral wondering if they could've changed my mind. I want the chronic pain to stop, I want my brain to shut down so I don't have to think anymore, I want to vanish into thin air and never come back. I want to take my Xanax and wash it down with whiskey for the rest of the day until I pass out. It's just not worth being awake anymore.
