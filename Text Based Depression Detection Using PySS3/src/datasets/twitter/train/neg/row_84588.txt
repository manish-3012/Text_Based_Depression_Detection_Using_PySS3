a slow deathjacob drank the rest of the bottle. he emptied it as much as his life that he could into this. he wished he were better, but he wasn't. he tried his best to alleviate the suffering through distraction. it didn't work. his birthday was in a week. he'd be 29 years old, and his life would be meaningless. all this time spent alive, wasted. both literally and figuratively. he wanted the meds to work, but they didn't. the pain was still there. the suicidal thoughts overrode him. they erased what little was left. alcohol made him more honest at least. what he had done was unforgivable. he deserved to suffer, he deserved this pain. at least he could make this right, this was all he could control, the suffering. so he suffered for 6 years. but was it enough? could the sweet release of suicide save him? did he deserve to die? Well, he was afraid of death. so his subconscious decided to kill him instead, through over eating. and it was slow and painful. but one day he will be free. one day the suffering will end. one day he will be dead
