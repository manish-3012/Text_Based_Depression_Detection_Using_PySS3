So it's been awhile (I guess)I am in this "group" since couple of months. I don't want to tell you about my past it really doesn't feel good to go back and think how my life was back then. Since November my life changed a bit I've met someone and now we are together. It's really weird to think about other stuff than suicide and how the world sucks but at the same time I am very thankful and happy to have someone I can share time and thoughts with. It helps me to be someone I always wanted to be. Just a normal guy. Now I have motivation to find a job and do something better with my life. But I am afraid of losing her I don't want to give her feeling that I don't trust her. Every day I think about her and how I can lose this relationship between us two because of myself and selfish thoughts. 

So can you guys give me any help how to change my mind ? Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you 
Simon
