I need to vent...I suffer from depression. Medically diagnosed. Last suicide attempt: May 26th, 2017. Self harm... not as frequent but still do. Went to therapy until I started college September 2018. Recovery been good, with some downs, but never actively suicidal since May 26th, 2017. 

Been in a relationship of about 6-1/2 months now. Boyfriend is much more stable than me. But has his downs. Always deals with them on his own. Doesn't tell me.

Well about an hour ago he confided he almost decided to kill himself this morning. I feel hollow. I was upset at him for not discussing his feelings from earlier this week so I ignored him until a few hours ago... and learning this, I feel so selfish and awful. I could have helped. But I haven't done anything but been selfish. He says I keep him from doing stuff, that I make him happy. But it's those memories of before. 

I am so selfish, and so so terribly sorry that I couldn't be there for him, that I can't be someone he can turn to. I'm sorry...

I feel so numb and empty and just unable to focus. I have school stuff to do in about 10 minutes and I just don't want to bring myself to do it. I want to die. I want my boyfriend to find someone better than me to help him and make him feel better, someone he can actually turn to, someone not selfish and pathetic and worthless like me. He deserves so much better...

I'm so sorry... forgive my ranting, and I'm sorry if you read this... I'm sorry for wasting your time....
