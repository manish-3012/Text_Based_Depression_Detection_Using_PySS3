I'm a bad person, an idiot, and a failure. I am [28/M], and have nothing. Going to end everything tonightIt dawned on me. that I am an evil awful person. I am also a failure. 

I have to go to Court Wednesday for texting while driving AND not wearing a seatbelt. I can't pay it, I have to see a judge. I may lose my license and become homeless. 

I can't live anymore, that's why I am overdosing tonight. I already wrote my note.
