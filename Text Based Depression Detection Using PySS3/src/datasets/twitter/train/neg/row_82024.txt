Being pushed but judgement when Iâ€™m dead stops me.Iâ€™m 26/F
I just want to die, itâ€™s this imploding feeling that I sit back and watch myself do.
I live with my mum and dad and younger sister,
The only reason Iâ€™m still here is because of my sister.
My mother is very much like me and I constantly see her own mental health issues.
It makes me realise that that is where Iâ€™m going and makes it seem even more pointless.
Life is just to much recently with the stresses of work and uni, I want to take a break from uni but my families judgement is to much.
3 months ago I broke my shoulder and it stopped me doing a lot of the things I use to like the gym and be able to work.
This injury has broken me mentally and the only way I found to cope was to turn my pain into distraction by pursuing a guy I liked and talking to him everyday over the past 4 months.
As of yesterday I finally decided to set things straight and have it confirmed that he doesnâ€™t want to lead me on... fair he did it in a nice way but I feel like thatâ€™s it then because he did distant himself and I should just leave him alone.
Between all this happening I just feel like a pest to him, my friends, my colleagues and my parents.
No one really knows the suffering I have been feeling lately and I know if I kill myself everyone will be like blah blah blah she killed herself over this guy.
Thatâ€™s not true at all.
I want to kill myself because Iâ€™m over this repeative means of life, the last few years are constantly the same and Iâ€™m watching people come and go out of my life and I feel stuck.
Iâ€™m just over existing.
