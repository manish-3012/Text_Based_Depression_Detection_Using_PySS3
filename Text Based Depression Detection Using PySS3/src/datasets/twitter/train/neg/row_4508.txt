Please for the sake of my son, help meIâ€™m so weak. The only light in my life is the smile on my sonâ€™s face. But Iâ€™m starting to get so physically weak, I get too tired to take care of him after 3 hours or so. Iâ€™m consulting with a sleep clinic tomorrow after years of sleep paralysis, loss of breath during sleep, constant nightmares, and now shakes.

My abusive mother has fucked me up so much. 

Iâ€™m autistic too. I have meltdowns. 

Even though he hurt my feelings first, if I fight back, Iâ€™m the bad guy in my husbandâ€™s eyes. I say he doesnâ€™t care about me, he becomes cold and unsympathetic, and says I hurt him. Then leaves. 

This post is all over the place, I know. My mind is so fucked up right now. I wanna kill myself. But at the same time I really donâ€™t want to. I love my son so much and donâ€™t want to hurt him. My brain is fighting with my heart. And Iâ€™m getting so tired, and weak. 

Help my heart defeat my brain. So I can live for my little boy.
