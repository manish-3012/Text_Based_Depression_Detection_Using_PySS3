i want to kill myselflet me start off by saying, im 17, and i have what seems to be a great life. i have a great family and have a roof over my head. but i have never felt complete in my life. i have never felt like i truly know what hapliness is. im not
good at anything, you name it. sports, tried all of
them couldnt do shit, school, failed everyclass. i have major social anxiety which leads to losing friends. i have one friend who is fucking beautiful, and i really enjoy her company. but i feel as though she doesnt feel the same, i feel she hangs out with me to make me feel better about myself. i have wanted to kill myself for many reasons, one of them is to escape this empty feeling and one is to see what it is like after death. but i cant put this pain into my family. i cant bring myself to commit suicide bc i know that the pain will just be stored somewhere else. i just feel like i have nothing to live for, nobody to live for. i know no one is reading this far, but i do plan on killing my self when the right time comes. i just need to feel something, i am done feeling like i dont have purpose
