I'm beyond disappointed in myself.I'm just going to say it: today I found out my ex is with someone else, and I just can't take it.
This happened last year as well, and other than him breaking up with me, it was the most gut-wrenching, excruciating thing I've ever been through, seeing him gush all over another girl, the way he should have been doing with me. 
This time around, I just graduated so I never need to see him again. But oh my god, my stomach is just in knots and I feel paralyzed.
So many thoughts are swirling around in my mind. Why wasn't I good enough? Why did he insist he didn't want a relationship with anyone, just to turn around and get with someone else? And why am I so fucking upset that he could possibly be happy without me? Why the hell do I feel this need to have some kind of control over him? Oh my god I hate myself for it. I don't want to feel this way.
My mind is so warped and toxic, I just can't get him out of my head, can't stop thinking about how he's going to lose his virginity to someone other than me, how he's going to love someone more than he loved me, how someone is going to make him happier than I did.
I have this horrible echo chamber in my mind in which a chorus of "it should be me, not her, it should be ME, it should be ME ME ME ME MEMEMEMEMEMEMEME" is bouncing around and killing me from the inside. Why am I so fucking narcissistic that the thought of this boy, who wasn't even with me very long, dating someone else fills me with jealousy and rage and pain?
I'm so afraid that I'll be doomed to always be this jealous and obsessive over my ex. I don't want this. If I could just move on I would have a very long time ago. I didn't even want to make this post because I'm so fucking ashamed of myself for still being this fucking obsessed and bitter. I hate myself for it, I really do. And if I can't move on from this one stupid piece of shit that dragged me through hell and fucked me over, is living really worth it?
