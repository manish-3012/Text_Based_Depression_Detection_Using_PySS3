17 Year Relationship Ended by SuicideMy life partner of 17 years lost his battle with depression 7 weeks ago. He hung himself in our garage and I found him. His depression has always been manageable with a few dark clouds here and there. I never saw this coming in a million years. ðŸ˜” We had a beautiful life together. 
My reason for posting in this thread is now Iâ€™m having similar feelings that I donâ€™t want to live anymore. Iâ€™ve done a bunch of research and there is a term for what Iâ€™m feeling called â€œWidowhood Effectâ€.  I am wanting to end my life but donâ€™t even know where to start. I have looked up a lot of different methods but the one that stands out most for me is Inert gas asphyxiation with nitrogen (suicide bag) or charcoal burning. I hate that my life has come to this but I miss my partner too much to care anymore. I just want it all to end but donâ€™t know where to begin. Sigh!
