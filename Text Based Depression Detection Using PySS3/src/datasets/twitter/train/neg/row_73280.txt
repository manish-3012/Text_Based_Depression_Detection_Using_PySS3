When was the last time I slept at a decent time, or at allI scroll through pages of posts in forums from people who don't want to live. It doesn't make me feel not alone. It solidifies everything I feel. . you can be put on hold by the suicide hotline.and then people wonder why some people dont see the point in anything.

I've been suicidal since childhood. How can anything motivate me to get better when this is all I remember? Every time I look for a way out the walls close in a bit more.
