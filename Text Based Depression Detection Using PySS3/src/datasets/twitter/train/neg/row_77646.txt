If my mom dies during surgery tomorrow, that's it for meI've had the possibility of her dying over my head since I was little. I always knew she wouldn't make it past 60. Doctors are even amazed she's made it to 50. Just a huge list of health problems. And I know I can't cope with her death. Whatever progress I've made with my depression and anxiety will be gone, and I'll just end my life altogether.
