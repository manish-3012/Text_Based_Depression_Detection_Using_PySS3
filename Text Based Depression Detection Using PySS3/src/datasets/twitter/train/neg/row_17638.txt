Last glimmer of hope left todayToday my absolute Best friend in the world whose stayed with me through everything including my fiancÃ©s Suicide last year, broke an 11 year promise. We talked about it and he just stood his ground, unwilling to go back and fix the promise which was and is still totally doable . But he just.....wonâ€™t. Heâ€™s never lied to me, ever. Never once let me down.... and for him to break this 11 year packed, bond, promise, whatever.... I almost donâ€™t believe it. Itâ€™s like Ricardo is dying  all over again, but this time itâ€™s my best friend and my future.... and heâ€™s the one doing it..... how did we get here...? How did my savior become my torturer???
