If I goI um I donâ€™t think I want to live anymore. I felt this way for a while
I donâ€™t have anyone who cares about me
So if I go I want to say bye
I want anyone who is kind and loving to protect themself, know herpes is real lol, donâ€™t ever not use protection not even for 16 seconds!
I want to... tell my sister I tried. I really did. Iâ€™m just not superhuman
I want to tell someone whoâ€™s feeling numb I get it I get how painful the numbness is like ur body knows that with this combo of things, itâ€™s not worth it
I um
I want to say I get ur pain, and I hope someone cares and listens
And if no one listens, esp if youâ€™ve been thru abuse, particularly abuse by a narcissist I get it. Ur not crazy
I um I want to have a letter but Iâ€™m not sane enough to write one, and no one would want to read it anyway
I want to say sorry to the younger generation 
The fucked up issues of the US shouldnâ€™t fall on you
I want to tell everyone that hurt me.. why, and ok you win
I want to the therapist who told me to just get better... wtf lol
And um to anyone with a mom that you know deep down somehow was not a mom, I love you. You are fine exactly how you are! You are beautiful, you are capable, and if I had a daughter, you can always cry! We can find out why youâ€™re crying so you feel happy again
