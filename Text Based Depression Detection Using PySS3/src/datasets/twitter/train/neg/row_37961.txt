I miss himMy friend, my life long crush that I was to scared to act on, is dead. He was hit and died on impact. I miss, him, and I know if Iâ€™m gone I can see him again. Iâ€™ll be happy and peaceful if Iâ€™m gone. I just want to go home and be with everyone Iâ€™ve lost. Itâ€™s so much easier than this place Iâ€™m stuck. I miss him so goddamn much.
