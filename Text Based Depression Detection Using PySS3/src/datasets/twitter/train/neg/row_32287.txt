Flirting with deathSomething that I enjoy doing a lot is flirting with death. I love the idea of suicide but I know I'm too afraid to do it and I dont think I ever will. I'm afraid that I do it for attention in an unconscious or semi conscious cry for help.....and the more conscious I become of that covert type of manipulative tactic, the more suicidal I become. As I type this right now I'm not sure if I'm being manipulative just to grab someone's attention or if this is how I genuinely feel, I really don't know......all I know is that I'm numb.....but sometimes I cry and sometimes I get angry, and pushing myself to my limits is the only thing that makes me feel anything but I'm afraid if I keep acting in this manner something bad might happen. I dont know what to do but I'm open to changing. I'm 110% open to changing for the better if anyone has any type of constructive advice?
