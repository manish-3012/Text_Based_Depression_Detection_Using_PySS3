I donâ€™t know how to handle thisI guess this is one of the more personal times Iâ€™ve shared with the Internet. 
I feel like Iâ€™m losing my grip on reality, I feel like Iâ€™m unwell to the point of wanting to kill myself over a relationship. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. I try to keep going but I canâ€™t. I donâ€™t feel I can anymore, I donâ€™t want to tell anyone close to me about this because with Self-isolation itâ€™ll just make everything worse. I know it sounds stupid, wanting to kill yourself over a relationship but I canâ€™t do this anymore. I canâ€™t fix anything anymore. I canâ€™t fix myself, my issues or anything. I keep trying to keep my head above water but itâ€™s so hard... 
please, Iâ€™m sorry to whoever reads this. I just need to get this out of my system before my head explodes. Thanks for listening I guess.. Iâ€™m sorry.
