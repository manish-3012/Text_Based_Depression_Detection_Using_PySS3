I'm heavily suicidal and depressed, I just want to end it all.I am a former sex worker with ptsd, borderline personality and major social anxiety that has stemmed from having withdrawn and burnt bridges with all my friends over the last couple of months. Living has no purpose,  this world is so sad and depressing and I have no motivation to finish uni and work for the rest of my life. I can't even sleep properly because I'm woken up by the slightest noise and ruminate on everything bad I've done and that's happened to me.  The love of my life is dating someone else and my anger and personality disorder ruined that relationship.  I have no friends and I live at home with my depressed mum and depressed brother. I can't get out of bed anymore and when I do,  it's only to binge eat and then go back to bed. I dont listen to music or do anything interesting, I am a shell of my former self. I'm so suicidal, please help.
