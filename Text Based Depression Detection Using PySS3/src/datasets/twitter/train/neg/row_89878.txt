I wish I was strong enoughI don't really care for life right now, but I'm afraid of death because my brain can't comprehend nonexistence. I'm scared of the pain... I'm scared of dealing with reality if I fail. I know that fearlessness is the key that I'm missing. Suicide is a cocktail of loneliness, hopelessness, and most importantly fearlessness. Without that ability to overcome our most basic human instincts, I don't know if I'll ever be able to go through with it. But I know I wish I was.
