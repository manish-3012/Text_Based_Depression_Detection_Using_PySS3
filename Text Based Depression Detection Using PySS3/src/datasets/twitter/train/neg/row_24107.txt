F my life thinking of ending it very soonI've been to emotional in my life and thats the problem. My life was chill unitl i left high school now iam 21. Suicidal thoughts came in last year

No friends, have social anxiety, NARCISSISTIC AS FUCK, family doesn't understand cuz they resent me and prob will be ashame of me if i tell then the truth. I dont average at appearance but have zero social skills when it comes to girls. I've never held a real conversation with anyone because iam shy. I thought i had the world figured out in high school but the real world is much nastier. All i do is sit in my room play video games and imagine what real happiness feels like. Iam not afraid of anything and thats a fact. I hate god for putting me in this emotional, torturous cage of a life, I'd prefer hell at least it be somewhat less painful. Not afraid to die just waiting fort the right time or a fu*king miracle.
