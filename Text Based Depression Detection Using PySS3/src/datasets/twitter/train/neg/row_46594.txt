I think I need help.Iâ€™m not really new to this.... but I guess I kind of am?  

Long story short, I recently started working with one of my parents at their office. 

Their boss loves me, and I was very excited about it. 

But one thing I forgot to mention. 
My parent is definitely a narcissist. 

They can do no wrong, but I was born wrong. 

I just got off of a 12am phone call with them, which pertained to them telling me that I would â€œruin our relationship foreverâ€ if I cost her the promotion she wants. 

But I work in the back of the office. I donâ€™t speak unless spoken to by her coworkers, and even then I am reserved and try to think before I speak. 

It isnâ€™t good enough. They told me so. 

That I am a wreck. That I havenâ€™t been wearing enough makeup or looking â€œprettyâ€ enough. 

And when I try to voice my logic into the conversation.... I am told they will take it into their own hands and be sure I am fired. 

Normally I can handle most of the narcissistic bullsh*t they throw at me. 

But my amazing support system (DearBoyfriend) is away for the week. 

I am laying in bed, sobbing. 

I am laying in bed thinking of ways to make the situation better. 

All I can come up with is to remove myself from the situation. 

Permanently. 

I think it might make life a little easier for them all. More breathing room without my mistakes... 

I sit here and contemplate... pills? Iâ€™ve got some that would work. 

Drowning in the bathtub? Maybe it would be peaceful. 

Maybe even the generic slitting of wrists. 

I just donâ€™t want my insides to ache like this anymore. 

I donâ€™t want to feel at all.
