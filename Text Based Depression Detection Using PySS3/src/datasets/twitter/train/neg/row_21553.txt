I think suicide is a reasonable option, even if it's selfishI have a history of depression , even attempted suicide in 8th grade, So I've grown a think skin to take emotional pain , so I can say I am thinking with a clear mind for the most part.


Now , I'm in my mid 20s , my family is getting old , siblings getting married assets getting divided . My parents will be  too old to take care of themselves in few years, they want me to get married in few months and settle down, I don't want to pull anyone into the shitshow of a life that I have, even if they marry me for my money.

I know as how things are , my sibling will not do that well in life , they will just become lower middle-class trash like myself. But if I give up my share of the assets and property , my sibling will have a wonderful life , their kids can live in decent Life. They will have bit more money to take care of my parents.


I'm still working up a good plan , I have few things planned. first I move out of the country by taking a job. Then I distance myself from the family and sound like a jerk.

2 years down the line they would have probably given up on me and won't take the news too hard.. then hope my will will take care of the rest.
