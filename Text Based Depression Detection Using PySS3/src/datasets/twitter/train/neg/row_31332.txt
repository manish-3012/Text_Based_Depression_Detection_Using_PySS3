One last tryso after years of moping around, being stuck in the same dead end job and generally not enjoying being alive i have decided to quit my shitty job and re-apply for college, i see this as my last try at giving life ago. If i do get accepted i will give everything i can to not go off the rails! in the past where i would say to my self and others im going to do something and then never do, i will keep this updated if i get on the course for anyone who cares, for the first time in many, many years i feel hopeful! 

Edit 1- I have been given an interview but because of money problems not to sure ill be able to attend even if i get accepted, im happy i had the strength to try though!
