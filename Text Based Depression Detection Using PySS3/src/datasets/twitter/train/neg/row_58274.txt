How long will it take for people to get over it once I'm gone?this may seem silly buy I have autism and don't understand human emotions at all, their thought patterns grieving processes and things like that. I'm planning on committing suicide on or near my 30th birthday (just over 22 months away). 

There are only maybe 4 or 5 people that I actually care about, I just want to get some insight on how they will be affected. I am going to do it regardless, I just want to know how they will suffer. 

1) My mother. how long will it take for her to get over it? I have a coworker who's only son died in an accident about 12 years ago and he seems happy and chipper all the time. She might be sad for a few years, and then she'll get over it I imagine. 

2) My 'boyfriend' We live on opposite sides of north america, never met in real life but talk every single day, about goofy stuff we both enjoy, trade dick pics and porn back and forth, tell each other about our problems. We have known each other about 7 months, have officially been "together" for about 3. I probably care about him more than any person in the world, if he wasn't in the picture I would be in my truck driving to home depot for a length of rope.

This isn't a plea for help, I've made up my mind and am at peace with it, I just want to understand how badly people will be affected once I'm gone. to give some insight, I didn't bat an eyelash with either of my grandparents died. I literally didn't give a shit.
