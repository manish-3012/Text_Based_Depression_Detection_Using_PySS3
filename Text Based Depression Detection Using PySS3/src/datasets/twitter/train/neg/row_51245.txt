Almost on the other side, 1st &amp; last.I woke up before 7 a.m., past week was nothing, but preparation. 

I collected all the files that I had, packed them, put a password on it, then pack it again with another password, and again. I think that's enough. I'm taking all of it with me, everything. 

My farewell note is done, it's funny though, it kept getting smaller and smaller over time, now it's about half size A4 piece of paper, not much about me, just general stuff about burial, and my belongings. I started to write a book, but I realized, "hey, noone gives a fuck about you", so I stopped. I'm just one of many. 

I live in a place where guns are hard to come by, but black powder replicas are allowed. They work like the real thing. You got the drum for bullets, put a bit of black powder in the chamber, filler on top of that, then put the bullet inside, a cap on the other side... and bang. I had it for years, 6 or 7, but I think after 5th year I started to use it, just shooting, see if it works, and how, get familiar with it. It's big, and heavy. Colt Navy .44 replica, if I had a modern gun, I would've done it years ago.

Today is marking the end that is to come,

I walked about 3km one way, to a quite nice, alienated place. I admit to damaging public property, but it had to be done. It was a steel board, you usual see in places like that, with info of the area and such. Over 5mm&gt; thick, but &lt;1cm. I was afraid what would happen if I shoot it, but most importantly, before I shoot myself, I wanted to see how powerful it is. There's only one try, and it has be done right.

Shooting black powder pistol is quite nice. It barely has any recoil, and you feel when bullet leaves the barrel, sound is unique too, pooh, white thick smoke comes soon after, then you hear the buzzing in your ears. I actually heard when I hit the steel, and believe me, fuck. I didn't expect it had that much of a power. Not only it did go through easily, but it also ripped over 1cm&gt; hole, it ripped a full piece of steel, and a smaller one.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm ready. It took &lt;1second, even less, 0.3 maybe. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm hoping that some of you will find a way, some problems can surely be solved, and there's hope just behind the hill, you just need to walk a bit more. For me, life has been nothing but a constant slide down.
