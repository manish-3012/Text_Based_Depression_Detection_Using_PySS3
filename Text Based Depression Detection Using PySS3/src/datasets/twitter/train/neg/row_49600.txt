Are there any older people over age 48 here?I get well meaning younger people who respond but they dont understand about older age and workplace pushouts.

F have different health issues than M

Not everyone qualifies for SSI/SSDI

Nor Medicaid or FREE handouts.

Has anyone worked their way UP to a certain income level and needs that similar income to cover rising housing &amp; healthcare costs?

Stagnant pay or underemployment doesnt keep people afloat if housing &amp; healthcare costs go up.
