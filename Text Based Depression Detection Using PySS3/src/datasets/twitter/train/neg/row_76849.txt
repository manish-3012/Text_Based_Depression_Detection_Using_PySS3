im slowly descending into insanityhaven't showerd in almost 3 weeks, my desk literally has towers of plates of rotting food that are almost as tall as my monitor at this point. still weaing the same clothes from 3 weeks ago. i dont really care because i literally only leave my room for a total of like 10 minutes a day to get food from the fridge put in microwave and go back. 

im becoming increasingly violent every day, i used to have 3 monitor but no i only have one because i punched the other ones because i cant contain myself when i get extremly angry. been this way for 3 years.

also breaking new records in weight... i was never very smart but now i genuinely think im losing my mind, but the funny thing is im still sane enough to know that im going insane? i dont know how to put it, but its weird
