Scared to dieI am alone. I don't need a cat, so don't recommend that I get a cat. I need to emotionally and physically connect with a woman. I know that my desperation drives people away. But I am desperate. I might kill myself today. Loaded a 12 gauge shotgun with 00 buckshot and put it in my mouth earlier to see what it feels like. My heart raced, hands sweat, and I felt fear, as I do when I am close to killing myself. It would be easy to pull the trigger, I could almost do it on accident. But I'm scared to die. It may be too late for me.
