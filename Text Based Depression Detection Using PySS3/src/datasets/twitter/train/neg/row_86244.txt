Wish I was never bornI know that's kind of a cliche, but I really do. My being born was a fluke to begin with - my parents had me very late into life, and they tried for more children immediately after but every one was a miscarriage. By that point they were too old to have another. I slipped through by a hair into life, and by the time I was in elementary school I already felt my birth should never have happened.

As time goes by that just increases. All I want is to return to the darkness before I was born - that perfect nothingness, the absolute void of existance. Not feeling anything - no love, no hate, no happiness or despair or joy or regret, no anything. Just dreamless sleep. Because that's where I came from and where I should have stayed.
