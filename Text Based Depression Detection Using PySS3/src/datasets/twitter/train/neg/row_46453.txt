i feel like I'm withering away19 , still in first grade high school, no job. 
I self harm since i was 14, my mom does everything for me because I'm incapable of taking care of myself. 
I'm failing school once again, this is my 5th time trying, it's always around this time of the year i get really depressed, self destructive and suicidal and I can't follow lessons anymore, i just stay in bed looking at my phone to distract myself so I don't cry myself to sleep again and again.
I can't get a job, i wrote my resumÃ© a few days ago but I can't do it, if i try to think clearly and i stop distracting myself for just a couple minutes i cry and i sleep for hours, sometimes i can reach 15h sleep in a day without any drugs or alcohol. I started to take anxiety pills sometimes so i can sleep less.
Mental illness aside, i have chronic pain and a lot of various multiple organ disease symptoms and like for my mental illness, doctors never take me seriously. I can't live like this, I don't want to be a dead weight at the ankles of my friends and family, so I'll have to kill myself sometime soon. 
I can keep trying all i want but I'm just a big, ugly, diseased, rotten, incompetent woman child and i will die either on the streets or by my own hands.
I don't really have the balls to do it, so I'll have to drug myself before. Can't think of a place to do it right now, it's cold and i want to go away comfortably, so i think I'll do it when spring comes, maybe in some abandoned building, I don't want to give my family the trauma of finding my cold dead body in my room, I don't want them to blame themselves for not checking up on me.
If i could just get up and do something about this i would, maybe I don't because I'm just a privileged little bitch and I'm not forced to because my parents can still pay for everything i need. I want to disappear, I'm a disappointment. I wish i was never born so i wouldn't have to put my family, friends and myself through this.
