I want to kill myself every waking moment of every day.And don't fucking tell me you care about me, you don't, you don't know me and you'd fucking hate me in real life.

Especially the ladies, because I'm not good looking enough for you cunts.  I've heard it all from you miserable bitches.  Over and over again throughout a lifetime over how my physical appearance isn't suitable enough for you or how awful my body is.  Derision.  Laughter.  Dehumanization.  Go fucking drown yourselves in the toilet; I've left the lid down for you.  Fitting since you all flush(ed) me down it anyway.

I'm tired.  I've lived 24 goddamn miserable years on this planet to be either betrayed or ignored by everything I've known.  I'm scared to leave my apartment because I know what you shitheads are capable of doing to others, doing to me.  I was born an ugly fucking son of a bitch, and years of being reminded how badly I look and how useless I am to other people have made me bitter, but unfortunately I never developed the ruthlessness or cruelty that could potentially come with that, and thus never really became successful by any meaningful measure.

I'm trapped, I'm lonely, I'm angry, and I'm tired of this hostile world.  Existence here is anathema to the person I am.  I fit in nowhere, belong nowhere, and don't want to be anywhere.  I want the courage to kill myself so I can remove myself from the ball of Earth and the chain of gravity and be de-burdened by this miserable existence.

I don't even fucking know why I'm here... you miserable cunts are the same people have that mistreated me my entire life, or would if you had the opportunity to feed off my emotions and existence.
