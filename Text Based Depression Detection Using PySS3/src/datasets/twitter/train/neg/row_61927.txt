Kinda want to die but not depressedIâ€™m 29. I spent a lot of my life working and going to school and I barely socialized. If ever. I have tried to hang out with people before but people tend to be come disinterested and avoid hanging out with me all together. 

Iâ€™m not exactly sure why but I tend to keep my distance from people. I keep telling myself I want to work on my social skills and I want friends and I want to date. But I have been out many many times and I just feel like they are all not interested. Maybe itâ€™s my personality. 

I stay in bed all weekends now playing games. All I do is work and go home. I donâ€™t have much money. And I donâ€™t really see a point of doing anything. I wanted to have a family since i was in my teens. But I havenâ€™t been talking to many people. 

I have no point in life. I think I would feel bragger if I didnâ€™t exist and allow other people who are better than me to enjoy their lives without me.
