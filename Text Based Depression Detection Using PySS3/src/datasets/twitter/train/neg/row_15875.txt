No one teaches you how to deal with being at the edge of your capacity to cope. I just can't see the point in life anymore.I don't know what to do and I don't have anyone to I can talk to. People just don't get depression. I can't blame because neither do I. Things have been building up for me, starting with breaking my leg in January and now I'm having trouble at work. I just wanted to avoid this work confrontation but I've been dragged into it and my mental health cannot deal with it at the moment. 
I don't want to have to kill myself but I see no other option at the moment. I keep desperately trying to think of the good things but they're clouded over by the bad. 
I don't know how to deal with being at my breaking point. I don't want to tell my work how bad this has got because I'm afraid they won't understand and I've had so much time off with my leg already. Time off wont help anyway because it just gives me more time to think about ending it. 
It's becoming increasingly difficult to stop the urge to end everything. 
I don't know what I want you to say, just like I don't know what to do anymore.
