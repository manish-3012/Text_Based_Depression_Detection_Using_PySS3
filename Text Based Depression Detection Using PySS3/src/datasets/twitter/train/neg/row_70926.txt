PLEASE PLEASE HELP. I think an internet friend ended their life or is CLOSE. WHAT CAN I DO??Hi, this might seem dusjointed because Iâ€™m kinda freaking out right now. A few months ago I saw a post on some sub about a person really truly planning to look themself, and being in a super super dark place. I messaged this person and we talked, checked up on them sometimes and we have some conversations. I then started using a different Reddit account so didnt see when they messaged me until NOW. They said something to the effect of â€œthis is the end for me, for real this timeâ€. Is there ANYTHINF a I can do?? Can I reach out to Reddit and they can help this person through the personal info (phone number, email, whatever,) that this person used to sign up for their account?? PLEASE HELP SERIOUSLY
