Tired of fighting a losing battleI don't even know why I am here anymore. Every time it looks like things are going to get better I get kicked in the face all over again. What is the point? Why should I continue to be thrown in the dirt every day of my life. Nothing I do matters, there is always something else that comes up and makes all my efforts worthless. I am so tired of fighting a losing battle, and I am tired of failing over and over again. I just don't see how this life is worth it when all it gives is pain and suffering. I'm just ready for it to all be over with.
