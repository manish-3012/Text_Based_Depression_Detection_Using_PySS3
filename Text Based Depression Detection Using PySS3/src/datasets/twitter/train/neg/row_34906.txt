Iâ€™m not sure why Iâ€™m putting this here.Well.
Where do I begin?
Iâ€™m not going to tell you a story, Iâ€™m just going to put reasons.
My best friend nearly killed me, slept with my ex (whilst I was with her), got out of prison after only six months, I didnâ€™t receive anything for it because solicitors botched the paperwork.
My dad committed suicide, and my sister used that fact as a weapon against my family, I tried reaching out to her because of covid-19 after 2 years of not talking and she blocked me.
Iâ€™m a failure in everything I do, Iâ€™m still in debt from when I got hospitalised by my friend. 
I canâ€™t maintain relationships or friendships because of my demons.
I hate everything about myself.
Idk if itâ€™s lockdown or what thatâ€™s really pushing these thoughts to the forefront.
But god damn.
I really just want to end it all.
