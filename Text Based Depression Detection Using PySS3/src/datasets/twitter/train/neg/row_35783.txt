Why is it so easy to purchase a gun?I hit a real frightening low today.
Low enough to research gun ownership and what is needed to walk into a gun shop and walk out with one. 
It takes nothing. 
An ID and a payment method and there you go, a brand new weapon and bullets included in the price. 
The only thought in mind was self harm, nothing other than that. 

I didn't go.
But if anyone looked at my Google history, it'd be cause for concern.
It should be any way.

I'm fine, I give my word but man, there should really be something more to buying one.

Even though a background check would've given zero red flags in my case.

Still.
