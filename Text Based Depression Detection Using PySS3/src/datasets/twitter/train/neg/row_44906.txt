well i hate myself on every level now.i had a good day today for the first time in quite awhile. but it occurs to me that im still a pathetic nothing who will never amount to anything and wouldnt be missed. im fat and gross and its my fault. i have no follow through on anything and i use my shitty past as a lame excuse for my shitty self. im a garbage person and ill die a garbage person which is exactly what i deserve. i hope god is real and i hope i go to hell. i give up on myself. all i hope at this point is that i dont chicken out this fucking time like the countless others.
