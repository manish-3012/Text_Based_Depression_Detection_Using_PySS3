i feel defeatedmy mental health keeps getting the better of me and i just can't. i keep acting and thinking shit i know isn't right, i can recognize the false info i keep trying to feed myself, but there's nothing i can do, i guess i'm just too weak when facing myself. it's all getting too much, i don't know how to break the cycle. i have all these mood swings and all these scenarios i keep playing in my head to make myself feel even worse, and i keep believing in whatever is on the repertoire today. it's terrible. 
i have an appointment with a psychologist next week, but i can't feel like i'm ever gonna get better. truth is, i kinda feel like i like feeling like this, like this is my 'safe space' and anything out of it is just scary and unreachable, i don't know. i don't even know why i'm writing this, honestly.
