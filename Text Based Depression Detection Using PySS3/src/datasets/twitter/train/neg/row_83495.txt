I just want to stop the pain
It hurts, my stomach hurts, is like I have broken glass inside me, it cuts me everytime I move. I am 34 this is not the first time I tried to kill myself. I am just to exhausted, too angry and it really hurts. I haven't eat in a couple of days and I think I am ready. Gonna cut my wrists today. I just waiting to mom leave the house, I have everything I need to do it. I am so scared. I read somewhere when you die you reincarnate in the same person, so there is no freedom, you became the same person over and over again. Is this hell? It feels like hell. I just want to stop the pain
