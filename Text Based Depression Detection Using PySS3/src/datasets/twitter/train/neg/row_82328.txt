I don't think I'm suicidal, I just need someone to talk toGuess who just got a big fat DUI? ME! I did! 

I was driving down the road after 15 beers, LEANING MY ARM ON THE HORN. 

I am so fucked. I blew a BAC of .20, that's over twice the legal limit. My parents had to bail me out of jail at 4 in the morning. 

I could go to prison. I could go to jail. My career is over. I'm a recent college graduate AND a fucking criminal. I don't think I hit anyone, BUT I DONT EVEN REMEMBER!!!! I COULD HAVE! SOMEONE COULD BE DEAD BECAUSE OF ME AND I BLACKED OUT.

I'm really in a tough spot. I don't know whats going to happen. I am TERRIFIED AND ITS ALL MY FAULT! I HAVE RUINED MY OWN CAREER AND ACTED LIKE A MONSTER! AGHH!

That's really it. I just want someone to talk to. I feel really terrible about myself right now, I don't want to die but I feel like I can't live with the shame of my actions.
