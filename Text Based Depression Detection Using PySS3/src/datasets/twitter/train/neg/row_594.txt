â€œAn interesting titleâ€ mocks me... How about life is terrible and why do humans put up with it? A Ted Talk by meHow can somedays the thought of taking my own life is swatted away like a annoying fly in my mind and others itâ€™s the only single thought on my mind the entire day? Today was another one of those all encompassing suffocating days. I hate myself so much. I have no friends at all. And no thatâ€™s not an exaggeration. I honestly have not one single friend. I havenâ€™t had a real friendship with someone for at least 5 years. The only reason Iâ€™m still around is luck and my self imposed responsibility to my family. My gift of looking like the functional college student doesnâ€™t have a single crack on the outside. Iâ€™m really very good at pretending and lying to my family and those that talk to me. Well, thatâ€™s it for now... Thanks
