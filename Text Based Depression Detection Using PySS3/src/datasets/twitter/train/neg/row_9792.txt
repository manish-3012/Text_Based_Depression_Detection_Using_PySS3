Why was I born?I dont understand why Im even here. It hurts to be alive. People say being alive is something to be happy about, they say its a blessing. Honestly if there was a god, i would like to say fuck you for bringing me into this life. I hate this life. I don't like how i am as a person. I dont like anything anymore. I dont want to be here. Whats the point anyway? We all die eventually. If I could take someone's illness away from them because they want to live more than I do, i would totally do it. Id want to give up my life so someone else who actually cares can live. But like doesnt work that way and now im fucking stuck. Life is just a waste of my time. Id rather be dead than be here. After going through therapy, taking medications, shit hasnt changed. So whats the fucking point?
