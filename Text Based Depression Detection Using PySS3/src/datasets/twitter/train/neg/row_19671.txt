I'm about to lose all my hope.I'm 15 years old, male and I live in the Philippines. My goal is to become a programmer/game developer. I've been practicing my coding skills through scripting for some people's fan made games and it helps a lot for my experience. But since then everything has changed and my parents no longer support my dreams. They also want me out of the house and live somewhere else. I am no longer being fed lunch by my parents because they think that I'm a waste of oxygen. The only person left that cares about me is far away and is close to death. I wanted to continue making efforts and get to college. But it seems my parents will no longer fund my education. I am alone, scared, young and in need of help. This has been going on for 3 months and I can no longer put up with it anymore. I want to achieve my goals but it seems like it is impossible for me. 

I can't see a way out of this. I've been trying my best not to end it all but, this is my last effort.
