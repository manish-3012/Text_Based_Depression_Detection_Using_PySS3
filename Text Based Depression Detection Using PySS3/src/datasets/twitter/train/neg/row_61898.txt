Iâ€™m just a failure. Iâ€™m feeling pretty hopeless right now.I stayed in bed until 1:30 PM today - I havenâ€™t been in bed that long ever before. Engineering college online is showing me just how pathetic I really am, and Iâ€™m running out of time to find a housing situation for the next school year. Iâ€™m so burnt out right now, but a break would only make me feel more terrible. The real world doesnâ€™t stop because of COVID - my future career doesnâ€™t stop, my housing doesnâ€™t stop, my grades donâ€™t stop, no matter how hard I try. 

Iâ€™m fantasizing about what it would be like if I chose to jump off of the bridge at my college. Iâ€™m too scared to do it, but the thoughts still come up. Everything Iâ€™ve worked so hard for in my life feels like itâ€™s coming undone, and Iâ€™m hurting badly right now. I can never shake the feeling that Iâ€™ve let everyone in my life down. I know I need to talk to someone about all of this, but I donâ€™t know where to start. Iâ€™m so tired of every day passing, and I have nothing to show for it at the end of the day. Iâ€™m useless, and I need help now.
