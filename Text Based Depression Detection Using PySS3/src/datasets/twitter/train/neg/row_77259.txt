I am in desperate need of helpIve been suicidal for a few weeks now but the past couple days have been the most extreme. I am very very close to commiting suicide and i want to tell someone, anyone; but there is a part of me that wants to do it that just stops me from telling anyone that has the capability of stopping me from doing it. Today has been a constant mental battle with myself trying to motivate myself to text someone about it but when i try to reach for my phone with one hand the other hand just pulls it away wanting me to not do it so i can kill myself. My mental and emotional stability is depleting day by day.
