Jfc Iâ€™m such a terrible personI openly try to make my friends hate me. I try to piss them off, I try to make them get annoyed with me, I try to make it seem like Iâ€™m undermining them and much more. I want them to hate me. I get into arguments or disagreements with them as much as possible, whenever the subject is happy or wholesome I try to bring it back down. Iâ€™m just so tired. I feel bad doing this to them, doing this to people who I damn near consider family but god, I just want them to hate me. I want to punish myself by making everyone hate me. I want them to see how terrible of a person I am. I try to push them away. I try to make them look at me in a different light because I just want them to be aware how dangerous I am. Like a wild animal being caged in. I do this because I think I deserve it. I deserve the mistreatment. I deserve the hatred. 

I want to die knowing that no one would miss me. Theyâ€™d all hate me too much to even care if I died. I donâ€™t want them to miss me and see me die as an â€œamazing personâ€ or as a â€œfriend.â€ I am neither of those. I want them to hate me so much that they wouldnâ€™t care if I suddenly passed away. I want to die hated. I want to die alone. I want to die with them thinking â€œhe was shit. He didnâ€™t deserve life in the first place. He shouldâ€™ve never been born,â€ because I donâ€™t want to cause them pain. 

Iâ€™m so tired nowadays. Iâ€™m not happy. I just want it all to be forgotten. Death seems like a good option. Iâ€™ll just die, and they wonâ€™t have to worry about me anymore. My friends, they wonâ€™t have to worry about my arguments and supposed â€œhatredâ€ towards them. I donâ€™t hate them. They wonâ€™t have to think about who my next victim will be. Theyâ€™ll be better off without me.
