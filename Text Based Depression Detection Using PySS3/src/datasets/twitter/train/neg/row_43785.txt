Iâ€™m alone in the truest sense of the word. I wonâ€™t be noticed for weeks maybe months.And my final words go to internet strangers. I guess you are the only ones I canâ€™t damage anyway. Itâ€™s fitting because 100% of my free time is spent with you anyway. If I donâ€™t have strong relationships in real life, I shouldnâ€™t expect there to be too much resistance when snapping them off. At least I can say goodbye here and nobodyâ€™s day will be ruined.

It doesnâ€™t always get better

Goodbye
