iâ€™m a fucking wash up and thereâ€™s no point in seeing how much worse it getsiâ€™ve gained about 50 pounds in the last two years. the only time my partner has sex with me is when weâ€™re deeply inebriated (maybe three times in the last year?) and as much as they deny that itâ€™s because iâ€™ve gained weight the correlation speaks for itself. i stared in the mirror for thirty minutes tonight documenting each stretch mark and flab and even with my attempts at changing i know it only gets worse. i used to be idolized for my body and now iâ€™m ashamed to even see myself naked. no one wants me anymore now that iâ€™m old and saggy. i have 74 days until i finish it. maybe if i hate myself enough that will gain me some redemption. i canâ€™t bring myself to do the physical effort necessary to change. maybe they can tuck the disgusting parts of my body away before i get buried.
