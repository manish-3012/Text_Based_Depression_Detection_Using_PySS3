End of the road.I wrecked my car and the bank is holding my check. Which had caused me to lose my job and I cant pay rent or bills. All this has hit just as I was sure I was at rock bottom. I almost killed my self a few years ago but was talked out of by a person who recently told me they wished I had died in my wreck. I just want to take my check(when ever i get it) and go somewhere like London and have a good weekend them just end it. At first I tried to tell my self this was ludicrous but as each day passes it seems like the only way. I can't shake it now.
