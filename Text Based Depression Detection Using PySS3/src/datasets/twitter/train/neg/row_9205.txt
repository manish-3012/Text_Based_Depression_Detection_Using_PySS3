I can't believe how cruel life isWow.

I always knew devastation and despair exists. Natural disasters, murder, rape, all kinds of horrors.

But the realisation keeps sinking in.

The older I get the harder it is to cope.

I regularly have casual suicidal ideation. I wouldn't do it now because I don't want to hurt my family. But I just feel like my emotional pain threshold is so small. Even when things are ok I find it hard to find the will or interest in living. So when the inevitable happens I have no idea how I would be able to find the will to go on.
