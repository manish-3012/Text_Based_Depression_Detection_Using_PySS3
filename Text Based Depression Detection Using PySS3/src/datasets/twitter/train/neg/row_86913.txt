I'm a whiny brat who'd rather die when things don't go my wayLast night was one of the worst nights I've had. I've had depression since probably the beginning of 2016, and I've had several nights where I feel extremely suicidal and can think of nothing but shooting or hanging myself. I can't focus long enough to actually go through with anything, but I worry one day I'll try something. Last night in particular I found out that my ex-girlfriend has a new boyfriend. I love her, but I should move on, but I feel like I'd rather die when things don't go my way than accept them. I don't know if I actually wanna kill myself, or if I just wanna cry for help, or worse I just wanna do it to make her feel bad. I don't think the last one is the case, but I have a tendency to self loathe and tell myself it is. Anyway last night was the closest I ever got to attempting suicide, and I'm scared it's only going to get worse. I started Zoloft a week ago, but it will need more time to kick in.
