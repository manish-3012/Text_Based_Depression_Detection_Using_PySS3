UpdateI talked to my school guidance councillor and she helped me find an electrical engineering course and suggested I talk to the doctor. My doctor gave me some antidepressants and told me to see him in a months time. I still feel the same but at least I know what I will be doing instead of waiting as if nothing happened. Thank you guys, I hope that you will try and seek help if you possibly can.
