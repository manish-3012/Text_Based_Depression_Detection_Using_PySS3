Sometimes I'm thankful most days I'm notI like this sub at it let's me speak my mind without being pigeon holed and being labeled as suicidal. And let's face it I really do think about suicide everyday, but It's not enough to just punch the wall?

Being kicked out of college has made me feel trapped in poverty and like I'll be poor my entire life and Idk, you get tired of trying to work towards your goal becuase when you lived in a global city and had 10x the goals and confidence everything thing is easier.

And I hate I'm so stubborn but I don't want to settle for an average life. And yes I'm drunk and my life is a mess, but god damn it I just want to be back in college.

This has made me stronger yes but it took away so many opportunities I had, and I worked so hard all of high school for that but fuck I've been working hard 3 years and feel like less of a person each day because my confidence dwindles. 

I'm just tired of being a suburban fuck up.
