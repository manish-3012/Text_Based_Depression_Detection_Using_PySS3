my friend (m 14) is suffering from bad depression, and I donâ€™t want him to kill himself, which he is thinking of doing.So, my friend has a pretty bad home life. His parents usually ignore him, and donâ€™t really care all that much and stuff. He says heâ€™s tried contacting CPS, but they didnâ€™t believe him or something. His parents act normal in public and stuff, which iâ€™ve definitely fallen for.

Me and one of my friends want to contact someone, but weâ€™re not sure who and how. My parents arenâ€™t an option, because they didnâ€™t seem to care a whole lot when my sister had depression, so why would they care about a different kid that doesnâ€™t belong to them?

We want to call a professional, but weâ€™re nervous, donâ€™t know what to say, we donâ€™t know if theyâ€™re gonna go to his house or anything. He would probably most likely ignore a phone call or text from a professional. We want him to still trust us, and still be our friends.

What do we do?
