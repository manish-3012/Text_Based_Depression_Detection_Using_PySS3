There is no hope for me, I am irreparably broken. I am beyond fucking lost.Somehow I have to at least continue to live for a bit longer due to my mother. I would still feel bad about leaving my other family members to deal with the fallout of my death but that will be what it will be.

For the past 6 years I have tried intensely to see if I could change and cope. I've been through a multitude of therapists, been prescribed and taken numerous medications, quit any substance that I was using to self-medicate or cope. Not only have things not improved, they have become worse and worse.

I am not functional. I have not been working for about 6 months. I am nearly 40 and have never had a true romantic relationship. My family situation has just deteriorated even more over time. Ugly as fuck, and lost the genetic lottery. I allow myself to be manipulated and used and abused.

How I long for the end, for any peace. For death. Yet I feel trapped, forced to exist because others will feel bad if I take my own life. I am so tired. I don't even know the point of posting this, the pain is so much.
