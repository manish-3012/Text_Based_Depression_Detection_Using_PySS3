I need advice with how to tell a hard truth to a depressed friendI have been in a relationship with a girl for a little over a year. About 4 months ago, I met another girl and we really clicked. I never had feelings for her, but I really care about her as a friend. However, I also never told her I am in a relationship and she thinks I'm single. She has feelings for me as more than a friend. She is severely depressed and has attempted suicide fairly recently, and I'm torn because I want to tell her the truth, but I'm afraid she'll hurt herself. Should I wait until her depression is better before I tell her?

I apologize if this isn't the right sub for this question.
