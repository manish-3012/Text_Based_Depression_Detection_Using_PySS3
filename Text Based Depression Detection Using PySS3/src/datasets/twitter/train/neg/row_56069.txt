I finallly told my mom that I'm suicidalAnd it didn't go well, she thinks I'm just sad and overreacting. I've suffered from depression for years now and I've gotten really good at hiding my feelings but I just can't do it anymore, putting up this facade that everything is going well is very energy consuming which I don't have much of to begin with.. I really need help, I feel like I can't keep going anymore.
