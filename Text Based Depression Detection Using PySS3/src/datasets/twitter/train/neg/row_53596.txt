Always feel like im dying [17]Theres not been a moment of my life where i am not being abused. Physical, sexual, emotional abuse, and neglect. Just this year ive already had several traumatic abusive instances and ive been in emergency housing which is more stressful than youd think. Im transgender ftm and i look female which wont change because it has to do with bone structure. I feel humiliated just leaving the house. Its excruciating living this way and the longer i live the worse it gets. I always find myself thinking that it would be better if i had killed myself earlier because then i wouldnt have had to go through even more of this shit for no good reason. Im going to college but i know ill be abused there too. Theres no way out except suicide.
