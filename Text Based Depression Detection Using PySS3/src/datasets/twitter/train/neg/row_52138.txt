Iâ€™m such a mess.Iâ€™m not quite sure how to handle this shit anymore. My â€œfriendsâ€ donâ€™t give a flying fuck about me unless Iâ€™m suicidal. Even then, some of them donâ€™t care. And it hurts. Iâ€™m in so much pain. I just want to go out and take that jump off the water tower but Iâ€™m too fucking chicken to do it and it sucks. Iâ€™m willing to literally do anything else but not jump. Itâ€™s weird. Iâ€™m just tired of feeling this way. All I do is wake up and sit in my room on my phone. Talking to â€œfriendsâ€ who arenâ€™t actually friends and just shut down when I talk about this. I need someone to help me find the courage to jump. Because quite frankly I donâ€™t want to be in this miserable life any longer. Iâ€™ve also been considering running away and leaving everyone and everything behind but I often think of crazy things when Iâ€™m suicidal. Sorry for rambling, I just wish things were different and I was dead.
