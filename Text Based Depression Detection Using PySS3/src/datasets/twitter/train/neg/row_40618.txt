I just donâ€™t want to go on living anymoreI posted last night about a break up thatâ€™s been affecting me pretty strongly. I slept after writing that out. The first time Iâ€™ve slept more than a couple hours since it happened. I thought when I woke up that Iâ€™d feel relief, less pain, less sadness, anything like that. I woke up just wanting it all to end. To not feel anything anymore. I have been crying all morning and all I want in this world is to fulfill her wish that I donâ€™t exist. That my kids can have a different father. 

I just want to die right now. Iâ€™m giving up.
