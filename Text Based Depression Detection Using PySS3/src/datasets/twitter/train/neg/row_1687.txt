there is no pointthere is no point to my continued existence. i am weak physically and mentally. i don't bring good to anyone.

&amp;#x200B;

i am gonna wait so D doesn't find me bc that would break him. not bc it's me. bc it's just one too many deaths for him this month.

but when he's asleep sometime, i'll sneak out. in the morning so he thinks i'm off doing an errand.

&amp;#x200B;

but i won't ever come back. i will drive into the woods with the bottle of lyrica i hoarded. people's bodies can stay lost in the woods off the side of the highway for a long time. i will take all the lyrica. and then i will fall asleep forever.

&amp;#x200B;

they'll find me eventually, so everyone won't have to wonder forever.

&amp;#x200B;

i wish you could all understand it's better for me and you if i'm dead. it's better for everyone. in ten years, you'll hardly notice. you don't call except in emergencies and shitty times anyhow. it doesn't matter. i don't matter. you'll see.

&amp;#x200B;

i can't wait for the long sleep
