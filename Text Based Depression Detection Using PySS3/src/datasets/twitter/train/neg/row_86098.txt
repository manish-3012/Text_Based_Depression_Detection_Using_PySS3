I feel nothing anymore.In January I was diagnosed with a medical condition which left me housebound and unable to attend school, see friends, or doing anything a normal teenager would. Since then, I've realized who numb I am. Although there's a chance I'm going to get better, I don't see the point. Life is a chore. I don't feel happy when I think of the future. I don't smile thinking about college, or relationships, or kids, or travelling, or anything. I don't feel happiness at all anymore.  

What's the point in living if I can't find joy in anything?
