Iâ€™ll keep this short and sweet. Iâ€™m 29, Iâ€™m smart, handsome, charming, strong, fearless, cunning, and in top of it all people genuinely like me. Everyoneâ€™s always wanted me to succeed, and Iâ€™ve always gauged their standard of success as pretty fucking dumb. I made two attempts over the last 9 monthI put my whole life on hold to care take my parents. They were awful too each other and those children, but they provided for a lot of people(myself included). 

Long story short, a project I was working on failed, my father had a severe GI bleed, and so I came home. Fast forward 5 years, cancer, a broken femur, Alzheimerâ€™s, and about 6 different diagnosable mental fractures; Iâ€™m still
Sitting here. And the
World keeps getting worse.
And I canâ€™t fix it. More over the people who can, wonâ€™t. Too profitable to exploit our fumbling over pennies. 
The final severance of a serious relationship, plus the slow tragic decline into old age; rather than the expedient â€œyâ€™all sucked, love ya, BIAaaaaaaaâ€. 
Anyway I canâ€™t seem to shake this urge to die. 
Iâ€™ve felt it my whole life. 
Itâ€™s well documented. 
I think for most people it does get better. 
For me? Iâ€™m thinking about getting weird with heroine. Maybe I can die happy lol. 

The tragic part is, thatâ€™s the positive, I always have a loaded gun. I still always resort to drinking drugs I should smoke, to taking breaths when I should just stroke. I think I missed my boat, I burnt out. I feel dumb. And Iâ€™m just glad no subsequent generation of this specific genetic code has to ever exist again. 
Iâ€™m not in a rush but I think weâ€™re all just killing ourselves. Whatâ€™s the problem with doing it a little faster? 
Iâ€™m legitimately numb. Iâ€™ll talk tomorrow.
