just need to get it outhavent cut in awhile and i think i'm just gonna go for it tonight. im in a bad spot and i miss the sting

and i hate that nothing is actually wrong. i'm just stressed bc the semester is starting again, and it's already kinda a lot, but it's not more than i'm used to. it's about as much as usual, and yet i'm not quite here and i'm wilting and i'm so fucking tired. i just wanna die but moreso, i wanna feel better.

scheduled a counseling appt with my university's student health center, gonna talk to them abt the stuff they can actually help with. not gonna mention the suicidal bit, i dont want them to breech my confidentiality if they think i'm at risk, that'll make it worse, it's happened before and it made me worse for wear so its not worth it heh

havent cut since mid july, last semester i was cutting every 2 weeks r so for awhile. idk. im okay,  i just need to feel something to get my head out of me yknow. i'll be careful
