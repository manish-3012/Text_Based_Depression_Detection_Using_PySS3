failureI'm a complete and utter failure to everyone. My parents. My coworkers. My teachers. My family members. I can't do anything right. My parents told me that I'm not the young, free-spirited boy that I once was. They asked where "their son" went; and frankly, I couldn't tell them. I am constantly tearing the family apart with my bleak outlook on life.

Therapists have done nothing. 'Friends' have done nothing. 

Every night I lay restless thinking about how I was the one who caused my friend to take his own life.

That should have been me.
