I'm a fucking mess of a human beingAt the end of my fucking rope rn, this year's been so fucking shit, and it's only made my depression worse.

Earlier this year my grandad killed himself via overdose. Am scattering his ashes next week and it's fucking horrible to think about. Then when I tell my girlfriend, the 1 person I thought I could trust and who'd support me no matter what, that I'll have to postpone coming to see here (LDR), she tells me she's sick of me and sick of me getting her hopes up only to let her down and tells me to fuck off.

Then on top of that I've been struggling this year with solvent abuse as a result of stress from my A Levels which I'm probably gonna fail and end up with no future, and all the while I get relentlessly bullied at college, I get called shit like school shooter or psycho just because I'm fucking quiet.

Im fucking sick of it, nothing I ever do is good enough for anyone. If I had access to the stuff I'd off myself right here right now but I can't so I'm stuck in this fucking loop of things getting a bit better then going to shit again.  

I just want this shit to end, I'm a fucking waste of oxygen and I'm writing this while I sit alone in my bathroom half a bottle of jager deep because it's all I got to numb the pain but even that ain't fucking working.
