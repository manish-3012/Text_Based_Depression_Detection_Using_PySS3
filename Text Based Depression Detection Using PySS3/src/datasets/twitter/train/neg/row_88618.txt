Suicidal thoughtsIâ€™ve always had them but theyâ€™re really â€œloudâ€ at the moment. Since New Years Iâ€™ve lost 4 friends I considered really close, Iâ€™m gaining weight and I really feel sick about it, Iâ€™ve never weighted this much before. Iâ€™ve lost my trust to my therapists so I canâ€™t really use them at the moment. My best friend is pregnant and Iâ€™m SO happy for her but it just reminds me that Iâ€™m alone and I canâ€™t get my own place because thereâ€™s no available apartments where I live, so Iâ€™m 25 and living with my mom. I just feel so alone. Iâ€™ve never been the kind of person that needs a boyfriends Iâ€™m fine being alone but I want to feel loved and wanted and Iâ€™m sick of the loneliness and being rejected. I feel like Iâ€™m stuck like this forever. Thereâ€™s nothing more for me in this life. Itâ€™s not going to get better than this.
I usually try to avoid my suicidal thoughts but lately it just makes so much more sense. Iâ€™ve lived my life, thereâ€™s nothing more to complete or do now, all I can do is wait for me to get old and die of age but that doesnâ€™t make sense either. But I canâ€™t work or get an education because of my illness and how easy I stress and all my doctors and therapists agree that my prognosis is bad because I donâ€™t react to treatment or therapy and Iâ€™ve been through so many. Iâ€™ve had the same symptoms since I was a child. I have a really hard time finding something to keep me going. I feel like it gets harder from day to day.
