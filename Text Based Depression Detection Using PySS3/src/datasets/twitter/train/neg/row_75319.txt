I'm tired of hearing this. I've been talking to the Samaritans, some people who talk to people who are thinking of killing themselves. I was hoping they'd say something different, that they'd say something that would somehow make it all come together, but they say the same things everyone else says. It'll get better. Dig deep, find courage to move on. It'll get better.

I've had these thoughts for the better part of a decade. I'm supposed to believe that its just a bit longer, even though my life has been steadily curving down? 

It seems like every day, i notice something is gone. Food doesn't taste the way it used too. its all bland. Music falls flat to me. Comedy doesn't make me laugh. The games that used to excite me now bore me. And every time i fall asleep i still feel tired when i wake up. 

I'm supposed to believe it'll all just go away? That it will all just snap back, and i'll be happy? I don't even think I remember what it feels like, anymore. 

Some people tell me, well, it doesn't happen on its own. You have to do it. 

Do what? Wave a magic fucking wand and change the fact I have no prospects? that I'm poor, and i'll never escape that because i'm already in debt and i have no job, and no education to get a real job, and no means to get a education? And that's the just tip of it.  

Some people say i should be on medication. But even if i popped down enough Rx to fill me full of sunshine, it'll be a lie. I'll still be a dirt poor, ugly, worthless fuck.
