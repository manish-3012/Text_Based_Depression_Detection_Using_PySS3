I can't cope with my lifeI'm struggling. I'm sat here with a canister of helium gas and an oxygen mask and I really want to use it to kill myself. I've not eaten properly in days, the prepaid electric has just gone out and I feel so betrayed by my best friend it's all becoming too much. 
I can't wait to die but my brother hung himself in 2016 and all I can think about is my family and how much I am going to hurt them all again. I don't want to go back to one of those horrible hospitals, they are not helpful. I'm insane, fuckin insane. I was responsible for a huge gas explosion (another botched suicide), lucky I didn't killed someone else but I have destroyed my uninsured landladies family home and ended up in prison for a year and a half for it.
In all honesty I don't know why I am posting here, I deserve to be dead and I want to be dead.
