Want to kill myself, but I'm not allowed toI hate myself. I spend a decent amount of time on a seemingly daily basis wanting to kill myself. A large portion of these thoughts come from thinking of how I will/would ultimately ruin the life of any person I'm close to.

On the flip side of that, I have people whose lives would be severely impacted if I were to die. My roommate would be stuck with the full amount of our rent for the remaining 8 months of our lease, and since my parents signed on my car with me, they would owe the next 4 years of payments.

That's all I have when I think of reasons not to kill myself. Because I don't want other people to have to take on my debts if I'm dead.

So today, after a particularly bad episode, I took a look at what I own and tried to figure out how much I could sell it for. It's not a lot but I think I could sell everything I own and cover 2 months of rent and sell my car back to the dealer to pay off 60% of the loan.

That still doesn't seem fair of me to them, so then I thought maybe I could get a second job to work for a few months to make up the difference.

But then, I felt even worse because of how long it would take and how much more of my own mental bullshit I would have to endure.

I desperately want to kill myself, but I'm not allowed to.
