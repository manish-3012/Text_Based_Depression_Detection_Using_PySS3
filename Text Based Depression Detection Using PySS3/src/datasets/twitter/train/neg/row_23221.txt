Iâ€™m not scared of it anymore.For a long time now, Iâ€™ve known that if I was going to kill my self, itâ€™d be by causing myself to bleed out.

Itâ€™s metaphorical in a way, you know? All my life, my life has just been draining from me. And when I do that, my life would literally drain from me. Itâ€™s fitting that way. And if I do everything properly, I wonâ€™t make a huge mess and the clean up for whoever finds me wouldnâ€™t be too bad. 

It just seems like the right way to do it.

And I was doing really well for a long time. And because of it, Iâ€™m stronger now. However the feelings came back and now Iâ€™m hopeless again. I just canâ€™t see a future for myself that isnâ€™t eternally draining and painful.

I really think Iâ€™m going to do it this time. I was scared of bleeding out for awhile. Scared that itâ€™d be too painful and slow. Except Iâ€™ve had blood loss before. Iâ€™ve donated blood 3 times now and Iâ€™ve passed out each time. It was mildly uncomfortable, but once I was out, it was nothing. All I have to do is brave it through that and the pain of cutting my arms. Iâ€™m not scared anymore. Iâ€™m ready.
