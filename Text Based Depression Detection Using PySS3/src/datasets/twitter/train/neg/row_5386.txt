Being female is humilating. And I want to kill myself because of it.50/50 and I get the bad side of the coin.. being female is humilating. No matter how much bodybuilding i do a man could easily pin me down and rape me. He doesn't have to try. I can fight with all my might yet its easy for him. 

And the fact i am capable of pregnancy is repulsive. It doesn't feel like something i should be capable of doing. Every month i get an ugly, vicious reminder of that I could easily be forced to be pregnant.

It's not fair. All i want is to die.
