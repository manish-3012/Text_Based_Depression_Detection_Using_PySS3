Worried about my little brotherMy brother is 19, sophomore in college studying engineering. Heâ€™s always suffered from moderate social anxiety and depression, but lately it seems to have gotten worse. He is awake until 3am every night with non-stop thoughts about his inadequacies. He has very good grades and a couple friends but nothing solid and no great influences. Heâ€™s always afraid of saying stupid things. If they made a movie about him his character would be ripping at his own brain wanting a new one because he doesnâ€™t understand why he canâ€™t just be normal. 

Heâ€™s seen specialists for years. Heâ€™s tried medication. My mom is constantly looking for help and heâ€™s not at all ashamed to try new methods. I have a very general distrust of doctors. I am a medical malpractice attorney and I see what many of these so-called specialists do. I know a good percentage graduated with a mere psychology degree and just check the boxes and make a diagnosis. They recite the textbook with little practical knowledge. 

I see posts about people suffering from depression and they say something like â€œ_____ saved my life.â€ Itâ€™s sometimes like a book, movie, therapist, thought exercise, hobby, job, etc. my brother has tried seeking help and Iâ€™m wondering if anyone has a novel idea.

Itâ€™s difficult for me to imagine him taking his own life, but every person who has lost a loved one to suicide has at some point uttered the same words. Iâ€™m all ears. Please help.
