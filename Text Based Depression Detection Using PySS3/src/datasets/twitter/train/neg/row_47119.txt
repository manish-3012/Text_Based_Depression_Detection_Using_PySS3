I'm lostI've battled depression for as long as I can remember.  One of my earliest memories is actually of me threatening suicide to my mother (anywhere between 5-6 yo). I've had a few extreme episodes up to this point but I have a constant level of depression/suicidal thoughts that never go away.

I enlisted in the US Army and was shipped to basic on my 19th birthday. A few months ago I had an incident where I came close to finishing it. My wife convinced me to attend Behavioral Health and talk to a therapist. They hospitalized me for a week and I lied my way out because honestly that place was making me worse. I almost missed our anniversary because of it. 

I am getting worse. They are kicking me out. I feel regret because I couldn't compete 4 f*cking years. I feel like I'll be dead if I stay. I constantly think about killing myself everyday, all day. No one understands.  I dont know what to do anymore....
