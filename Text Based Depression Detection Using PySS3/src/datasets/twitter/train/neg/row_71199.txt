Im not going to bullshit this anymore, growing some balls and ending it for goodI'm probably going to go out in a pussy way, but it's better than just continuing talking about how miserable I am and how I want to end it. I'm tired of talking. I made an appointment with my doctor for some sleeping meds and I'm going to swallow that bottle once I get it. 
I think in the past, I was always able to pull myself together after feeling this way because there was at least something in life to cling to. Recently this isn't the case anymore. There is permanent damage to my life. Permanent changes I can't reverse. I can't deal with what lies ahead of me and I can't deal with aging and the wrinkles deepening on my face. I'm past my prime but before I could even enjoy it. This is my only way out, and I'm even getting excited about doing it.
