I'm drunk and covered in blood. I can't live like this anymore. I cry everyday. I cut myself every day. I have to drink myself to sleep every night in order to avoid the UNFUCKINGRELENTING thoughts and memories. That's the absolute worth thing. The memories. Fuck them. Fuck my brain for not forgetting. I want a gun in my mouth so bad. I can't live with this weight in my chest anymore. I need to be free. Life is my prison. Death is my salvation. No more pain.  No more memories. No more anything....it brings a smile to my face just thinking about it. That's the only thing that makes me smile. A shotgun in my mouth. I'm never going to know love. I'm never going to know peace. I'm never going to know tranquility. All I know is hate and disgust and conflict. Before you tell me to go to a therapist, I did. She told me I have post traumatic stress disorder. I stopped going after that. I'm not strong enough to face that demon. I'm surprised I made it this far but it's only a matter of time now. Soon I will sleep. I will know peace. I will fade into the deep of space. All will be forgotten. A clean slate. Purgatory. Heaven.
