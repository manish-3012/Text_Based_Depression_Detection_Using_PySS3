Just not sure what the point of my existence is.Got fired about two weeks ago. The literal reason they gave me was that "I didn't fit in." (It's an at will state.) I have a degree but it's fairly worthless. I have applied to 27 jobs already and gotten only two calls. And I'm applying to everything, whether over qualified or under. I'm too educated to fit into the service industry, but I'm not actually qualified to do anything. I've managed to drive away the few friends I had. I'm living with my parents but can't afford rent now. If I don't get a job by the end of the month I'll lose my car and destroy my credit. I don't really matter to anyone, I don't contribute to the world, and I can barely bring myself to care. I just feel like I should stop trying. I've been suicidal for about... 12 years. Since I was 11. But I've always maintained that suicide is selfish due to the anguish it would cause loved ones. But now I'm just a dead weight to my loved ones. I've often thought about staging a car accident, but that would potentially hurt someone else. Just some way to make it look like an accident. I dunno.
