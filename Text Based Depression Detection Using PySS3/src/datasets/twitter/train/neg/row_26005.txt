What can I do?I just feel like there's no point in living. Does anyone have any advice on what I can do for help? I've tried therapy and self-help books, but it's been a year now and nothing has changed. 

I don't want to bore you with my life story but I feel like it's worth mentioning there's nothing obviously wrong with me. I feel like I've done all the things I'm 'supposed' to do, just that there isn't a place for me in this world.
