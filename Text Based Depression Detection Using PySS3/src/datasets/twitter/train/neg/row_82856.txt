Why is it better to be alive?I was searching for a way to expound on the question, but... who cares? Why is being alive better than being dead? Sometimes I think the only reason I haven't released myself yet is because I'm afraid of the unknown. I can see why many people would want to keep experiencing life. But momentary flashes of happiness, or vague, cruel, milky potentially satisfying futures just seem like bullshit in comparison to how sad I am all the time.

I'm going to die alone and scared anyway. Why is it better to sift through years of agony and disappointment just to get to the same place?

Please, someone tell me. I'm scared of what comes after, I would like to hear a compelling argument.
