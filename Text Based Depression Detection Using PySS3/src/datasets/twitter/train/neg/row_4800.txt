I am not fucking okay.I donâ€™t know how to fix it I donâ€™t know how to feel better I want to be dead. I canâ€™t do this, I am simply not strong enough for the struggles of life. Iâ€™m too much of a worthless coward to hurt myself beyond what Iâ€™ve done so far so I doubt anyone is going to take me seriously. I want to overdose on something that wonâ€™t quite kill me just so my parents will understand that I need help. I wouldnâ€™t even be mad if it did kill me. I donâ€™t deserve to be happy. I donâ€™t deserve to live. I need a fucking break I canâ€™t take this I want to die I need to be dead this is ridiculous Iâ€™m only 16 and Iâ€™m already not able to keep up, it only gets harder and Iâ€™m not okay with that.
