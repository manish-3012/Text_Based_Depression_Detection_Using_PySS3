i hate relapsinga few days ago i thought i was finally getting better, but of course one little thing happens today and i'm feeling shitty all over again. i relapsed into self harming and the suicidal thoughts are coming back. i'm starting to think maybe offing myself would be for the best. i can't keep dealing with this cycle of feeling happy for a few days only to feel shitty again for weeks.
