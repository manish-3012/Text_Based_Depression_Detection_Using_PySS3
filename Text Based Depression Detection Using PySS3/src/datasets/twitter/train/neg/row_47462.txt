I'm hurtingHow can this many blows happen in one Summer. I'm in so much pain. I haven't been okay in half a decade. I don't just think about suicide anymore, I desperately crave it. I can't suffer like this any longer. I can't be alone like this any longer. I can't hurt people any longer. I just want to hurt myself.
