I'm just doneNo matter what I do I just can't get ahead. I've worked my whole life till I broke my body. I somehow survived *years* with only 3 hours of broken sleep a day just to take care of everyone else. I supported 7 people for years so my brothers didn't end up in foster care like I did. I knew they couldn't handle it. I supported my mom through the death of my father cause she was deep in her addiction. I cashed out my 401k to pay off her house so they would always have a place to live just for her to lose it to taxes.

 All those years of abusing my body has taken a toll on me. Every day, minute, second I am in pain. I can't work. I'm not lazy, god I wish I could work! When you lose your job, you lose your insurance and ability to go to the Dr and get your bipolar medicine. There is a pandemic right now so surprise, the government is closed. So now all my problems are 100x worse cause I have this damn chemical imbalance in my brain. 

I go on social media to just really vent, for my asshole brother *who I still support* to tell me to stfu and stop asking for a hand out and get a job. Really?!?! I never asked anyone for anything and I gave him my last $100 cause he was starving, SMH. That hurt so bad and now I can't stop crying. It may sound dumb but I can't help it. 

Sorry if I am all over the place, I just needed to get my feelings out somewhere. I'm just so tired of being the strong one all the time and am seriously thinking about just giving up
