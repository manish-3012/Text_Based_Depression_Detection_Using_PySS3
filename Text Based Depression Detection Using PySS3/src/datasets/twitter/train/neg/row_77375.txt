I think I've made a planI knew this time would come. I always got to hang on to the excuse that I didn't have a plan, a series of actions I could take with my death being the end goal. I can't say that anymore. 

I'd need 8 weeks to get my affairs in order. I guess I'll wait and see how I feel at the end of it...but the idea of acting on this series of events brings comfort. Makes me feel calm...
