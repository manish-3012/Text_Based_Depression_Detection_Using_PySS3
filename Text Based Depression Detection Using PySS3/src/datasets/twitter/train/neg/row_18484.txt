I did it, guys. I got help. I was hospitalized for 2 weeks. I attended partial treatment for almost 2 months.But I'm still struggling. The world feels crushing, everything I do is a fuckup, and I feel like everywhere I go, everything I say, I'm hurting someone or myself. I don't know how to go on, I dont know where to turn. I thought I'd feel better, having gotten all this treatment, being on 4 medications, and staying in low stress environments but it hasn't stopped and doesn't stop. I've been inches from the edge, too many times since I was cleared. 

I'm scared to admit it, I'm scared to seek help, because this has already ruined my life and I'm terrified of more damage... 

Sorry to vomit everywhere..
