End of the RoadSo this might be the last post that I ever make on a internet site, I really don't know what to write except that I have been living a almost empty life for the last few years, I feel numb, just bored, empty ... I really don't know. I need help... do I need help? ha ha heh... Please help me... I am on my last threads here
