fuck thisi donâ€™t understand the point of living..... i wish when i was 16 i wouldâ€™ve ended this shit. i was a lot braver than.. i had the courage to jump right in front a train. i still have the opportunity as i tide the metra every fucking day. and i fucking donâ€™t.. i hate the person who saved me. why did you keep me here?! why couldnâ€™t all of this end a long time ago?! shit only gets worse.. life is not worth living... it is not worth it... nothing gets better...

i wish i was strong enough.. i pray one day i get the strength i need to finally end this piece of shit life.. ugh..
