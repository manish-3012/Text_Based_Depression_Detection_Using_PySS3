** I hate living **I really hate being alive. I don't want to be alive. Every day that I wake up seems worse than the last. There's no one on this planet that gives a s*** aside for my parents. And that's not enough. It's great and all but they feel the need to have to love me but in all reality if they were given the choice I'm sure that it would shows in a much better life and having someone that wants nothing more than to be dead. I know I'm not the only one that wants to be dead... Why don't we all want to be dead so badly? Why do we not want to be here so much? Why is it so hard just to be alive everyday? I hope I don't wake up tomorrow but you sad reality is that I will. I f****** hate my life I hate everything about it and I hope you hate yours too because no matter what we're all going to f****** die so this being alive bulshit it's just a short blip and what's to come.
