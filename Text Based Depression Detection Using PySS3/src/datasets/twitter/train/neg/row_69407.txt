I'm really bad at killing myself.I'm really bad at killing myself. I've tried six, maybe seven times this year? 

I went out and bought a helium tank a couple months back. I tried later that week. As the helium in the bag got warmer and stuffier, my breaths got shorter and faster until I was starting to hyperventilate. I panicked and took the bag off my head. The next day, I tried two or more times. Same thing. 

A month later, I tried twice more to no avail. Same thing. After, I made the mistake of texting a suicide hotline. They called the police and my helium tank was taken away.

Here I am, a month later, with a new tank I bought and another bag of helium floating on my ceiling. I failed again. Same thing. 

I'm really bad at killing myself. I wish I wasn't.
