I just want a reason to stay, I hate my life so much and I can't do anything. Even if I wanted to kill myself I couldn't. I am just living in pain.Wake up

Go to school

Do well and try not cry

Feel as if everyone hates you and doesn't want to talk to you 

Feel as if no one wants you

Keep hiding more tears under the same hoodie you've been wearing the same 3 years because you hate yourself 

Get back home

Feel as if everything around you reminds you that you are useless and worthless 

Don't want to eat and take care of myself because I hate myself 

Do it anyway 

Feel sad that you are wasting space and money with your existence 

Have parents that remind you that you have no mental illness 

Have a brother who knows about your condition and you feel more like a burden on others 

Have the same brother in the same grade and doing better than you will ever do, which gives you more of a reason to end it

Hate to treat myself with respect 

Always keep hiding your tears 

Write a song about your feelings that's shit

Go on here and see others in a worse place and condemn your self for feeling that way

Cry 

Cry

Cry

Get ready for bed

Talk to your imaginary friend that you just created to help you cope with everything 

Cry some more 

Sleep

Repeat 

My fucking life for the past fucking years and I want it to end. I don't want to be a burden anymore. The worst part is that I have to hide it all cause no one cares and I don't matter. Can't get help and can't kill myself. Just in constant pain and battle with myself. I just want to leave. That's all. No one has to worry about me ever again and the world would be a much better place. 

I want to leave but I can't, so I have to live in this hell and I don't want to
