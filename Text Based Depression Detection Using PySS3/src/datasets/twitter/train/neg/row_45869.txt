I don't know how I can have a happy lifeI'm 18 and I have no idea on how to have a happy future for myself. I hate every kind of work or responsibility. Even the 4 hours of school and the homework (i'm in the end of high school) are enough to drive me crazy. I don't want the shame of being an useless guy living in my parent's house all my life. The only possibilities I see are to be unhappy in a normal adult life, to be unhappy as a homeless or to kill myself. I don't know what to do or if there is any other alternative.
