I feel so damn pathetic.Idk if this is the right sub to write this but after this i had to come straight to reddit, i literally just dreamt that i was on my way to the gas station about to buy some swishers to go and smoke weed, it was dark outside too (dont know if that has any significance) 

When i was on my way home i saw this girl that was absolutely beautiful, i wouldn't normally have the confidence to talk to her but this time i guess i couldn't let this opportunity pass up  so i go up to her and start talking tto her. 
First i compliment her looks and she starts blushing after that i know i cant mess up from here lol, then her phone starts to ring and her ringtone is one of my favourite R&amp;B songs and i instantly get happy because we share the same taste in music we even discuss top 5 albums and shit..well after that it started to rain and we both had to go inside because we didnt have jackets and she didnt want to get her hair wet.

At the end i asked for her number, she hesitated and said she doesn't give her number out to strangers but she'll give me her snapchat. 
She texted me and we started talking and flirting through text.....Then i woke up.

The reason i feel so pathetic is because i was genuinely upset that i woke up. (It felt so real)
I got up and looked in the mirror and i realised im an ugly piece of shit who has never had a serious relationship and a virgin at 19...no one will ever love me, my mood for the rest of the day is ruined. I thought i was going to brag to all my friends about how i finally got the confidence to talk to a girl and get her social media but it was all  just a shitty dream.
