What I see when people want to help meWhenever I ask for help or look for it, people look at me like I'm some freak. And I'm gonna be honest, I probably am. I describe my mental problems and other issues I'm having, and everyone says "It'll get better one day." Really? Because I have been suffering for 5 years. FIVE!!! It's the same bullshit every time, and I think I know why. There are 2 reasons. 
1.People just don't care about my issues and want me to suffer until I snap and kill myself
2.They think saying/doing the same stuff will change everything. IT WON'T!!!
