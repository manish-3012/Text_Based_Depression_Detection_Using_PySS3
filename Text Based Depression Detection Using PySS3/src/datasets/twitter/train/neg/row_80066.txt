When bpd traits ruin everythingSo I recently had one the biggest I've had with my best friend, I don't believe she will ever trust me again, she knows I'm not a bad person (I hope anyway) I emotionally manipulated her, I didn't intend to hurt her, I didn't know what I was doing, anyway, the guilt I felt, that feeling of knowing I ruined the realationship without knowing what I was doing. I lost control of mysely. This led me to attempting to hang myself, I got lucky, that's all I have to say about it. I'm scared that side of me will come back and I don't know if I could fight it again.
