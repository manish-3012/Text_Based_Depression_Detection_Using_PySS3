i am now completely disconnectedat first i thought it was a temporary thing. I now go to bed hoping i don't wake up (amongst other situational temptations). My only concern is my family might be upset if it all ends, other than that nothing else remains. this isn't a "help me" message. Just wondering how others have overcome this so i might follow (i presume that others have been this way, to think otherwise would be ignorant)
