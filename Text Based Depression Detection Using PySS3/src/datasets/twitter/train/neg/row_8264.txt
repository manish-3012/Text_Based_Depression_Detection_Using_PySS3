School is the reason for all my painEver since I was a junior in high school I became insecure because of my grades. Right now I attend community college and itâ€™s just defeating in that sort of aspect. I swore on my life that Iâ€™d get straight As, and transfer to a top20 school. Until calculus messed me up mentally. I donâ€™t even know what to do anymore. My will is broken, Iâ€™ve lost motivation. On top of that I have essays to write, a job, and I have to complete other class midterms. Itâ€™s agitating as hell. I always think that death will be more peaceful, honestly. Iâ€™ve always thought like this since highschool  and I know that isnâ€™t a good outlook on life. I just feel like I donâ€™t even have anyone to talk to in terms of my situation. I expect the same mediocre answers, like â€œsee your professorâ€ â€œeverything will get fine over timeâ€. All these quotes are the quotes that I hear everyday. I canâ€™t even process being happy after college. If Iâ€™m not happy now when will I? Iâ€™m just really fed up and tired.
