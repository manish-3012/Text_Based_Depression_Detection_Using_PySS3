I need help.I used to be able to live with depression. Yes it did effected my life but I always found a way to keep going with it. Now i can't stop but dreaming about suicide and I'm truly scared. I don't need anyone to tell me about how it would upset anyone in my life because that's the only reason I'm holding on anyway. But it feels like it won't work any longer. I just need to now how did you get motivated about anything? Just so maybe a little motivation and hope can get me busy.
