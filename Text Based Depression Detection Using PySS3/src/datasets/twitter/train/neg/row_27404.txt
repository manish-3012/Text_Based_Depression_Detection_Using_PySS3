Being ignoredI need someone to show me they care about me right now, my boyfriend, my mom,
My best friends, my sister. No one cares, everyone says that they are there for you but when you talk to them it doesnâ€™t expand past â€œdonâ€™t be sadâ€ or â€œitâ€™s going to be alrightâ€. I have been suicidal for about 3 or 4 months now and I know that my life is definitely going to end in suicide. Probably sometime in 2020 after I have got notes for everyone. I donâ€™t want to feel so sad and alone anymore.
