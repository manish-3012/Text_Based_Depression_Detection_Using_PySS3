What would you do if you were me?25 years old jobless male with no skills to get any job other than the worst jobs. I dont have friends nor partner and I dont have money. Im not fit.

I cant get fit/cant go out/cant get girlfriend without money. This is weird. Should I just go and spend my lifetime in a shitty job to have money to socialise/meet girls and maybe get one?
