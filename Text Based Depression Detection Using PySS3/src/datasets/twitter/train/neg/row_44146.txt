How do I get a normal healthy routine where I had none before?It's been that way for many years now where my parents aren't quite able to watch how I'm doing and such, I can't really follow my own list without falling into old habits again. I can barely bring myself to do normal tasks such as showering or brushing my teeth.

How can I motivate myself to get a normal routine?
