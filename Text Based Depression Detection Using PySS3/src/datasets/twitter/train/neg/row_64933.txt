Angry about someone else's suicide, but I am suicidal myselfThere's this smaller streamer who killed herself earlier this year, I watched her brothers tribute video of her and it was an insane amount of family photos, from her as a baby, childhood, all the way to her 20's. 

Seeing her smile and being with her family makes me not only heartbroken full of tears, but insanely pissed off. Pissed off that she wasn't saved in time and she had to lose her life with no way of bringing it back. Pissed off she didn't keep fighting. Pissed off because her family is enduring alot of pain.Hell I am even pissed off that al lthe comments are older and there's barely any recent ones like people forgot about her. This is all obviously nonsensical reasons to be pissed off about. 

Yet, I am a complete hypocrite. I want to kill myself too really badly. I don't want anyone to commit suicide at all, it devastates me when people do it. But I am willing to do it myself. 

Sick world we live in. I am sorry to everyone who wants to do it
