7 year relationship, alone, looking for anything to hold out forI always grew up with extreme anxiety and paranoia. I'm a diagnosed Hypochondriac with OCD. I've tried therapy but I'm dropped out after a couple of months.

 I'm a low income, self employed loser. I'm in the process of ending a 7 year relationship with my girlfriend and best friend. Both being self employed, we stayed in a lot and grew VERY close. NO ONE understands what goes on in my head but her. My social circle is small to non existent. For 7 years it was just, us. She's moving across the country in a couple of days. I'm terrified. Terrified of being alone with my thoughts and issues. I feel numb to what's happening around me. Everything feels like a pulsating black wave that hits me with negative thoughts every couple of minutes.

 I feel responsible for everything. I am responsible. I couldn't raise enough money for us. My issues ruined everything. I love her and now my only concern is getting her out of this rut. It's the last good thing I can do for the relationship. She's a beautiful person with so much potential and she deserves more. I feel as though I need to die once she leaves. I just forgot how to live without her.
