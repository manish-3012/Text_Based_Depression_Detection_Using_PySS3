iâ€™ve been depressed since i was a childiâ€™ve always known something was wrong with me. growing up, i would never experience the happiness everyone around me felt and for the longest i had mistaken my depression for being a pessimist. 

i remember being 5 and staring out of a window sad for no apparent reason and that feeling has stuck with me since.

now, iâ€™m 18 and those simple feelings have developed into suicidal thoughts and ambitions. iâ€™ve never been happy with my life, although from the outside in people wouldnâ€™t understand. i have a sister, 2 brothers and 2 parents who do fight almost everyday, but they love me. 

i just canâ€™t seem to get a grasp on why other people enjoy being here. i watched my parents pay bills, and feed me without realizing they had to work 9 to 5s the entire time.. and itâ€™s depressing.

my girlfriend just broke up with me and itâ€™s kind of the cherry on top of a lot of things i havenâ€™t mentioned. iâ€™m just ready to go. i donâ€™t wanna be here and i have my mind made up that i want to do this on friday. iâ€™m so unhappy
