What do I do nowI think I'm depressed. I haven't actually seen a doctor or been diagnosed. I'm too scared. My family might not be supportive and I'm afraid of that the most. I love my girlfriend, but I don't know how she'd react if I told her how I feel. 

I'm failing a few of my classes this semester. I don't know what the fuck I'm going to do next semester. I think I would never bring myself to the point where I'm considering it but my life seems so fucking monotonous. 

I have lots of friends, and I have a few good friends that I've known for a long time, but I'm afraid if I tell any of them how I'm feeling, they'll look at me and treat me differently. FUCK guys idk what to do
