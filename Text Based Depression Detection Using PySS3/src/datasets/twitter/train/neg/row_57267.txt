Im pretty much done with lifeThe only thing that has kept me from taking my life is the concern for my mom and younger brother. I donâ€™t want to have these connections with anyone as they mostly bring me suffering. So far life just hasnâ€™t been worth living in my opinion, Iâ€™m 17 and things are only going to get tougher for me from now on. Im currently seeing a therapist but Iâ€™m not  capable of sharing everything i would want to with her and money and social life keeps pushing me further into the void. I donâ€™t know what to do.
