Does not killing myself mean that I'm just going to drag myself through shit forever?Random thought I had after I went to bed last night: Does it make a difference if I kill myself now, or in a year or if I do of natural causes in a couple of decades or so? I'm always "planning" to kill myself if things don't get better... but I don't really have a timeframe or anything.

I don't know. Seems like there's always something preventing you to be truly happy. So you're always working for something until you simply can't anymore. I still want to do some stuff. I don't want to kill myself now. Maybe in a year?

I don't know. If I do it like next year or so, I won't have to feel this pain and sadness until I just die one day because of whatever. I could stop it now. And I'm not sure if the timing makes any difference at all, since honestly: Things will never change.
