HeartacheThere isn't much worse than seeing your spouse flirting with other women publicly on Facebook. Especially when they do everything in their power at home to stay away from you.

Everyone says, "Stay alive for your kids!" Yeah, but you can't have companionship with your young kids, you can't have romantic love with your kids. I want a friend/lover/mate who I can be nerdy with and have a meaningful relationship with, not a roommate.

Being in a relationship yet feeling like they are a million miles away, even in the same room, just hurts so much, you know? I feel so alone. I feel so.... unwanted.

Having these feelings every single day is making it very hard for me to have a reason to stay alive, honestly. I don't see the point in staying when I'm shown that I'm not wanted.
