Lately just really feel like I canâ€™t do this anymoreI feel so anxious and just completely overwhelwmed. Iâ€™m all fidgety and shifty like a fucking tweaker.

Iâ€™ve been depressed for my entire life. 5 or 6 years old I knew something was wrong with me. Hasnâ€™t gotten better. The more I learn, the more I see everyday, the more depressed I get. Iâ€™m so tired of having thoughts of killing myself
