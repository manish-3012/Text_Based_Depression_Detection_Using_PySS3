My ideal deathI would really love to quit existing all together. Not even just die, but stop existing. Unfortunately, I can't randomly stop existing so the next best thing would to be killed in a freak "accident" or murdered. I want someone or something to kill me. It would probably be easier on my family and friends because then they wouldn't have to deal with the fact that I did it myself, that I wanted to die, even though I've attempted it before and have put my family through hell for most of my life because of it.

I do have friends but I feel like none of them actually care. I'm unemployed and living at home, so these friends that I do have aren't even around anyways because they all have real adult lives with jobs and shit. I don't really hear from the people who I want to hear from the most. I feel that I will never be completely worth it to someone, that I will never be important enough to anyone. I give everything and then some to people who need support, but no one ever does that for me. There was one person who I thought did that, but turns out that was all a lie and he was probably just with me to have sex with me, just like pretty much all the other people I've met in my life.

I'm nothing more than a bag of meat to them. I am a burden to my parents and friends. I've got a whole fuckload of mental disorders that I just carry around with me and I'm not good enough at anything. Even though I've accomplished some good things I hardly even care, because I feel that none of it matters.
