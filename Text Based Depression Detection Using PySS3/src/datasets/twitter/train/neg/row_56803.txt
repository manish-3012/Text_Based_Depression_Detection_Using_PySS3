I finally told my family Iâ€™m suicidalI canâ€™t hide it anymore and Iâ€™m scared that Iâ€™ll actually do it soon. I had to reach out for help from my sister, but she lives 700 miles away. I constantly google how to commit suicide and I have a plan in the works. Not a date, I just know how Iâ€™m going to do it. Whatâ€™s holding me back is that I still need to go to the bank and get beneficiaries on my bank accounts so the money can all go to my sister. When that is done, I guess Iâ€™ll be ready. 

I am an attractive woman with a good job and lots of money. Youâ€™d think I have no reason to feel this way but it all culminates from being abused and unloved as a child. Both parents were alcoholics. My divorce was 2 days ago, and my ex-husband has a beautiful Asian girlfriend now and is happier with her than he ever was with me. Iâ€™m going to be 40 in a few months and I feel like there is nothing to look forward to. I absolutely cannot go through the pain of heartbreak again. And I donâ€™t want to be a lonely cat lady either. I feel like Iâ€™ve lived enough so I might as well end it now.  Iâ€™m on Lexapro which I hoped would help but it didnâ€™t change a thing except take away my appetite. Iâ€™ve been so depressed that I havenâ€™t left my bed in a week and Iâ€™m down to 89lb. Life isnâ€™t enjoyable, honestly it never has been.
