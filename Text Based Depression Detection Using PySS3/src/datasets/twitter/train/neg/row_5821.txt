I'm 99% sure I'm going to lose my job tomorrow and am scared about what i will do to myself if this happensim addicted to marijuana and i was pulled for a random drug test two days ago, tomorrow is my first day back since. ive struggled with major depression issues for years and pot is the only thing that helps and ive become severely dependent on it. im really scared i need help. the past two days ive done nothing but lay in my bed googling suicide methods.
