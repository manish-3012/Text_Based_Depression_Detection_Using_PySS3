I'm so fucking angryI'm so fucking angry all the god damn time. I have good friends, but they do stupid shit that just really fucking pisses me off and annoys me to no end. I can't stand being thrown around like i dont matter. My mom kicked my dad out of the house, and nobody acts like its a big fucking deal. Why the fuck is everyone so god damn fucking annoying? I can lie and pretend to be happy with everyone, but really, all i want to do is fucking scream and bash my skull against a fucking wall to make them stop. My girlfriend makes me feel guilty for spending time with my friends, then yells at me for saying that it makes me feel bad. I can't fucking take anymore shit from these shitty fucking people that live to ruin my fucking life. Fucking shit i cant deal with these stupid dumbass shitheads
