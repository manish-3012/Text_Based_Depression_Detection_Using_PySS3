The only thing that keeps me from ending it all is the pain I'll put my mom through if I do itI literally have nothing to excite me. I haven't been out in the fresh air for already 5 months now because i'm recovering from a fracture. I have the brittle bones disease, and I fracture my legs easily. I don't have friends to come by. I also have OCD and ADHD, so, learning anything is very hard. My GF broke up with me. I feel like I can't stand up for me, or for anyone I love (well, I don't just feel like it, it's true). 
So, that's that... I also forgot to mention that I'm 20 years old.
People keep telling me to "look at Hawking and see how he could do all these things yet be paralyzed on a wheelchair" 
This actually angers me bacause there's a lot of difference between me and that person. 
Anyway, I just feel like ending it all. I don't fear death. I just want to stop existing. This idea has been around for a long time, and it's only reasonable. It's not like I'll lose anything.
But then, I can't do this to my mom. She's gone through a lot to give me a good life. 
I don't know, but I think probably some day I'll just stop caring, and I'll do it. 
Oh, and the GF I was talking about, I've never even seen her. We'd been chatting online for a long time. My stupid self was emotionally connected to someone online. She made me want to live so I can go and see her one day. She helped me a lot actually. I felt like I could beat anything with her.
But then we broke up, and I don't have anything to fight for, again.
Sorry for writing so long, I just had to put these thoughts somewhere. You can ignore me. Thanks
