It's all shaking and spiralingOn vacation, thought it was 2 days left, its 3. I'm so tired, can't sleep. Cant let out stress, no books or knives. Im seeing men in trench coats they want to kill me. Could go to get a soda to relax but the fridge is too far. I'm thinking about her so much, just 3 more days and I'll be with her, she's the only one who I can let out emotion to. Then there's the other, don't want to hurt her feelings, so sorry. Raining, I want this roof to cave in on my spine. Can't talk to anyone. Stupid friend, no I'm stupid I just want to be right. Why can't I sleep? I'm fantasizing about people helping. I should get help. I need help. Please help. Im so tired
