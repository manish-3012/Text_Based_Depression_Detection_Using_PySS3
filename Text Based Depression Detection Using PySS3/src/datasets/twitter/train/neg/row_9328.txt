Right now I feel lostPeople always tell me that I am important to them. Words are just that. They can incline feelings and emotions, but they can't make me see, or feel any specific way. I've been having feelings of depression for about three years. I am 16 years old, a sophomore in high school. The problem is I don't feel like I have anything to be sad about, but that is the only emotion I can feel. Everything else is an emotional numbness that doesn't allow me to feel anything other than lost. I have friends and I have the support of them. They were by my side before and after I came out of the closet. My parents love me, and my brothers are there every step of the way, offering support as I struggle my way through life. I feel like the problem is myself, and the lies my mind is telling me. I'm the only person that I can trust, but unfortunately what I tell myself to do is not good. I started self harming about a year ago to deal with the emotional distress. It felt like the only way to express something I couldn't put words to. The only thing that makes me feel like I have a purpose is that I have the power to end my life. It's like the only thing that I have that gives me a purpose. I am completely in charge of what happens to me. I want a future, but the voices inside my head aren't in agreement. I guess I just don't know why I feel this way, or why people would even care about me.
