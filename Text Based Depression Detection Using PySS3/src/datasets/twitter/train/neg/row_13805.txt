Bursting at the seams with this painItâ€™s almost been a year since I contemplated suicide. Even wrote out a letter, which I still have. 

My life is currently in shambles. Jobless, confused, husband and I are falling apart, etc. I donâ€™t know what else is left, but to quit the game of life. 

He is too far away for me to reach out, and no one else understands me. Seems like people only say things to make it worse. Why do folks do that? Instead of trying to make you a little better, or just stay quiet; why make comments that add more salt to the wound? Just pour the whole salt shaker, why donâ€™t you? Even my husband isnâ€™t such an asshole, compared to what was said to me tonight... 

I feel like ending this is the easiest way out; nothing worth fighting for anymore. 

I need help. Iâ€™ve been screaming for help,and people brush me off like Iâ€™m over exaggerating.... I just wanted someone to talk to who wouldnâ€™t male me feel worse than he already made me feel ...
