The struggleMy name is Matt, recently I have come into some financial trouble, some may not think it much, some may view it as the mountain I see it as.

I feel as though I am about to lose everything I have worked so hard to get.

&amp;#x200B;

And so, because of this I have been feeling very suicidal, I don't see a way out of this, I don't see any silver lining the only thing I see is me losing everything and becoming bankrupt, homeless etc

The only thing holding me back are questions, I don't generally talk to people about anything, feelings, emotions, problems etc, it has just never been something that I do, I have an act or a mask and I stick to it, everyone see's me as this strong reliable bloke but in truth I am not, I just act that way because I the more I do it the more I believe it myself, that I don't need anyone, that I can do everything myself.

&amp;#x200B;

I think the only thing that brought me here was a google search on what happens after... I don't know why i'm even writing this, or why I signed up, I guess I just needed to get this out somewhere and find some answers

What happens with my debt if I take my own life?
