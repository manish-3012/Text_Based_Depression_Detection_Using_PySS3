Why does love hurt so much?Im in love with a girl, who claims to love me back but its so complicated. She said it to me and I don't know if it was in the platanic or romantic context. This uncertainty is draining me...I've been through many ups and downs in my life and I've never felt worse. I feel like my hearts about to get broken again and its incredibly emotionally painful. A similar experienced happened to me last year and it nearly destroyed me. I feel numb. Im mildly drunk, and i feel like ill never find someone who loves me like i do to them. Im only 21 so i guess this is foolish but logically it doesnt matter. I've been so driven by my feelings lately and sometimes they cant be justified by logic. I am lucky to have people in my life who love and care about me but theres this sick voice in my head saying "do it" just to spite them. And i dont want to listen to that voice. But this uncertainty, this distance between me and her further driven by the pandemic, having to wait all this time to see her and see where her heads at only to know theres a chance she just sees me platonically, it makes me want to give up. I can't stand waiting all this time. I think ill be okay but I want your advice, words, anything you can offer to a young motherfucker in love with a girl who might not love him back in the same way. Sorry for poor phrasing but im fkn posting this before i can regret it and delete it all.
