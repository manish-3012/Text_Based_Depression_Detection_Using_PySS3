I can't do this anymoreI always felt out of place with everyone of my friend groups. I always feel like I'm just a spectator rather than a player. I guess I'm a bad person and I deserve to feel that way. 

Even if people try and say nice things to me, deep down I know it's bullshit. I don't think I can last much longer
