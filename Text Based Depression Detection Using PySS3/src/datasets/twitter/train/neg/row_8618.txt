Everyone wants me to live but nobody seems to care if they make things worse for meJust a rant.

Everyone wants me to live ON THEIR TERMS.  They don't give a shit if they make it harder for me to actually try to WANT to live.  They don't care if they add to my misery.  But I'M the selfish one for wanting to die.  What's the point if nobody acts like they even want me around.  My mom just yelled at me for having a panic attack (every time I wake up i have one) like THAT will make it better.  I'm supposed to keep living even though I am miserable and frankly haven't had the will to keep going for over a year now.  

Why should I keep going when i am constantly in pain and nobody acts like they even like having me around.  

At this point wouldn't it be just as much a relief for them as it is for me?

I.  Want.  To.  Die.

But I'm not allowed.  And nothing and nobody is willing to make it easier so what's the point
