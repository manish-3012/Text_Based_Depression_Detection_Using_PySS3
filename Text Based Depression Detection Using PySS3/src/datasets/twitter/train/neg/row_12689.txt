I told my friend I wanted to kill myself today and they laughedThey fucking laughed. I love my friends. 

You know what makes it worse? They said they were depressed and were freaking tf out last week. Wanna know what I did? Fucking dropped EVERYTHING and went to their house and made them eat food, shower, and go for a walk and talk about it. 

I don't get it? I literally wanted to die and they just laughed and walked away. Wtf man?
