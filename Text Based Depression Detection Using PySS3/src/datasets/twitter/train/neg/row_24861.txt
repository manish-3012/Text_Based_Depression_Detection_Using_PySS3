Iâ€™m operating off 20%I thought this would pass that it was just a slump from the last time I posted. Itâ€™s not. Iâ€™m still miserable having a hard time staying asleep waking up in the middle of the night. Then waking up tired only to have a breakdown. Iâ€™m tired. Iâ€™m exhausted. And I wish people cared because I care about them but it just feels like a one way street. I want to feel wanted even if just for a fucking second. Thatâ€™s all I have when everything else is shit. Canâ€™t get a job, going broke and depressed. Iâ€™m just trying to find my strength and common sense. But Iâ€™m just so fucking lost.
