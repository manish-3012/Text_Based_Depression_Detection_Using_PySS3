I'm so broken I can't remember what happy is anymoreKind of a rant and a scream for help. Few weeks ago I saw a list of mandated reporter criteria for what is abuse. Well it's been getting to me and I have been having some scary flashbacks to when I was younger about 4 or 5 and my adoptive parents would lock me in my room for a nap. Even if I did take a nap I would wake up needing to go to the bathroom and finding the door still locked would bang and scream to be let out and no one would answer or come up and check on me. Also twice that I can remember I crapped my pants. It has been so thourghly fucking with me that I want these memories to stop by any means and that includes killing myself if that's what it will take then so be it. I am so alone and just feel so abandoned I don't want to be alone anymore. I can't fucking take it anymore. I think this may have been one of the reasons that I drank as much as I did. Even coming up on two years sober is not helping. I don't want to call or text the helplines after the numerous stories I've heard here. I have some severe trust issues. I no longer want to keep going or hang in there if this is going to keep fucking with me
