Very depressed... losing my home, and study... feel like giving up...I'm going to lose my student home because I couldn't pay up in time, and haven't paid for this month, and previous. By losing the home I'm forced to move back with parents who live in a different city, which means that I'll have to drop out from my studies only one month before exam. I'm starving, and I'm broke.

I've given up right now, and I'm very depressed. Don't know where to go, and I have no-one to talk to therfore I'm coming here. How do you cope with life fuking you? Pardon my language.
