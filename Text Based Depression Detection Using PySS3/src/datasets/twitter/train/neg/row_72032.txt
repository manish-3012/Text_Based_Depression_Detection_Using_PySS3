There's too many posts here. Helping is so difficult :(Yesterday I decided to break out this ancient throw away to respond to people who were coming to this community in a time of need, however after being in /new for many hours I feel like there's a tidal wave of posts that I honestly never realised from /top, hot or best. 

I get sad when I see 0/1/2 upvotes but 0 comments, I try to write a thoughtful response but it takes time and you have no idea if that's appreciated, impactful or even useful to the OP or the community. I noticed some of my posts are on 0 points meaning somebody came in and actually downvoted, which is okay but I don't get feedback on why, and it doesn't feel welcoming or encouraging at all.

It's hard to appreciate the posts here since there is no emotional connection, I don't know if the post is by a human, bot or super intelligent AI and that makes it even harder, I wanted to respond to as many new posts so they don't just go ignored but it takes so long to not just write a generic comment that might as well belong to subreddit simulator.

I'm sorry to those who are really going through a rough patch, I often think it's worth dying on a daily basis as life to me is so meaningless, yet I try to find meaning as a way of pushing through the daily grind that feels like the world's shittiest F2P game.

I wish I could help you all, or you could live a purposeful life, but I realise it's really a law of averages. We're just one of several billion who exist at this time, and we're not even a pixel of the overall population, although it's hard to know just how many suffer from depression, or suicidal ideation.

Anyway, I look forward to this sitting on 1 upvote (or 0!) with no comments, instead I'll disguise myself with the 100 other threads to come before the days out.

Cheers all.
