How do people not realize this?I've been trying to convince myself otherwise for awhile, but I just can't. Life is pointless to me. I don't see any point in trying to improve my life after realizing this. Why should I try to move out of my parents house, find a career, etc, when I know none of it matters? I don't understand how other people don't see this. In 100 years, nobody will remember anybody on this Earth, so why shouldn't I end mine early if I'm not happy with it?
