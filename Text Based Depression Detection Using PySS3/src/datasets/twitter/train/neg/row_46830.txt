I've been thinking scary things alot latelyI'm married. I have 2 kids. I'm a 25 year old stay at home mom. I have a pretty good life. Except my husband doesnt spend time with me he would rather be with his friends. I have PTSD, depression, and anxiety. I dont know why I'm writing this. Call it a cry for help or a need to feel loved. I wrote a suicide note tonight and my husband took it from me. I'm laying in bed crying because I feel completely alone in the world right now. If it weren't for my kids I'd do it but they dont deserve to grow up wondering why they weren't enough. My past is awful, one trauma after another and I just want better for them but how can I ensure they have a better life if I cant stop thinking about ending mine? I feel alone and unloved. If you read this jumbled mess of emotions thank you. I just want to be heard.
