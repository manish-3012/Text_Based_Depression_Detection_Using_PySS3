I go through pretty intense spells of lonelinessHave a SO, but they're always busy, or not present for days. Can't bring this up to them cuz they take it as criticism if I try. Have been going through very intense spells of feeling lonely. No friends.

Lost my friends this year, all two of them. It's hard to stay here, it gets painful. Also deal with anxiety to a very painful degree. Have had very terrible chest pain. I'm tired. Want it to stop
