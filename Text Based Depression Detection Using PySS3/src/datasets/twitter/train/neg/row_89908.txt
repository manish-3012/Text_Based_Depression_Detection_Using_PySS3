26I'm not really sure why I'm still posting. I guess I'm just lonely.

Things have gotten so much worse since I made up my mind a few months ago to end it all on 1/8.  I don't want to repeat it all, but it's in my post history if you're interested. Long story short, I am now unemployed, disabled, and have lost literally everyone I cared for. There is no hope of things ever getting better, at least to a point of making any of this worth the trouble. I have 26 days until my departure date, and the days are so, so long. I've mostly been sleeping them away, biding my time until I can fulfill my promise to you all on this to see at least the beginning of 2019. But you can only sleep so much. Now I'm wide awake, can't go for a walk anymore, can't really do anything as an outlet. I'm glad I only have four more weeks here, but they are crawling by. The end can't come soon enough.

I hope you are all well.
