In a rare turn of events, I end up here. I live a total facade. I have this really complex identity dysphoria and its becoming hard to feel any kind of happiness. I remember learning about some philosophical idea called eudamonia- it means a state where you have maximized your potential, or have the satisfaction of achieving the best you could in all areas of your life.

Anyway, I can't achieve this 'eudamonia' because I have something called autogynephilia. Bottom line here, I've just recently come to terms with this but I know I hate being this way- and its a serious condition that I'm not sure is curable. I'm not sure if it stems from me being an in-the-closet transexual, and I'm not sure if I care that it may be the reason.

I just want to be fucking normal, and its impossible. I can confide in no one. No one knows about what I'm dealing with and nobody really cares.  

I started by saying that I live a facade, but actually- thats only partially true. I lived (with a D) a facade, but everyday I'm slipping out of it. I'm slowly losing any and all ability to pretend that I give a fuck about anything. "OMG, lets go to starbucks and..." No. Fuck off. 

I don't want to pretend about anything anymore, and I can't transition because (1) I'm too masculine of a person to be 'passable' (2) I don't have the resources, and (3) I'm not a normal transexual. 

I know I'll probably get directed to some LGBT or similar resource, but I've done enough lurking there already. Additionally, I've tried to enhance my coping by writing my own blog and do some reach out. But its not enough. 

I can't feel happiness. I can't be myself. No one understands exactly or gives a fuck...
