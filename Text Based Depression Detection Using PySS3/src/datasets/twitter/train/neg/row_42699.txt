Please help.I am 13.
 
I know i am selfish .

When i was 6 someone done something bad to me.Even though it wasnâ€™t me i feel guilty and disgusted at myself.

In school i fail most my grades.I am just a failure to my family ..I have low self esteem with how i look because i have a lot of anxiety and iâ€™m very self conscious about how i look. I donâ€™t even know why i care as iâ€™m ugly anyway.

There are also loads of fights in my family and i hate it.It has made me more aggressive.

I have never talked to anyone about this and i need help.

I just hate my self and want to die.
