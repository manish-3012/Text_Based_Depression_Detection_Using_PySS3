I am poor, my parents are not. I live in Canada (British Columbia), what options do I have as far as seeing a therapist goes?Sorry, I know I should just google it, but I need some help. Tried to kill myself a few times before, seen some therapists before. What options can a poor person with wealthy-ish parents (don't want to ask them for therapy again--didn't help because I can't open myself to someone who is on my parents' dime).

I'm over legal age and I don't want to die, I think.
