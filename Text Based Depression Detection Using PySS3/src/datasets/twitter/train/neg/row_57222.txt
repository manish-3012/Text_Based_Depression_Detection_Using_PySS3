I'm so lostive pushed away all my friends I recently lost my job and now I think I just ruined my relationship with my girlfriend the one person I truly loved being with.

I fuck up everything and I've done some horrible things. There's also so many tiny annoyances in my life right now that are all adding up. I'm young only 19 but I feel so lost and hopeless. I was always shit in school I know I'm never going to do anything useful and ruining this relationship is really the end of it for me. It was the only thing making me happy and like everything else in my life I fucked it up. Nobody but me is at fault for this mess and I just don't know what to do now.

Looking back at everything it was so preventable. I feel like subconsciously I was trying to ruin everything good that I had for some reason. Maybe I subconsciously wanted attention from people so I did these things and I eventually took it too far and now everything's fucked. I sit at home all day trying to sleep as much as possible to pass the time when I'm awake I watch shitty YouTube videos I'm such a loser. I ruined the last thing that made me happy and now I'm fucked I have literally nothing to look forward to now so what's the point. I'm sure if I tried I could start new and meet new people but I'm just so demotivated.

I would've killed myself last night if I had a gun. I'm so lost I don't know what to do
