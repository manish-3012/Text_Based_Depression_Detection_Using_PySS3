Done with everything, life is an exhausting messI canâ€™t stop with the self destructive coping mechanisms. I canâ€™t stop pushing people away. I canâ€™t stop snapping at friends and family even if they donâ€™t deserve it. All I do is hurt people, so why should I carry on? Being gone is the best choice rn. When I am, I donâ€™t have to worry about hiding everything anymore. Maybe one or two people would be slightly bothered by that, but they will get over it fast enough
