I donâ€™t want to be live anymore.Iâ€™m in an emotionally abusive relationship. I have no family. I have one friend. Two children one of which Iâ€™m in a custody battle over and fighting false reports and allegations to CPS. Iâ€™ve only been able to see him for 6 hours in the last 3 months. Didnâ€™t get to start seeing him until February and CPS is closing the case which means supervised visitation are no longer an option through them and his father is no longer speaking to me. My abusive SO family is constantly telling me how sorry they are for my daughter for having me as a mother. Iâ€™m want to end it all but SO might end up in prison or jail and I donâ€™t want my daughter bounced around in foster care or worse yet raised by my narc mother or my SOâ€™s shit parents. Iâ€™m only alive for my children and I donâ€™t know how much longer that can keep me going.
