Sorry, no robots here.I had a whole 1000 word spiel written out that I was going to post here, but it's dumb, and goes off on tangents about robots and the moon.  Kind of stupid.  
    
I can't seem to connect with anyone and it's horrible.  Any friends I make are gone again within a few months, and it always seems to be me doing the legwork.  The idea of a girlfriend at this point is laughable for several reasons.  My life just lacks direction, and is very lonely.  I have the social skills of a grilled sandwich, and not even a tasty one.
    
I've tried to fix these things.  I've done lots of volunteer work, where I met some people, who I now don't ever speak to.  Tried to get out to places more, but that hasn't worked.  I'm at a loss of what to do really.  I'd like to travel somewhere, but I'm broke, and I'm pretty certain I'd just come back to being in the exact same situation again.
    
I'm not completely ignorant of any positives in my life, it's just that they're so horrible outweighed by negatives, some of them that I can't do anything about.

I suppose you could say I have suicidal thoughts a lot, lately especially...but then it's something I'd never go through with, I can't see it ever happening (so goes the usual "I don't know if I should be posting this here, etc").  But then, it's worrying to be having them in the first place really.  I've been meaning to post something here for months, but never felt the need to (that's not the wording I'm after, but you probably get what I mean), and I've got no idea what I'm expecting from this.  Nothing really I guess.
