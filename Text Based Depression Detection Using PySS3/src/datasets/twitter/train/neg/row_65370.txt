no one loves me, no one will miss me when im goneim 20, been lonely my whole life, my roommates legit ditched me, i've never had girlfriend, is it too much to ask for someone just to hug me?  


is it too much to ask for?  


im not entitled to love no... but i just want it. i need it in my life, but i've never had it...
