How do I stop thinking about death and having random thoughts?  I don't want to die but the thoughts don't stop.I keep having really horrific thoughts about varies ways of killing myself.

It can be very detailed to not that specific.  It is happening a lot lately as I'm going through a tough time in my life and struggling with depression.

I'm freaking out and having mini anxiety attacks often.  Is there a way to stop the thoughts??  WTF I just want to focus on getting stuff done and feeling better.
