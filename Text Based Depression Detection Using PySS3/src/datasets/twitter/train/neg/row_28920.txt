What can I do when someone on social media is suicidal?Thereâ€™s a guy I used to go to school with. I had him in my 7th period when I was a freshman, I believe he was a junior. He was pretty popular, sat next to the cute girls in class and was always making them laugh. 

Fast forward to about 3 years later, heâ€™s 22-23, and is very open about his depression and suicidal tendencies. I messaged the guy one time to let him know Iâ€™m here for him in case he needs a friend. He never replied. It was okay though, for a while he seemed to be doing alright. Today though, this guy just posted two pictures of his arm and wrist bloodied up and covered in cuts. Iâ€™m legitimately worried for this dude right now. Trying to talk to him about this didnâ€™t help, so I need another plan. Would calling suicide prevention be any good?
