Does anyone else feel calmer with a knife near by?When I feel suicidal I keep my folded pocket knife by me. I either hold it, or keep it by me, and it calms me down. I don't know if it's because I've love my pocket knife, or if it lets me vent in an unusual way.

It was $8 on amazon, but it is the single best crafted knife I have owned. The design of the knife is awesome, the blade and metal parts are colored blue, it gets this oil slick pattern when it's dirty, and it's hella sharp. I've had it for 3 years and it still looks amazing. Still sharp, too. When you run your finger on the edge, it feels like silk. I always carry it around on me. I feel safe when I have it on me when I'm out of the house.

However, I've always thought about using it to kill myself. I have always kept it away from me when I get very badly suicidal while not wanting to commit suicide.

I'm just wondering if others feel this way too.
