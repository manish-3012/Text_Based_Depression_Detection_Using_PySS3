I told my mom I was having suicidal thoughts. She handed me a glass of water, a bottle of Tylenol and left to go shopping at Walmart.She gave me the Tylenol because I have a fever and live with chronic pain. But my aunt died from an intentional OD of Tylenol, so the circumstances are just not ok in my mind. She didn't even say anything to me after I shared my thoughts with her. I hope you guys have more thoughtful and supportive people in your lives. Feeling invalidated is a terrible feeling.
