Help a sister outHow do you know when you have suicidal ideation? I drove by a full funeral home today (apparently the rona doesn't exist in the south). I pulled over in a pet store parking lot and cried for 45 minutes. I had longing for that. I was so mad at myself, but that thought brought me peace. I don't have active suicidal thoughts. I'm a clinician, I know the drill of having a plan, warning signs, etc. But how do you know when you're needing help? My husband has poor health literacy and trusts whatever I say about physical or mental health. We call them "bad thoughts" in my house. And we talk it out and I tell him I'm in control. I feel less in control than I did a few months ago when I first had these thoughts. These are all passive thoughts. Just like "it would be kind of nice to not wake up," or "I'm an organ donor, a car crash wouldn't be terrible?" 

tldr: passive suicidal ideation--is it serious and should you get help? Like I don't really want to do anything about it but if it were to be over tomorrow that'd be cool.
