I am tired of my lifeI am so tired, I am crying now while Iâ€™m writing this, and my husband has just stopped playing his Nintendo and fell asleep. We got into an argument again, he hates me, he thinks I have destroyed his life. I have no one, my mother was murdered 9 years ago when I was 17, grandmother died few months after, my father told me I am old enough to figure out what to do. I havenâ€™t seen him much before, and never seen him after. Another grandmother is very similar to him. She never cared, and never cares about anyone. All this time I have been in a depression. I lost all my friends. I didnâ€™t get a degree, I was working to pay off motherâ€™s debts. My little sister was taken by a different family who hates me and turned her against me. I shut myself down in my apartment. My husband was with me since my motherâ€™s death. I was looking for someone to love me and found him. I loved him. He wasnâ€™t ready for a relationship with a traumatized person. He is blaming me for being antisocial, blaming for him feeling alone at his gatherings with friends. Itâ€™s been 9 years. He hates me more everyday. I canâ€™t leave him, because we are in the joint process of paperwork for immigration. I am tired. He didnâ€™t propose, we married out of convenience. He never hugs me, never talks nicely. He asks me to shut up when I start speaking. He says he wasted his youth because of me. That I am the worst woman and wife he knows. I have started school, I was feeling a little better. Got best results in the class but was the only one who wasnâ€™t accepted for transfer. This hit me so hard. He is saying he feels sorry for me, but in reality he became more aggressive. And even if I would be accepted, Iâ€™m not eligible for financial aid because of his salary. I chose to study full time to finish a degree faster so I could escape. All he has now he got from me, and he yells at me for being useless. Iâ€™ve sold everything to bring us here, even my motherâ€™s apartment. I was working day and night so he could study. I never asked him for anything when I had money. Now Iâ€™m suffering. I need to choose between my mental health and his help with my tuition. I am trying to not give up, apply again, bear with everything, but I canâ€™t do it anymore. My heart aches. My chest is stuffed. I donâ€™t want to go back to my country. I just canâ€™t. I am crying now, I am crying every day and night. I already have my own â€œpharmacyâ€ at home with all kind of pills. Now I am taking them everyday to sleep day and night and not be in this reality. Nothing helps. I am so lonely, but I donâ€™t trust people. I am failing at everything I am doing. I just canâ€™t anymore. I am tired of my life.
