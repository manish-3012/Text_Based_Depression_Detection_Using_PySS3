Does anyone else feel like the universe is trying to tell you to kill yourself?I've never had a friend and whenever I think I can call someone a friend they do something to wrong me. I've never had a successful relationship. Whenever I feel like I can call someone my girlfriend they cheat on me. Whenever i feel like i did great during an interview i don't get the job. I'm really starting to feel like the universe is sending me hints.
