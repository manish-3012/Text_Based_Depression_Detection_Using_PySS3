I'm 19, pregnant, being pressured into an abortion and on the verge of suicideSomeone please help me. I'm 19 and recently found out I'm pregnant. My boyfriend is 22 and we've only been together for a little over a month. From the second he found out, he demanded I get an abortion. I made it clear I don't want to. Just a little while ago he was at my house. We discussed things briefly and when I mentioned not wanting to get an abortion, he stormed out and slammed the door. Just left me. My father did the same exact thing to my mother and it's damaged me tremendously, as he's never been a part of my life. I don't want to get an abortion, I don't think I could handle giving my baby up for adoption, but I'm not secure enough to raise it completely on my own, either. Someone please help me. All I can think about is how I want to die and relieve everyone of their burdens. Please help me.
