i feel horrible about something in my past that i did absentmindedlya few years ago my parents were doing work on our house so my siblings stayed in my room with me. something i did normally was to masturbate so that i could fall asleep. i wasnâ€™t really taking it seriously because it was my room and something i was kinda desensitized by but now i feel really sick about it because now i recognize that it was extremely inconsiderate of me to do that. i had my headphones in as well and was really certain they wouldnâ€™t know. my intentions were to do it to sleep so i didnâ€™t really think about it too much but i feel pretty horrible about it now. ive been having suicidal thoughts as well which iâ€™m sure i deserve. like the action itself was completely separate from them but i know that doesnâ€™t excuse it. iâ€™m a female and iâ€™m also more of an adult so i feel sick. i know it was wrong it was selfish and i wasnâ€™t thinking about others. i wanna clarify i had no intentions other then doing it to go to sleep like i normally did but idk how to live with myself.
