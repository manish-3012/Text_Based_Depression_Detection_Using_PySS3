I have always wanted to talk to someone so heres my last shot.I am currently 15 years old and had been depressed since my 8th grade, ive been thinking about suicide before but now its really serious so ive come to look for help here because no one believes me, relatives, family or my only friend that i have.

I feel like there is no point in living unless you have a job and economy like youtubers or song artists who wipe their asses with 100 dollar bills while we can barely get food on the table.

Why do we need school? Im sick of it, people treat it like its a godlike thing while we go to school, barely fight to get through it and then? Then after we waste 12+ years of our childhood we continue to work like goddamn slaves for little food that we can get.

I get it money doesnt bring happiness but it gets you the freedom of being able to do what you want.

We have been taught that being greedy is bad, but really every single person is greedy and they are just scared of admiting it.

Im just afraid of ending up homeless, or failing school because our whole life depends on it.

Im currently wanting to start recording dor youtube because i truly love that and it can bring wealth, i am planning to quit school if that doesnt work out cause its my last resort.

Are there any ways to fight this depression? I know i sound like a stereotypical teen but thats how it is.

Thanks for reading and sorry for errors as i am on a phone.

EDIT:  I also forgot to add that i am fat, i had a double scoliosis surgery which means they cut my back from my neck to my ass and screwed 2 titanium rods on my spine which was a good thing cause that was a whole month my family pretended to care about me. I have never kissed a girl and no one likes me even if im good to everyone and not offending anyone. Again, no reason to continue "living" i pray every day to just die or something, i am not emo but thats how i truly feel.
