Is there a hotline I can call even if I have a plan?I want to die. My mental illness doesnâ€™t get any better no matter how much I try and I really do try. I have a therapist and a psychiatrist and even with all this help I donâ€™t get any better. I can hardly work and am completely financially dependent on my parents. At 27 fucking years old. I do have a plan and I know I want to go but I just want to talk to someone not so they can put me in a hospital and try to save me but just so I can tell another human I am scared to go but Iâ€™m more scared to live in this pain.
