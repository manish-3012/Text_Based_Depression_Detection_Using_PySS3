Money lost and about to hang myselfThrowaway for obvious reasons, excuse my english, not a native speaker. 

Welp so here it is. It feels weird just typing this but anything goes when you're desperate I guess? I'm not sure what I am achieving by doing this but here it goes:

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 24, at university, graduating next year. About 1,5 years I stumbled on to an online gambling site and decided to give it a go, played 20 euros and won 120. 1,5 years later and I'm dead broke, spent all my savings (2500 euros), got 2000 euros in Paypal debt and just lost my last winnings from yesterday. This is it. There is no more. Paypal won't cover me anymore since they limited my account because of the debt. I don't have any money. I honestly can't believe what has happened the last year. There were nights I won 10 grand, only to lose it all in about 3 hours. This happened 3 times. 3 times, can you imagine? Can you imagine winning 10 grand and not telling anybody, but waste it all in 3 hours on a game?

I was actually pretty happy a year ago. I had (and still have) an amazing girlfriend that thinks I'm her hero, I've got a loving home with parents that take perfect care of me. They are the ones that saved up 2500 euro for me. That 2500 euro lasted me all but one night.

I've got nowhere to go, nowhere to run. Christmas is coming up and my girlfriend and family expect me to buy presents. I mean, why wouldn't I? I work on the weekends and just sold everything expensive I own, I must have a fair amount of money right? I've managed to keep all of this a secret during the last year, but I can't do it anymore. 

You should feel me tense up when somebody mentions money. When my girlfriend takes my phone to check something. If my girlfriend finds out she would be so disappointed, she's perfect with money, she's saving up, buying cheap food, not going out to save more. And then there's me with 0.00 in my bank account and a 2000 paypal debt.

Now I'm in my room looking at my belt and thinking how quickly this could all be over. I could hang myself on the doorknob, and it would be all over. My dad would find me in the morning when he comes to check why I haven't waken up. He'd be alright, it's my mom I'm worried about. My dad would take care of her I guess. He would tell my girlfriend, he's a doctor so he's used to giving people bad news. She has lots of friends, they would without a doubt take care of her, better than I can at the moment I guess. It would work out eventually. I don't know anymore. It feels scary writing all this. Why man, why? It needs to stop. But it can't come out, it must never come out. I don't know anymore. I'm literally shaking, this is fucking pathetic.

Please help me.
