Tried talking to mother...24 year old female. Long story short... my grandmother (who basically raised me) passed away in October. Due to being a college grad but sucky economy I had to move out of my grandmothers home (who I lived with) back into my mothers home. Things have been literal hell, she fusses about me and my dog 24/7 vacuums three times a day due to my dog and doesnâ€™t allow me to touch any cleaning supplies, kitchen area, or laundry room due to me â€œbeing messyâ€ Iâ€™m not allowed to lay on the couch or anything because â€œIâ€™ll damage itâ€. So therefore I spend  all day in my little room when Iâ€™m not at work or grad school. 

Iâ€™m just done. I honestly hate coming home and find myself driving to a parking lot and just sitting in my car to avoid going home. I often talk about moving out to which my mom response is â€œIf you leave this house before your get your masters degree, youâ€™ll be exiled from the family and Iâ€™ll never talk to you again, you canâ€™t manage it on your ownâ€

Iâ€™ve researched how to hang yourself via a doorknob... I think thatâ€™s my best option right now. 

Iâ€™ve been dealing with PTSD and depression since my brother tragically died when I was 12. Iâ€™m just at the end of trying anymore. 

I probably wonâ€™t go through with it.. ( I dream of a day where this night will be just a bad memory) I just needed a space to vent.
