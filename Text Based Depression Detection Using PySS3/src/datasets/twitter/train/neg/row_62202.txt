Trying not to spiral outMy past year of life has been the roughest one ever, and at the age of 26 I am having a really hard time keeping my head up. I have ADD (diagnosed) and most likely depression (not diagnosed) and this past year has me spinning out hard. My highs are great, I beam happiness and inspire people around me, or so I am told. But my lows make me feel like there is no reason to keep continuing this life. In this year I have, failed out of school for the second time with no degree and 120k in debt. I lost my dog which was the only thing keeping me in contact with my parents about 3 months ago. I have no job and my girlfriend of 3 1/2 years just broke up with me over this past weekend citing that we are toxic to one another. I can see her side because I isolate myself from her and my friends and spend ~10 hours or more a day on my computer at my lowest points. I feel so disconnected from society that the only way that I actually feel good is when I am at a rave or festival fucked up. All of my actual friends live over an hour and a half away, and if I did decide to move back to where my parents live it would put them closer to three hours away. I also live with my ex-gf at this point and am not even sure about whether to just say fuck it and leave or to stay and push through. I feel like seeing her everyday is going to kill me inside knowing that we're not together, but at the same time just cutting ties and running as far away as I can will hurt the same. She has said to me that she would be down with the idea of us trying again at a later date, but I am not really a person who makes the same mistake twice so I almost don't even want to entertain that idea. My support systems feel like they are failing and I feel like any friends I have made at school are more my ex-gf's friends than actually my friends. I'm just trying to find meaning to my life because it feels like everything is crumpling away and I can't really see a reason to continue.
