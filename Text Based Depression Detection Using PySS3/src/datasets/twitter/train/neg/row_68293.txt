Do you think facing death/suicide helps as release or is not a good idea?Hypothetically..

do you guys think facing death/suicide makes you feel better or not a good idea?

when I was younger I would hold a gun to my head and it would make me feel better (havent had one in years). hypothetically driving through the area and only like 100 miles from the golden gate bridge and, as I have felt my whole life, always comtemplating, and recently very much so

I feel like it could help, going to the golden gate bridge and maybe walking across a few times, sit there a few hours, might make me feel better. or not, any of you have any similar experiences with that, good idea and makes you feel better like a huge release or not a good thing to do?
