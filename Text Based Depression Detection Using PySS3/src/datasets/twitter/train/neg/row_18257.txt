Should I admit myself to the hospital because I need...attention?Title kinda sounds off but let me explain: Iâ€™ve been going through extreme isolation. I have no friends, no online friends, I donâ€™t talk to family, and I live alone. Iâ€™m locked in my house, I donâ€™t leave it. I realized Iâ€™m beginning to lose my mind somewhat. Iâ€™m getting dissociation episodes that last a couple hours per day. My suicidal thoughts occur everyday. I know I wonâ€™t act on it because I have nothing to end my life in a painful way. If I had a shotgun or some drugs to put me to sleep I would most likely do it when Iâ€™m feeling really down. But I also get CONSTANT negative emotions and thoughts that keep popping up in my head without actually thinking about it. Distracting myself doesnâ€™t work much, I still get negative feelings (guilt, shame, fear, etc.). 

I know it sounds selfish but I feel so depraved and I donâ€™t feel connected with my emotions and feelings. I want to be admitted to the psych ward in the hospital, but I also suffer from generalized anxiety disorder. I even feel guilty about admitting myself to the hospital because I feel that my issues arenâ€™t worthy enough to be admitted. I have been to the hospital before only when I was drugged up and couldnâ€™t process what was going on. Iâ€™m not actively trying to kill myself but I also feel the need to get some sort of attention and help, I just need to escape from whatever is hurting me inside. 

I hope this doesnâ€™t sound completely irrational but what other choice do I have? Talking to someone on the suicide hotline isnâ€™t enough. Iâ€™m honestly so tired of feeling so awful constantly, I need a way to escape. My only other option is drugs for temporary escapism. Iâ€™m in so much pain everyday it wonâ€™t stop.
