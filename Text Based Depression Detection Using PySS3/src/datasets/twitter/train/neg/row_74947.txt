Fuck, I can't get "laid" on reddit.After reading and answering to some posts around here I'm slowly realising that I'll still have to go through it alone. Nobody understands me, my ideas, the fact that there is no god, we live in a chaotic universe and what can happen will happen (meaning you will suffer if the chaos of the universe decides so) and because our nature is selfish (350 million years old lobsters and 3,5billion years old bacteria say so) we, those who have felt the real suffering and survived (or partially survived) and found an answer to our suffering (or some answer) should understand that the only way we can survive in this universe is as one. I'm not gonna expand on this idea. Since you never had it or anything cloe to it you also probably won't understand one yota out of it. I actually wanted to write a really long post trying to explain a lot of shit and spill some of my guts out but I realised the uselessness of that so this all that you get. Not that you need it.
