I've lost the will to live I think...I feel like I've been losing the will to live for years now , it has gotten to the point where I have been hospitalized 3 times from lack of nutrition because I can barely bring myself to eat, the only thing keeping me going is my mother and little brother, but it gets harder and harder everyday any advice ? I've decided if I get sick again I will just end it I can't keep living this way.
