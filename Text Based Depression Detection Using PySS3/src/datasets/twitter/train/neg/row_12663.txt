Need a gun 19fAlready been struggling so much with depression and anxiety. Guy I've been talking to just told me he doesn't want a relationship and hates how i talk lovey to him even though we've been talking flirty for months. Blocked me.

Lost my best friend because of my own stupid mistake.

My parents are divorced and trying to be friends but still fight off and on all the time. Been dealing with the screaming, violence, and insanity my entire life. 

I try to talk to people. Most ignore me or can't handle me anymore. I'm too annoying. Too depressing. Too stupid. The only thing I have to look forward too is getting fucked up enough to forget about all of this for a while. 

All I want is a gun so I can finish this and finally gain some fucking peace
