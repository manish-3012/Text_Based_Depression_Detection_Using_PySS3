Totally lostIâ€™m lost, i quit high school 2 years ago and didnâ€™t do anything since except getting my driverâ€™s license. 
I applied for a job, got it, then left after 3 hours on my first day because nothing felt right.
Iâ€™m usually a pretty negative person but i really tried to only see the positives of being there ( told myself iâ€™m lucky for getting a job for applying to only one, ill finally have my money and be independent and all that stuff ), but as soon as some dumbass boss acted all superior and was making me feel like an idiot for not knowing something that i canâ€™t know since i just arrived and all my thoughts began to go the opposite way. 

I started realizing that i donâ€™t want to force myself out of bed at 5AM to be exploited, badly treated and barely paid, ( how the fuck are some people doing this for all their lives??) plus i started feeling crazy self conscious to a point where it was mentally screwing me and i just had to leave, i went to the office of the women who had given me the interview, and as soon as she asked why i wanted to leave i just broke down and cried like a little girl, i couldnâ€™t control it, i was sobbing and trying to explain what i felt, told her i planned on killing myself multiple times before i got the job and since i didnâ€™t well here i am. She was very understanding, sacrificed half an hour of her job to make me feel better, told me that i didnâ€™t have to feel bad for leaving and all. 

Since then i didnâ€™t even look for another job, i feel like i canâ€™t work for a big company, and i donâ€™t think i can handle having a meaningless job that i donâ€™t enjoy doing. 

So here i am, spending my days at home ( i live with my grand parents and reached a point where i can absolutely not bare them anymore, i constantly avoid them even tho weâ€™re in the same house ) trying to find a job that i could do without hurting my mental health ( i obviously donâ€™t have any diplomas or anything)
I canâ€™t seem to find anything, nothing motivates me, the only reason i want to work is to escape my grand parents, but iâ€™d rather stay at theirâ€™s and do nothing than doing a job i hate just to get away from them

Iâ€™m totally lost, everyday iâ€™m stuck between wanting to live because thereâ€™s many thing i love about this world, but i canâ€™t because i have to be a wage slave all my life for it, stuck between should i kill my self or keep going, stuck between wanting to bring joy and wholesomeness in this world but most people in my country are selfish fuckwads and donâ€™t even know the concept of being nice and helping each other

This is more of a rant than anything but if you think you can help me, please do so


TL;DR : Left high school, got a job, couldnâ€™t keep it because being a wage slave isnâ€™t my thing, iâ€™m now stuck with my grand parents who i hate and i donâ€™t know what to do from now on
