My suicidal ideations have been morphing into me actually considering killing myselfI donâ€™t want to go into the spiel about why Iâ€™m depressed, but basically Iâ€™m lonely and nobody cares about me, I have no future, etc. 

Iâ€™ve fantasized about killing myself for a while now. Itâ€™s always been on and off, but for the last month itâ€™s the only thing on my mind. Recently, as in the past few days, my suicidal ideations have started to worsen. I was on my way home when the sudden intrusive thought of me jumping in front of a bus popped in my head. At that moment, I realized that I did not fear death. I felt a complete wash of numbness overtake me. I havenâ€™t been able to stop thinking about it since. 

All day, everyday, just â€œbus, bus, bus, bus. It would be so easy to walk along the highway and wait for a city bus. Jump. Bus. Neck snap, ribs crush.â€ and I donâ€™t know how to feel about this all. A very small part of me thinks about how thereâ€™s no going back, how I would almost certainly be crushed. That rational part of me always kept me from hurting myself but itâ€™s almost completely gone. The urge to step in front of that bus is overpowering, I feel it in my bones. Iâ€™ve never experienced numbness until now. I donâ€™t know what to do, my thoughts are racing.
