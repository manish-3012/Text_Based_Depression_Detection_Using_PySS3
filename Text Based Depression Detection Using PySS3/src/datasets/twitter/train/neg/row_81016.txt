I really wanna dieBeen drinking and taking any drugs I can afford the last few weeks. The only reason not to kill myself at the moment is my girlfriend. Although she's pretty mentally fucked herself, she still doesn't really know how to handle me/anyone as fucked. 
Been thinking about suicide a lot, im certain im going to kill myself next week. i havent seen my gf in a bit over a day now and its already fucking me up way too much, i managed to become way too dependant on another person again. listening to lil peep rn and drinking some nice champagne monopole. im craving some xanax (although im not physically addicted, last time was over a month ago) rn, just to numb my mind enough to be able to deal with this shit... I don't know what to do
