I don't want to be hereI hate my life. There are some bright shiny things to go along with the bad but the bad crushes me. I don't want to be here. I don't want to feel this way. I don't want anything. It's better to be alone than to be with someone and feel alone. Unloved. Worth nothing. I really hate it here.
