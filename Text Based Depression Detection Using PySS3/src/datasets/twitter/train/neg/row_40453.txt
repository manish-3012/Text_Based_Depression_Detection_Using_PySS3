Is the hotline useful at least a bit or is it just as bad as everyone is sayingMany people who have no idea what I'm going through always told me that there's a hotline for suicides but I never really bothered since the people on the end probably never went through the things I did but there are times in the middle of the night when I feel like talking to someone but they are all sleeping. I don't want the police to think that I'm suicidal just because I called the hotline, I don't need more problems, and I don't want people to say useless shit for something they don't understand. I'm not a very patient person unless I have to talk to the person so I would probably hang up pretty quickly since talking on the hotline would not be a priority. 

So does it just depend on what kind of person gets the call or is the hotline just bad in general?
