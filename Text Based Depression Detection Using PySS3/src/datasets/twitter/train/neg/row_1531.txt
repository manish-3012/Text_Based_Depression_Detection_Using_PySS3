I'm not sure where to go from hereI posted on here almost two months ago about how I wanted to escape to the city or just get it over with. Well I did end up escaping to the city, and a lot has happened since I did that. About two weeks ago I snapped and made my way about 40 miles south from where I was to philly. I was going to either get lost in drugs or kill myself, I'm still not sure what. I ended up getting scared, and I was rescued by a friend. Two days later I found myself back in the psych ward. I've since been released, and I've started outpatient therapy and medicine, and some days are really really good, but today is not one of those days. I've lost a lot of friendships from what I did, and I'm currently living with my ex-boyfriend and his family until I can find my own housing. Today I just feel so overwhelmed and like I should have stayed in the city or died that night. I don't really have anyone I can talk to anymore. I'm not quite sure where I go from here. I feel like a burden. Plus I'm still desperately in love with my ex so living here is tough sometimes. Sometimes he reciprocates my feelings. Sometimes he doesn't. I just feel like my brain is a horrible mess sometimes. I feel like everyone would be better off without me.
