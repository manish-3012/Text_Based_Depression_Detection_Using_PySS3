Help meI can't keep doing this.  It has gone on for much too long and I can't fucking take it and I'm going insane.  I've hit the point where I'm constantly fighting with myself in my head over life and death, taking both sides at the same time.

I just read a bunch of posts about people whose family and friends committed suicide, and now it's even worse.  I won't bother detailing what's going on in my head, but it's causing me physical pain.

It's not even really about figuring out a reason to live anymore; it's become a struggle to not kill myself.  It's only a matter of time before I snap.  Not because I want to or that there's no hope left, but because the stress and pain and confusion and the situation itself is much too much and one day, something will happen or I'll lose control and I'll just kill myself.

I don't know how to cope anymore.  Simply clearing my head is getting harder and harder.  Even amidst a bunch of friends having a good time, on the inside I'll sometimes be imagining the ways things could be and then the ways I could die.

I've posted here before.  I've talked to people.  I've tried suggestions.  Things are not getting better, only worse, and same goes for my hopes.

I really wish something would just kill me so I didn't have to.  All of this is way too much.  Hell I hope I snap soon just to get it over with.  If I wasn't at a friends house, or if I had my car here, I honestly might crack right now.  I'd be going neurotic if nobody was here.
