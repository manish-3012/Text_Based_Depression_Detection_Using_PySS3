May 23 is my deadline. If nothing changes by then, then Iâ€™m ending it.Iâ€™m a hopeless anxious mess, and I have been for far too long. Iâ€™m tired of it. Iâ€™ve been considering ending my life for years but Iâ€™ve been putting it off, hoping things would change, that my anxiety would go away. But itâ€™s not and I donâ€™t want to be stuck like this forever. I want peace. Iâ€™m giving myself until the 23rd to try to find it and then Iâ€™m throwing in the towel.
