On behalfMy friend (11F) visited the Eiffel Tower and was about to jump off before I reassured her life would get better. I do not want to encourage her suicide and do not want her to go. I told her to visit a therapist or call Childline. She refused to. I would not like this to all be on me. She also cuts herself with a sharp knife often (daily). I would really like some help to reinsure she does not go.
