in addition to my roomate situation...Nobody is in clubs, everyone goes home whenever possible (so the dorms are usually empty), most people commute (this includes everyone in my major), and everyone is hostile. There's also no food available on the weekends. On a weekend day I'll search the entire campus but won't find a single person to hang out with. My dorm feels like a jail cell. I'm too depressed to get my grades high enough for a transfer and I'm already in my first sememster of my junior year.
