I'm not going through with it.I'm way too much of a pussy to ever actually do it. I'll just constantly think about it as my health, sanity, and any chance at a good life slowly slip away year after year. Maybe 10 or 20 years down the road, when I'm morbidly obese with no family or significant other and I've finally gone down one too many dead endsâ€¦ maybe then I just won't care anymore.
