Everything is too much and I been sleeping poorlyI live in a bad situation, and there is no easy way out. I'm hungry, I'm poor, I'm tired, and I'm constantly getting sick.  I'm mad at myself and too tired to move. I want to skip work but staying home is worse because everyone here treats me like I'm toxic just for existing, and tries to convince me I'm bad and awful for expecting them to meet me even just a third of the way. It's so hard to fight back without becoming a nasty person too, and I feel like I'd rather just hang than work hard to own myself again. 

I'm so mad at myself that I got myself into such an awful situation, and I'm broken hearted that no one else I the apt will even try to get his resolved, so I'm going to have to get my roommates evicted or something instead of kindly letting them or me leave.

My hand is infected from trying to protect cats, and the antibiotics aren't working, and I can't find my cream and that makes me paranoid about all of this. 

Every time  I try to sleep I say I want to die. I want to break myself to pieces and die. I haven't slept more than 4 hours in days, and work is in four hours again. I feel like vomiting. 

I can't go to work, and I can't be safe in my house, so the best  option is death.

I know it is not but it is the only other option that gives me rest. 
I just hate it and everything is my fault, and I'm probably being terrible and selfish for wanting my home to be better for me and my cat. I only am alive for him so he won't eat me by accident.  I don't know how to take care of me anymore, I'm so trapped and I'm so scared to push.  

I wanna just sleep forever
