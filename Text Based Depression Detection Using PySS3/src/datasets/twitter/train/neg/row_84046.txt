Physical pain in my chestMy Dad died almost 3 years ago on my 17th birthday. He was 39. My Mom killed herself when I was 3. He was all I had. I still have traumatic night terrors from when I scattered his ashes in the ocean. It feels like a part of me died with him that day. I have tried to honor him by fighting through this painful and lonely life without him, but I have not felt truly alive in years. Wouldnt he understand if i finally ended my suffering? Dignitas gave me the greenlight over a year ago. Lately it feels like that gaping open feeling in my chest is getting heavier and more painful. I swear there is something physically wrong. I lay in bed and weep loudly to try to relieve the pressure but I end up more down and depressed. Why did he leave me? Why dont I matter to anyone? I am so alone. I am drowning and i cant take it, he would have to understand he would have to
