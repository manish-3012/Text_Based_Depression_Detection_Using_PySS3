I'm doing it tonight6 years fighting with this and i'm losing. My family start broken apart when i was 13. Now i'm 19. I diagnosed with Major depressive disorder with anxiety last month. I'm dropping out of college and i can see my family dissapointment. 

I came out to them telling how i hate this family and history of my depression. At first i thought they were accepting but then suddenly feel like they're pushing me, still want to control my future who i live with and etc. I guess they told my aunt after saying my aunt is scared with me having depression. I'm so ashamed. 

i get into argument with them. I ran into my room, locked the door but they break in. I ended up shouting a lot and my father threaten to send me to mental assylum. Which i told him 'do it'. I guess i'm crazy after all. He told me the devil possesed me. 

I'm already tired. One day if you find someone with lot of scar on their hand, please hug them.

And i'm losing this war. 

Depression is like having mind that want to die and body that want to live.
