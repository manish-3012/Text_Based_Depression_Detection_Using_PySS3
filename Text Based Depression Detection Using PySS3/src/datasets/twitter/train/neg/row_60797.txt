Iâ€™m telling myself itâ€™ll get better but I donâ€™t know if it really willHey. Iâ€™m 13 years old and I really need advice or something to help me with my situation. Sorry if this is all over the place. 

My family has always been the only thing I truly cared about in life. My life is basically family-oriented. About 2 years ago, we moved. Thatâ€™s when I started realizing more about my parentâ€™s relationship. They seemed more distant, but at the time I didnâ€™t realize why. About 6 months ago they would start to fight constantly. I would always hear them yelling while I was in my room. Every time they got home from work. Nights always ended in tears, but in the morning I just pushed the thoughts down and went on with my day. 

I donâ€™t want this to get long, so Iâ€™ll just go into what happened tonight. My mom came home about 2 or 3 hours after my dad did. She was visibly upset. She started yelling at my dad in front of my brother and I. She kept saying how he didnâ€™t do anything to help. Later, (about 15 minutes ago) she came into my room and saw that I was upset with her. She asked why I thought my dad was so perfect. I said I didnâ€™t, and asked why they didnâ€™t just talk things out. She got mad and said sheâ€™d been trying for years, and  talked about how she wanted to be with someone who made her happy. A week or so ago they were fighting and she told me that if it wasnâ€™t for my brother and I, she wouldâ€™ve left my dad already. 

I want my parents to be happy, but Iâ€™m mad at them. Why canâ€™t they just have a conversation? Why do they have to yell and fight every time they talk? Iâ€™m going to be honest, I donâ€™t know what I live for. Iâ€™m trying to give myself until December for things to get better, but Iâ€™m deciding whether or not I should end it all now. Iâ€™m not happy. Iâ€™m so stressed out and I donâ€™t know what to do. The things I enjoy doing just donâ€™t seem to help. I feel like itâ€™s all a waste of time. It feels like no one really cares. I donâ€™t even think my friends do. I donâ€™t feel like I belong. 

Please help.
