I don't see my internal conflict ever getting resolved.I've been in therapy now for 19 years. I started back in 1994 and since then I've seen 20 maybe 25 doctors and different therapists. I've tried all kinds of medications, treatments, being locked up for years at a time. I still can't get over my hatred of people. It's not a fear, it's hate. I can't get along with others, I hate being around people, and I hate talking to people. It effects my life in a very negative way as you can imagine. I don't care that I don't have any friends and there aren't any family members left. I love being a lone. I'm only happy when I'm by myself. Problem is you can't function in this world without being about to interact with others. That brings me to my problem that I've had for the past 20 or so years. That's why I want to kill myself. I won't ever be able to do anything with my life because of how much I hate people. No professional has been able to help me. This is no life to live and no one seems to understand what the problem is. I'm going to end it just to not have to deal with the problems I've created for my future self and I really don't like being in this world around other human beings. I don't like anyone. I stay frustrated when I talk to people. I hate being interrupted from my thoughts inside my mind. The problem is so complicated that I can't explain it here. I'm unable to articulate it. I just want life to be over so that I can be left alone and won't have to worry about the future. The last 20 years have been horrible and the only thing worse than this is to live 20 years and 1 day.
