my english is badi have this feeling and it's killing me , i feel nothingness , besides the personal reasons that i want to take my own soul , i feel that there is no reasons to live just to suffer , you come out of your moms belly crying and you go out from this world making someone cry , this whole journey of life is just to full of negative feelings such as envy , hate , bad luck , boring , waiting , heartbreaking , sadness , deprresion , losing a loved one , illness , bills , fear , i can go on and f ucking on about the shit u go through in one day , you can't live a good life only if you had money , or you just don't think too much and that i consider is happniess , i envy people who don't think too much or dumb enough to care about small things , i wish i can just stop feeling anything for a day , i don't like to talk about suicide with people i know because they'll think i seek something else from this shit show they call life , even tho im getting out of this life , im still going to get a negative feeling and that is pain , negative feelings is felt more than postive ones as laughter or good news , i wanted to be a director one day so i can make films that maybe stop people from thinking too much , i beleive in god im muslim , suicide is one of the worst sins a human can do , still i hate the fact that i can't stop thinking about it ,

anyway , im pretty sure the way im going to die is going to be suicide but i don't know when cause if im dying it needs to fast cause i dont want to buy a gun or tie a rope or od , they all take time until i do it and i don't want to take time so i can think about what im doing , i dont want to remmeber my whole timeline i just want to leave fast , no thoughts , just one heartbeat and blank
