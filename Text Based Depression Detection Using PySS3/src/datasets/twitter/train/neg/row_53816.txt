Ultimately it is up to the individual to move past the grieving process. My choice should not hinge upon them being unbelievably sad.I keep mulling over it and I'm still not convinced my death would have any impact on the lives of others. This notion that my death would have lasting ripple effects...I mean, sure, in so much as those who can't move past the grieving process would be effected. 

For me, in my eyes, that's what it comes down to, and I don't understand. There is not much value I contribute to the lives of others. Sure, entertainment, companionship, humor, yet that's it. It isn't like this couldn't be found elsewhere. Also, people basically just tell you how sad they'd be if you were to die. 

Well, that's on them. They have to learn to properly grieve and move past that, which is weird because I'm sure most of us have experienced the death of family before. I'm no longer sad about the loss of other people. What the fuck can I do about it? They're gone. Every living being has to experience this at some point. We'll have to move past that at some point. 

And people can kick you out of their lives with a drop of a dime. Hell, mental illness is one of the reasons why they do this. These could be long-standing friends. How would *they* be effected? 

I know I'm rambling, but I just don't get it. Anyway, regardless of whether it's true or not, I don't think my choice should hinge on that. It's always about how someone else would feel and not how it feels to be in a place I never asked for to begin with, with a species I resent with every ounce of my body, something I make known and yet somehow still get compliments for being a great person. 

Despite this post, I feel happy for some reason. I don't know if poor sleep is making me perpetually slap happy, or if this is genuine happiness. Ah, on that note, if I keep getting poor sleep, that'll be enough to make me end it. 

May as well get myself before brain damage does.
