I'm so alone. I'm ready to go.I am so alone and scared. Two weeks ago, my girlfriend and I of two years split. She is the only friend I have ever had. My anxiety and depression are the reasons we couldn't work. Since then, I have plummeted into a bottomless pit of sorrow. Through my depression before, I could see a future. Now it is just pain. Now it is just constant pain. I am so afraid of what my anxiety and depression will cause in the future. I have ran out of room on my arm to slice open. The few minutes that I can focus on the knife cutting my skin are the few minutes I can escape. Last year I failed out of college, and currently attending a community college. I see no future. I see no hope. I see no way out. I don't want to feel this way anymore. I am so alone and scared.
