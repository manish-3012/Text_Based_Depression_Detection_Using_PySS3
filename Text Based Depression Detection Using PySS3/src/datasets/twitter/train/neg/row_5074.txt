Partial SuspensionHi, A while ago I tried out partial suspension hanging because I read that it was an easy and painless way to go, but when I tried it it didn't go so well, it hurt a lot and I felt like my face and head where going to explode, I really want to kill myself because my life sucks, at least I want death to be nice, like I'm going to sleep.

I used two cloth belts tied together and tied them in a way where my legs where on the floor and I was using the weight of my torso to tighten the belt on my neck, trying to resemble sleep as much as possible. 

Dunno how this works or even how reddit works, hoping to get some tips or whatever. Also, shooting myself is not an option, I'm a beaner so we don't have gun stores or anything like that and because I'm an antisocial piece of shit I don't know anyone that could sell me one, also I don't want to be the person that cleans up the puddle of blood I leave behind.

Thanks in advance.
