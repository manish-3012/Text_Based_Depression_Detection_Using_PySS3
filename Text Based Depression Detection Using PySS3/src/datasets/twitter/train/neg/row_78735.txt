Whatâ€™s the point in living if my life is affected by depression?Why bother living if I canâ€™t have the life neurotypical people have? They get enjoyment out of life whereas all I see is the negative. Iâ€™ve missed out on my high school and college experiences because of depression and my romantic life is nonexistant because no one wants to date a depressed person.

Plus thereâ€™s the law of attraction, which basically states that you attract what you think about. Because Iâ€™m prone to negative thoughts, I always attract the negative into my life which I canâ€™t help! It seems like the universe/God/ a higher power has it out for me, and Iâ€™m tired of it.
