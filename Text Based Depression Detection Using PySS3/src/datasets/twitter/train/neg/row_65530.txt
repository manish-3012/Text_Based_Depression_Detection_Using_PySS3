I need help.I feel like such a failure. Nobody wants me. Idk what I'm doing wrong but I can't handle anymore rejection. I just moved to s bigger city way far away from my friends and family. It was ok but I need to find a new place to live in the next 5 days. Nobody wants me. I'm not good enough for anyone, I even got denied by an air bnb. I can't go home so everyone will see how much of a failure I am. I don't know what do anymore. I want to die, I think about suicide almost everyday, but I simultaneously don't. I just want to fall asleep and never wake up. What is wrong with me that everyone hates me?
