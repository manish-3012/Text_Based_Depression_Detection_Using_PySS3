I live my life for the sake of othersIâ€™m so sad. I shouldnâ€™t be, I have a pretty easy life, but I am. 

The woman I thought loved me left when I needed her most, I canâ€™t keep up in class, it takes me hours to get out of bed, I just want to be fucking done with all of it. I feel like I canâ€™t kill myself because it would destroy my family. But I didnâ€™t ask to be born, but they love me so much, but I canâ€™t fucking take this life. Iâ€™m not strong enough.  

I feel so alone, and so fucking abandoned.  Sheâ€™s doing great and Iâ€™m left here, a crippled, crying mess. 

Thereâ€™s a Pearl Jam song that I think about all the time. Black. Thereâ€™s a line that says â€œI know some day youâ€™ll have a beautiful life I know youâ€™ll be a star. In somebody elseâ€™s sky, why, why, whyyy canâ€™t it be mine?â€ 

I just wish I would go to bed and not wake up
