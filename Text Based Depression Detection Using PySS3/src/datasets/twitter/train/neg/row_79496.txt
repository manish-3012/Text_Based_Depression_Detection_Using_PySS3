Little goodbye noteSome people say how dare you take your life when others get thereâ€™s taken without choosing to, i am 13 years old my birthday is in 12 days. I wonâ€™t make it that long and you shouldnâ€™t try to convince me otherwise but I know the world will continue to move and peoples lives will go on, I just have to get this out.
I used to want to make a mark on the world, I wanted to be the center of attention, to be this big star. I still do, but I know I sure as hell never will and that doesnâ€™t bother me so much anymore. Maybe in my next life things will turn out better, Iâ€™ll be happier hopefully, have a better family. I just hope next me wonâ€™t be so sad, thatâ€™s all. My names Sophia by the way, thanks for reading even though Iâ€™m some random stranger.
