please help me I need someoneI've always hid my feelings and never talked about my emotions to anyone. I've always been on bad terms with my mother. She always tells me stuff that get into my head ever since I was a child which caused me to have multiple mental health problems. I never had a normal childhood and was expected to be a perfectionist in every aspect which pressured me a lot. Ive been having suicidal thoughts. I thought it was gonna be okay and fade away. but today ''mom'' told me that I am a burden to everyone around me and  that everyone would be more comfortable and happy if I wasnt here. and that I am useless and a disappointment and what hurted more is that I know it is true. then she told me why don't I just kill myself and then started mocking me that I was a coward for not killing myself. I had a panic attack and had this  intent that I felt for the first time. I was ready to kill myself I was ready to go to the kitchen grad a knife and cut my vitals. then my little sister cut me out of it by hugging me and telling that she cares. well I know for  fact that 3 people would be really sad if I died but for how much? a couple weeks they will go back to normal.  a year they'll forget I ever existed. then mom kicked me out of the apartment. I didn't even have my phone with me. so I actually went to the roof and stood near the edge and heard a little voice in my head telling me to end it all. then I remembered that even if I am a burden I still have a future ahead of me. I will go to my father's country, leave everything behind me, go to college, build a nice life. so why should I always live in my moms shadow. 

ill have hope for now...
