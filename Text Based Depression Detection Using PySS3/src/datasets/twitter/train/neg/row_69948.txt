Just so tired.I often daydream about ways to kill myself. Some days are worse than others, and today is one of the worst. 

I am overwhelmingly sad today. I take antidepressants but I probably need to up my dose. Unfortunately I donâ€™t have health insurance and canâ€™t afford to see a Dr. to get my script changed. My husband and I are having huge financial problems, which is really why I feel so awful, so I canâ€™t justify wasting money going to the dr. 

The only reason I know I wonâ€™t kill myself is that I have 2 kids and I am their main provider. If I wasnâ€™t, Iâ€™d definitely kill myself today. 

I canâ€™t tell my husband or my friends how bad it is. I canâ€™t afford a therapist anymore. I work too much to go running (which used to help my depression a lot). Iâ€™m just tired of working my ass off and not getting anywhere. Iâ€™m tired. Iâ€™m done. 

Iâ€™m posting here because I need to get this out. I know I canâ€™t do anything or my kids wonâ€™t have food, but man, itâ€™s tempting.
