I Wish I Could Kill MyselfI have thought about this so much throughout my life. I tried to kill myself when I was in the 5th grade. I have hated who I am for as long as I can remember. My mom and I have a very complicated relationship that I think contributed. Thought about suicide daily all throughout middle and high school. Never did it because I am a chicken. Things got better for awhile. I got married at 20 and had 2 kids. I was much happier for a little bit. Now it is like I am right back in the hole. COVID has hit me hard and turned my world upside down. I feel like my life is going nowhere and my only purpose is to stay alive so I don't scar my children. I started making a plan the other day but then stopped when I thought about how sad my 4 year old would be. I think I should do it before my 1 year old is old enough to remember me. But my 4 year old would be devastated. I can't find the energy to do anything other than things for my kids. I went to the doctor and was put on Fluoxetine in April but even just going to pick up my medication every month is too much. I don't want to leave the house if I don't have to. This frustrates my husband a lot so I try for him. But if i had my way i would have no one look at me ever again. Husband is clearly frustrated with dealing with me and I dont blame him. I started crying randomly the other day and instead of being concerned he just looked at me and went "Really?" He says he understands and is trying to help me but I can tell he is over it. I feel like I'm fucking up my kids by having them seeing me cry all the time so I think I should just end it so I stop upsetting them. But then if I killed myself my 4 year old wouldnt understand and my husband would be left hanging dry with childcare. Basically I feel like I have to stay alive for everyone but myself. I love my children so much but I feel like a burden to them and like I am going to damage them.
