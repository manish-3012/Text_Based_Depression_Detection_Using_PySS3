tired of being the quiet, fat girl.I had a decent run in life. I have been the "fat girl" my whole life. I was sociable as a kid but as I got older I was made fun of for my appearance fairly regularly (I have been spit on, asked on a date by a guy "as a joke", a group of boys would hit me in middle school and mock me, etc.) and this made me stop talking and become very shy. Even though I'm in my 20's, I've never dated because I just assume most men want thin women (which there is nothing wrong with that, I understand). Finally, I got tired of this and started to eat more healthfully and exercise but since I cannot afford a gym I started couch to 5k and run in public. I was doing alright on this, lost 25 pounds, but still people have shouted at me calling me a fatass on my runs, and making noises from their cars. I cannot live anymore like this. I feel so alone and worthless, I have no one to talk to and have been so discouraged with working out because of the comments people have made. I ruined my own life, and have myself to blame. The least I can do is end the pain now.
