I really could someone to talk to right now... F/20Right now I'm struggling with desires of self injury, few days ago I had to get stitches on my thigh. Now I'm sedated with pain pills which are helping but underneath it all is a great gnawing to mutilate my body again, I don't want to but they keep demanding it, it never stops they're never satisfied. I don't wanna be like this anymore I wanna improve myself have a real life... But I feel like there's so much I must do, it feels impossible some days. if anyone can relate at all please pm me, I really need a friend rn I have so much anxiety...
