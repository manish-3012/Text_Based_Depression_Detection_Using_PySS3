Iâ€™m tired of this worldI find meaning then i lose it. I find something to enjoy then it goes away. I say ok now Iâ€™m comfortable with myself and find â€œMeâ€ then something destroys it. I try to communicate it then it gets muddy again. What is it with this world? Iâ€™ve been experiencing this since i was 18 now Iâ€™m 27 and still feel it. I find love after so fucking years and lose it in a heartbeat. Every since I understood that circle I decided Iâ€™m too tired to live like this but i was afraid to hurt my family and my mum. I donâ€™t anymore. Iâ€™m afraid. Not doing it and coming here and talking to strangers kinda helps. Does this circles break at some point or does it keep going? Iâ€™m really tired.
