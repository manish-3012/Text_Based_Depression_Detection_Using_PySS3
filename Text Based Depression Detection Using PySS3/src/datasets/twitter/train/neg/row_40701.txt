Math FailureI know I shouldnâ€™t get so defensive when people ask me about college, but I feel like such a failure. My best friend is an engineering major and everything comes so effortlessly to him. Compared to him I feel worthless. Iâ€™m great at English but I suck at math no matter how hard I try. My dad is threatening to take my GI Bill from me if I donâ€™t makes Aâ€™s and Bâ€™s. I donâ€™t go out and party, I donâ€™t drink or do drugs, and yet I canâ€™t even do math right. Iâ€™m a sorry excuse of a daughter and friend. My friend is going to be chasing her dream as an art history major, but if I even dreamt of telling my dad I wanted to do English or tell him I was uncertain about nutrition, itâ€™s all be over for me. My best friend would laugh at me, he already thinks Iâ€™m stupid and a crybaby and a spoiled brat and maybe heâ€™s right. I just wish I could trade my talent for writing in for something useful like excelling in math or something. 

I joke to my best  friend at least twice a day about killing myself but he doesnâ€™t realize how much I want to die. The only reason Iâ€™ve held on this long is to see my family members each one last time. To say goodbye and tell them I love them.

All my relationships have failed and Iâ€™m ready to go.
