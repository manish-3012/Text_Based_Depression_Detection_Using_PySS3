I've lost everything that ever matteredMy fiancÃ©e fell in love with someone else. It hurts so much just to write that but she did. I don't have any happiness anymore, I've been depressed for months since she told me. Everything had been going so well. I moved to her country to be with her, got into a masters program that I was struggling in but managing, I was starting to make friends. 

And now I can't get out of bed. I failed one of my classes this winter, I very nearly failed two more. I feel like a huge disappointment to my supervisor. I just dropped the class I was supposed to take this summer because I can't focus on anything.

She was my lifeline to the world and I know how pathetic that makes me. I was so dependent on her and I probably drove her away because of it but I don't know what else to do, I can't function without her. I'm such a worthless mess.

I just went out and got all the things that used to make me happy and I got home and all I wanted to do was crawl in bed and cry. I wrote her a note apologizing, I didn't know what else to do.

I don't have anything anymore, I was so stupid and let it all fall away while I was happy. I'm so alone.

It says not to be explicit about methods, but I know what I'm going to do.
