I think I had a psychic vision that I will kill myself in the near futureI just had a psychic vision that my boyfriend will, in the future, cheat on me, causing me to commit suicide via handgun in front of him. I am currently being medicated for bipolar disorder but the medication has been working for now. Is this a delusion? Is this real? This is probably my worst fear, realized. I love this man. He is the reason I try to be better. Without him, it would be easy to make the decision to end my life. I feel incredibly conflicted and have no one to talk to about this...whatever it was. Thank you.
