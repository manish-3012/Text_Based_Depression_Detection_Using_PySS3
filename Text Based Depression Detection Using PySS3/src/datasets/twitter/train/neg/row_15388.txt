im tiredthings have been okay, but. i dont want to deal with how lonely and miserable i feel anymore.

 do you ever feel like you just give up, youre done, maybe its me, maybe im exhausted of feeling nothing but one emotion all the time everyday, im convinced everyone i love hates me, and keeping in mind everyone i love rarely talks to me if at all, ever, and when they do i feel like theyre annoyed or bothered, included my gf, its not rly that far from reality it seems. 

im just lonely, and tired, sad, permanently, all the time, i keep crying myself to sleep everyday and im just not living, i do whatever everyone wants me to do or i think that they like bc i dont wanna be alone and my friends arent my therapists so close to no one knows i feel this way.

i tried to attempt twenty minutes ago by walking into traffic but the truck driver slowed down a lot, fucker 

im just tired im so tired and oportunidades wont roll me in bc my id is from another city and the lady denied it to me numerous times, so i cant even afford to see a therapist 

i jusy dont wanna do this anymore this loneliness is crushing its so much its too much i just ant it tp stop i give up i want to give up i give up
