Things have been getting worse since last posting..Kind of scared, starting to hear voices. They don't want me to hurt anybody except myself. They tell me how shit I am. I feel disconnected from the world and it was brought to my attention that I've been silent for several days. After my foot broke I just kind of shut down, too.

My childhood was taking inches from multiple family members every day, and this continued until about two months ago when I left. After finally seeing a doctor I found out my liver is failing and my heart is weak. I need crutches to walk, and I'm too weak to use them. Chipotle fired me the day before I was supposed to start because I'm injured and NYC is at-will employment. If I had broken it just one day later I'd have the job locked in and I'd be on disability, but nope.

Nothing brings me joy, I'm always hurting to the point of real physical pain in my chest. I haven't eaten in three days because there's no food here. Someone on Discord convinced me to make a GoFundMe, which I promptly deleted out of shame and embarrassment. Right now Discord is the only place I put this happy little persona on for.

How would you feel if a deli gave you a free sandwich out of sheer pity? If I could walk I'd jump off a high rise.
