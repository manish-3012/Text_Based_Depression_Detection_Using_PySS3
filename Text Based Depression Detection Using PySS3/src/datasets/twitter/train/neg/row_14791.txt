Iâ€™m losing itNot what I made this reddit for but while Iâ€™m here fuck it.

I am losing my mf mind, my PTSD is pushing me to my absolute limits and I canâ€™t seem to enjoy life anymore.  I wanna not exist and Iâ€™m angry af that Iâ€™m only here bc my mom and dad were horny on Valentineâ€™s Day as teenagers.  I love my dad but like wtf...  

Iâ€™m constantly being torn down everywhere I turn and nothing really seems to come to fruition for very long/ends up being worse than before.

I hate people in general and my PTSD has only multiplied that.  I donâ€™t wanna do this shit anymore.  Iâ€™m sick of people telling me itâ€™ll get better.  Stop lying.  I get it no one wants to say â€œyou know your right go kill yourselfâ€ but just stop.  

I only stay alive for a few amount of people that I donâ€™t want to upset and really depend on me.  

But again like all the shit Iâ€™ve had to deal with.  Itâ€™s a running joke between ANYONE who gets to know me that I just have shit luck.  If I had more time to type you would think I was making shit up.  Some of it is my fault for sure but Iâ€™m sick of being let down by people and by life.  

Iâ€™m tired, I donâ€™t really have any positive thoughts/insights anymore.  I do to reddit, but thatâ€™s bc I figure while Iâ€™m here why not make other peopleâ€™s life struggles/questions some solutions.  But I donâ€™t wanna be alive anymore.
