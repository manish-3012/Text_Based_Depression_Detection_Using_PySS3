Unending sadnessNo matter how old I get, how great my life becomes, opportunities arise, I have a sadness that creeps up and continues to nag at me. I started working out which was so good for me and helped managed my depression but I got hurt at the gym and donâ€™t know when I could go back. I am always crying, never content, and my job is so boring and negative that most of the daytime I am holding back tears. I just feel so empty. My boyfriend is very supportive but I can also feel that he is becoming impatient with my mood swings. I just wish I could burrow into the ground and stop having to be a person.
