Would somebody like to care for me?I mean Iâ€™m a nice guy, I donâ€™t hurt anybody, I donâ€™t screw anybody over, Iâ€™m not a nasty person. Life seems to take more than it should from me. I honestly just want somebody to care for me. Iâ€™m not a difficult person. I want to live but at this point I really want to end my life.
