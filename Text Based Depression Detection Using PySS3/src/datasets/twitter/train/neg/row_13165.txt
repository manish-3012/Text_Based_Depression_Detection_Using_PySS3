First world failureI have everything. I'm an intelligent teen in a middle class family. I'm not popular, but I have friends and things that I like to do. All in all, my life is pretty damn good.

I just don't want to live anymore. The vast majority of my life is going though the same mindless motions. I hate failing, but I can never get myself to try do that I won't fail. Any time something abnormally good happens to me, something bad cancels it out or ruins it. I don't want to spend the rest of my life like this. Is rather go into a dreamless sleep and never wake up
