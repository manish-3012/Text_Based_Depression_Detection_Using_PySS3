Just when I feel that my life can't get any worse, it does. I fear death, but living just feels miserable.Hi guys, sorry to disturb, I just need some advice if any of you have a small moment. I live in South Africa as a 17 y/o white male in High School. In 2018 my dad, the sole provider, got retrenched from his retail job. He has not been able to find a sufficient income since, and this has caused very sad problems in our house; mother has emotional breakdowns, (tried in one of these breakdowns to OD) and is also prone to physical outbursts against my sister (only 1st year high school) when she doesn't get answers right when tested for tests (which every single small spot test seems like a big deal). Dad tries to avoid confrontation. I also feel that I have disappointed him as a son. There is a division in the marriage to mostly finances. In addition our car was also stolen last week, my friend group is in the process of disintegrating, my ex (girl) who I still have slight feelings for is about to start going out with the only person I've ever truly loved (my male friend: it's a sad tale, but tldr he knows i like him though a letter), and I have Grade 11 exams in less than a week that here (in SA) are almost the sole entry into University (I wish to apply to Medicine, but varsity's require higher marks depending on skin colour). All of these mostly recent build ups have thus led me to consider ending myself, but I fear that that there is nothing for me when I die, and that there's a small chance I could make an impact somewhere. But I'd just like some advice on how to cope with dealing with the desire to stop existing/die and fantasising repeatedly my own death on a daily basis?
Apologies if poorly written, its 4am here, but I had to do this right now.
