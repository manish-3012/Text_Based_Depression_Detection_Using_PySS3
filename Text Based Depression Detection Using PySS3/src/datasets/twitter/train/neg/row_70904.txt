I'm at my wit's endI don't know what to do anymore.

For some background, I have PTSD and go through depressive episodes. Most of the time I manage pretty well but the most recent depressive episode has been significantly worse than previous ones. I feel like I'm drowning and there's no one to help me. I went a year and a half without self harming but have recently relapsed

I made an appt with my therapist to try to get help. I told my mother about a couple minutes ago and she just yelled at me because we don't have the money for copays. She said I should have just waited to make the appt until I start working (which has been difficult to find a job). So now I have to cancel the only glimmer of hope I had to beat this thing. I can't talk to my friends because they either a). Busy with their own lives and I don't want to burden them and b). They don't get it.

Currently the only thing keeping me going is that my cousin (whom I am very close to) is getting married Sept 7th. After that, I don't even know how I'm going to keep going. I can't do this anymore. I'm so tired of feeling like this. 

I don't even know know where I'm going with this. I'm just at a very very low low point and I'm scared.
