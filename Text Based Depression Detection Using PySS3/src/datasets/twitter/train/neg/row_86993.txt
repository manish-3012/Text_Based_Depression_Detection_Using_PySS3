I've lived a lonesome life. Now, I am going to die a lonesome death.UPDATE: Feeling a lot better now. Tuned into my favorite streamer, had a snack, and got support from some really awesome people, both on and off reddit. I simply can't thank you all enough for preventing me from putting a countdown on my own life.
