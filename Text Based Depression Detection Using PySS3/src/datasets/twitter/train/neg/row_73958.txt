Back again so soon....Coming back because I have no one else physically to help me. I was supposed to go to the doctors over 2 weeks ago with my mum because of my panic attacks and depression, but everytime I approach her she's too busy to go. I messaged one of my girly friends and she told me she's going to sleep when I said that no one ever listens, she said "that's people lol night". Talking to a guy friend now and he's directed me to a helpline and told me I'm only feeling this because of my age. Feeling this way isnt right, wanting to hurt myself isnt right. Neither is wanting to kill myself.Someone, for gods sake, give me hope.
