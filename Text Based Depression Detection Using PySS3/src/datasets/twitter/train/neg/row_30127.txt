I had erectile dysfunction with my first girlfriend and it played a huge part in the relationship failing, I want to put a bullet in my head.There's been far too many instances in my life where I suffer for things out of my control, it's so unfair I don't think it's worth living. Embarassing and ruined my relationship, I'm defective and hate myself so much. It mad her feel unattractive and worse about herself. I don't have money for a doctor either.  

I literally stood in a parking lot and screamed WHY?! at the clouds. Shit like this is proof there's no benevolent god or that they hate me.
