My main motivation for suicide is hurting people who donâ€™t care about me enough while iâ€™m alive.Maybe iâ€™m an egomaniac. Maybe iâ€™m selfish. i donâ€™t care.

Iâ€™m very obvious about my depression, iâ€™m even on medication thatâ€™s barely working. even so, i get abandoned by everyone i love and i donâ€™t even know why. What am i doing wrong?

I want them to regret it
