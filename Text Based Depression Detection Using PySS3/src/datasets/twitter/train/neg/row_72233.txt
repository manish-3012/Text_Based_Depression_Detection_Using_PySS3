Today's the daySucks ill never be able to transition to who I really am. Sucks ill never be a singer like ive wanted to be since I was young. not like the world would ever accept me as a trans singer anyway. to the world im a freak.

Im about to lose everything that means something to me anyway. when my mom comes home on Friday atleast I won't be here. No more comments about my body or groping me.

my dad is going to take all my technology away in 3 hours. Say in overreacting but I have nothing or no one else. all my support is on here, my phone. I can't do anything in school so i guess I fucking deserve it. how pathetic am I for having but nothing but internet friends anyway??

i can't fucking deal with my shitty cards i was dealt. aspergers, add, bipolar peronality disorder, anxiety, pstd, sounds like I'm pullinf shit out of a hat but I'm just fucked up. 

I'm out of cash for street xans. ive been sober for 4 days and I want to claw my eyes out. i started cutting again and i want everything to end.

guess my parents wont have to deal with their unplanned mistake anymore. 


thanks reddit for distracting me from my problems for a while but i can't do it anymore. Goodbye.
