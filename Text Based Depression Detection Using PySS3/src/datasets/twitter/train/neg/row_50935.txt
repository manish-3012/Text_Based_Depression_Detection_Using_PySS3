guys I've had enough I'm gonna do it tonight, goodbye worldI just can't do this anymore I lost everything within the span of only 2 days, how's that even possible? Why is this happening to me? what have I done to deserve this? my dog sparky sadly passed away two days ago he was my only friend, it all started two days ago when we were just going for a walk it was like any other day but then when we got back home I found my house covered in flames, that's right my house burned down to the ground while I was gone for only 25 mins, I couldn't believe what was happening I was speechless I tried to pinch myself to see if this was all just a horrible vivid nightmare but sadly it was not, I then heard my dog shrieking in pain he got caught on fire, he died shortly after, there was nothing I could do to save him, I couldn't save my best friend, the next day I decided to just go for a walk alone, I started sobbing as I was walking and got too distracted while I was wiping out my tears that I accidentally fell down a ravine filled with lava, I lost everything including an enchanted diamond armor

this is the last straw I'm done with this world, I will delete it and I will never play this game ever again, mark my fucking words
