"Well why don't you kill yourself?" or "Well you can go ahead and do it"As if we needed your permission to do so. Yes, thank you. 

These are usually the response you get, as I've seen here, when you not only disregard someone's platitudes, but explain that you no longer want to live. They aren't being agreed with so it's time to get mad. They want to poke holes in your logic, with their own perspective, as if that perspective is true and you can do nothing to defend yourself. 

"You haven't committed suicide yet because yadda yadda yadda, so this means you want to live and yadda yadda," As if this thing should turn out exactly how they expect it to, and if it doesn't it must mean whatever it is they think it means. 

This mindset infuriates me to the point of wishing I could choke them until their face turned black and the blood vessels in their eyes exploded. 

And then when you dare tell them your body belongs to you and you'll do with it as you please, they get upset. "Go ahead and do it." 

Thanks,  I truly needed your permission, all compassionate one.
