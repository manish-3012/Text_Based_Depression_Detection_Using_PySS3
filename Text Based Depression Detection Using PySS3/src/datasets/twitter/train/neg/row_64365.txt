The only reason I don't kill myself is because I don't know what would happen to my dog.I think about throwing myself off a bridge every day. I know which bridge I'd go to, I know at what time, I know how I'd do it, fuck I even know what I'd wear and that I'd be eating chocolate all the way down; but the only reason I don't is because of my dog. Damn this fucking dog for making me love her so much. I want nothing more than to die and get this shit over with but I can't stand the thought of her at the pound and/or abused by some jackass who doesn't deserve her. Even now as I'm bawling my eyes out writing this, she came to me and hopped on my lap. I can't do this to her but god I wish I didn't care as much. 

I don't feel like a person anymore. I feel like an object. A thing. I don't live, I exist. I'm 23 and I feel 100. I'm so sick of living. I'm so tired of being lonely. People are always repelled from me. Sure, they're friendly enough, nice enough, but never show any interest in any way. Every time I try to reach out to people, I'm met with rejection. I'm so tired of being alone. I'm so tired of struggling to make friends. I'm so tired of analyzing what's wrong with me, what I did wrong, what I said wrong, how I could have said things better so people would be encouraged to reach out to me, how to improve myself and make myself more likeable and I never get to anything. 

All I want is to be in a place where I fit in and I'm wanted and loved and cherished for who and what I am. 

All I want is to not be alone. All I want is friends.
