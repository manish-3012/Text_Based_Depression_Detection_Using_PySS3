How to get out of panophobia or pantophobia or GAD disorder becoz of this i cant live life like normal people and suicide the last option left for meSorry for bad English
Since childhood i am suffering from this disorder i think but it got so strong as i started to do job
Even to get the small things done i need lot of guts
I always afraid of small small things
I am very straight forward guy, introvert, shy with zero skills.
I really hate corporate world as i am not fit into this but i dont have any other way or skill to earn money
My looks personality really sucks i am short height guy
So while walk in public looks like child. 
Dont have leadership quality, low grasping power
But as a software developer tomorrow i may need to lead group of people. Need to take important decision need to go for work to new locations or abroad and so may things which corporate world needs
But i easily give up, negative thinker dont have my own opinion or stand always confused
Now friends tell how can i go ahead in life with such characteristics and nature and skill
My whole family is dependent on me and dont have any bank balance or inherited wealth from parents
Only salary is the source of income
I know suicide is the solution but is the only way to escape from emotional pain
I love cars but dont have parking place and money to buy and becoz of this phobia wont able to ever drive car
I tried to learn riding bike but totally failed here also same condition no money to buy no parking place
Things which are normal to other world are difficult to do or achieve for me
In short looks like i am not born to survive in this world
If i wont be able to achieve anything in life or wont be able to live normal life then i dont have any right to live this life
I cant explain each and everything here but i hope whoever reads this will get what i want to say 
In the end i would say only that one thing i got clear is that mentally ill people hardly able to live normal life
Thus is the world's biggest and incurable disease
