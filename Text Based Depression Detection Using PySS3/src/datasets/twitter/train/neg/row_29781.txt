Sick of looking at screens.I spend 99% of the day looking at screens. Using the Internet on a screen, going to work and looking at a screen (stopped showing up but that's okay, now I stay home and play games on a screen). I have been unable to sleep all week so from 11 pm to 8 am I lay in bed and look at a smaller portable screen that ruins my eyes. This is bad because later when im looking at a bigger screen I'll find that the bigger screen has become harder to see. Sometimes I will hang out with friends. We usually end up looking at a screen together, only now I don't even like what I'm seeing on the screen. Occasionally we will switch it up by looking at a gigantic screen in a big dark room with a bunch of strangers. I like to skateboard when I'm not being a sniveling vagina. Feels real nice when I land a trick and then get to see how it looks on a screen. I'm afraid of girls, so instead of trying to talk to them I watch them on screens. With no pants on. At least I'm only 21, so even though I've dropped out of college twice there is still hope that one day I'll be able to direct all this time I have spent looking at screens towards doing or creating something positive that people will then see on a screen.
