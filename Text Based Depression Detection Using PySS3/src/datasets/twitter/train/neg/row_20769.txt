I feel like Iâ€™m going insane. I really wanna do itI just got home and on my walk here I was overcome by tremendous anxiety. I very vividly imagined my self jumping off the tall buildings and cutting my arms, and taking pills. They were so vivid I wanted to sprint away but my roommate was with me and I couldnâ€™t. I feel pressure on my chest and Iâ€™m scared of myself. It seems like such a viable option to just let myself go. I wouldnâ€™t be stressed i wouldnâ€™t wake up or sleep like this, I could stop. If I could stop and be a normal college kid if I could stop and just be normal I wouldnâ€™t want to kill myself but everything I do just seems too hard.
