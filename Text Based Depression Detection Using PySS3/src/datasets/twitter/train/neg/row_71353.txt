Too weak to live, too weak to dieI really canâ€™t take much more of this. I just fucking canâ€™t. Iâ€™m spiraling hard. I stare in the mirror and watch my face change until I canâ€™t even recognize myself. I donâ€™t even know who I am anymore. Iâ€™m a conglomeration of anxiety and suicidal ideation that has a legal name. 

I canâ€™t get the courage to kill myself. Iâ€™ve written so many suicide notes and I can never go through with it. Itâ€™s not because Iâ€™m strong and suddenly rediscover my will to live. Itâ€™s because Iâ€™m a pussy. Iâ€™m not scared of dying. Iâ€™m scared I wonâ€™t even kill myself good enough and survive with horrible health issues. Iâ€™m scared of having to face the few people who care about me in the hospital room. I want to fucking die so bad but Iâ€™m too weak. 

Iâ€™m too much of a pussy to have a normal life too. This world is so harsh and cruel. Only the strong survive. Iâ€™m tired. Iâ€™m weak. I hate it here. I say I want to die and people either say, â€œwell it gets harder so stop being a pussy and buck upâ€ or â€œbut life is beautiful and it gets betterâ€. Life will never be â€œbetterâ€ for me. And if it does just get harder, Iâ€™d like to make my exit now. Itâ€™s obvious I canâ€™t survive in this godless plane of existence. Or maybe there is a god and he fucking hates me. If he hates me he should just seal the deal and have a satellite fall out of the sky and obliterate me. 

Iâ€™m pretty sure Iâ€™m already in hell, or at least purgatory. This canâ€™t be real. It all feels so fake and superficial. I hate this life. I never asked to be born.
