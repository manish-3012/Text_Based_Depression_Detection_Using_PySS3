A complex problem with no optimal solutionMy life is a confusing mess and I cannot solve this problem.  I feel overwhelmed, confused, old and hopeless.  In a nutshell here are my problems but they are all interconnected

**Titties**: I have a deformed chest and a lifetime of being overweight.  It brings a lot of insecurity.  I have tried to solve the weight recently by getting very serious about health and fitness.  A year in and I'm actually doing well.  Best shape of my life.  6 more months I might even have a six pack and a respectable bench press.  Now my age (33) is getting tossed in the mix and adding to my insecurity.  Chest still looks like I fell tits first into a meat grinder, and had passable reconstructive surgery afterwards.  I should mention that besides the chest I am a pretty attractive guy.  Not like brad pitt here, but I can hold my own.

**Women**: I have lots of issues with women and regret.  Closely related to my deformed chest, I was afraid to take my shirt off.  I missed some truly wonderful opportunities with beautiful women I cared deeply for.  It would get to the physical, and I would shy away.  Coming to terms with my cowardice and regret is incredibly hard.  This more than anything else makes me hopeless.  I did eventually somewhat get over the chest and slept with a few women who I didn't find very attractive.  I then dated a girl who I eventually married.  She is pretty and sweet and just a wonderful woman, but I feel that I didn't really get over my wild oats phase.  I need to put my insecurity to bed.  On top of this I'm not so sure we are all that compatible.  I think I had low standards because of my self esteem and just tried to make a round peg fit in a square hole.  Its not that she is a low standards kind of girl, just possibly not a very good fit for me.  There is this bottomless well of anger in me and I feel the only way to get over it is to date around and sleep with a bunch of women, yet then I lose my wife who I love.  The clock is ticking on this one as she wants children and is getting to the age where that needs to happen.  I am not ready.  

**Career**: I am unemployed, but have no doubt I could find a job.  I have a good resume and two STEM degrees; mechanical engineering and math.  I also have a reasonable programmer resume.  I am personable and interview very well.  The problem is all 4 engineering jobs I have had have been AWFUL.  I expected creative design problems and I get real life dilbert.  I cannot believe that comic isn't an exaggeration.  It's really like that.  So now I am adrift at sea, wondering what the everfuck I'm supposed to do now.  The last job almost killed me.  My blood pressure was through the roof, I was flying off the handle at any little thing, almost wrecked my car.  I'm kind of getting stressed just thinking about it.  I am also really angry at what I feel is college lying to students about what to expect in engineering.  

**House**: At some point on the journey I took a risk and bought a short sale farm house.  I paid very little for it and it's a really neat place.  I love it.  But it's far from friends and really limiting career choices.  When I quit my job my plan was to fix the house up the rest of the way (I had to do a lot of work in the beginning), and put it on the market.  Where will I go, what will I do?  This feels like home and its making my wife and I both really sad.  

**Baggage** I had a troubled home life with an alcoholic father and a mildly autistic sister.  I think this laid the groundwork for me being a little passive bitch.  I am always very concerned with how others see me, how they are feeling, how to solve their problems.  I make friends easily but I am disconnected from myself in a lot of ways.  I often don't know how I feel about something and have no idea where my passions are.  At times in my life it took me a very long time to realize that I hated something I was doing, that would have been easily avoided had I known.  I feel very broken when I consider this part of my personality and it makes me really hate who I am.

-----------------------------
The way I see it I have three options:  
**1)** Start down the road to separation with my wife.  Sell the farm.  Focus on your career with a side eye on living up the single life.  This will be a turbulent road but a road of self improvement and self discovery.  Self discovery is something that has been lacking in my life as I have been far too concerned with how others feel and not how I feel.  I will probably regret leaving your wife as you watch her raise kids with another man, but do not want to deny her the experience of motherhood either.   
**2)** Don't sell the farm, try very hard to get your foot in the door with this one local business that has engineering jobs.  It may not be great work, but the pay is good and you can start a family.  You will have to live with your regret and the knowledge that you missed the boat on your sexuality.  Your wife will be ecstatic. This choice feels like more living for her and not living for you, but is probably the smart thing to do.  It also feels easier.  
**3)** Well, it's /r/suicidewatch right?  I'm so tired.
		

Two roads that both lead to a lifetime of regret and I've already got enough of that.  Third I would like to avoid if there is hope.  What would you do?
