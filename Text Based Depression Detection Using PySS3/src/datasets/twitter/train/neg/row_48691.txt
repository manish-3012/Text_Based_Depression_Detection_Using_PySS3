09/12/2028Ive picked a date. A final deadline. I won't turn forty feeling and living like this. I truly hope something else kills me first or something dramatic in my life changes.

But seeing as there's less time left than has already passed, it's looking pretty likely that if the world is still here 8 years four months and a handful of days from now, I won't be here with it. I think I've soldiered on long enough already, but I refuse to take a single step past that date if this really is the rest of my life.
