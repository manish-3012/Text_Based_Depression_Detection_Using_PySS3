Why do I even bother?I'm clearly just a waste of space at this point. All I do is bitch and moan at my loving husband just because I'm a hateful person. I really don't understand why he's still with my pathetic ass. I'm a college drop out and even though they dont express it, I can tell I'm my parents disappointment while my 16 year old sister is a straight A honors student and athletic star my dad wanted. I just don't see the point anymore. I give up on everything in my life my husband has even said he's surprised I haven't just dropped him yet because of the way I act and how hateful and closed off I get. I just cant do this shit anymore. I don't make any effort to better myself and maybe that's because ive given up hope on my pathetic existence. Just Fuck it all right? I'm done with this shit.
