half suicidalI donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m suicidal I have good days and I genuinely enjoy life sometimes but everyday I just want to kill myself I think about it so many times itâ€™s been going on for two years now. It used to be worse I used to hurt myself but nowadays I just get very depressed and self loathe most of the time or I drink alcohol to forget. I grew up in a toxic household they both became better parents but the damage already had set in as they didnâ€™t really improve until my senior year of highschool when they went to marriage therapy and counseling. Iâ€™m honestly afraid to tell anyone I know Iâ€™m depressed and suicidal I donâ€™t want to be sent to a psych ward I just want to feel something. I canâ€™t even remember the last time I was really happy with my life. Iâ€™m just worried that one day Iâ€™m going to lose and just kill my self impulsively. I donâ€™t want to die I just donâ€™t want to feel all of this that Iâ€™m feeling the guilt, regret and sadness of everything. How do I really become happier and stop feeling this way I honestly want to know because I canâ€™t just keep ignoring it and keep telling myself itâ€™ll go away because it hasnâ€™t and I think I need to change something in my life to do something about it.
