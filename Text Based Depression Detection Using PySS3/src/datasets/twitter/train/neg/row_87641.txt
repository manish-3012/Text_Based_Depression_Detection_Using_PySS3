I miss her... Almost to death.I miss her so much.

Especially at nights like this. When I've been out with friends, had a blast gotten drunk. Played some pool and talked some shit. At times like this when I'm back home in front of the computer listening to music all by myself. All alone I can feel her. I can feel er lonelyness burn in me. I can feel her soul weigh down on my shoulders.

If only I had understood, if only I had been older. If only I had...

And It's not that I don't understand. How good wouldn't that flight feel. When you know there is no turning back. The fear building up, but subsituted by the realisation that there is no turning back and that the decision has finally been made. The concrete is the next step, and after that nothing...

I miss her to death, and all I could wish for is that she gives me the streangth to keep fighting. And not go the same way. Couldn't count the number of times I've walked across the same bridge and looked down at the exact point where she jumped, and wondered whether I should follow.

But I'm still here and I just fucking wish she would have given me some fucking advice on how to cope with this shit!

Peace out guys, I'm gonna get that knife that's been waiting...
