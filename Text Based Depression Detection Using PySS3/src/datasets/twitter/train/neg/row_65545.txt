EI don't want to kill myself I just want to stop feelingBPD is a damn joke, and I'm starting to believe what everyone in r/bpdlovedones says is true about us. 

I can't find a place to live after I move out of where I am right now. The stress I'm under because of it is absurd. I want to slice my thighs open and I can't pinpoint why other than I just don't feel good, I *guess*. My incredible (LDR) boyfriend sent me some of his shirts that smell like him, as well as some cards telling me how much I mean to him and how much hhhlwqssa me. Today he keeps trying to reach out and support me but I'm pushing him away so hard. He  lmaoooooooooookkkk  and is leaving me lone right now. Seeing him give up completely validated all the fucking ridiculous thoughts in my head. I feel self hatred, sadness, and above everything else, guilt. Maybe I should break up with him just to save him from me. We are planning to move in together and I'm literally so dysfunctional I'm doing this to him? What the fuck is wrong with me? I've already binged today, I'm considering getting into the habit of purging when I do that because there's nothing quite like self sabotage, is there! Whatever. My razors are waiting for me. After I punish myself I'll come crying to him and everything will be fine until it isn't. ðŸ™„âœŒï¸
