Staying alive for othersI donâ€™t know who needs to read this, but I just wanted to say that anyone of us that is suicidal and who strictly stays alive for the sake of others deserves credit and love. We are completely acting unselfish so we donâ€™t hurt others. In my opinion having this trait is one of the best traits any human can have. We deserve credit, I just wish sometimes that our friends and family would understand that and show more appreciation.
