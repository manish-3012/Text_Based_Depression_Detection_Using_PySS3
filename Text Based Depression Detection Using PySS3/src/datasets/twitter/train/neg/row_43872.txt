Anxiety While I'm Trying to SleepI can't sleep because I don't want tomorrow to come. I'm tired of waking up in the morning. I don't want to go to work. I don't want to stay at home. I just don't want to exist anymore. Please just let me disappear. Why did I have to exist in the first place? My parents never wanted me. Why couldn't they have just aborted me and saved me from living such a terrible existence? Who would choose to bring more life into this awful world? I just want a painless and guaranteed way out. I just want to die in my sleep.
