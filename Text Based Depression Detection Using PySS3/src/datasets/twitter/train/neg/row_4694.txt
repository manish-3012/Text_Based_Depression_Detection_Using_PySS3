After 6 months of daily chronic pain I want to give up.No one believes me. "It's all in your head" ""You're drug seeking" no I just want this pain to stop. It is constant and I can't sleep at all because of it. I can't go to school because it is so debilitating. I'm so just done I don't want to continue to live in pain. I just want answers to make it stop. I'm so miserable
