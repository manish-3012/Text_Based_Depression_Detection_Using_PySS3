All i can think about is jumping from a tall building downtownThats all i can think about. I was down there today. I kept staring at 3 buildings. Asking myself which was taller. I cant get that out of my head. It is all i can think about. These thoughts keep coming and getting worse and more persistent. They wont stop. They are all consuming. I just want to do this.
