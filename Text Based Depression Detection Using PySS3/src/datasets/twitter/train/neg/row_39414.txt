First post and probably one of the lastFirst of all I would like to thank all of the redditors who posted here and those who helped others
It feels good to atleast know that I'm not alone

I say it's one of the last because I have decided to go through with my plan
Now I'm going home for the last time to say goodbye to my family and dog
After that, I'm going to jump off a very high bridge

The last post would be when I'm at the location

I just hope I can just jump without my survival istinct to kick in
