I've tried, but keep failingI should be somewhere with my life. Instead I am 20 something, living at home, unemployed, single with BPD.


I have pushed away nearly everyone in my life with about 3 close friends remaining who are all getting tired of my shit. I have broken so many hearts because I need affection but cannot commit so I run away. I am smart but useless. I have no talents needed for this world. I have tried medicine and psychologists but nothing changes.


Maybe I am just not meant for this world.

I have hurt enough people.
