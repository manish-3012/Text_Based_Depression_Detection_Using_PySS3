Can I go now?Therapy never went over well. Iâ€™m a little pissed at how much time and money was wasted, but hey, at least it didnâ€™t hurt much. Psychiatric drugs, on the other hand, were one of the more horrible things to happen to me. 

There will always be a new therapist or new drug to try, but I donâ€™t want to live like that. I gave this stuff well over a decade to work its magic. I really believed in it.

I donâ€™t know the future holds, but I donâ€™t really want to wait to find out. Iâ€™m sick and tired. Why is everyone OK with that?
