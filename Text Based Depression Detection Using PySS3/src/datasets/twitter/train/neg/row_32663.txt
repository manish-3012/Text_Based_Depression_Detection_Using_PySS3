I want to die.I'm a disease so it's irresponsible to keep myself alive, my personality is a a diagnosed sickness so it's unfair of me to keep pretending to be a person and force others to interact with me. I waste so many resources by living and providing nothing. I am out of hope of being a person one day. I'm going to cut my throat to die so it looks visually striking at least.
