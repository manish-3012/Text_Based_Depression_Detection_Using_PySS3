Suicidal- DV victim/survivorI had my purse stolen out of work the other night. Been out of a domestic violencence for 2 or 3 months. Feel somehow its my fault still. Pretty sure he was seeing other people and may have been sleeping with prostitutes because things don't add up. Haven't had my medication in a long time because I haven't been able to see my Dr working nights. Car repossesed as soon as I started working again.

My abusive ex had a lot of attractive physical qualities and its making things really confusing. I can't help but blame myself some for being so depressed when we were together it started a downward spiral he felt nothing he did was good enough and became very angry towards me.

Now I spend my days wishing he killed me and wanting to blow my brains out at times, especially at work. Really lost and confused. I'm in so much pain no one can see and I just feel like if I had better control over my depression he wouldn't have felt some type of way. I know he thought I'd never leave him because he is very attractive and I did kick him out...

Panic attacks and anxiety all day its no way to live. I'm 29 I feel like this will be my entire life I will never know a good life. My whole life has been plagued by abuse and mental illness. Nothing jas ever really gotten better. I left him and lost the little independence I had with my car and I was just starting to feel better about myself.

Haven't cleaned the house in weeks. Trash and flys out. I do take care of my dog. I've been really depressed. I tried making a post the other week but mods said to post here intead because I'm suicidal.
