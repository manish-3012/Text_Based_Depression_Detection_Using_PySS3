21 never kissed a girl and can't get a job.What is the point of living? I am tall and average looking, but I don't know how to talk to girls and I don't have any friends. I can't get a job for some reason. I attempted suicide a couple months ago and have decided to try to kill myself again. 

Is there any hope for me? How can I change my life for the better?
