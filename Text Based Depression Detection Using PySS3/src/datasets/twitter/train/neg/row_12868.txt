I Don't Know What To Do AnymoreHonestly I don't really know how to write this. I've never spoken out about my emotions and I guess I just wanted to tell someone how I feel. I'm a 16M and I've felt like killing myself for a while now. I feel like I'm just letting down everyone I meet. My family all accomplished things. My mom and dad were high ranking in the military and my brother just got a prestigious NASA scholarship while I'm doing shit in school and fail half the classes I take. The thing is I don't feel like I deserve to feel how I do. I was born into a good family an have a lot of friends. The only reason I don't kill myself is because of the people around me. I feel like if I killed myself my family and friends would be disappointed in me and I don't want people to remember me like that. I wish I could sacrifice myself to save someone or give my life to someone who needs it. I've looked into organ donation but you have to be 18 and I don't know if I'll last that long. I don't know what I'll do at this point. Sorry if this is long or confusing I was just writing what was on my mind. Thanks.
