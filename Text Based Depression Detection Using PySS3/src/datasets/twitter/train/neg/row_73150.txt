A visit to an ER.So, I was thinking about killing myself, I'd rather not rehash all the details right now. I called a hotline thinking that maybe taking would help. The guy I talked to was great but apparently very worried about what I would do and called the cops, who had to then take me to the ER in an ambiance. I had not attempted suicide so I had no injuries but I had to say in the hospital for a few hours. I'm an adult but I'm currently living with my parents. I'm concerned about the bills now, I'm concerned about my parents seeing them, and of course, the cost to me. I was given a number to call about the billing, but I'm just wondering if anyone has any experience with this kind of situation and what I'm to expect. I was thinking I could call the number and if they want to mail me anything I might give them a friends address to mail it to. So yeah, please help.
