As a fellow suicidal person I should be able to empathize with others here... but I can't. I'm a fucking monsterIt's hard to explain. When I start reading posts here I can sort of begin sympathizing... but **anytime** they mention a love life or SO, my brain just shuts down. My reservoirs of empathy run empty.

It's a reflex. I've tried to stop this kind of reaction but I can't. I think it happens because I've never had a love life. The world doesn't give a shit about me, not really. Not like you all care deeply for your girlfriends and wives. At the end of the day I will be nothing more than a drinking buddy, someone to entertain yourself with for a few hours and joke around with until you go home to the person you actually love and care about.

And that fucking hurts. Every time I read about an engagement on facebook it makes me want to kill my self.

Evolution sure is a bitch huh? I get it, I have unattractive and repulse natural qualities (short, for starters) and natural selection wants me to GTFO. I just wish it was a less painless process. I wish I didn't have to watch everyone else find the light of love while I sit quietly in the darkness.

At the very least, I wish I could empathize with SWers who are in relationships instead of just being envious of them.
