Been there and came back strongIt was fall 2016, I was stuck with severe anxiety when I realized the mistakes I have made. My confidence was shattered and I wanted to hide myself in a bubble and end this beautiful life. Long story short, what helped me was the sheer determination to give myself one more chance and not keep punishing the inner child inside of me. I tell ya, this is very hard but you can fight and win. Think of science, think of the sky, look around you, all these beautiful things are made for us. DO NOT THINK OF ENDING THIS BEAUTIFUL LIFE. Be proud to be born in this era where we have access to the medicines and all the facilities. Be proud that you are breathing. We are humans; anxiety and depression are part of life. Know that a human being is the strongest of all creatures. They can fight anything. You can fight anything.
