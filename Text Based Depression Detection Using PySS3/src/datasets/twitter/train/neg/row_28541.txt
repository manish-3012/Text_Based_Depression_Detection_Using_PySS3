Today I saw a girl on a bridgeI was taking the bus to the city centre as always. When it was driving over the bridge I saw a girl who had stopped walking on the sidewalk. Facing the railing and the sea she looked both ways of the path - almost as if to see if any other people walking across were nearby her or not.
I entered this daze of disbelief at what I saw. A certain numbness was still within me at this time, but I got off one stop early right by the bridge. I felt like I had to. I walked a bit to the other side, but couldn't seem to see her on the railing. After a few minutes I realized there was probably no emergency and even if there was; what could I do? Maybe she just considered it for a moment like I did late on a November night last year, but decided not to. 
When I got into town I tried to run my errands as usual, but I was growing evermore anxious from what I'd seen. After all, this is the bridge that whispers to me more or less almost every time I cross it. The method that seems most probable in my situation. Small annoyances of bustling crowds and other stressors of city centres coupled with this incident today near gave me a panic attack or public outburst at one point. I have struggled with these thoughts in the past, but nothing as serious or probable as I have within the last 12 months. I felt the need to vent about this somewhere as noone in my life really knows about these thoughts. I have plenty of people I could vent to, but something always blocks me from venting or opening up.
