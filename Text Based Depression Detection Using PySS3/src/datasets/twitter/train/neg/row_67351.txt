what is the best way to commit suicide?i am looking for the best way to commit suicide. i know what i am doing and have my reasons for doing it so please do not try to talk me out of it. i need to commit suicide but am not sure how. overdosing seems unlikely to work and i only have access to drugstore medicine, cutting wrists seems difficult (iâ€™ve read itâ€™s hard to actually cut deep enough and once you hit the vein you are likely to start freaking out), i donâ€™t want to jump from a height because i donâ€™t want my body to turn disgusting, i have no access to a gun, i really wanted to try carbon monoxide poisoning/ plastic bag over head, but i am barely allowed to leave my house so there is no way for me to go out and get any materials. what is the best way for me to commit suicide given that i do not have access to any materials other than what can be purchased at a gas station/ grocery store?
