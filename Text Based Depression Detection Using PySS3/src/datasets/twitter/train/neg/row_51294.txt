NitrogenHi,

I'm sad and am trouble having coping. We will all return to the source (no I'm not thinking of violence) soon.

Ive bought a 40L nitrogen tank and the shop owner let me borrow a pipe and regulator (lol). There's manuals out there but i was wondering if someone could help me set this up, or even just give me any advice regarding it.

PS: If you are expecting a child, or have one under the age of 7. Please stay strong for that short period of time. Thanks.
