i think i broke my handim in a terrible space. Im short of rent because i spent it all on shooting cocaine into my veins, but that doesny matter,  ill get floated a week of work from my boss. I got a boyyle of whiskey, I went downtown,  hit a used book store and finally found a collection of ETA Hoffman's storiez that aren't the fucking nutcracker, as well as a vintage 1945. paperbavk of Henry Millers 'the air conditioned nightmare"  All great? So I go down the street and notice another bookstore. Have an amazing convo with the girl there, its so nice and wholesome to relate to people you feel like yourself ; she's going to GIVe me a book once she's done with it..

all fine. and good. until I get home here. my life is a tight rope. will i beable.to float rent or not! what do i say? im twenty fucking aeven. not a dime to my name, a veritable man child. in honour of.my ancestors i should take my life .im. pathetic. what am I? nothing. noting at all,entirely insignificant. tears stream down my cheeks as i write this. this. very fact i'm writing this here only serves to enforce my notions that i trulu am wholly alone. there is no one at a moments nnotice. 

and, in truth is iy not becoming of me? am i so ararrogant tp assume i deserve of tgis service when ive noy been there for another? 


i smashed some things, I triwd punching holes in these old late 19th century wood ans plaster walls which only served to turn my hand into a grape fruit. i dont know whAt to do. i could die in my room rifht now and no one would know until the stench became so noxious my timid roonmates ventured to open the door to my maimed carcass strewn upon the floor of my tidly kept room.
