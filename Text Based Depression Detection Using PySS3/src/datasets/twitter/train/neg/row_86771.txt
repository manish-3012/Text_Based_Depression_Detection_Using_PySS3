How can I leave my family without hurting them or getting them in trouble?Over the 16 years of my life, I have caused tremendous pain and suffering upon my family. At the tender age of 5 I was molested by a relative and again at the age of 7, the first one was caught but the second is still breathing. This has caused me to go through a lot of shit, and inflict harm on the people around me. Believe me when I tell you that I am a horrible human being, I have done unspeakable things. And it is the main reason that I want to end it. I have harmed both children, adults, and animals. I shouldn't be alive. 

I remember, after my millionth suicide attempt, my mom looked at me with tired eyes and told me that if I wanted to die, that I should do it outside. "If you want to leave, just leave. No ones holding you back" It was meant for a different context but I have taken this as a support, that it's okay to leave. But believe me, my family is amazing. They have gave me everything in life that I could ever have. And I will pay them back as I have a check waiting for me once I reach the age of 18, 8 thousand dollars sits. I turn 18 in 486 days. I hope that they can still access it when I'm gone. 

Ways that I have planned: 

I have a rope ready and prepared. I have a tree a couple kilometers waiting for me. 

I have the blade inside my pencil sharpener. 

I have the knife in the kitchen.

I have the bleach under the sink.

I have the pills in the cabinet. 

I have gotten them to slowly hate me, despise me so that hopefully it can be easier. They are scared of me, I can see it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am serious. I am not crying. I am not a mess. I am calm. 

&amp;#x200B;

I need to leave. For them. For me. For the people that I've hurt. I need to take responsibility for my actions. 

&amp;#x200B;

Please tell me, out of all the options, 

&amp;#x200B;

which is the best way to go that will not get them in trouble?
