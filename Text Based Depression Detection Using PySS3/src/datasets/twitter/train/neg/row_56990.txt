I wish I was a girlI wish I'd like myself. I wish I could be happy. I wish people would accept me. I wish I had support. I wish I could ask for help.

But I'm too scared to change my life for the better. I'm so incredibly lonely and I can't do anything about it. I feel like I'm slowly dying because I've given up my hope for a fulfilling life. If only I was born as someone else.
