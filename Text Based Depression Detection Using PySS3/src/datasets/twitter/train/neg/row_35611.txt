Welp, He Murdered My Future!!I wasted my entire childhood and now adulthood on building up various computer-related skillsets in an effort to ensure I will always be able to afford taking care of myself. I am disabled due to permanent psychosis, and the only means I have to make ends meet on disability is selling game assets online. Now with the NN repeal, I won't be able to afford all the sites and services I use for resource gathering and distributing to my collab groups. I won't be able to afford the service that I need to continue my self-made career that I already need to match my bills. I wasted my entire life developing skills that are now rendered worthless with the death of the internet. Who needs HTML and CSS when nobody can afford a website! Forget about Python algorithms, have fun never being able to host your future AI pet projects!

When I inevitably fail to keep up to minimum payments, I was wondering if I could send my corpse post-mortem to Ajit Pai. He'll probably eat it.

If anyone has a clue how to get to this guy, I have dedicated a Kali Linux rig dedicated to black-hat fuckery. If I'm being ejected from this world, I want to stir up some shit where it hurts before I sign off.

Peaceful protests are quaint but ignored. I'll offer myself to the fire if it means these capitalist greedmongers feel even a brief threat against their survival as anyone in my field is currently feeling.

This isn't about the FCC, it's a war on the lower class. Middle class is next, never assume you are safe from these subhuman adrenochrome harvesters.
