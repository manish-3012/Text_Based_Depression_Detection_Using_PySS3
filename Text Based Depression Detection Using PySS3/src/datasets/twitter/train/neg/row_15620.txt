Sharing. Problems.I have a lot of problems and I'm pretty sure I have mild mental illness.  I have never been diagnosed, but there are just some things you know.  There is a lot wrong with me, a large part of it is severe social anxiety.  When I talk to people, or need to be near people, I start sweating profusely.  I cannot make eye contact, if I do it's for a split second.  I'm very awkward.  I'm alone, and being alone for all my adult life, which I'm only in my early 20's, has been miserable.  I don't have friends.  I don't know how to make them.  I don't have a boyfriend because I don't know what guy would ever want me.  

I'm a computer science student.  Most of my time goes towards programming.  Unfortunately, I'm becoming so hopeless and my depression is deepening to the point where I can't even focus on my work anymore.  This area of study requires me to work non-stop all day, barely sleep, I barely eat.  I have no free time.  I love my field of study, however the depression is making it very hard to focus and stay motivated.  It's not what I'm doing that is upsetting.  It's how I'm living.  

Loneliness...it kills.  I can easily make friends as it's rather simple to start a conversation about my curriculum with my peers.  I can't go further than a conversation.  I've tried putting myself out there.
