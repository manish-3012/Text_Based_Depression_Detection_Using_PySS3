I donâ€™t have any hope leftI donâ€™t want to have any hope because itâ€™s just going to get taken away. If I have any hope itâ€™ll make me the selfish one because this entire race of humans beings in a piece of shit. There is no hope left. Thereâ€™s no point in staying around. Itâ€™s just going to get worse and worse and I donâ€™t want to see that. I wonâ€™t be able to do any of the things I wanted to do in life. I donâ€™t want to do anything. I canâ€™t do anything. Everyone is becoming corrupt. The only way I can avoid that is by taking my own life. At least Iâ€™ll know that my final moments will be the only part of my life I have control over.
