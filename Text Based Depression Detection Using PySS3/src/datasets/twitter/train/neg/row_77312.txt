Anxiety Attacks. Are. Killing. Me.Yea so the truth is, I am a recovered addict / alcoholic and even though I'm now sober, I do not like myself. At all. I do not deserve a good life or any of the good things / people I currently have in my life. Trust me I don't. Also, the past month, April, was honestly one of the worst months of my LIFE (even sober) and I became suicidal, but I can't kill myself because I feel so guilty about hurting others. But now, after all of the things last month (car crash, cancer scare, auto-immune diagnosis, nearly getting fired due to no car or way to get around, another friends relapse and suicide, etc.) I am having almost CONSTANT unrelenting anxiety attacks. Can't think. Can't breathe. Can't live like this. I want to die and make it look like I didn't mean to do it. That is terrible. Like I said I am just a bad person. A failure. Poor. College dropout. Mentally and physically ill. It's all too much. Help. Please.
