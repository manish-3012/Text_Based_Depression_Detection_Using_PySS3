I think Iâ€™m too muchI have a doctor appointment tomorrow to try and get help but I just want to call my fiancÃ©, fall asleep on the phone to him to feel safe. But heâ€™s always busy and Iâ€™m alone at 2AM and every day is getting harder and harder. I donâ€™t know what to do. Everything is so scary. I havenâ€™t felt this bad in so long. I donâ€™t want to call 999 and I canâ€™t drive so I canâ€™t go somewhere. Iâ€™m so scared the time.
