Best Friend Doesn't care AnymoreI tried talking to my best friend about how I hate my life and tried to improve my life but nothing helped so I was thinking about killing myself. My friend then says to stop emotionally abusing him and to apologize for lying about killing myself. Wtf? Yes I have talked to him about this before around a year ago and I have tried to improve myself since then but things just stayed the same I can't take it anymore yet he doesn't even care about me at all anymore apparently. It's just fucking pathetic because we have been friends for 12 years how little he cares and i'm so close to actually doing it now since no one will care if I'm gone. I'm sick of everyone that I interact with not giving two shits about me due to features I can not control such as the scars I have from the past.
