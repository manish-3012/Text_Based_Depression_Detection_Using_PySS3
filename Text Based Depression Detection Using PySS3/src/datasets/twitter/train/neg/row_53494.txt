...I feel my life is going nowhere. I feel paralyzed, like the only thing I can do each day is just repeat what I did on the previous. I cannot progress. It has lost me the love of my life, an amazing woman I've been with for five years. Earlier I had a dagger in my hand. I didn't do anything with it. I put it away.

I don't know.
