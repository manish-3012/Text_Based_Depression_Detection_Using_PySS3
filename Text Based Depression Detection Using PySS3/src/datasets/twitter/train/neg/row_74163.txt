I donâ€™t get the point with life to be honest, I think about giving up all the timeI just want to give up, Iâ€™m sick of waiting for good things to happen. Iâ€™m so sick of the pain!

I hope that Iâ€™ll be blessed or something because I donâ€™t know how much longer I can take this pain. 

I hope youâ€™re all doing at least a little better than me.
