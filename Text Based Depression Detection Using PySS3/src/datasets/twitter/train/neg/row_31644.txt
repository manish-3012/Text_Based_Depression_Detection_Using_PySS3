Anger.SO enraged so done so pissed of being the last things on peoples minds so tired of living as a fucking rage ball so tired of feeling trapped. I'm so tired of hurting people. The last time I let out my anger I scared and almost harmed people right in front of my ex. Losing control every single hour little by little. I'm not going to meet anyone I walk alone and I always will. No one has ever liked me except for her. Everything is gone. Now I'm losing my honor the one thing I always had more of. Why am I so bound? I want to be free. Everyone is gone and or moving away from me. Am I supposed to just fucking be in pain for more entire life? I love people and I am so loyal to them. But they don't love me back. So I dropped all of them. The rest are going to be gone soon. I loved her but she didn't love me is it me? her? I still don't want to live without her. Fuck theres so much too much on my mind. They'd only care when i'd be gone. JUST GO FUCK YOURSELF BEFORE I FUCKING KILL YOU! GET OUT! im fucking crazy kill me do something.
