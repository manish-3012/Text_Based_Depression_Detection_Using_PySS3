Have been feeling worse than everHey, so for the past 6 months i've noticed a change in my attitude and outlook on life. Before I was content and happy with where I was and had things to look forward too. However, now I feel like theres nothing to strive for. I don't look forward to doing anything and nothing seems to make me happy. Whats frustrating is there hasn't been any big or major changes in my life to make me feel this way. I am still going to college and still working full time. A year ago it was fine, but now I see no reason to continue. Nothing makes me happy and I don't look forward to doing anything so whats the point of continuing that type of existence. As of today I felt the worst I ever have, I just feel stuck and I don't see the point in stressing about school and work if it wont even lead to my happiness.
