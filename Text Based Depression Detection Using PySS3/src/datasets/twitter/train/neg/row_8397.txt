I'm going to the train tracks tomorrow.I might not die, but it'll only take a quick moment for it all to be taken away. I can't deal with my parents knowing about my self harming, and I can't handle going to therapy tomorrow. If fate has me pinned down tomorrow, then I will die. And if not, I'll live for a little longer.
