Today is my last day on earth.Iâ€™ve felt weirdly calm all day. I donâ€™t know why. It feels surreal. I canâ€™t exactly tell anybody I know that today is my last day alive but I felt like I had to say it some way, so I thought Iâ€™d say it here. I waited, I really did. It didnâ€™t get better, it just got worse. Every time. Every time Iâ€™ve ever had hope Iâ€™ve been horribly hurt or crushed and itâ€™s just happened one too many times now. Things will never turn out alright and I know that and I accept it. Iâ€™m not a very good person. I was mean to my sister a lot when I was little and she still resents me for it. My family things Iâ€™m a useless, lazy failure. I donâ€™t have many friends. Iâ€™m nobodyâ€™s favorite person. I have no use to anybody. Thereâ€™s just no point in staying here. I donâ€™t give a fuck about myself, in fact, quite the opposite; I fucking hate myself, so thereâ€™s no point in staying alive for myself either. Nobody needs me or depends on me so Iâ€™m not going to be leaving anybody behind that wonâ€™t be able to continue on. Iâ€™m a useless piece of shit, a sorry excuse for a person, a fat and fugly stupid bitch. Iâ€™m sick of living, I know that this is what has to happen. I always knew it would, since I was younger, I thought that thereâ€™s no way Iâ€™d make it to be old. I always though that sounded like way too much life, I knew I didnâ€™t want all of that. This is just how it has to be, this is fate. Iâ€™ve gotten endless signs and reasons from the world to just end it all already. And Iâ€™m ready. Iâ€™m ready to go. I just hope I donâ€™t fuck this up like I fuck up everything else, but if I do, Iâ€™ll just try again right after until I succeed. Goodbye. I hope things get better for all of you.
