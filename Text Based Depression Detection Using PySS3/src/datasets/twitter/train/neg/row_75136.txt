Fighting suicide for two years.All I want is a relationship with my kids. For them to call me. Text me. All I wanted was to be a good mom. And I thought I was. Now its over. No one checks on me. Asks me how I am. One doesn't speak to me at all. Without the other thing I had in my life- live music...I'm left with nothing. No reason to live. It's too fuckin' painful.
