It would be so easy to end it all.so fucking easy. why live? its too hard. people here are sick fucks. rapists, abusive friends....and they love coming into my life. drugs wont help. sleeping wont help. its easy to watch the blood drip down my wrist.   its not easy to hide the scars from people. i dont think anyone would care if i were gone. my parents dont seem to have time for me anyway. i virtually have no friends. the girl that has my heart is gone. im just so lonely in this same house, same school, same fucking thing. it just needs to end. Fuck you, life. Fuck you, colorado, and fuck you world.
