I will be on ALL night tonight, if you have any problems, or feel suicidal, PLEASE come and talk!I have alot of work to do tonight, so I will be on all night. If anyone out there is feeling down, depressed or even suicidal, **feel free** to come and talk to me about anything

I use MSN, but I also have things like Google Chat. PM me if you need to talk about something!

**ON ANOTHER NOTE** - I think we should set up a list of reddit usernames that are willing to talk to the people that visit this /r/. I have seen alot of "I need to talk to someone" post lately, and I think we should run at this head on.

Thanks!
