first time poster, long time lurkerman, i've lurked on r/SuicideWatch so much over the years.  i guess this is the day that i post.

sorry.  it feels so self-indulgent to post here.  literally everyone has problems, and most people probably have worse problems than me.

but, you know, anyone can feel like they've reached the point, emotionally, where they're ready to go.  it's, like, i'm just kind of done.  i feel like a disproportionate number of my interactions with people leave them frustrated, disappointed, or angry ... so, like, if i'm a net loss to human happiness ... i'm just saying the math checks out, is all.  

i hope, one day, i have the courage to check out as well.
