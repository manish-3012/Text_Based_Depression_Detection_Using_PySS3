what's even the point yknowi was really cool when i was a kid. i played the piano really well, and i won competitions, when i got older than that i got a black belt in two different fighting styles, and when i got older than that i was *the* star on the football team.but what am i now? im a nobody. i dont matter. this is the first time in life that ive realized that nothing ive ever done and nothing i will have done will ever matter. my girlfriend cheated on me with my best friend, my close older relatives are dying, my mother killed herself and my dad is constantly drunk because of it. so whats the point. i have no family for emotional support i have no friends now that college is over and theyve all moved on i have no money because despite all those years in college all that hard work and motivation and dedication the major i chose has no job openings. i cant afford to go to school again to get another major so im stuck working at the local fucking grocery store with my masters in jack shit. 

so what is there to do? what is there to look forward to? my glory days are over. i dont even have a piano as an outlet anymore. its still at my dads house and its not mine and he wont let me have it. i cant afford one.everything ive ever known and loved is gone forever now. all i can do now is browse 4chan and reddit from my lonely 1 room apartment staring at the only chance of escape i have. my knife.
