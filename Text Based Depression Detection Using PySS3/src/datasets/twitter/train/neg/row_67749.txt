Last night I self harmed and took few pills while listening to a song and it all felt like I was falling into a endless pit.At first I got dizzy but I think it was the smell of blood itâ€™s really weird but everything was feeling lighter when I jumped in bed, only a few good memories some other things that I hate about myself, I wish I wasnâ€™t like this I donâ€™t want to disappoint the few loved ones...
