Taking steps to incite a mob to beat me to death.I need to die in the worst way possible.  I believe in consequences and punishment.  I'm too much of a coward to do it myself, so I need someone else to do it for me.

A few weeks ago I was transported to a psych ward by police for the first time in my life.  I've been developing and practicing a new habit of trying to manipulate strangers into believing that I'm a monster who deserves to die.

My attempts over the past few weeks have been unsuccessful.  People just look at me like a lunatic.  I tried handing people $30 asking if they'd see if they could take me out in one sucker punch for the free money.  Nobody complied because I did it in a well-to-do town.

I know my next step.  I know where I need to go.  I know the type of people who will deal with me.  And I'm getting better at acting.  I'm discovering a talent for it.

I must get beaten or burned to death by a mob, or at least a few VERY ANGRY people.  It's not fair that it hasn't happened to me yet.  It needs to happen.

I'm a disgusting coward of the highest degree.  Someone who is plotting to get killed by an innocent person.  It's time to face my consequences.

I'm getting help.  I'm getting intensive therapy.  I've been to the ER.  The mental health bills are starting to pile up.  I'm going to lose my job soon as a result of all this anxiety.  It's time to die.
