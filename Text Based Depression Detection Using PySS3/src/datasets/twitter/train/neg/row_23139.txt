Feeling lost and ashamedHi. For a while now I've been feeling hopeless and unmotivated. It's winter break and I just didn't go to any of my finals, which is stupid but I really can't find it in me to care. Since I was about 14 I've also had to deal with body dysmorphic disorder- I hate the way I look and most of my issues cannot be fixed, such as bones and certain elements of my skin. I don't really want to go into detail about that. I fantasize of purchasing a gun and doing myself in out in the woods somewhere. I don't know if I have the willpower to go through with it right now but I'm worried I will soon.
