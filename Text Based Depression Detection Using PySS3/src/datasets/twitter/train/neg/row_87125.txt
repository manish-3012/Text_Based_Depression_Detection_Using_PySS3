I don't know what to do anymore. 18FMy dad left us. My mom is a bitch and has been browsing the internet for 2 years searching for a guy, but she wants a perfect man while not even working. She is depressed, doesn't want to talk with anyone and uses her phone all day, each day. The one cooking is our expensive maid (money wasted since she hasn't anything to do ALL DAY). For 2 years we've been living with the money of my 1 brother and 2 sisters which live in another country. I'm finishing school soon, my dream is to go to medical college and become a doctor, but she says I have to find a job and bring some money home. This shit is so fucked up, I won't be able to go on for much longer.
