I'm 15 and I want my life to end this immediate second.Summing it up short. I think I'm a paedophile. This is something I will never accept. Never ever. It's something that has showed up out of nowhere. It's haunting me.

I'm also attracted to adults and girls my age. But I'm more attracted to younger girls. Or at least that's what I think. I'm just really confused.

I want to kill myself over it. I'll never ever be able to live my life with it. I will never ever be able to walk on this planet bearing such a sin.
 I need someone to tell me it will get better. I need someone to tell me that this is just hormones or that this is just a phase. But I honestly don't know. I'm just really desperate for it to go away, because if it doesn't. I will without a doubt end my life. I want to get children with a beautiful wife and make my family proud. But I won't be able to do that if things don't change.
