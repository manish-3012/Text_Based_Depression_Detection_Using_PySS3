I was supposed to go today.I had everything planned out, I had the pills and a plan that I was comfortable with and I was going to do it today. I shouldn't be here. The only reason I haven't done it is because after a particularly difficult appointment at CAMHs on Monday I had to admit that I had something planned, I'm a bad liar. I'm so angry for saying something, this was my easiest way out. Essentially this is the 3rd attempt in the past month. I've been admitted to hospital twice, only to be discharged a couple days later and come back into this shitty cycle. I am so desperate to rest. I want to sleep. Waking up is so painful, knowing I have to get up and continue to live this shitty hell of a life nauseates me. I've been trying to tell my therapist that I'm only getting worse and will continue to do so until I stop telling people and I will actually do it, but I just get told to focus on the moment. I'm so frustrated, I'm falling behind in all of my subjects because of horrible health issues I've been having for the last 5 months. I don't have any aspirations for the future, I really just want to go to rest now. I've had the pills taken from me but that doesn't mean I'm not considering other methods. Maybe soon I'll get the guts to do it, and properly.
