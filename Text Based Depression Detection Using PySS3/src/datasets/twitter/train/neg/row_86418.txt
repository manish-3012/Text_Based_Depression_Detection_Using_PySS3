Please kill meWhen are you coming, Death? 
Every day I wait for you, you who wait for no one, 
I'm that girl stood up at the cafe, at the street corner, at the restaurant with a red rose in a crystal vase
Waiting waiting endless waiting for you to come up from behind,
And with your endless smile
Embrace me.
