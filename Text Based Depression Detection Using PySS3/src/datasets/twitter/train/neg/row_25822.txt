It hurtsThinking bout it more and more lately. Running out of reasons to keep on going. 

Can't even manage to focus long enough to write a coherent post. Guess I was looking for some kind of encouragement. "Hang in there Chap, It'll be allright." Some kind of connection to make me feel a little less alone. 

Doesnt matter though. Life still sucks. Yadda yadda more melodramatic bullshit. Not very good at expressing feelings, or asking for help. Probally why no recovery in sight.
