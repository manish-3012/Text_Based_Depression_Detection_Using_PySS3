Contemplating......Hey so I'm Sean. I've been through 11 psych hospitalizations since I was 15. I have BPD, OCD, MDD, and an eating disorder. I'm kinda at a loss as to what to do anymore. I know that if I make another attempt and fail, I could end up back in a psych ward, or end up with permanent damage. I've been wishing since this covid thing happened that I would get it. Like I said I'm just at a loss. I don't want to leave my family behind but I feel trapped. I've only had really one major attempt last year in April, all the other ones were superficial or not very life-threatening. I just need support. I'm scared of losing my mind and being delusional, but this is contrary to my mental illnesses because I never have been. I'm a very kind person. But I suffer from OCD which causes intrusive thoughts. My partial program is shutdown due to covid so I'm kinda going stur crazy being at home. I'm just scared. I have an amazing and supportive family, I just keep worrying about my future and feel like they would be better off if I wasn't here. I'm currently taking my meds and I am in therapy via phone conferences. I'm just wondering what I'm doing wrong. It's like I know the risks of suicide but it just feels like a safe haven. Just please somebody give me something positive to think about to at least get me through until tomorrow.
