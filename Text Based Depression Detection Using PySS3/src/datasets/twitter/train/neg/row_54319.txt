My girlfriend keeps making comments about suicideDear /r/sw,

My girlfriend keeps making comments about committing suicide... things like "I wonder how much nail polish remover I'd have to drink to die" or "I spent all 1 1/2 hours of class today wondering what the best way to die is.  I think the best would be to just slit my wrists.  Or run into heavy traffic."

I don't know what to do.  I've told her how much I love her and how much it hurts me to hear things like this, but she keeps saying these things.  She recently started the pill, so I'm worried that that is something that is exacerbating it, but she brushed off my suggestion to talk to her doctor about stopping the pill.  What should I do?  How can I get her out of this?

Edit: For a point of reference, we are both about 20, at college.
