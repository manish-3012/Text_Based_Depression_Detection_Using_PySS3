I dont think I can keep goingmy ex and I recently broke up/on a break, i have no idea what we are. All I know is he's in New York, in college having fun, and Im at home sitting in tears. I wake up every morning and within seconds I'm having a full blown anxiety attack about if he's found someone else or if he's slept with another man, I cant handle the thought of him having sex with another man... I want him back, but I know I should move on... I dont know how much more of this I can take, I go to therapy, Ive tried everything... I just dont think I can keep going
