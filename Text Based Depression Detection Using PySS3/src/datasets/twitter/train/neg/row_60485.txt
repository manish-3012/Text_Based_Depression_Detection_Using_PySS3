This world is so unfair. I'm tired of being hurt and treated bad.I'm 30 years old and I have been wanting kill myself since I was 11.
All people around me have hurt me mentally.Even my family hurt my inside. They broke me.
My soon to be ex husband is a really bad person I've ever met.
I am tired of crying every day and thinking about killing myself. Every night I think about suicide Like tonight I should go or not... I prepared for killing myself. But I have a son. When I think about him, I can't kill myself yet. But soon I will get ready for ending my life. 
I have no friends no family.. No one listen to me.. Sometimes I write my feelings here and go sleep.. Here is my suicide note. 
I am sorry about this random post. 
But thank you for reading..
