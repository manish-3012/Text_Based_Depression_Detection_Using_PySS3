No girl will ever like me because I'm a terrible person.I'm terrible. I'm whiny. I have no confidence. I hate myself. I have no hobbies. I'm boring. I'm a failure as a human being. There's no reason why I should continue to live. I see all the happy people around me and my heart sinks and I feel so jealous of them. I'm such a terrible person. I quit my job two days ago because I couldn't handle it anymore. Now I don't even have that. I guess it's time for me to go.
