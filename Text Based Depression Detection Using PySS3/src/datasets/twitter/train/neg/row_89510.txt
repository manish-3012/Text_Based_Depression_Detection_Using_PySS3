i never thought i would make it to 2021. this feels weird, damn. (story on how in still here)i would have died from an attempted a couple months back but the only reason i didnâ€™t go through with my attempt is because one close friend of mine told me during a call that committing suicide is basically the easy way out, etc. right before i finished my self of those words flashed through my mind and i started laughing and then crying because of how stupid i felt going out of life â€œthe easyâ€ way. iâ€™m still suicidal and have lots of problems, including sh but at least iâ€™m still here today. and so that concludes on why iâ€™m still here in 2021.
