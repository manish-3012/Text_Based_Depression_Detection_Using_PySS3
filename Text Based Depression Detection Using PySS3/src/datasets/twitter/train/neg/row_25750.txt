I can't live with the guilt anymoreI just broke my ex's heart because I couldn't reciprocate feelings. I still love her and care for her, but it just didn't feel right. Knowing that I broke this person's heart and put them in so much pain is eating away at me. I can't just let it go. I want to just end it now. I feel like a monster. I hate myself for not knowing what I wanted or what I want right now. I can't do this anymore.
