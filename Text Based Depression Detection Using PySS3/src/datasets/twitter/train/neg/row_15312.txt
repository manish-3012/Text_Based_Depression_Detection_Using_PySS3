Job search has caused me to consider suicideI know this sounds extreme, but I am hopeless and just want out. I left a job in December at a shi**y non-profit with a verbally abusive boss, and thought that I could get back on my feet. I'm 29, live in NYC, have a master's degree and a about five years of professional experience. However, I have applied to 150 jobs and have had ONE interview. It was a long process that led to rejection. Aside from that, I haven't even gotten rejections!!!!! I spend time carefully crafting cover letters for each application and tweaking my resume for each one and don't get so much as a rejection email or even a confirmation that my application is being considered, even when I follow up. 
I used to be a very driven person with so many goals and now every day I just wake up and want to die. However, I don't want to hurt my parents or bf by taking my own life. But then again, I don't want to continue living. Anway, I just needed to put this out there. Maybe someone can relate.
