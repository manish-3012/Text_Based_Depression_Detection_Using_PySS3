Attractive people make me want to kill myself more.Does anyone else feel like that? Especially the one who brag about their relationship statues and all their adventures.. Just annoyingly depressing especially when you know if you tried to find a partner you get nothing but rejection coz in today's society ugly means no rights to feelings.
