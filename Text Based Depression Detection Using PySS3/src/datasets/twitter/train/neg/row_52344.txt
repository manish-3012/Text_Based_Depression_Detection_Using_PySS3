I confided to a friend that I was considering admitting myself to an inpatient psych program and he told me I was overreactingI laid in my bathtub earlier today with a knife in my hand seriously debating ending my life. I self harmed for the first time in over five years. Am I going crazy? Just because Iâ€™m not in hysterics I shouldnâ€™t seek help? Am I overreacting here?
