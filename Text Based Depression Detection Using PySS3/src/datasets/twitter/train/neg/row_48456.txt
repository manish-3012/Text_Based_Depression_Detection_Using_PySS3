Today I realized something!Hey all,

This lovely day will not be my last. I want it to be, but I can't make that happen. I have something very important to do for someone soon, but after that I'll be free. 

I realized I'm destroying myself. In many ways, but none are physical right now. It's all mental, I'm doubting everything, convinced myself that no one cares for me. I'm drowning my sorrow in food, and I'll get really drunk tomorrow night. That's all... Soon I won't have to worry about it, which I'm really excited about

Love you all!
