Happy SuicideHello everyone.
I would like to start off by saying I am an extremely happy person.
I'm always upbeat and enjoy life and thinks it's fun.
But
I believe that suicide is the most rational thing you can do.
I genuinely believe this fact considering the absurdity of the bigger picture. 

I liked Albert Camus' quote "There is but one truly serious philosophical problem and that is suicide". Deciding whether life is worth living or not however isn't my problem, my life I feel is worth living, but it's not necessarily a rational choice. I like to dub this state "Happily Suicidal". But wait... If i'm happy about killing myself and I think it's the most rational thing to do, why don't I just do it?

Well I believe it's my animal instincts stopping me, the same way it's hard to see suicidal symptoms in other animals.

I was just wondering what others take on these conclusions would be? I'm curious to hear your thoughts and if anyone else is "Happily Suicidal?"

Thank you!
