Dead end job, losing hope, mental health dwindling.Hello,
I have entertained the idea briefly years back. My mother has been very sick for sometime and I don't think I can hold on any longer. The thoughts are beginning to make their way into my life in lots of different ways. I've been convincing myself that the easiest option is death. 

Do you have any advice for changing my patterns of thinking over the long term? CBT with a therapist and medication have been consistent for years.
