the grass - so green on the other side...I don't know why I keep posting on here every few days. I feel like a big stupid baby about my pathetic try for my existence. Maybe in hopes to keep myself sane? 

There's not too many people to talk to about any of my problems. Even then; I don't want a "solution". I want to put it out there and maybe know that the parts in my life that are hard for me - really are hard and maybe to also know that I hopefully am not exaggerating all the horrible shit that's happened in my life.

It hurts to live.
It hurts to breathe.
I just want to run far, far away and never come back.
