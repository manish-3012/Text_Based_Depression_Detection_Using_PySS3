We can only wish for a miracle.Nobody understands your thoughts as well as you do. Therapists can only advise you. Not all meds might work. Living is working all the time in the name of "developing yourself" or "coming out of your comfort zone".

In the end we are all alone. As much as people can empathise with our situation, they are only bytes of text on the Internet that lives its own life outside of Reddit. and deals with their own issues. Each and every one of you has their own reason why they want to kill themselves.

My point is, it's really kill or be killed in this world. I understood that long ago, but I'm waiting for my situation to get worse so I can finally have the balls to off myself. Everything is effort and people will sugarcoat it as much as they can to avoid telling it to you bluntly, so you don't off yourself this instant.

This post might break some guidelines on this subreddit. I can only muster writing all of this, because I have no willingness to pull myself up and to do something about it (which comes down to it). Maybe I want to get banned.

I know this is some r/im14andthisisdeep material. But I'm not bright or smart enough to articulate this in a way that isn't edgy.

I'm not even sure why I'm venting here, even though it doesn't matter what people say. I'm living a life where I'm starting to think if I'm just really dumb.
