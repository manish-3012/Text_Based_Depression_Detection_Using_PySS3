Help for a nihilistI have no reason to be sad, in the objective sense.  I am a successful, educated person.  I'm not super wealthy, but I am in control of my education debts in my 20's.  I am a white, young male.  My best friend was murdered.  The culprit is scheduled to be executed.  I have defeated my reliance on alcohol.  I am a nihilist, and I wish I was not.  But that is what I believe.  Please convince me otherwise or just help me.
