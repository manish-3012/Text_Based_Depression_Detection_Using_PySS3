I think i found a draft of my dads suicide letterI don't know what to do. I'm visiting my father currently and went into his room to see my cat. On his drawer I caught a glimpse of a note with my name and my sisters written on the top. I read a bit and the first line was "if you are reading this I am dead". I couldn't read any further and ran out. I know my dad has been severely depressed. He lost the love of his life; my stepmother last October. It was sudden, she had health issues but we thought she'd have more time. They got married only 3 months before. It's not something I'd wish on anyone, to see the person they loved for over 15 years die so suddenly. 
I'm currently shaking and searching as to what to do. I can't bring it up to him. Every time I've mentioned his depression or what happened he shuts me out instantly. He's told me to leave when I tried to get him some help. I knew it was bad but I didn't think I'd see that. Does anyone have any ideas? I'm completely lost, I'm so scared of what he has planned. He told me recently that he's purchased a passport and was going, in his words, "somewhere, anywhere, not sure". After seeing this now I fear the worst. If anyone has any ideas as to what I can do, I'd love to hear them. Please.
