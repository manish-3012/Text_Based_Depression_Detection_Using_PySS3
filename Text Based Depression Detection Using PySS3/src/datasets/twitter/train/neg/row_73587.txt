I've decidedI'll probably do it soon. Get my affairs in order and find the best way to get it done without too much mess. It's always been a hypothetical flirt in the back of my mind, a plan B option just in case. Everything's built up to be too much now. I'm too sensitive for this world, to thrive or connect in any meaningful way. This isn't a rash decision, but one that's taken me years to come to. I can't hear the empty chants of "It gets better, trust me!" and the like for too much longer. I've done therapy, antidepressants, etc etc.. It's not so much the 'depression' or 'sadness' anymore. It's the realization that I'm not like others and I will always be misunderstood. I will always be casually rejected. The emptiness and numbness that I've felt for well over 10yrs now is too much to bear anymore. I've always had a sliver of hope that I'd meet the right person (not even necessarily romantically speaking, just someone I could really connect with) or find my place somewhere. It's never happened and it's not going to. I cannot go on like this anymore. I'm done.

I've been sober for 4yrs, I still take antidepressants, therapy has always failed me. I'm a lost cause, only cause I don't think I was ever supposed to be here to begin with. I don't even care about the pain I'll cause others when I go, because I won't be here anymore to experience it. I need to think of myself now and this is what I believe is best. This is the most analytical I've ever been regarding taking my own life, I don't like to let my emotions dictate my actions.

I don't believe no one cares, I think they do, but no one ever understands. That's what's driving me now. I'm an alien visitor on a foreign planet, time to go home. And I hope it's too nothingness cause I'm rather done with existing.
