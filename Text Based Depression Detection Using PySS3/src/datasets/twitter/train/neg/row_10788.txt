I can't keep going like thisI've had suicidal ideation for almost 20 years now. I've never gone through with it though. I just keep going along, not changing anything, surviving for another day. I am excellent at talking a good game, making plans, etc but I have no follow through. On the one hand, that means I am still alive, but in the other hand that means nothing gets better and really, things just get worse. I am amazingly disconnected and detached from life. I just don't care about anything.  I haven't been doing my job, it has finally caught up to me and will likely be fired this week. I don't exercise, I don't sleep right, I don't eat right. I barely manage to keep myself distracted for enough for it to be time to go to bed again. I avoid everything I can. I just want to die. I just want it to stop. Nothingness would be a gift. But I can't do it. I can't follow through. Please God just kill me
