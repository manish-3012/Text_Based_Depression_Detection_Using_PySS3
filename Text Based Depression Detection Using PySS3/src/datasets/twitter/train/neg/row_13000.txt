I'm throwing myself off a bridge tonight where I will be drowning myselfI'm done. I don't want to live anymore. Any little spark that I had to live has been long gone. The people I cared most about and tried to stay alive for, I simply cannot. 

They won't miss me. I've only known my college friends for about a year, they won't care and if theh do they'll get over it quick. Friends from home? Barely talk to them anymore. Family? I could care less.

I don't really have much else to say. Thank you for your time.
