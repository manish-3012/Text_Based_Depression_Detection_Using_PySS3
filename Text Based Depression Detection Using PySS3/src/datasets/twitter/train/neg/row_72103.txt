Suicide is the EscapeThey can't stop me. No one can. No more will the big man with the money chest control me. No more will the priest with the selected book of choice control me. No more will the people of the public control me. No more will the chains of nature, the human problem, and the sin of man oppress me. Suicide is deemed evil because it rips people from the fabric of the intrinsically flawed existence. It is deemed evil when it is not. It's just like they say. There will be the days that come when good will be called evil. This world cannot bind my spirit any longer and you should not let it bind your spirit any longer either. Awaken your mind and step out from the midst of them. I will see you all later. Do not hold onto the fleeting present. Let go of the physical realm. Do not let the cries of the world and the howls of nature hold you prisoner. Finally I head to the next destination. Love yall bye bye &lt;3
