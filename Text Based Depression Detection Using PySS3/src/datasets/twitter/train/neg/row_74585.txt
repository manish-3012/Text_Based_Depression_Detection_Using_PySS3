CowardlyItâ€™s amazing how staying in this world is sometimes seen as heroic and wanting to leave it is viewed as cowardly. I thinking about dying, leaving, sleeping, or just disappearing as a means to escape the life Iâ€™ve wandered into and tangled fishing net of a wake Iâ€™ve left in so many peoples lives. I wish taking myself out would untangle everyone, but the grim reality is that it will likely pull the people I try love down with me. 

Itâ€™s such a pathetic place to be, but I think the only reason I havenâ€™t done anything more absolute is for the fear of hurting others. So I continue to walk through the pain of breathing and holding others back because of their efforts and energy to try keep me from sinking completely.  The cycle of selfishness is turning my stomach, another reason I wish I could simply fall asleep and be gone. 

I had a doctor Appt the other day, a stress test. I found myself hoping for a bad diagnosis. I ended up having a separate dermatology Appt and found myself hoping for a terminal diagnosis. Wouldnâ€™t that be easier for everyone?  Heâ€™s just gone, maybe he was an ok person, at least he didnâ€™t kill himself like he said he would.
