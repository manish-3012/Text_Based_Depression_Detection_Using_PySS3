17 days leftI'm seeing psychologists and psychiatrists and getting tests done and being evaluated and people want to kill themselves because of me. If things don't improve in 17 days then goodbye.

I stopped cutting myself and drinking to make other people happy and it made me feel worse. Suicidal thoughts don't stop, they won't shut up. I'm so anxious I can't think. I don't want to do anything or be seen by anyone.

I don't know what I did to make people want to kill themselves. I want to die right now. They're taking away the ropes. I have to throw myself off a cliff or use broken glass or something. Depends how much I hate myself in the moment. 

Being alive is too much.
