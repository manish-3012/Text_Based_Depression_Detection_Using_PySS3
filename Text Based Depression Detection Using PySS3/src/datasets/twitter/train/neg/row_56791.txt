i'm sick of iti've officially pushed all the people around me away. i don't want anyone seeing me in the state i am right now. i may never get to even speak to some of these people again, ever, and it feels like shit but i had to do it. i'm a mess and i'm done with people trying to "help" me. i tried to kill myself last week and got sent to the ward. i take all these new meds now and it honestly feels like it's futile. i don't get why people still bother to keep me sane. life is just shitty
