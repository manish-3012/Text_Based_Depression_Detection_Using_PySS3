Should I not bother with my life???So after reading a few other posts I feel pathetic after my story isn't nearly as depressing as others. However, I feel like I should tell my small story to some people here as it might make me feel better. So the time right now in Australia is 11:50. I have school tomorrow. I am 13 years old. I have to wake up at 6am and take the bus to school. After the ride to school, I have to spend my time during class watching my classmates laugh at stupid jokes and attempt not to cry from depression. As each period passes by I will attempt to think of a reason why to move on to the next one instead of just jumping off a second story floor headfirst. Once school finishes I will be relieved for a little while and play some csgo competitive. This is when I am the most happy. However, after I am happy comes the worst part. Realising its 10:58 and that I have school tomorrow. I realize that all that homework that I have not done is waiting for me. That time, is now. So usually attempt to be in bed by 10:30 but today is an exception. I don't believe I will be going to school tomorrow. So my plan is to fill a bathtub with water and pass out in it. Easy and painless. After that will be no school, no worries, no depression and no anxiety. Please give me a reason not to do it. I am going to have a shower and refresh this post. See you (maybe) on the other side.
