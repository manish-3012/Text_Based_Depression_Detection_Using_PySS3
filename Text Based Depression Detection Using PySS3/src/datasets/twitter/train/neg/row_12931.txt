im ridiculousi really hate being like this, and of course I do. who doesnt? but I especially hate having only my boyfriend to talk to and I hate putting everything on him. it's not fair and I'm so scared to hurt our relationship. 
he finally got a therapy appointment and keeps pushing me to make one. but I fucking can't. I can't just get over this ridiculous phone anxiety and I'm so sick of talking about myself. it's fucking stupid but the mere thought terrifies me and I would honestly just rather die. he doesn't deserve to have to put up with me. poor baby.
 I think the worst part though is how he always tells me "you make me so happy, you're the reason I'm here" and "I don't think I'd still be here if I hadn't met you" n after that I feel like complete shit. I wanna die so bad but not if it's gonna kill him in response. he deserves so much better. he deserves a happy life. I hate feeling so selfish. so so selfish.
