.I cut deeper now, I wonder if one day I'll cut too deep, I wonder if that would be so bad.

What does it matter anymore, the last girls I dated broke me, I can't for the life of me even get someone to talk to me ( not even kidding, tried talking to random internet people, 4 people couldn't get through 1 conversation with me and just stopped responding ).

I'm gonna stop now because I don't like thinking who or what I am anymore.
