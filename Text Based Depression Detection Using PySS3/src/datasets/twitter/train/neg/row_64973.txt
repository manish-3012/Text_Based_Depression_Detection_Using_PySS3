Decided to hang myselfI've been telling myself for a while now I'm going to use helium or try making cyanide, but as usual for me I can't fucking see any idea through. I've decided to hang myself, it used to scare me but I'm feeling better about it now. I've been practicing and I feel calm about it as I start to black out, if I'm lucky one of these practices will go horribly right and I'll be out before I can save myself.

Why do I want to do this? Because things do not get better, medication does not help, therapy does not help. I find life to be utter shit and it is because of my personality.  I have never been happy, why the fuck would that ever change,  I'm the last fucking person who could accomplish something like that.
