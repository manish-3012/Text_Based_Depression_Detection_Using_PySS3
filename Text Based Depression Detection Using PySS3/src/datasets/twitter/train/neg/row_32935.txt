Suicide seems to be the only optionI want to live so bad though. I'm 19, I have a beautiful baby girl who will be 6 months soon and a loving fiancÃ©. After having my daughter I developed postpartum depression, my anxiety worsened and I have OCD. Every single day is a headache and it gets worse. I don't want to feel like this at all but there seems to be no escape. I found a therapist through an office that specializes in what I'm suffering with but its $225/session and I can't start until next week and even then I feel like it won't help. I zone out so bad now I'm pretty sure it's psychosis. I am just so tired of feeling this miserable. I developed agoraphobia and I left the house today and felt like death and the only time I'm at peace is when I'm sleeping. Each day is a fight and I don't know if I can keep fighting anymore. I just want happiness. I look around and see people enjoying their lives and here I am feeling like shit. I live in a nightmare. I wake up in terror go to bed in terror and repeat. I know my baby girl needs me but my mind tells me she'll be better off without me. I feel so disconnected from her now and it's just terrible. I'm sitting in a hot car fully dressed right now and I don't even feel it. I just think I'm going to drive off the embankment near my house and close my eyes.
