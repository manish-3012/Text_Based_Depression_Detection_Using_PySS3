Failed at life and suicideYep i failed at everything,

I am a carmechanic of 25y old

5years in workshops and then the moment was there i made money with btc and i quit my job and started daytrading for a living had the oldskool rolls royce and vintage rolex lifestyle life was great. Started my own bussiness and stared trading for others this also went great, also i finally had the balls to date my highschool crush and yes i got her! 
Fast forward a bit and i became a dad!
but bussiness was slowing down and my trades were not that great so i got my workshoes back on and became a mechanic by day and trader by night 
And then i was back to working a minimum of 80h a week i became tired the lack of sleep was getting bigger and bigger and then it happend half a sleep i entered a trade and i got liquidated everything was gone... My money and the money from clients totalling about 1million usd gone and after a few days it really hit me what happend and i suicide came to mind.

I drove to a gasstation and bought coolant concentrate went back home and right before i went to sleep i drank 0.5L of pure coolant concentrate.
GF called an ambulance next morning because i was acting weird/drunk then i know a flash in the ambulance and then it was 4 days later that i woke up in hospital with kidney failure only 9% function left and everything.
Left the hospital after 2 weeks and find a letter that im fired for my mechanic job due to corona... And some unpayed bills... 
That day is now 1 month ago and luckely my kidney and everything recoverd 98% but mentaly im still a mess and i still need to find around a million somewhere but i did find a new job selling alarmsystems

If you have question ask them bcuz nothing really nothing is worth losing your life
