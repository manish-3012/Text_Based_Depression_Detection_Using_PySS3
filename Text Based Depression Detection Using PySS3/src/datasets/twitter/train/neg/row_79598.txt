I want to get out of depression...Hey People, Iâ€™ve made a post a couple weeks ago about my life and what happened and everything trying to reflect back and share my story.

Im feeling worse than ever and everyday I feel more disconnected to this world and canâ€™t find happiness anymore.

My suicidal thoughts are worse than ever and now Iâ€™m at the point where I feel like I only have 2-3 months before I finally break down and end it.

Im alone and I mean alone... no family left no friends because I push them away in case I might kill myself so no one gets too hurt.

Life just overruns me right now and I donâ€™t see how I can make things stable.

I need help but I donâ€™t know where to go... I heard suicide hotlines are garbage and i donâ€™t know who else could help me.

I want to go in therapy or something but I just donâ€™t know what to do.

I want to die so badly but at the same time I want to be happy again...
