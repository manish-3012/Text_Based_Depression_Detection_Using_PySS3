It's quite important for me. If you read this, you'll help me really wellSo, I have to go on a high school next year and of course I have choices. The first one is to go on a school that interests me by doing the handwork, I want to be an automechanic. The second school I don't want to go on is I think IT or something to do with languages idk. I want to be an automechanic but my mum wants me to do the other thing. I don't feel like to and I'd be really bad too as my grades aren't too special either. She argues a lot with me over it, but my goal is clear, so is hers but how do I leave her to make my choice work?
