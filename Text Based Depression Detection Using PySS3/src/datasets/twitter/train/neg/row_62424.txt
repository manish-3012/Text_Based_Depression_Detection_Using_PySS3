I fucked up. There's no going back and I can't fix this.My life has been shit from the beginning because of things out of my control. I've had suicidal thoughts for years, but I was always too cowardly to do it. I thought that things could be better. I thought that things could change with time and hard work.

My parents pushed me into STEM. They don't see the value in anything else and my mother wants to live through me. I was the most miserable I've ever been last year. I didn't have any friends. I despised school. I didn't go a week without crying or self-harming.

Today, my head fucking hurt from how miserable the classes made me. I recently made the decision that I'll change courses because this is my own fucking life and me going into STEM isn't going to make anybody truly happy. I asked if I could change my high school strand into HUMSS - I'm actually interested in humanities and social sciences. Lo and behold, turns out I can't fucking switch. I could have switched into HUMSS last year but I just had to be so fucking stupid. I'd have to endure this year of classes I despise and can't understand. In college, I'd be tired and exhausted from bridging programs. My family is financially unstable too, bridging would be difficult. If I had just switched last year I could have saved myself years and possibly a lifetime of bullshit.

I can't fucking take it anymore. This is the boulder that broke the camel's battered fucking back. Writing this down really helped me, but I still feel very strongly about this. I can't remember the last time I enjoyed waking up and living. I might run away and go on a bender only to overdose in a dirty alleyway. Maybe I'll just jump off our apartment's 8th floor window.
