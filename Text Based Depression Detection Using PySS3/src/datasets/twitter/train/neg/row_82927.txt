I honestly fail to see the problem with committing suicide.This is kind of just to release my thoughts, so it'll be kind of random. I haven't bothered to read the rules so I don't know if the unironic edginess of this post breaks any, but whatever. 

I'm not in a mood to explain my situation, but I feel like I'm done here on this planet. I want to leave. I'm not seeking any request to be saved, and I have no interest in exchanging PMs. I've seen a few posts here and wonder- while it is always nice to support a person who feels awful, *whats so wrong about suicide?*

If a person wants to go, I really can't see a reason as to why we shouldn't let them. It's their choice, and they chose to leave, and I personally respect that.

And as I was looking at methods of ways to go, I couldn't help but think *"No wonder why so many suicides fail."* seems like everything you possibly can ingest these days won't kill you, not even fucking lava lamp liquid, which I was for certain would have some deadly chemicals in it, but no- just some oil and wax that'll make you feel sick and vomit. So, I suppose I'll have to scratch that method off the list.

Again, I can't help but think, "What's so bad about suicide?" I'm genuinely curious, which is why I'm here, I guess .

(Granted, I'm extremely mentally ill and there's probably some obvious answer as to why suicide is bad that I'm not registering.)
