I want to help myself but I don't know how?I have had some health problems this year which means I'm on a study break while I deal with all the shit I have. I'm currently sitting at home doing nothing all day and it's getting to me. I have battled with depression before but sitting doing nothing all day make my life hell. I was offered an opportunity to be active and work but it requires moving away from home which my mother objects to. I would be working with my amazing boyfriend all day and he really lifts my spirits but my mother just ripped it all away from me. How do I cope? I've tried to do something everyday but it gets harder and harder to get out of bed each day.
