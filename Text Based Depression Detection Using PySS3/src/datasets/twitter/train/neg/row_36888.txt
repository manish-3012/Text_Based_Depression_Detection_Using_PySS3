a noteafter 10 months of dealing with debilitating illnesses I figured out no matter what this is always in the back of my mind, even when I'm at my most happy I still feel like I could blow my brains out because I know that happiness is going to be pain later. I'm 18 haven't been able to start my life, get a job, etc because of this. I'm poor as fuck &amp; I'm a complete nuisance to everyone around me &amp; I truly don't see a reason to live anymore if live is just going to be pain &amp; doctor appointments that go no where. I have access to ropes, 45 caliber pistol, other things. Still haven't figured out how I'm going to end it, I guess it will just be what I feel like in the moment. Bye guys
