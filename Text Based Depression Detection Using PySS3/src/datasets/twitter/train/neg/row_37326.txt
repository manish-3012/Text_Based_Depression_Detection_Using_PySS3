I'm gonna go hang myself in a bitWith the rope me and my bf used to make a scratching post for our cat. It's gonna be uncomfortable, but it'll be over quick. This is no way to live, I can't do anything. I'm too tired to live. My dead body is the first thing my bf is going to see when he comes from work, but oh well... Shit happens. I'm just gonna warm up under a blanket and then I'll go prep.
