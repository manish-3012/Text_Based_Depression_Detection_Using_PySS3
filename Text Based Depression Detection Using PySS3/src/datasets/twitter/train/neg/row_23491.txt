Nothing positive ever affects me.It's like there's an enormous brick wall in my mind keeping out anything and everything positive. Compliments don't make me feel anything, neither does praise or motivational talk. If anything, motivational stuff just makes me feel more suicidal.

I'm pretty sure I was just born with something wrong in my brain.
