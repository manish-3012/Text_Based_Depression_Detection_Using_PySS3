I don't know what I did wrongLast night I told my parents I didn't want to work at a summer camp that they paid a lot of money for me to get everything ready and they were really upset. I tried to explain that I felt really bad about it but I couldn't work there because I've been losing sleep over it for the past two weeks and I've only gotten bad vibes from the entire thing. They started calling me ungrateful and it escalated into a big argument where I said I didn't want to live here anymore so they threatened to put me into foster care. Eventually the cops came because they told the cops I was having psychiatric episodes and they evaluated me and eventually left. I've been feeling shitty about everything and on top of this the girl I like and have been talking to is in the hospital and I don't know whats going on with her. Everything that's happened has made it almost overwhelming not to just end everything and I don't know what to do. :/
