I'm fine until I'm notI feel suicidal a lot, but always in a revenge way and I don't know why. My roommate and I got into an argument because I had left a single hair in the bathroom of our apartment. Literally, a single hair. She's very OCD and controlling and even yells at me about putting food in the wrong place in the cupboards. She even times how long I wash my hands for when I use the bathroom and pours bleach in the tub after I shower. The worst part is this is a college dorm so I can't just move out or get assigned elsewhere because the school just says we're already at capacity and there's literally nowhere for either of us to go. 

Lately, I've been thinking about offing myself in the bathroom or in front of her room in revenge. I just feel like dealing with an actual, bloody mess of a corpse would be way worse than the single hair I accidentally shed. I know that's fucked up, and I know I shouldn't even have those thoughts, but I can't help it. I know it wouldn't solve anything, I'd just be dead. I've had these thoughts since I was a kid. Whenever I get into a serious argument or something my first reaction is to try and kill myself. I've never actually attempted, but I feel like one day I'll get there.

I just wish I knew where this was coming from. I know it doesn't make sense, killing myself wouldn't solve anything and getting 'revenge' on someone doesn't actually do anything either. I don't want to feel like every time I get angry or upset the natural response is to try and off myself. 

I'm on Zoloft and have been for a while. It helps with the depression, but it doesn't help with the suicidal feelings. Basically, I don't feel sad all the time anymore, but if I get angry I immediately want to off myself again. 

Sorry for the rambling, I just had to get it out somewhere.
