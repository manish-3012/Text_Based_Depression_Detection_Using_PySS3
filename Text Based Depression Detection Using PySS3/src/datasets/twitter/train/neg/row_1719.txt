Depressed at nightI somehow can distract myself the entire day, even if I'm alone in bed all day. However, once the sun goes down and I try to sleep, my mind fills with horrible thoughts \(suicidal and/or thoughts of loved ones passing away\). My sleep schedule is fucked, I use my Juul to calm me down but all it has done is given me a nicotine addiction. I feel useless. All I want is to be tired, crawl into bed and sleep happily. I come onto this forum a lot and I feel the same as a lot of people. Hell I opened one and immediately started to cry because it was like I was reading a journal. I don't know why I posted this, but if anyone needs/wants to talk, I'm here. We all deserve to be happy and I hope one day we find it.
