FunnyFunny how I feel so alone.. my girlfriend of almost a year cheated on me and gave me herpes...Iâ€™m dead set on death by cop suicide...or maybe an overdose...idk. Maybe this is the only cry for help Iâ€™ll get because Iâ€™ll never admit in person .. maybe itâ€™s just me being bitter.. could my life really not amount to much but killing my self over a girl ? Maybe I donâ€™t even mean it because Iâ€™m posting here.. but damn it hurts..
