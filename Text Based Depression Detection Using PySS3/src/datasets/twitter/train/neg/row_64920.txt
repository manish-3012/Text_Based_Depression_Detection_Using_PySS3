What's the pointI'm literally drifting through life right now. I'm 20 years old and I'm in college and for about a month I've ignored all homework and everytime I try to bring it up to my mom she never really allows me too because she has a temper and usually is too stressed out to make herself seem approachable. I hate this. Everyday I wake up and lay in my room thinking of a game plan. I thought about running away to avoid the embarrassment to my parents. I thought about just having as much fun as possible then killing myself at the end of the year which is looking like the best option to me. When I think about just having fun then ending it I feel less stressed and I can actually get out of bed those days other time I just sit in the dark thinking the smartest way to kill myself I haven't attempted yet but I want to make that if I attempt suicide I better fucking die. I know that when I kill myself I'm going to have to have an explanation for everyone who is in my life. My girlfriend who I love so much shes wonderful is going to go into extreme depression if I kill myself so I know I'm going to have to write an essay apologizing to her. I'm 100% fucked in school at this point I'm going to make little money if I keep going on with life. I have a therapist but unlike others I find it rather useless. They don't ask the questions I need them too and I'm too scared to talk about how I want to die all the time because I'm scared they will change things too much. I don't even know why I'm posting here maybe I really want help maybe I don't. I don't know. I see some of you guys copy and paste comments like you don't even individualize people who are feeling alone. I don't know what I get out of this but I know a lot of you here really are just trying to help and maybe you can help me in some way so that I don't let down every person in my life
