These thoughts.I've been suffering from depression for as long as I can remember. I have thoughts of suicide on a daily basis. I've only talked to 2 people about these reoccurring thoughts. One of those friends has the same problem. On some days I go about imagining everyone's lives if I were to summit suicide. I always tear up when I imagine that. On other days I go about thinking of ways I could end it all right now. I'm only 16 and many of you will say its puberty. I don't think so. This feels too different...
