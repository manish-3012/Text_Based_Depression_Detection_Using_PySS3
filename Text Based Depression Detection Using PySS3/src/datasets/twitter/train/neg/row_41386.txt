How to..My passed away and then my boyfriend broke up with me weeks later. I met him and his family in italy and he left me there the day after i arrived. His family continued their vacation and he left me alone grieving. This was almost 9 months ago. I keep researching best methods. It seems like saving up sleeping pills or short drop hanging are effective but im.afraid i will fuck it up and get hurt  instead of exit. 

I dont have anyone to answer to .. no kids no pets no close family so there is no pull and i know it wont get better. I am just trying to understand the how tos so i wont fuck up.
