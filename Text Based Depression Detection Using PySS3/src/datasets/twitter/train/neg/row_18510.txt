I don't know what to do anymore.I mean, I'm on this sub so obviously I'm depressed. I wanna cut but I've done it in the past and it doesn't relieve the mental pain, yet my arms are longing for a blade on them. I wanna kill myself, but I'm too scared. My girlfriend broke up with me, after 2 years, and she's already getting over me after 2 months. She said she finished me because she felt too much like a mum, but I can't help it. I'm supposed to be getting tested for DCD/ASD in the next few months, so at least I'll finally know what's wrong with me. 

All my goals in my life where with that girl. She's my everything, and she's seeing another guy tomorrow. I don't want to go on anymore. I don't have enough of my antidepressants to kill myself with them, there's a big bridge near me so i think I'd rather get drunk and jump off that. I hate life.
