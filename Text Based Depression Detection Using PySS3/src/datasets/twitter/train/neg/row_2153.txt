Thank youI posted here a few days ago.  With my stressful job and my wife of 12 years telling me she didn't love me anymore

She still doesn't.  And my job is still hell.

And while I'm not ok.  Not even a little bit.  I'm no longer considering suicide as an option.  

I appreciate those of you who reached out to me.
