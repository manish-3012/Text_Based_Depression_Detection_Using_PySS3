It's been a months since I've looked at this sub.....thoughts are back.They say it all hits you when you turn 30. It's happening. I haven't thought about it in almost a year. I've been crying in my bed for an hour next to my pregnant wife. My daughter was there too sleeping. Unreal how it just comes back. I'm ashamed. 

I know I'm just being a pussy. I just fucking hate these thoughts. I was just bragging to myself how I was gonna post a " it gets better " post to you guys. It's been a terrible year. I had my entire savings stolen from me ( 12k ). I was T boned in my wife's car. Now we are driving a 15 year old car. I don't mind but she does of course. There are problems with it. She is pregnant as of last month. I am still fighting for custody of my oldest. 

It's all hitting me now. Just fuck. Christmas is on the way. I didn't even pay my rent last month. I had the money....that's how fucking gone I am. Slowly checking out and back into the terrible place.
