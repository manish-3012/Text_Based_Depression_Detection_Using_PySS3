ContemplatingI keep thinking about it more and more. I am in college and though I am trying to fit in I truly cannot. I am in a sorority and it is known to be a top one but I really do not belong. I do not have one friend and have become very depressed. My parents call me multiple times a day and are doing everything in their power to cheer me up which is the one reason why I've been holding on. I love my family a lot but I seem to be more of a burden then a pleasure to be around. I go to school with the same mean girls from highschool and they continue to do things to ruin my life daily. My parents want me to stick it out another semester but I have no clue how I could do that. I have given it my all this semester and the one real friend I finally found is transferring. I am really torn and not sure what I have to live for currently
