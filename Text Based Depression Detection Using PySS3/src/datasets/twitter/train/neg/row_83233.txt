No money. No transportation. Been a big disappointment to family, and it's finally crossed the line.I keep asking myself what makes me happy. I've found that helping people has made me feel better about myself. Because of this, I've been helping my friends with everything I can, but I've ignored whatever sacrifices I've made for it. I've been wasting money this way, and I've kept it a secret from dad but he keeps pressing. Mom found out early on and has made me feel like shit ever since. _x000D_Well, tonight dad wouldn't leave me alone, and mom kept egging it on. Now he knows and he's pissed. But I don't care that he knows. It's a great relief I don't have to keep that stupid secret, but he doesn't know the full story. _x000D__x000D_I know I have to tell him, but I know I can't have a rational conversation with him about it. Never could have one with him. It always ends with us arguing and blaming each other. With mom, it's kinda the same but just her getting louder and me making it worse. _x000D__x000D_But I know it's about to get worse. What's worse is that the situation as a whole has led me to this site multiple times._x000D_All I want is to last one more day to get a friends birthday gift finished before I reach a point I can't take anymore. _x000D__x000D_Not sure what I wanted here, actually. Just typing my brains out while I'm still on break. Boredom at work is fun. -.-
