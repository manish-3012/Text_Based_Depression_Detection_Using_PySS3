I feel nothingI thought it would be impossible to rid yourself of emotions but after years of solitude and depression, all of my feelings have slowly deteriorated over time and on certain days I don't feel anything at all.

The only time I feel any emotion it hurts. 

I have no friends, no family and now I've even lost myself. I feel transcendent in a way now that on this rare occasion I'm completely apathetic. I've been given an unique perspective on life, I feel like I'm seeing everything in 3rd person as nothing more than a pair of eyes. 

I see that nothing matters and that my future is filled with nothing but a painfull waste of time. Thats why I decided on pure impulse to end my life with these nembutal pills I have. 

I don't feel any sense of empathy towards anyone so I'm just going end up hurting anyone that gets close to me, so I figured it would be for the best to just let everyone be. 

The most ironic part of it all is that I for some reason felt a need to share it here, I don't know if it's my unconscious instincts calling out for help or if I simply felt the need to document my last day on earth.
