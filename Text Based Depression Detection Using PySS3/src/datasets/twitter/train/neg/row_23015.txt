After leaving an abusive relationship, I thought my suicidal thoughts would go away. Two years later and I still hate myself and want to die.I usually do not make posts on reddit but I feel like this is necessary. I feel like I can't talk to anyone else about this. 

Two years ago, I finally left an extremely emotionally abusive relationship. I was with this person for two years, and after about a year of being with him, I started hating myself and having suicidal thoughts. He was very overbearing and tried to control everything I did (he also controlled my finances) and when he couldn't, he would blame me and ask why I couldn't be "better". I constantly wanted to die for the remaining year of that relationship because I felt like my life would be controlled by him. 

I told him about my suicidal thoughts a few months before the end of it, and all he could think of doing was sending me to a doctor so that I "could be fixed". I was offended and knew that it wasn't that easy. Finally that relationship ended, and my suicidal thoughts stopped for a few months. I thought they were gone forever and that the problem was just who I was with. 

But now almost two years have passed, and even though I'm now in a new relationship with someone who isn't abusive at all, I still feel like hurting myself and killing myself. I've felt like this since January 2014 pretty much, and the only reason I haven't actually killed myself is because I know how much it hurts other people. I have had a few friends who have killed themselves and I've seen and felt how much it affects other people. 

I don't know what my problem is. I constantly wish to be physically hurt, and I constantly think about killing myself and wish I was dead. I have a lot of things to look forward to but I can't stop thinking about how I feel like it would just be better if I was dead. I don't even know if I'm doing the right thing by posting here. I just wish I could stop hating myself so much.
