My mother broke me again today. I feel like jumping again.Today I just told my mom I'm finding it very hard to concentrate on my online school classwork. She told me "what's not letting you concentrate?" I just said that I don't know (because the real reason is going on Reddit, 4chan, video games, and just weird stuff that I do like biting my fingers' skin or just going into deep thoughts but it feels too personal to tell her) and she kept asking me. Then she started yelling at me telling me how I didn't concentrate at a real school because of other students and slow teachers and she's angry because I'm not able to concentrate in online school. It's really making me consider jumping out the window more than I've ever had because not being able to concentrate puts stress on me and it's a real burden and it just feels like she doesn't care for me. I'm a male under 18 and I'm just a total mess.
