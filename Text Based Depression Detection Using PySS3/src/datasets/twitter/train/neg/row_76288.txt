Anyone awake?I have been feeling suicidal all day and I called my boyfriend and asked for his help and he got angry at me for keeping him awake for work tomorrow so I'm now at home and I'm so upset because I hadn't cut my wrists in a year and now I have.. I feel like I have to die I'm such a burden on everyone. I'm so scared though.

If anyone is reading this please comment, say anything. I just need to chat to someone . I'm scared to hurt myself more
