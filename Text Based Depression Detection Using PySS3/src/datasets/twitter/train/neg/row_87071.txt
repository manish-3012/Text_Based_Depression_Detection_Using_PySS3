I am questioning my faithI am Christian and am questioning my faith. Not becuase I have doubts but because I am being told that the evidence I have is shit evidence and not to be trusted. If I find this to be the case, I of course will stop being a Christian. So my struggle now is, there would be no point in existing. I'm a burden on my husband and children and they would be better off if I am removed from the situation. Yet, this atheist I was talking to  was conversing with me like suicide is a bad thing. If there is no god, then I see no purpose in remaining a burden on those around me. So, anyone ever been in my shoes?
