Hope hope hope... It shoves me in suicidal limbo when I still want to kill myself but won't because my silly brain still generate hopes. Every day is hellish even more than I was firm of ending my life. I hate hope because it guarantees nothing. I had so many empty hopes that turned into regret.I am haunted by my mistakes, regrets plague my mind and I just want to die NOW, ok. It would be great.

But instead I have to suffer again and again and again.

I am exhausted.

I want to quit and give up hope but I also have few people that I don't want to traumatize.

This is some kind of hell I swear.

I looked so horrid today that people thought I was on drugs but I wasn't.

I am in pain constantly.

Thank you for reading this bullshit.
