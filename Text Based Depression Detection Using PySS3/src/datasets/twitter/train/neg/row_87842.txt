So there is no cure for internalized racismI'm not sure where this leaves me. Gonna stop therapy soon because it can't cure this. I want to maybe just get off the grid and never associate with humans again. But then I'd just be alone with my self hatred. It's an interesting and frustration situation. No idea what to do here. I'm not suicidal, just stewing in confused anger.
