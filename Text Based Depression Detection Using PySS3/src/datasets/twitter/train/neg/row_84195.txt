Iâ€™m tired of meI donâ€™t like to be alone with myself and I find myself increasingly unbearable to be around. Iâ€™m whatâ€™s wrong with my life and I feel like I just degrade the value of life for everyone around me. I donâ€™t belong here. I hate myself for wanting people to stay with me when I donâ€™t even want to. Iâ€™m so tired of everything , I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. I canâ€™t even stop you know itâ€™s, why is everything ok and then itâ€™s not. I donâ€™t want to be me anymore .
Why is everyone so fucking oblivious.
