I am unsubscribing from this subI wanted to stay subscribed so I could occasionally help people out but constantly seeing people post about being suicidal and wanting to kill themselves reminds me too much of my own struggles and it puts me in a bad mood.

Iâ€™m sorry and thank you all you lovely people who help people keep the will to live.

One of you saved my life.

u/yuri5768 probably doesnâ€™t know but they seriously saved my life, thank you :)
