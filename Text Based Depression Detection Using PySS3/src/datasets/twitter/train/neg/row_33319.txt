I'm not even sure why I'm postingI was recently diagnosed with Bipolar disorder after dragging my girlfriend through a year of behavior I couldn't fathom myself. I'm currently going through treatment though. But she witnessed my first manic episode of my entire life and I'm so embarrassed. My mental health is getting better but I don't have any good friends in my life anymore. As I have consistently moved, I was bullied in high school, and one of my two good guy friends from high school came on to me over thanksgiving break last year (I'm a lesbian).

I met my girlfriend my freshmen year of university, fell madly madly in love with her and for 11 months now we have been dating. Month 10 is when I had my manic breakdown. I'm currently home for treatment and it's going really well but until I get back and prove to her that I can balance school, our relationship, and my mental health, I've been feeling really really suicidal. My suicidal thoughts have flared up in years, but this past month it's been an every night kind of thing. 

I don't want to burden her by talking to her about it. I just don't know how to tell myself everything will be okay and believe it.
