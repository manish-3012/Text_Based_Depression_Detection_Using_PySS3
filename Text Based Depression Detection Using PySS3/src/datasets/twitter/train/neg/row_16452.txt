My partner is suicidal and I don't know where they're atI will be (A) and my partner will be (B). I'm trying to keep as many identifiable details out so bear with me

We have been together for a few months now and up until these past few weeks it has been wonderful. A few weeks ago my partner opened up about a drinking problem and sought support. B was doing well until early last week and they spiraled, speaking of suicide and wanting to just run away. I urged them to get help.

Yesterday I got some messages that B has called their parents and that B is suicidal. Last night I got a text saying that B is at the hospital. This morning I get a phone call that B is on their way to the hospital again. That's the last I heard from B. Assuming that they're at the hospital I called them and the hospital has said that B hasn't been there since last night.

My only friend in town is on her way to take me to B's house to make sure the worst hasn't happened. I don't know what to do from there. There doesn't seem to be a guidebook on what to do for a suicidal partner and I have only been able to support B based on my own experience with suicidal thoughts. Because of my experience I tried to just be present and let B find their own way because a suicidal person can only get help if they're open to get help, right?
