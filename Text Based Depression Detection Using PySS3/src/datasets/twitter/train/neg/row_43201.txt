I canâ€™t even anymoreIâ€™m a 14 year old boy that has gone through a lot. My family had to move to the US because we didnâ€™t have money and wanted an opportunity. We are still staying strong but I just canâ€™t handle living anymore. 

I just failed my semester due to my iresponsible self. It was the class that could get me a schoolarship and help me with education, but i didnâ€™t pay attention, I didnâ€™t ask for help, I didnâ€™t tell my family for help even. I just told everyone that i was fine. In all my other classes that are normal, the kids there always want to work with me because they say Iâ€™m smart and strong(the strong part is because i do crossfit but i wonâ€™t get into that). I just sat infront of my TV just playing games and watching Netflix instead of studying and doing homework for that class. Now I have no chance of helping my grade and some bad decisions i made this year are coming back to haunt me.

Iâ€™m just looking for help and people that understand me. I donâ€™t want to die but it seems like the only way out. I need support in this moment
