Texts to make sure youâ€™re aliveSo the last couple of weeks Iâ€™ve gotten random texts from my father ever day like â€œlook at the weather hereâ€, â€œsee we are eating meat and potato todayâ€, â€œI went on a walk and saw this riverâ€. The thing is that itâ€™s really kind of him, but itâ€™s not sincere, I in fact KNOW he only does that because he feels it is his duty to check that Iâ€™ve not done something stupid and lay dead in the house. It takes so much energy to just sit there for ten minutes everyday and think to myself what I could possibly write to answer him in a kind way.
