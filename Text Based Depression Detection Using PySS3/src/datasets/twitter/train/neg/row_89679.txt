I just want to die because Iâ€™m so sad.I think about dying every single day. Even on days that Iâ€™m somewhat happy, I still think it. Iâ€™m so sad. I donâ€™t have a job, living in LA where everyone takes advantage of other people. Iâ€™m just so sick of life. But I have a hard time doing it. Iâ€™m worried about my wife and my brother and parents. It seems greedy and selfish. But at the same time, I am suffering so much.... I feel lonely, alone, sad, anxious....... life really sucks.
