I want to kill myself because of anexitySome days ago I went out with one of my friend and drunk till blackout. I only remember dancing with a girl at a club and maybe (but not sure) kissing her on the neck. I fear that I will be charged for sexual assault or I might did other innapropiate things.

My buddy says that he thinks that nothing have happened. But he was drunk too. I don't trust him.

I fight with paranoia and anxiety for years now and this situation is killing me. Usually I can releave it by talking to people about this situation but this time I can't because I can't even remember what might happened. I feel extreme guilt and fear. I haven't slept for 3 days and haven't eaten much. What should I do?
