i thought maybe you guys could help mei don't get why i have to keep going. i've done nothing but hold people back and drag people down. i hurt so much inside and i can't take it, i hate that because of my mental illness i have put so much stress on everyone in the past years and even now. please help me, i dont know where else to turn.

edit: thank you all. i really appreciate all the kindness i've received from the people in this subreddit.
