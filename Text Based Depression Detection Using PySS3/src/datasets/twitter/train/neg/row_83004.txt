I almost beat my former offender to death from junior high and high school a bit of context when I was in primary and secondary school I had a bully that harassed and attacked me, it caused me many problems with depression and anxiety, it made my life impossible and I currently suffer from social anxiety. I recently ran into my old aggressor, he was no longer the same, he had already matured and he apologized that is fine but it made him explode and I remember everything that made me go through everything that I am going through because of him and at the moment he asked me to I will forgive him as if nothing came to him and I beat him so much that it left him very serious and if I killed him and I felt good but I don't like to feel like that. I'm confused. How should I feel? should I be relieved? O well? please help
