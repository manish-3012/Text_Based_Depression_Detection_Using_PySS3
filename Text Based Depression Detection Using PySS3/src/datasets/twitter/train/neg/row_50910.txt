Gave myself a time limit.  Time is up and I don't feel better.  What now?I started having issues with depression and suicidal thoughts when I was around 13 or 14.  I read a lot of online stuff at the time that told me it was a temporary problem and that life changes and you can get better.  Being a logical little middle schooler, I told myself that suicide wouldn't make sense unless I was feeling that way for over 50% of my life.  I'm 28 now and I don't feel better.  Time is up.  I came here for the first time and clicked on the 'If you are feeling suicidal NOW, please read this.' link on the side of the page.  I saw that exact same page when I was 14.  It makes me feel like getting better is never going to happen and I should just stop trying.
