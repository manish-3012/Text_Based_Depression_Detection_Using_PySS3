The Afterthought 

I ainâ€™t perfect, just a tiny man with scars, an imperfection in Godâ€™s eyes. Therefore, take my word for it, when I say,

*â€œYou can be; smart, yet foolishly blind; beautiful, yet selfishly distorted; flawless, yetâ€¦ donâ€™t you see who you areâ€” I am not.â€*

When the suicidal thoughts pops like a gun shot, and when suddenly, the idealization of deathâ€™s voice, a voice as small as graveyard mice, whispers in your ear,

*â€œOh please, oh please gravitate towards the comatose thought and come play with me in the dark, where the peaceful souls tokes the joint.â€*

I exercise that idea, that graveyard mouse sings, oh so clear now,

*â€œNo more countdown, no more I tell you, no more counting towards the end and counting days like counting change in the 7/11 counter for a square,â€*

I am screaming in my brain.

*â€œPlease let me go, stop singing lullabies so alluringly convincing, please let me go, I cannot stop thinking about you,â€* I tell myself,

as the nickels and dimes and quarter splash all around me trying to buy a cigarette. The 7/11 clerk rolls his eyes in impatient disgust.

*â€œHey buddy, donâ€™t you see I got a line in front of me. Step on the gas and can you hurry, please and thank you!â€*

I am not ready to die to be an afterthought.
