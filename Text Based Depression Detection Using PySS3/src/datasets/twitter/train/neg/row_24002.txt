feeling pretty lowI have BPD and for awhile I wasn't feeling anything. I'm now feeling things and I've been ping-ponging between despair and anger (at a really stupid thing). I feel like I'm replaceable to all my friends. I feel like I don't see them much anymore though I'm usually always reaching out to hang out. The exception being when I pay for things. 

I want to die. I just want it all to end. I hate my head and don't know how to fight back. I don't want to kill myself necessarily but if i were to die that would be fantastic. 

I hate that my friend's having their own lives makes me feel so fucking alone. I don't have anyone I can reach out to. The suicide hotline is useless it feels like they want me off the phone as soon as possible. If i had made attempt I wouldn't call them as they just call the cops. 

I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm at my end. I've been crying for the past hour.
