Glock 23.I am currently staring at an unchambered Glock 23.

She left me. She said we argued too much. But it was because she drank too much, and I had enough. 

I work out of state, I am an iron worker and apprentice carpenter. I am 24. I leave nothing behind.

I am a college graduate, circa May 2015. I am in a management training program with the construction company I belong to.

I suffer depression, mostly due to a past relationship where I was smashed over the head with a bottle by an ex that couldn't understand why I wouldn't want her back after she cheated on me. Yes I have attended therapy, and am on medicatiOn, buts that's besides the point.

I have 1 round in front of me, too. I never cheated on her, I never hit her. All I wanted was her time when we were together. She talked me down to all her friends. I tried everything.

I have been in a drunken stupor for the past 6 days.

I have reached my end.
