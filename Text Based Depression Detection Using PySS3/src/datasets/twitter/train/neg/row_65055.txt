I'm 36 and am about to give up.I don't want to do it anymore. The grind, the submit and work for someone to pay rent and do it again. I been doing it and it isn't going anywhere. Am I supposed to do this for another 50 years, fuck that. I want to just sleep and not wake up. Fuck my brain hurts, my chest, stomach you name it. If I die, no more struggle. I pray that God gives me the strength to get through this. He has blessed me with so much throughout my life, and I feel like a failure. Help me please.
