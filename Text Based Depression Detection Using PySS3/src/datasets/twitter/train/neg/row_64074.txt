Time to disappearI really don't know what to say at this point. I just want to go. I've tried everything and nothing is working anymore. It's been a long week so far..hell a long few years and I'm tired. I know how hard suicide is on those related to someone who does it, but I've tried everything, literally, to get through this. I just need the pain to stop. I'm not doing this to "get back" at anyone or what not. This is the first thing I am doing for myself. But, either way, I'm sorry. I really am.
