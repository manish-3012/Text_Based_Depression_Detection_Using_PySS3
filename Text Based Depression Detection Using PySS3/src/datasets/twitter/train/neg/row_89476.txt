Lonely and depressed on new yearsI tried drinking but all it did was make me dizzy and more depressed. I posted some art on social media but was given the painful reminder of how socially isolated I am and the reasons for it, and it hurts. I am almost 30 and social media hurts like hell every time I go on there because I come across people who I like but who have no idea who I am or don't want anything to do with me if I try to talk to them. The same thing happens in real life, I come on too strong and deter people who are nice to me because I'm so socially awkward and so much want friends. A girl at Winners around my age was nice to me and I don't know what I did but she just looks at me weird now and yeah. I have ADHD, autism spectrum disorder, social anxiety and am traumatized by being bullied my whole life for my looks and weird demeanour. The only reason I post my art online is because my family and two friends are on there and support me. I don't know I should be happy I have them but it just hurts being cut off from the rest of the world and the world not even wanting to give me a chance. I've been told I should try networking, but I have no confidence due to past awful social experiences and feel like I would just not appeal to anyone. I don't want to go through the rejection. I didn't even fit in with the other nerdy art kids at my college. I was too weird for them and they didn't want anything to do with me. I wasn't cool and aesthetic enough or tumblr famous.
