*Something generic*In a couple of days I plan to follow through a list I made on social media from asking about â€œeveryoneâ€™s bucket listâ€ and while quarantine will make it hard to do most Iâ€™m going to try my best and as soon as Iâ€™ve decided Iâ€™ve done enough or I get pinned in a corner Iâ€™m going to end it all. Iâ€™ve been alone for so long and I canâ€™t do it again.
