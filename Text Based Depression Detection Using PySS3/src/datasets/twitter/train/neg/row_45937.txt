sorryI've been like this for months

Every minute of every day I think about dying

I feel like i cant do anything right and every time i think ive screwed up i hurt myself

i cant stop because therapists dont even want to talk to me :)

my friends dont talk to me anymore at all

people keep telling me i matter to them but never acknowledge my existence

im lonely 100% of the time and i feel like complete garbage

the only thing stopping me from killing myself is that im afraid of messing up and being in the hospital for years or something like that
