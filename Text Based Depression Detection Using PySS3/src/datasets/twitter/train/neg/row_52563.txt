Please talk to meHi all,

So, things have been tough lately. Iâ€™ll try to write this coherently but Iâ€™m struggling. 

Iâ€™ve been going through a time time lately for lots of reasons. My long-standing anxiety, depression OCD, recent problems with my university, relationship problems/conflictions (not a word, apparently) and so on. 

Iâ€™ve spend the last few days not really doing much. Iâ€™ve been trying to tidy up my tip of my a room, but havenâ€™t gotten far. Other than that, Iâ€™ve mainly been in bed, drinking and watching YouTube, and doing other simple things tbsg donâ€™t tax me much. 

So yeah, Iâ€™m going through a tough time, one thatâ€™s involved a lot more alcohol than ever before in my life. 

Itâ€™s just before 5am my time, and my sleeping pattern is messed up. It usually is anyway, but itâ€™s been especially so lately. 

My mind is a mess. Iâ€™m struggling a lot. I have some people to talk to but... I donâ€™t know. Please talk to me. I feel alone.

Iâ€™m supposed to be visiting my parents later today (Sunday) for dinner and a visit. I enjoy doing that but the anxiety of leaving my house and having to do things can be a bit much sometimes, especially with my sleeping problems, so itâ€™s been at least a couple weeks or so since I last visited them. 

I know my mum misses me and has been worried about me. 

I see the sheer number of threads started in this subreddit of people truly struggling, and itâ€™s depressing. I try to help when I can. 

I just need... something. I donâ€™t know what. 

I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™ll fall asleep and go to my parents later in the day. I hope to visit them. 

I might go there drunk or somewhat drunk at the time. I donâ€™t want to worry them. But it helps me. It makes me feel better. Makes me forget things and the bad thoughts donâ€™t last as long. And it helps me sleep.
