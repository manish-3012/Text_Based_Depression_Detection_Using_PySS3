Why shouldn't I die?I mean this life is just unbearable and I'm sure therapy etc isn't gonna fix it within an acceptable amount of time.

Death is easy peace (may be some more lucky in next life if that's what happens lol). I don't consider life so important. 

The only reason I haven't done anything is because people tell that's not a solution blablabla because they want you not to die (which is the only reason they try to stop it).
