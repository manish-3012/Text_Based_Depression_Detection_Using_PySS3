Are there no chat rooms where we could discuss things?There used to be chat rooms for people who want to CTB, are there none now? 
Extremely depressed. Lost my job in a layoff. Though there are no financial issues, I just hate sitting at home and this is not for the past few months. My career has been in doldrums since I got married. Tried my hand at a business, didnt work. Started a couple of well paying jobs, had to leave them. Wanted to start something after the layoff, plans are shelved becasue of COVID19. 
Im extremely ambitious. On the other hand, my husband is so laid back, lacks ambition. On top of it he is so cold and indifferent to me. He abuses me. I hate being mediocre. And therefore I started hating him. Unable to get pregnant even after multiple IVFs, and IUIs. 
My life just seems so purposeless now with failures on both professional and personal fronts and sitting at home idly is just driving me to take the extreme step. Shortly into the marriage, I realised he is not for me and have been depressed ever since, especially with the way he treats me, how lazy he is, how he lacks ambition. I am not oblivious to the attention I get from men, I never cheated on him though. Got N back in 2018, will that be useful now? I would like to talk to people virtually as I dont want to burden anyone irl with my sob story.
