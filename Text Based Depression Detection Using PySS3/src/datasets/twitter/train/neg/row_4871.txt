Is there something you want to accomplish before you die ?Iâ€™m sitting in my car outside of Target debating if I want Olive Garden or fastfood. My logic is I should save my money so I can take a trip around the U.S. before I finally go.. But on the other hand, fuck it, food so damn good. And when youâ€™re this fucking depressed, Yeah, Iâ€™ll take some goddamn breadsticks.

I really want to travel and see a few things before I decide itâ€™s over. Because maybe the beauty in it all will make me wanna stay.

Do you have anything you want to do before you go through with it?

*Also should I get OG or fries*
