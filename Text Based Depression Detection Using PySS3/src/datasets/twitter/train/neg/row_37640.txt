I wish I was dead already...IM 17 and have wanted to kill myself for about a year now and ive already tried twice but with my brother physically stopping me twice. I think im going to try and overdose on a ton of pills that I have because i just feel like there is nothinng for me anymore. I have really bad intrusive thoughts everyday all the time saying that I should kill myself and ive gone through all the treatments and nothing has helped. no one understands or knows how to help and I just can't do it anymore. i just dont know what to do nothing is good at all
