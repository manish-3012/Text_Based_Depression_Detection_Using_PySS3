I've given myself 10 days to live. This is the second. What should I do during the rest of my time?I've already gotten rid of most of the things I own, so my family won't have to do it themselves. I've found a sturdy rope, so I've already acheived the bare minimum of what I wanted to do. I have 8 days left. Is there anything I should do before I go?

Kinda like a bucket list, but within a week.
