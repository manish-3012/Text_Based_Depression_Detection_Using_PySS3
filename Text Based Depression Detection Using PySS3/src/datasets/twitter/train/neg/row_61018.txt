One of many unread entriesWhatâ€™s the point of writing? I donâ€™t know. I want to be heard, cared about. I feel so alone, so alienated from what makes a human being human. I feel like this is too many words to explain how I feel. Heavy. Isolated. Stuck. Worthless. 

Life used to feel like a story, now it seems like a cruel joke. My birthday is in a few weeks, and I donâ€™t feel like spending another alone. Best of luck to everyone else in their journeys, because I feel mine is about up.
