I just want to not existI don't want to die, I want to be happy but that feels so impossible to do. I can't remember the last time I was and honestly don't deserve to be, I want to be normal, I want to do normal things and have friends but I just can't no matter how much I try. I wish I was never born, I only keep living because I don't want to hurt my family. But I'm a complete mess, my heads a mess, my life's a mess. I've fucked everything up. I can't get a job. I have no money. I'm struggling with college. I can't even afford to get to college anymore and I have to walk 3 hours each day just to get there. I'm physically and mentally exhausted. I've started self harming again. My body is already covered in scars and I'm ashamed of who I have become. I wish someone could hold me and just tell me everything will be okay, but there's no one. I'm alone and hurting so badly I don't know what to do anymore. I'm too scared to ask for help. I'm not in control of me at all. I don't deserve help anyways. 

Sorry for the rant.
