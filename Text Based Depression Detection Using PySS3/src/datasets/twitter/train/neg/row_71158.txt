im exhausted.I think it is time.   I proved I could be sober.   My life feels so fucking weird.   Nothing I do matters.    The only person who seemingly cares for me is an eye doctor who doesn't have an agenda.   My family constantly lies to me and keeps stuff from me.  My family actively fucks with me on purpose, I don't understand why.   I tried reaching out multiple times today, nothing has worked.  people are tired of me.   i'm tired of me.  i'm exhausted by me.
