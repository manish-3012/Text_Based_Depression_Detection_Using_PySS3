I tried to say goodbye to everyoneI tried to tell everyone on facebook to have a goodlife and they'd likely never see me again. And my internet for a second dropped as i posted it so it was never posted. I realized this and rewrote it, but then thought maybe its meant to be this way. Maybe i'll just go away without saying anything.
