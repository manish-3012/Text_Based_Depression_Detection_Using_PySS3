I can't do it anymore, I'm losing everythingI'm broke, I'm a piece of shit and I can't do it anymore. I can't hold down a job I'm in and out therapy and the hospital I'm a broken piece of shit and I'm going to kill myself.  I even tried sex work and I can't do it because I'm too fat and ugly. I'm trying to figure out what to do but I'm going to lose my house and I can't go to school and everything is falling apart. I can't do it I've tried so hard but it's not getting better
