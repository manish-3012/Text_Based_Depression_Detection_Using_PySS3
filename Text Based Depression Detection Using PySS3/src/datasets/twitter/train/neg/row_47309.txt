Hoping covid gets rid of me so my name doesn't get plastered with infamy because of suicideI'm 33 and I've lived nearly my entire life against my will because I was so scared of going to Hell. It was engrained into my head that suicide is sinful and I'd burn for eternity if I committed this.

The social majority has demonized suicide to the point where I actually find a sigh of relief with this virus. Becoming infected and dying from the virus CAN be a way to put myself out of my misery without tarnishing my name and memory in the name of suicide. I dont see covid as an excuse or a copout to cheat life but rather as an opportunity to embrace true freedom from pain that life gives.

I can't seem to catch the disease no matter how hard I try.
