I'm tiredI can't do this anymore. Trying to get help and get back on meds is impossible right now. I have no friends, no social connections, and no one to talk to. I'm broke, unemployed, and I can't get a callback on any resumes I've sent out over the past 6 months. I'm just done. I've wasted the last 23 years of my life and I can't see myself doing anything with the time I have in front of me. I can't visualize a future for myself. I have nothing left to give and it's getting harder and harder to pretend like I'm doing okay. I want to die but I can't. Living is expensive, dying is expensive, and everything in between is exhausting. 

Hearing that it'll be okay just makes everything worse, because I know it probably will be but it doesn't feel like it. I'm just so tired. I want to be erased from existence but I have to wake up tomorrow morning and the morning after that and go through another fucking day, and I can't. I just want to lie down and die and have everything about me wiped from the earth, so no one has to be burdened by cleaning up after I kill myself. But I know I can't kill myself yet, because my family can't afford a funeral and I know they would be sad, so I'm stuck here. I just want to be done. I'm so tired and everything hurts.

I don't want feedback or advice or sympathy. I just need to post this somewhere because it feels like if I don't I'll start screaming
