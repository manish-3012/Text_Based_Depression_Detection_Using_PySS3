my head hurtsi made my plans. made a list of people to leave letters to. planned a date. drew out a method. and i let it all sink in. 

the only thing stopping me is my family. the only reason i canâ€™t bring myself to do it is because i know that i will instil hate and resentment in everyone i love and this wonâ€™t fix it. this wonâ€™t make anything ok between us. and theyâ€™ll spend the rest of their lives cursing my name for never bringing them anything but misery. i live as a constant deadweight latched to their feet. known day in, day out, as one giant fuckup.  and i canâ€™t even escape it, because that will only make them hate me.
