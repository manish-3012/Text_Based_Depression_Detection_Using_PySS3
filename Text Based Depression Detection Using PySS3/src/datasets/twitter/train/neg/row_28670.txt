Struggling a lot.Sorry, this is my first post on reddit, kinda new here. But honestly, I just need a place to let this out. You donâ€™t have to read if itâ€™s a burden of course!

Iâ€™m really struggling, Iâ€™m sorta young so my family doubts me having any mental issues but itâ€™s really starting to affect me. Iâ€™ve tried to kill myself several times, police showed up once but they didnâ€™t think anything since they â€œcouldnâ€™t see scars on my arm.â€

Iâ€™m always so negative, depressed anxious, and especially suicidal. Iâ€™m in so much pain but I say this so much no one probably takes it seriously anymore. Iâ€™m such a dumbass,, like Iâ€™ll isolate myself and then complain about how no one wants to talk to me. Iâ€™m so self aware yet so dense. I canâ€™t fix it. 
Iâ€™ve tried professional help but that just gives me anxiety.
I feel like nobody cares about my life, I know itâ€™s not true but eh.

I feel like I failed, I canâ€™t help anyone and will probably just cause it to be worse. This is quite possibly the worst mood Iâ€™ve been in. 

My mom is constantly drunk, my dad is cheating on my Mom, my brother is literally my bully.
My family is pretty fucked.

I think I really am going to kill my self, I donâ€™t know how but I might. Could be a week from now, could be years,
But I reslly donâ€™t see a point. My friends are leaving me and I donâ€™t see myself as important,

I had a bad, I donâ€™t even onow? It felt like nervous breakdown and cut a lot. I regret it but sometbing keeps urging me to do it. I might. I had this one boyfriend, he was the best thing ever, however we got into an argument and then he began to hate me. He attempted to kill himself and claimed â€œI hope Noen is happyâ€. J called the police cause I was scared but it really fucked me up. It really was my fault. He didnâ€™t die, but Iâ€™ll still never forgive myself for that. I also called the cops, I bretrayed our trust and now itâ€™s all fucked

Sorry for so much spelling errors Iâ€™m tired and Iâ€™m not really paying attention to it. I guess thatâ€™s it for now. Ty, tysm if you actually took the time to read this, i thank you from the bottom of my heart &lt;3
