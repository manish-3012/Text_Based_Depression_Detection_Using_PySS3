Take a few moments to look at yourselfI had posted here recently to essentially vent, because I have struggled for a long time with depression, anxiety and PTSD, and I would say there have been more bad times than good times in my 23 years of life.  

But today I realized how little I actually focus on myself, and figured that this probably applies to a lot of the people here.  It's easier to focus on things around us and distract ourselves, but at the end of the day, I know that I haven't done much of anything to change my life, I've just tried to distract myself from feeling like shit.  My life isn't going to change if I don't change it, so I've realized that I need to change.  

So please take a few moments to look at yourself, it can help.
