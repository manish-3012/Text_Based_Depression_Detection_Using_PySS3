I have this feeling everyday.I'm 19 years old. It seems like all my peers who I went to school with are all graduated and going to college I can't afford it. I had a girlfriend it lasted 4 years she recently just broke up with me. I've always struggled with the thought of suicide. Last Christmas Day I went to the hospital because I took 18 Gabapentin and started overdosing and got my stomach pumped. I don't have anyone. My father has never been there. My mother passed away when I was 7. I'm 19 trying to make ends meet on my own. I struggle to get a good job that can pay enough to actually survive. My girlfriend left me because I'm insecure. I kept thinking she was talking to other guys even though she was but not in the way I was thinking I guess, we will never know. But anyways to sum it all up. It feels like there's no way out. Life is too hard life is too short. I don't have anyone I don't have anything I can barely feed myself. I really don't wanna be here anymore. Everyday in the front of my mind is the thought of suicide. I think about it everyday. As soon as I wake. All throughout the day. And I've always had these thoughts. But now it's just I'm down so bad there's no way out. I don't wanna be here anymore. My name is Anthony. I appreciate you if you read this. Thank you but I think my time is up. I'm worthless.â¤ï¸
