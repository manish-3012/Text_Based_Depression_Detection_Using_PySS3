I tried writing a poem...Void

I feel emptiness inside me

Suffering endlessly

Someone, anyone,

Can you save me?

Why am I cast among the filth?

The degenerates, the maggots?

I am better than they

Made of sterner stuff (or so they say)


When people ask whatâ€™s wrong

I answer plainly with a plastic smile

â€œNothingâ€

Synonymous with this Void

Empty

Suffering

Hated

Slumbering


The beast inside me

Cries in anguish

Every waking moment

Feels thankless


And they pray to their God

Saying to be grateful

But I canâ€™t be thankful

When God is hateful


Where was he

When I was trapped in Hell?

Where was he

When I fell?


Where was he

As I suffered under that whore?

Where was he?

I canâ€™t take this anymore


I wish I understood what love is

Not platonically, plenty of that to go around

I mean this gaping void

Screaming a silent sound.


Iâ€™ve said it before

Iâ€™ll say it again

This void is empty

Consumed from within


Help me

I cry one last time

Before I tire of this ire

And end this tragic lie.
