I dont know anymoreI'm 15 and I'm not sure if I'm depressed or just being a moody teen, I've been crying myself to sleep every night because of negative thoughts and I keep disappointing everyone that I know, I'm not over exaggerating about that. I don't want to self diagnose or talk about it with someone in real life because 1- I don't have any close friends and I don't open up to my parents because I know they would just compare how tougher their life is 2- I want to keep this to myself. Everyday I feel so lonely craving for attention and wanting a hug. I don't feel anything when I do the things that I used to enjoy...everything just feels so empty. I'm at a point where I don't even care if I die or not but I'm just so much of a pussy to end it all. I don't even have any motivation left to do anything.
