Idk man. I just don't know.Idk. Im just. I feel like I can never do anything right. I'm just a monster that ruins everything. 

I'm manipulative, useless, stupid, ugly, unstable, etc. 

Nothing in my life is ever stable. Not friends not relationships, the only stable thing in my life is my constant depression and anxiety, but even it's not stable or consistent. Voices come and go I get chills throughout my entire body. I don't feel like I can do anything right. I am always fucking myself over. Any friendships I get as soon as they get considered anything close to best friend they just start to crumble right in the Palm of my hand. Everything I touch falls apart. I wanted things to be okay for a change but today is one of the worst days ever. (Or yesterday now). Lost a good friend she thinks I'm manipulative. She's not wrong I'm a complete piece of garbage. Than this guy comes up to me in downtown and I think I'm gonna get raped or mugged and he's telling s big story about how he used to have a problem with drugs and at the end of all that he asks if I want a BJ. Just makes me feel violated. I now understand why females hate cat calls. But you know whatever. All of this is fine as long as I can come home and make some amazing music. Yeah nope. Keep reminding myself that I'm actually trash at making music. Everything today has pushed me closer and closer to just going to an overpass and jumping. But on another hand I want to suffer for all the bad I've done. All the time I've wasted. All the space im currently wasting. All the air I'm stealing. I deserve nothing more than the most painful and. Ive thought about it all day. I have no one to talk to so here I am wanting help, but so on the edge of just saying fuck everything man. No one has any faith or trust in me at all. Nor should they have. Honestly fuck this planet.
