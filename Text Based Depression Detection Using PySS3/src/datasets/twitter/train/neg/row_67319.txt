What keeps you from ending your life?A lot of posts from us, wanting to end our lives. What stops us? 

For me itâ€™s one, my mother is still alive, and two, method. My mother was recently diagnosed with cancer, and had surgery. Sheâ€™s 85 years old, and likely doesnâ€™t have many years left. My suicide would devastate her. 

Two, is how I would end my life. I want a clean, not-too-painful death. I plan on overdosing when my time is up. I read suicides by overdoses are rarely successful. Perhaps most attempts are poorly thought out and do not take enough of the right drugs, or change their mind when they still can. 

I have 75 10/325 Hydrocodone-Acetaminophen tablets and 12 muscle relaxant tablets left over from a recent surgery. I am confident this dosage would be sufficient. My only reluctance is the acetaminophen dosage would ruin my liver should I survive the initial attempt. Or just draw out the overdose from â€˜going to sleep and not waking upâ€™ to a slow, painful death over a few days. 

I do not own a gun. Too messy. I do not like the idea of hanging myself, jumping of a bridge, building, or train.
