Existential CrisisI have a loving husband who makes me laugh all the time,a job pays well(I can afford most things I want),a few of friends I like to hang out with.However,I haven't feel happy recently.I don't know why I exist,but I don't want to die,either. Sometimes,when I wake up in the morning,the first thing in my mind is "why I am still here". 
I used to buy things I want to make myself feel happy/contented,but now it doesn't seem to work. Also,I don't have the urge to "want" anymore. Like,when I saw something I really liked in my 20s,I would work so hard and reward myself that thing,whether is a purse or clothes.Now,even if I see something I like,i lose my interest really quickly.
How do I know if I have depression?
