Whats like the point of my life?Like I'm lowkey asking.  My life was shitty even tho I had plenty of love etc., maybe I'm broken Why can't I just go and die? Who would actually rlly care? Like, I always wanted a relationship but surprise surprise, life had dissapointed me once again... No matter what path I'd choose it still comes to one, death... What's your opinions?
