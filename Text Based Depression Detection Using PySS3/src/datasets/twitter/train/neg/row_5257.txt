Isolated Suicidal Numb Weirdo GirlJust FYI I don't hate myself, that is a literal description if what I am. At this point I'm just getting bored of living.

Its fucked up. I ran away and pretty much got rid of everyone in my life because they were treating me worse that shit. Worse than rat shit.

I'm so angry...all I ever try to do is make people not hate me (I gave up on being likeable) and somehow I am either ignored or looked at sideways.

Now I'm living alone, nobody to talk to. I work, come home, eat, and waste time until I'm tired enough to sleep.

I really give up on trying to find my place in society but that doesn't change the fact that maaaaybe it would be nice to talk to someone? Like for real...just be genuine and be able to relate to someone

The hollow feeling I get is unbareable hence why I want to kill myself occasionally. Tonight is one of those occasions.

But I know I won't do it. I'll just have to keep living, being bored, being lonely...whatever

Maybe one day someone will just kill me. Maybe I can trip down the stairs and crack my skull open

I hate trying to live like everyone else
