I just wanted to say thisIn a book called looking for Alaska, there was a quote the stuck to me. 
"How will i ever get out of this laybrinth of sufferning?" Alaska Young

This was implying all the pain that you face in your life, and how you plan to escape it. Of those of you who read the book i am sure you know what i am taking about.

Alaska said that she would get out of the laybrinth straight and fast. 
And you might have guessed it she died.

I for one thing that this is a very inportnat lesson. After reading this book i knew the only what to bet out of the laybrinth of suffering was through suicide. The funny thing is i can n3ver seen to get myself to do it. 

Sorry if this was a terrible thing to post. I just needed to get it out of my system.
