I want to die.most of my week has been spent lying in bed pretending to not exist and fantasizing about suicide. my life is fine. I'm working part time while I'm off school this semester, I'm trying to stay on track for my career, I have friends that say they love me, my family says they love me, I have a home, food, water, but I still feel incomplete. is it my depression doing this me? regardless of what is causing it, I still feel this way and I just want to die. I have a method and just need a location. but even then I'm just being picky with my location. I could honestly do it anywhere I think. 

yeah, I just want to die. every action I do is prefaced by the thought 'I want to die'. when I lie in bed, I think about ways to die. I wish I could make it stop. I don't have it in me to make efforts to distract myself from these thoughts. and that idea in itself is a depressing one to me. is my whole life just going to consist of trying to distract myself from suicide? like how is that living? its not. I would rather not live. I would rather die.  sometimes I think to myself I should have killed myself back in high school. maybe I should kill myself now instead of regretting living even more in the future.

I don't know what I'm doing by posting here. I just want to talk about these suicidal feelings, I guess. sigh. I wish someone would just kill me. I would be grateful.
