The only thing holding me back from killing myself is my ageIâ€™m 13 and life already doesnâ€™t feel like itâ€™s worth living. Bad stuff started at around 8 when my family would argue a lot and stuff. Everyone always checked on my sister tho but my parents would frequently forget to get me from school and stuff like that. I started confiding in older man and so ashamed to say it but I still do sometimes. They make me feel important for awhile.but then it just hurts again when I think of what the really want.And sometimes I gave that to them. I donâ€™t send any like pictures and stuff anymore because nothing has genuinely made me feel good anymore. Anyway though My family has been in like a civil war thing for years now it doesnâ€™t bother me as much I donâ€™t think. But a lot of my problems come from school and myself. When I started 6th grade a kid would always touch me in class and telling adults doesnâ€™t always work. 7th grade I had so much hate for myself my kinda friends Ig would pick on me but I made it seem like I donâ€™t care Iâ€™m still friends with them ig. This summer I did try to kill myself but failed. Now 8th grade sucks so bad. I feel getting up every morning and so sick and tired the whole day. I constantly cut burn and scratch my arms but just hide it with hoodies and long shirts. Soon Iâ€™ll try again I feel but Iâ€™m just really young and the thought of making a mistake still scars me a little but not as much. Idk why I shared all of this but please no one judge my choices I really donâ€™t wanna open my phone to stuff like that. There is a shit ton more but this is already super long.
