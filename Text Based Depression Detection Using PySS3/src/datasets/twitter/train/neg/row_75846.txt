I canâ€™t even think anymoreMy mind is consistently swirling I keep freaking the fuck out at people. I just want this bullshit to end let it end please fucking god let it end. I canâ€™t fight this shit every moment of every day how I have to commit creeps up on me. What do I fucking do no one can answer that question. I should just do it I hate that Iâ€™m such a baby maybe I can give someone permission to hurt me. 

I just have to fucking do it Iâ€™ve got no choice itâ€™s there all the time this isnâ€™t a good life.
