The only thing I can think of ending my loneliness in this world is by taking myself out of itI can't shake this thought I have felt this way for a long time I keep on telling myself that it will all work out in the end I just need to get that job I wanted, I get the job and the feeling is still there maybe I just need to lose some weight, I try it and still this never ending want to end my life why do I feel like this, Other people don't feel like this.I try tinder but I just cannot get anywhere with anyone I am 21 and have never spoken in person with a girl with intentions of making a 'friend' I put myself in a pit of loneliness and I know all I have to do is be brave and talk to people make friends and find a girlfriend but it all seems so hard and ending my life just seems so easy.


Somebody please, what's the point, somebody let me in on this big secrets how can everybody else seem so happy.
