One Way or the OtherAt this point in life, I feel good about the two choices I've set for myself.

The first is that I will be a musician. My musicianship needn't take me to world-wide fame or anything huge like that, but making good rock music for myself and those who would listen is what I want most out of life right now.

If that does not work, however, I think it will be time to check out. There's nothing I'd rather do more. I'll give myself ample time to see if things are going okay but if I can't reach it, then I guess that's the way it is.

It's an all or nothing type of thing. It's how I want my story to go. Just sharing what I think.
