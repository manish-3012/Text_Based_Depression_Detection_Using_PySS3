TiredI cant do this anymore. I'm always tired,always frustrated,constantly critcising and hating myself. There's just no hope for me left. There's no goals i want to achieve,i have nothing left to live for. I just want to close my eyes and never open them again. Why must i stay alive if there's no happiness in life for me at all? I wish i had the guts to kill myself but i don't even know how i would do it. I feel like...just like everything I've ever tried..i would end up pathetically failing.
