In so much physical painI have medical problems and it makes my quality of life so poor. I don't know how people with cancer or other medical issues do it, I don't want to fight. I want this pain to end. I can't breathe and nobody can do anything for me. I can't work much because I can't breathe and my chest hurts and I want the pain to end. My insurance sucks and I hate playing this waiting game while I suffer. 

Kinda need to rant, I'm getting very depressed lately, hoping I'd get in a car accident or something and it'd all be over. Trying to hold on for my family but at this point its hard to think about them when I'm suffering.
