I care anymoreA while ago I had a mental breakdown and tried to open up to my family about it. My sister criticized me for not cleaning my apartment when I said it took everything just to get through the day. My ants and uncles either don't believe in mental illness. My friends have all moved on and lost contact and nobody even takes me seriously when I tell them about my abusive past. I have no control of my own finances and it's just getting harder to keep going. I feel like at every possible turn and moment people just keep kicking me while I'm down, idk no one will probably see this but I only thing I can feel is numb and pain. I just don't care.
