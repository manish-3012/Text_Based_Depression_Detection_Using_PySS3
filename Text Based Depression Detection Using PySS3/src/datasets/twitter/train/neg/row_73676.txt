Lack of Hope and motivation prior to lockdown, which now has worstened.Hello. I'm writing here to gain some sort of motivation and hope for the future. I'm an 18 year old Secondary School student in Ireland, currently in my final year before the Leaving Cert, which acts as an access route to college based on individual performance.

  
I have for the longest time struggled with my mental health, major anxiety, depression and suicide ideation, all of which lower my general motivations immensely. Coupled with this is ADD which makes it harder to stay focused on a topic or gain focus in the first place. Although I am taking medication for these, Sertraline 100mg and Ritalin 20mg, school has always been difficult, however with the supports supplied it didn't seem quite impossible.

Now with the country in lockdown and schools closed I'm left at home with little to no motivation to do anything. My mother understands my mental health challenges, however insists on blaming herself for my academic short-comings and lack of motivation. As such, she believes she's in her right to be angry about this, with said anger being aimed at me, the source of the problem, or so it seems to me. 

We don't have any online classes in my school for whatever reason, so there's little direct pressure from teachers. We do use google classroom, but that's it. 

I don't know how to get motivated to do much of anything and my thoughts of escape through suicide are getting stronger and stronger.

I just feel so alone is all, it sucks and I don't want to feel like this anymore.

(If this was incoherent, I'm sorry, It's hard to put this sort of thing into words for me)
