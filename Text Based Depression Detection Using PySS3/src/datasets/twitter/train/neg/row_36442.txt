I'm going to kill myself in a couple of hours.It's nearly 2 AM now. By the time I'll leave the apartment at 8, I'll have spent those intervening hours playing two of my favorite games (Fallout: New Vegas and Hearts of Iron IV, for those curious) and enjoying myself for one last time. I'm not going to tell my friends and family, to spare them the knowledge that they knew my plans in advance and couldn't do anything about it. If all goes well, I'll be dead before noon.

This isn't an impulsive decision, I've had a month to think about it, and I've made peace with my own mortality. I'm not going to get into my reasons for why I've come to this decision, but it's the choice I've made for myself. I don't really know why I'm even posting this, since neither the people who'll care nor the ones who won't will ever see this post. Maybe I just wanted to say goodbye to some strangers on Reddit, I don't know. Or maybe I'm hoping that some kindly guardian angel will convince me otherwise, but this isn't A Wonderful Life, so I doubt it. 

It doesn't really matter though. I've made my decision, now I have to follow through with it. Bye, Reddit, it's been grand.
