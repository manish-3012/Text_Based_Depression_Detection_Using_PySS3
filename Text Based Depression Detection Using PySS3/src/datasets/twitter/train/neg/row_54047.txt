I swear people think that I am the next Sandy Hook shooterI was on the subway just now. It was super packed. I was swinging my backpack off to take something out. A woman next to me was annoyed as fuck and got pissed as fuck.

I got really angry. I started breathing heavily, curled my lips up like a pit bull, clenched my fists and started trembling out of anger. I didn't hit anyone. Nobody made eye contact with me. That fucking cunt ignored me.

When the subway reached the next station, I bursted out screaming. I swear it must be a new sight. Since I had to go somewhere else quick, I just plopped down onto a spot on the other side of the train. I kept on curling my lips and clenching my fists. People stood away from me as if I was the next Sandy Hook shooter. 

I don't know if this is related to ADHD as I rarely read these stories here. I was diagnosed with it and I do have anger outbursts.
