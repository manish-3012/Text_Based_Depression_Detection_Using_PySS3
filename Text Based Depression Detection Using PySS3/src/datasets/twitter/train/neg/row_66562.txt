All set up, very seriously leaning towards going through with it. I guess I'm giving "help" one last chance before I do so. So if you have any good reasons for sticking around, i'd sure like to be clued in. I wont get into my life story. I had a shitty childhood, shitty life. I've been in therapy since my first attempt when i was 17, and years later all i'm doing with my life anymore is therapy. But theres just no helping whatever is wrong with me. Some people are destined to tragic or doomed fates, and i might just beone of them. Rather than be a drain and burden on the state and the two people around me i have left, and rather than living every day in pain, this seems like the solution i havent yet been able to reach. I've had numerous other attempts. But i have hours alone, i wouldnt get caught, no one would know. The noose is tied, the closet is cleared out, and i already know it holds my weight.

i just don't see a way out of it. If i don't do it, I'll just be a coward. I'll be afraid of leaving the pain i live with every day, because like a dumb animal the pain is what im used to. 

i dont now what else to say.
