I canâ€™t talk about this with anyone I knowI donâ€™t know how much longer I can keep this up. 
My father was sexually abusive. My exboyfriend raped me. My friend molested me. My other friend raped me and then stole my car. I had a miscarriage at three months.
My boyfriend has several sleep disorders that were undiagnosed for the 8 months of our relationship, which made him beat me without knowing what was happening. I was in a car accident that broke several bones. We often go days without eating. One of my friends just died from a blood clot, and another was ran over by a plane.

I donâ€™t know why I keep living, I donâ€™t believe in a god. I canâ€™t sleep at night, and I canâ€™t focus on conversation during the day. I donâ€™t want to hurt my boyfriend, but I think that he would be better off without me. I havenâ€™t been working, and I feel like I just bring him down. He works so hard for us every day, and when he comes home, I can tell that heâ€™s exhausted but he keeps it inside. I feel like shit for eating his food and not contributing. I also feel guilty for being hungry when there isnâ€™t food since I no longer help with income since the car accident. The most shameful thing Iâ€™ve done is walking to my old work, since I know that we tie off our trash bags before throwing them out, and taking the bag from the kitchen so that we wouldnâ€™t go hungry that week. Iâ€™ve done this 3 times.

If you are what you eat, Iâ€™m literally garbage. I wish that I could die without hurting my boyfriend.
