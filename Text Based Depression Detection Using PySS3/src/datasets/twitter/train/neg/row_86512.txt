I have suicidal thoughts but I donâ€™t want to dieMy girlfriend of a year and a half has just left me out of nowhere and I have no idea why. Itâ€™s like she never even loved me. It was so easy for her and now she tells me to leave her alone and she needs to move on from the past and she wants to start anew. I donâ€™t understand what I did wrong. I have missed a year of my life as I canâ€™t go to college this year because I am too late to join any good colleges in my area so I have to go to some shitty college that used to be a house but turned into a college. I donâ€™t see the point. Iâ€™m not going to be successful. The only reason I lived was the hope of living a good life with my girlfriend and now itâ€™s out of the window. My friends hate me because Iâ€™m snappy as my mindset hasnâ€™t been the best lately. I feel like nobody is there for me. But I donâ€™t want to die, something is pushing me to carry on. I donâ€™t know what to do.
