A blissful goodbyeI think about it a lot. Every day actually. What else can I do? I've sought out help, whether it be from friends and family, or the military hospital (I'm in the Navy). But through all the help, and ups and downs I still have no desire to carry on. I quit the heavy drinking and partying and fighting. That helped for awhile. I patched up my broken relationship and joined a gym. I've done all the right things, checked every box to stop this pain. But I still spend every moment of the day thinking about it. I've done the research, I know SGLI covers my life insurance so my family will be taken care of. The stress and self torment are just too much. I feel like it's time for my blissful goodbye.
