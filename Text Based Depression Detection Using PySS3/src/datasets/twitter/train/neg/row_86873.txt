How can I finally overcome my cowardice, and just end it already?As life continues to be less and less enjoyable, especially with this damned pandemic, a growing part of me wishes I wasn't so scared, and would just put myself out of my misery. I've had one attempt and multiple near attempts, and every time, I get too scared, and seek out help at the last minute before anything could really happen. 

No matter how many medications I've tried, therapists I've seen, or times I've been admitted to a psych ward, the outcome is always the same: I'm glad to be out of a mental hospital, but just go right back to the same cycle of pain and self-destruction with no motivation to take care of myself. With this pandemic, an enjoyable future for myself seems farther and farther out of my reach. I can't see my friends; there's nothing fun to look forward to; everything else in life is severely restricted; tensions in my family are high; I can't afford anymore psych ward visits or other intensive care. Most of my day consists of gaming, eating junk food, and +10 hour sleep cycles in which I'm blissfully tuned out of reality in lucid dreaming.

If I wasn't so afraid of the gruesome way I'd likely go, and if I didn't care so much about not hurting my loved ones, maybe I could finally give myself the ultimate pain relief, and no longer wait another eternity for the world to stop being so shitty.

Thanks for listening.
