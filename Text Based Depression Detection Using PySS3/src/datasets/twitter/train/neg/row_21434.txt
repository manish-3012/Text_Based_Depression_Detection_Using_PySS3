Kinda just looking for someone to talk to about thisI've started to believe I've developed some kind of pessimistic God complex.
It's like I'm stuck in some late night tv show that's written by someone who only got the job because he dad knows a guy. There are times where I feel like an author insert, not quite a Marry Sue, but the main character of a story written by someone who isn't quite sure what the conflict is yet. Problems I have feel lazy and easily fixed. Bad things that happen tend to be surface level and lack continued consequences. All of it, everything around me feels cheap, contrived, and lazy. All advice is welcome. Dying seems pretty easy ATM.
