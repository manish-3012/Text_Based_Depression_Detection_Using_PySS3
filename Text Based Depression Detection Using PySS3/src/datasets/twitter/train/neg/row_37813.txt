Tried to kill myself back in 2017And as you can see, i'm pretty much alive right now. 

Like everyone else, life did got better for awhile... and then 2020 showed up and everything. Slowly. Started. Getting. More. Worse.

I wish I had died. 

But I didn't. 

And now, I really wish I could no longer convince myself to distract the bad thoughts so I can finally be in the same bad level of mental health and this time, I promise I won't fail.
