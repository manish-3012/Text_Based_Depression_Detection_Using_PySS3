Reasons I want to Die. Any Reasons to Stay Alive?1. I struggle financially. It's really hard for me even to pay my bills, or eat properly. I just make somewhere like $2-10 / day. I used to have business, but it's all collapsed. I have tried to start all over again, but I keep failing.
2. Because of what happened last year, and this year, I now have social anxiety and severely depressed. I am dysfunctional, and even buying grocery outside takes lots of effort
3. I have no friend nor family. technically I have family but they don't care about me, well maybe if I die, they will care. not sure though. I cannot complain about this actually, but I am actually a burden. So I am all alone.
4. My health becomes like shit, and I cannot even afford to go to hospital. It's getting worse each day. Don't talk about insurance or something, I cannot even afford to pay it. Well I am just barely able to afford my $2 simple food every day.
5. My long term GF left me 1.5 years a go, well that's because I have been useless, and dysfunctional.

It's not I don't try it to improve my situation for God's sake, it's just everything keep going wrong. I cannot blame other people, it's my responsibility. But I am tired to live. Is there actually any reason to stay alive?
