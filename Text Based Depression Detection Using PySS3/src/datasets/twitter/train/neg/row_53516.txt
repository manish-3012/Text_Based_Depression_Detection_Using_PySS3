The Only ChoiceI don't really want to kill myself I just know it's the only way I won't spend the entire however many years I'd naturally live feeling unwanted and worthless and insigificant. I've tried so hard for so long and I just have nothing. Nothing I ever try is successful. I'm never good enough to be anybodies friend. I've never had a relationship. I can't even land a job interview never mind a job. People just won't give me a chance and I have absolutely none of the luck everybody else seems to have.
