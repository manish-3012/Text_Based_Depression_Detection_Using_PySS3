No real point anymoreI've been severely depressed and suicidal longer than I haven't. I don't remember ever being truly happy. I've had friends but they all have abandoned me. My mother was the only reason I was alive up until now. She has a new boyfriend and spends more time with him than me now. I have a boyfriend but I want to spend more time with him while he doesn't. He likes his days off for himself so I'm lucky to see him even once a week. I'm about to turn 22 and I'm not even close to completing my degree. I'm starting my summer job in a week and all that it brings is unbearable pain because it is physical labor. Taking the suggestion of recovery for my eating disorder as made me the heaviest I have ever been. My boyfriend as even said he's worried about me getting diabetes. I sit at home all day every day. It would be multiple days before my body would even be found. I've already counted out the number of pills that will kill me. I'll just slip into a coma and never wake up.

Yes I have done all the doctors, programs, medication, and therapy. Doctors have given up on any sort of relief for me.

I don't even know why I'm posting on here. I've done something like this before but it turns out with people talking to you for a little bit and then never replying back.
