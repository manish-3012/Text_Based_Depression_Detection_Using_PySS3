I am a coward.Hi, I'm 19 years old. I hate myself. I have a  seemingly good life for which I am grateful to GOD but it seems like I bring pain to everyone else. I spent a lot of my parents money on my education. I don't know if I will be able to get a job. In fact, now that I think about it, the reason I don't have any friends is probably because people can sense I will bring them nothing but pain. I feel like I am ugly and I don't really want to show my face to anyone. I just want to end my misery and the misery that I cause anyone else. To the world, I just wanna apologise. I truly want to kill myself. I'm just scared to take that step. A few moments of pain is the only hurdle I have left. Can someone help me with this? Like a painless way. I am a coward.
