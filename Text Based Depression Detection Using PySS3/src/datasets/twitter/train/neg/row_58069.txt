I'm 16 and I feel like my girlfriend might be pregnant. Please help me.I can't handle being a father at 16, it'll ruin my life and I feel like there will only be one way out. We've been using protection but her period is almost 3 weeks late.

Edit: I'm reading all the replies and I appreciate them all, thank you. They're all helping.
