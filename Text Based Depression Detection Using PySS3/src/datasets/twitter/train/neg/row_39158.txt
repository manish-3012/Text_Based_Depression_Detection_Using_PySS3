I cannot fulfil my potential and i wanna kill myselfThe thought of suicide lingers around me no matter how happy i am i know suicide and darkness is always one step away from me. Im a extreme procrastinator and because of that i am unable to fulfil my potential i never submit anything on time i never achieved anything or completely learned anything and i know this is bad and gonna affect my future but i just donâ€™t know how to stop it im always running away from responsibility im well aware of the consequence but i dont know what to do about it. It stresses me out so much and i feel so lost. Itâ€™s ruining my life, i have no one to seek help from with confidence. Even if i seek help and plan something nothing happens. I am so tired and everything feels so tasteless and temporary. If i continue like this im only gonna be a burden so i just wanna stop existing. I know school is mandatory but itâ€™s something thats thrown at me without my own will and no matter how much i say i hate it but no one cares and tells me to suck it. My whole life is basically wasted at school where im forced with things i hate. I cant get around in life because i have to get through the things i hate. Im so lazy i hate myself i just wanna die so that i dont have to deal with complex problems. I dont even have motivation to move sometimes. But i keep telling myself youâ€™re a coward you cant even kill yourself, you have perfectly normal life why are you being so pathetic. I dont know what to do anymore.
