Dead SoulsAfter 27 years of feeling alone, being abandoned, rejected, bullied. I am feeling totally empty inside. I gave everthing, everthing I wanted to. Till I am at the point that I can't take it no more. 

My soul is torn apart, broken. As if I look through a window and see people being happy, a world where I don't belong as it seems. Like a lost soul finding it's place. With nobody around or people who understand me it feels done for me.

All my life I was looking for someone who was just like me, who likes the music that I like, to feel a real, deep connection, someone who I could talk to. I found that person. It's broken, and with the thought that we never talk again, never share our live and interest... It breaks me to the point that I feel ready to leave this world. There is nothing anymore, the opportunity is there, so clear. 
What is a life worth if it's always alone? I can't go on like this, the pain to much, the world to cruel. It's a place that I don't feel at home. 

The silence, the guilt, I wish the pain could stop. It's so heavy, surviving the day is like a battle. 
How hard I try, it seems like ending it is my destiny.
