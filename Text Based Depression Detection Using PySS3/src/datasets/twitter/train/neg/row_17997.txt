I Can't Finding Meaning In Life AnymoreThis will sound childish but I cannot shake these feelings no matter how many therapy sessions I go to or how much my doctor ups the dosage of my pills. My heart has been broken, not once but three times now by the love of my life. I guess I'm a bit of a control freak because I can't let go, I can't let him go, but this time he's really gone. I try to stay busy, avoid things that make me think of him, but I feel empty inside. I am constantly fighting off tears and when these large pockets of emptiness hit me, they hit me hard. I'm left with no spark to life and no meaning. I have lost direction in life. I don't even know what I want for the future anymore. I want him to come back, like he did twice before, but I'm slowly starting to realize that's it's really over this time. He doesn't want me anymore and I don't know how to cope with that. I feel like I'm forcing myself to keep moving forwards everyday. I'm so lost.
