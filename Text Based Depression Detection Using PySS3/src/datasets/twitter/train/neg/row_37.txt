I don't know where to goI've been homeless for Going on 2 nights in seattle. I don't know where to go, I have no friends or family here. I'm stranded, walking in the city and looking at all the people. I just wanna be gone. I am lost here and I just want the pain to end. I know I am not being smart about this, but I don't know where to go anymore. I feel so lost physically and mentally. I feel detached from everyone... I feel like this is my last day on this planet. Time just goes so slow when you have no where to go. Then the night comes and I am afraid to close my eyes. Is it even  worth trying to get back up?
