I ruined my own lifeHello Iâ€™m 19 now . I wish I had something better to say but I just felt as if I needed to tell someone of my actual pain . A year ago today I was at community college and lived on campus.Nobody knew this but i didnâ€™t deserve to be their . I didnâ€™t make good grades in high school but Iâ€™m not the type to take no for an answer. So right before graduation  I looked up school that had dorms available for incoming freshman. I attended and began the pre medical course . Little did Ik I was not really ready. I  was extremely passionate but I just wasnâ€™t ready for all those classes. But never did I say  anything I just let myself kind of fall into a pit . That I didnâ€™t even notice I fell into to . But I did meet a person and heâ€™s cool , but me being so depressed I messed it up twice now we are just friend . I had to leave the school . I was kicked out . Now a year later I am miserable I wish it was another way to describe it but Iâ€™m just plain ole miserable. I wish I was dead . Everyday . I think about that school and the happinesses it brought me . I was never that happy until I was their . I  was overflowing with happiness. Now itâ€™s hard for me to leave the house because all everyone wants to do is talk about school. I cry everyday longing for a change to go back but I canâ€™t I ruined my life . Now Iâ€™m begging in school   , the guy lives far away and Iâ€™m deeply depressed . Also how can I be scared to die but at the same time want to . Not only that but I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll ever be ok . And this may sound crazy but this one thing has really changed me
