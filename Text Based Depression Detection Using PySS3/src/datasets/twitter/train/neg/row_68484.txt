I'm worthlessI am utterly worthless. I'm no better than a child and the only way to move past that is to admit it but I fucking can't handle how low and irresponsible I've become. I just want it all to fucking end. Any hint of being a functional adult makes me want to shut down. I can't do this and I won't. I'm weak. I'm fucking pathetic.
