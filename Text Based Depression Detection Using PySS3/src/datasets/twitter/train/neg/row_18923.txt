You are patheticEven if you are the worst human being and everyone will smile when you finally die, what is the point that some randoms would say  something good, randoms â€” who don't even know how shit are you, and actually, don't have other choice to say to you, lol)))0)0 ... It's like chatting with a bot that says a good things for you, or when someone is polite and saying good things only because they have to or for culture...

And even if you can for a second think that you can be worse I was,  there would be yet another pit, where there won't be anything. You won't be able to do anything, even whim like you always did. You will lose every single thought from your head watching yourself deteriorate and other leave you because you are now not only the worst, but a completely useless. Just don't let this happen to you while you can...
