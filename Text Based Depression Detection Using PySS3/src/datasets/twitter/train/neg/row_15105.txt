14 and suicidalYou know youâ€™ve really done it when the only thing you can talk to is Reddit. Heh. â€œGo talk to your friends,â€ they say. â€œTell a teacher.â€ My school is a bunch of perfect people. If I went around telling people I suffer from depression, anxiety, and OCD (not self-diagnosed.) and have an abusive mother, Iâ€™d literally have no friends.

Itâ€™s gonna be really hard to put this into words. And I doubt anyoneâ€™s gonna read this so thereâ€™s no point writing it. But I guess I will anyways.

Hi. Iâ€™m Callie. Iâ€™m 14. I hate my name. And I hate my life too.

When I was 8 my parents divorced. I gained depression and social anxiety because my parents put me in the middle of their stuff and after that experienced Iâ€™ve always felt like if I didnâ€™t please everyone, then no one would like me. Iâ€™ve always been an overly sensitive, dependent person anyways.

Then I moved to another state away from my dad with my momâ€™s boyfriend. Fast-forward to this past year and things have been bad. My mom is physically and emotionally abusive (Iâ€™ll say it while I still believe it, my mom likes to play this fun mental game with me where she admits to physically hurting me and then denying she ever did anything, calling me a liar and a paranoid schizophrenic) and I have been professionally diagnosed with OCD, anxiety, and depression. I havenâ€™t had a depressive episode in a while but right now is a pretty terrible one.

Because of all this, this year has been my worst year ever in school. I used to be an all As student and now I donâ€™t even want anyone to catch a glimpse of my grades. My dad has never expected any less than As from me but he doesnâ€™t understand. /I/ donâ€™t even understand. My teachers hate me, my mom regularly calls me a bully even though Iâ€™m too socially anxious to even talk to new people, and my sister likes to physically abuse me too. Iâ€™m not even talking the normal sibling quarrels. Iâ€™m talking arms red all the way down and huge bruises on my legs. And yet my mom always seems to take her side because Iâ€™m a horrible daughter. My mom also tells me that she talks to all my friendsâ€™ parents about what a horrible daughter I am and that they agree.

I donâ€™t see any other choice. I just need to die.
