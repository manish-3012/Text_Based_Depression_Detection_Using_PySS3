I feel like I am slowly rotting away.I have been depressed for years.  Ever since I was like 8 years old.  It wasn't my fault really.  A combination of Family issues and bullying through most if school until the 8th got to me. I got this far but I don't think it's worth it anymore.  All I have been doing is attempting to heal myself only to dive head first into more pain. I don't feel some of my emotions anymore or at least I am numb.  I fantasize about death like it's a godsend but I want it to be comfortable.  So, I hesitate because the right conditions haven't been met yet.  I have trust issues, anxiety, and depression.  I can't stay happy for too long and I want to die every few hours.  The things that made me happy don't have much impact anymore.  My last years of highschool didn't help either.  I thought I had friends but no one spoke to me or talked to me of their own volition.  It made me lonely and my mother told me to just get over it and to stop making myself upset.  She just runs away when I get upset waiting it out until I solve all my problems by myself.  I hated her for a reason and know I know she is scum.  She hasn't changed over the few times I have gone to therapy and she only tries to hide my condition entirely benefit herself. I have no allies at home. 

I would argue that over the years bullies and my family have relatively been the same.  I felt unsafe at home and unsafe at school.  I only felt safe in my thoughts and they betray me.  For my family everything was my fault and my claims of being suicidal were for attention but it's their fault I got this way and I damn them on my eventual deathbed. 

Telling me I am selfish for wanting to die is hypocritical because it's selfish to want me to suffer through being alive just so you won't feel bad I died.
