Second post here, I just can't get betterI posted here before explaining my situation, I received some great feedback that helped a lot but I'm afraid the feeling has gone away and the thoughts have returned again. I try to receive help from friends but I just get ignored. The fact that tye things I have been thinking about myself have been affirmed by the way others have responded to me. I have spoken to a doctor about my depression but due to current gealth issues, I cannot go on antidepressants. I feel completely alonr in this, my friends and family won't help me, my doctor can't help me. I feel like I've already arrived at the end.
