Done.Iâ€™m so fucking tired of always feeling sad and useless. Nobody even fucking cares about me. I could go days without saying anything and no one will notice. I even went as far as to delete every social media app off my phone for a week and came back with no messages from anybody. Not even a text/call. I donâ€™t want to hear â€œyou matterâ€ or â€œsomebody loves youâ€ because itâ€™s bullshit. Iâ€™m fucking done I donâ€™t want to be here anymore. Everyday I scramble to think of something to keep me busy in between work and school just so I donâ€™t feel depressed or like the useless sack of nothing I am. Fucking hate myself and my life. I donâ€™t think I can do this any longer.
