Public humiliationMy wife went through my phone and found a lot of embarrassing posts on reddit (hence the newer account) and decided to wake me up with an aluminum bat to my leg, only after taking screenshots of many of my posts and DMs.

She proceeded to send the screenshots to much of my family and hers,  then post the worst of them to MY snapchat story and send it too every one of my snapchat contacts.

I had been asking her to see a relationship counselor with me for some time. She wouldn't.

I'm more angry than embarrassed. 

Now I can't stop thinking about saying fuck it and pulling the plug.

I've started therapy alone. I have a lot of my own issues to work on, but every  time I think about what she sent for so many people to see I just want to blow my fucking brains out right in front of her just in spite.

I don't know how to get over this.
