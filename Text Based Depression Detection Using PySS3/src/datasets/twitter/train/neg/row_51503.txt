I think my ex gf its going to kill herself. I need helpShe was deeply in love with a guy in  senior year who killed himself 2 years ago. That left her psychologically scarred. Months after this guy's death we started dating and we were together for 2 years until she broke the relationship saying that she didnt love me like she used to. We stayed friends, since she is a classmate and I have to see her everyday, so we try to get along. She never got over that guy, even after almost 3 years after he commited suicide. She writes in wattpad, an app for sharing amateur novels and literature, and she is publishing a poem book dedicated to the guy I mentioned. Based on what she writes, its obvious that she is in a deep depression, even after all this time, and she says many things that refer to her own death. She talks about 'jumping into the abyss' or 'joining him (the other guy) in the darkness'. Its very hard for me to talk with her about this, since she never liked to touch the subject while we were together. Im planning to talk with her best friend to see if he can do something about it. The anxiety and the fear are consuming me. I cant spend more than 5 minutes without thinking about it. I already got over our relationship, but i love her as a friend and i am very worried. Please. I need help.
