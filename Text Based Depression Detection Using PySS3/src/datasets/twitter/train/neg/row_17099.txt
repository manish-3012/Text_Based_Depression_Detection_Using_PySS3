Has-been failure of life.I'm 31, and I've had constant suicidal feelings since I have been 12. This is because my mother abused and neglected me, I was also distant at school and was physically bullied for this.

This is not making excuses for my lack of contributions to society. In fact, i feel dreadful for such a thing, and feel like Iâ€™m taking up valuable space on this Earth for someone with a naturally confident personality. I've never even managed to hold down even one menial job. I wouldn't mind but I am naturally very smart, but at the same time I have very severe mental illnesses. 

Living a normal productive life where I contribute to society is almost impossible for me, and I'm smart enough to recognize that. So why then is it that suicide is generally seen as a negative option? In my scenario this is **NOT** â€œa permanent solution to a temporary problemâ€. This illness will ALWAYS be there, like my brain is punishing me for having these dreadful things happen, and I simply can no longer reconcile that.

I don't even feel as if i'm looking for any of you to help me, as much as I appreciate the sentiment. I just feel like this is me getting off my mind and explaining to someone (anyone) WHY this is a thing that I feel I have to do.
