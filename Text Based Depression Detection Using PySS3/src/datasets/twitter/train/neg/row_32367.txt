I am so pissedEver feel so pissed with someone you just wanna end it. I just feel like I will do it if triggered by it. Like what the fuck is so hard with raising your kid right. Not pressuring them all the fucking time. Not forcing them on social situations. Not faking symptoms to the doctor so that my situation isn't taken seriously. Like fuck. I am so pissed.
