Would greatly appreciate a bit of advice from you great people :)tl;dr should I tell a suicidal friend that I attempted suicide before, and that I consider it the biggest mistake of my life to help stop him from trying?

Long story short, someone I care for tried shrooms and they messed up his mind (extreme suicidal ideation, doesn't experience rest from sleep, terrified that he'll be like this forever, among other symptoms). He was voluntarily admitted to a psychiatric hospital for 72 hours and is still there. Unknown to him, last year I attempted suicide (which I consider the biggest mistake of my life) and was wondering if it has a higher chance of helping or harming him to reveal that to him, kind of like an "I've been there too" comment. Any advice would be appreciated.

And as a sidenote, I personally don't need help, I've mostly got my depression under control, which is amazing to feel. Anyone who's reading this, I hope you have a bit of hope, because I didn't and was dead wrong.
