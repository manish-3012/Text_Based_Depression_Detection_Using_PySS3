Not used to this, thought I'd try it on the interwebsThe only people that know of my suicidal tendencies is my closest family.  I was unaware of this subreddit until r/askreddit told me.  I now realize asking how to kill myself without making it look like suicide is ridiculous.  Even as I write this I realize how much of an attention whore I sound, maybe I'm just drunk.  I can't inform my therapist of my intentions because I know I will be baker-acted.  I can't tell my parents or brother because I knoow they will intervene in anyway they can which will make me even more embarrassed to know they know my thoughts.  At first I just wanted to know how to do myself in without making it look like suicide.  But I'm such a goddamn douche...I don't know, maybe someone in the world could tell me something I don't know rather than try to institutionalize me or shove pills down my throat.
