I feel like I shouldnâ€™t have lived for so longI donâ€™t expect anyone to read my sob story. But thank you if you did. 

Since a young age i knew i would die young. I struggled with depression since i was 11 or 12 due to my narcissistic and abusive parents. Iâ€™ve tried to end it before i turned 14 by falling off a tree i climbed. I climbed it so fucking often. Iâ€™ve had so much pressure on me since i was young. Best grades, best appareance, best behaviour. Never talk about problems. I begged any higher entity to end me because i couldnâ€™t do it properly. A fucking coward. My whole family and relatives put such high expectations on me.  Iâ€™m 21 now. And thatâ€™s past the lifetime i expected for me. I honestly thought iâ€™d never make it past 19. I was happy to think iâ€™ve never make it past 19. Since then something just completely died inside of me and it gets worse. Iâ€™ve been forced to have a high paying job to support my family so i chose what was most bearable for me. But after 4 years i cant do it anymore. My parents kicked me out with 17 but still expect me to do everything for them since they donâ€™t speak the language here. I get panic attacks everytime i see family or relatives calling. My dad caught the virus and has been in the hospital since march. He almost died. I begged god to take me instead. I told him to take everything from me and give it to my dad. Iâ€™ve been assigned the legal guardian of my dad since nobody else in my family could do it. I have so much to do. So many calls, so much debt, so many court calls. My mom is not appreciating anything i do. My sister is 17 and she is expected to do nothing. My mom guilt trips me to do the most simplest stuff like go to appointments with her. For the lockdown i worked in homeoffice and i felt so relieved. I love my colleagues but hate my job. I have to go back now and i canâ€™t. I have insomnia and havenâ€™t slept for months. If i do fall asleep i wake up with a panic attack. I want this all to end. Iâ€™ve put on so much weight. I feel so heavy and dead inside. The only reason i havenâ€™t done it yet is my boyfriend. He is the light of my life and helps me so much. But i burden him with my problems just as much and i donâ€™t want that. I think he deserves better. It would be better to just go. I donâ€™t care if i go to hell or to nothingness. I already feel like iâ€™m in hell. I canâ€™t being myself to cut so i starve. My therapist gave up on me. Last time he got so fed up and got aggressive and it scared me. Four years iâ€™ve been there. I guess iâ€™m hopeless. The only way for me to go would be to poison myself since my psychiatrist or doc donâ€™t want to give me sleeping pills. Iâ€™ve laid out my plans. I can get the stuff since itâ€™s just berries that grow locally that are highly toxic and deadly in the right amount. I donâ€™t need to worry about my belongings they will be gone and my flat is cancled by my landlord anyways. I know a place i would like to do it. Iâ€™m on my last string. My boyfriend said it will get all better. We will live together and i can change my workplace. He is so sweet. And iâ€™m just a burden. I donâ€™t know why he likes me so much. He deserves better. But i donâ€™t want to hurt him. Iâ€™m so sorry.
