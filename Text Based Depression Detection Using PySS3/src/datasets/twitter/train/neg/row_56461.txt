Help! Friend in England!Iâ€™m messaging someone I found on Reddit. They said theyâ€™ve attempted an overdose. But I live in America. Their Name is Sophie and they live in Bristol. Iâ€™ve heard stories of reddit saving lives before and Iâ€™m praying it can work this way too. Idk if I can call the England emergency services because Iâ€™m in America. But please someone if you can do something with that info please send help or call.
