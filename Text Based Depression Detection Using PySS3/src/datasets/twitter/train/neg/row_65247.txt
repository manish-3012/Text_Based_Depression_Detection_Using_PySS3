I thought Of ending it but donâ€™t know howI am a 13 yr old boy living in Dubai.Iâ€™m not from Dubai but I live in it.So I go to an international school with a British curriculum and British teachers an all,but the majority of the students are Arabs.i started going to this school a few months back so you could say that Iâ€™m new to it.The best part is that Iâ€™ve only been here for 2-3 months and already getting bullied, like really badly.Iâ€™m being insulted for being short and being darkish brown.Iâ€™m being called names for being Indian and for being a guy who actually CARES about his grades.People call me names for no reason and they insult my family and sister(sheâ€™s my weak spot).i have no friends and I am socially awkward.No one likes me and at night I think about all the things theyâ€™ve called me and the times I have disappointed my family and I just cry my self to sleep.I know, I know  iâ€™m Weak but thatâ€™s the way I am I guess. My whole family hates me and I hate them(except my younger sister) Iâ€™m already sad and have family problems and I have to deal with these Arab boys insulting me for not being Muslim or not being an Arab.These gang of like 50 Arab boys pretty much rule the school grounds. Now iâ€™m NOT saying that all of them are this way but I just canâ€™t take it. Me and everybody else are afraid to stand up for ourselves and when we do we just get beaten down. So my question to u Is How do I kill myself painlessly? I canâ€™t have guns and have no rope.Thanks for your replies :)
