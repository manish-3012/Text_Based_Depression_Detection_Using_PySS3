Insecure and horribleI am very insecure.  I need constant assurance and validation.  I am acutely aware of how I act but am powerless to stop how I feel.  If a friend talks to another friend, I get insecure, feeling I've been abandoned.

It's soo stupid, and I really despise myself for feeling like this and acting like this. I'm so close to texting everyone saying I'm going to end it all, sorry for everything.

I'm supposed to be better than this. I'm 46, I'm supposed to be mature.
