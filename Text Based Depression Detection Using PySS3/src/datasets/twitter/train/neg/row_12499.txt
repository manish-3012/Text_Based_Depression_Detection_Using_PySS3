Did I just save a life?I was taking a drive at night just now and I was on my way home. I saw a shadow of a person on the bridge. I get this feeling all over that I need to talk to this person. I turn around and called out to her. Well call her (B). I asked B if she was ok and if she wanted to talk. She told me she was just having a bad day and she was fine. I told her I had no where else to be. She again said she was fine and she thanked me. So... I left. I started driving and I couldnâ€™t shake the feeling that I should go and seriously talk to her. So I turned around and parked close by and walked towards the bridge. I didnâ€™t see her anywhere and I was starting to get nervous. When I saw her I started up a conversation. B told me about her being trapped in a relationship with her bf and we shared some of our life storyâ€™s. We talked for a long time. When we started to leave the bridge she hugged me. I gave her the best hug I could. 

B if youâ€™re reading this I really hope youâ€™re situation gets better and know i care about youâ¤ï¸
