Tried to reach out, felt unwanted, can't expressI don't really know what to do with myself anymore. I'm ready to flounder the only good opportunity I worked really hard for the past four years. I'm perfectly ambivalent about it. I feel like I don't want to live and I'm looking for excuses to end it. 
  
I just don't feel connected to anyone anymore.   
I can't see myself in the past or future any longer,   
I feel guilty about any interaction with others.  
I hate everything I stand for and can't even recognize what I stand for at all.  
Days are just timeless and moments just steps of fear I have to climb often to the same mistakes I make over and over again.  
I fear no one cares or that I can't care, I feel like I can't express any of this to anyone, even myself.   
I'm on a waiting list for help but shit what I might do before then. is sinking in hard.   
  
  
I want help but I don't want to call for help.   
  
I...I'm... I don't know anymore.
