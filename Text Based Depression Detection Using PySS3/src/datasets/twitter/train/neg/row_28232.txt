SeethingIm angry. Idk at what. At myself the most of all maybe. Im angry that when I want to say what i want to say it got taken away from me. Im angry that i couldnt directly tell anyone to stop making me upset. Im angry that strangers are out there judging me. Im angry that im used. Im angry that noã…¡ IM ANGRY. IM JUST ANGRY. and im crying. 

And i want to die. Isnt it magnificent that cats just get depressed and could pass just like so. Im just so angry at the happenings in these few days past that i just cant. I dont even know. I dont azfudhdvsn URGHHHH. It's unfair. The world is unfair. And what's pathetic i cant even say i deserve to feel okay. Im just so. Im angry. And sad. I mostly hate that someone that traumatised me is still out there just gaining support while if i die right here, id just be a number. 

Im a nobody. Unlike that person. If i die the world wouldnt lose anything. Theres just a replacement somewhere. Out there. It doesnt matter. It's just upsetting I couldnt just die. I don't want to live anymore. I just want to die. 1
