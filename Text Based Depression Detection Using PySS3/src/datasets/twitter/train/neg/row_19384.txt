I am subhuman trashI donâ€™t want to do anything with my life. The only thing I want to do is commit suicide and finally end everything. I have zero value as a person and I do not want to contribute to the world. The only thing Iâ€™ll ever contribute to in life is the suicide statistics. 

I am 18 years old and I am convinced life will only get worse as you progress through adulthood. Iâ€™d rather die right this second than live through an entire lifetime of misery. I wish I was never even born. The world doesnâ€™t need lazy sacks of shit like me. I have zero desire to put effort towards improving myself. Might as well just commit suicide and do the world a favor
