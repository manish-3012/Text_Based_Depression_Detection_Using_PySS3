I can't find a reason to livei hate everything about who i am and no matter how hard i try to change myself i cant. i wish i could just start over redo my life all i ever did with this one was make mistakes and cause pain. and frankly i just don't like living anymore. i'm able to imagine a perfect scenario where life is different and i'm happy but that world is a million miles away and i'm confident in saying no matter how hard i try in this life i will never see that world.
