There is no point in continuingI've never had a job and will likely never find one with the pandemic  
I feel like a shell pretending to be human  
I know what I wanna be, but I will never have the funds or mental strength to get there.  
My brain has so many stupid self imposed rules that keep me from being "myself" (if he even exists)  


Why waste resources?  
I'm not allowed to be depressed because I "have it too good" (according to my mind)  


Why exist?
