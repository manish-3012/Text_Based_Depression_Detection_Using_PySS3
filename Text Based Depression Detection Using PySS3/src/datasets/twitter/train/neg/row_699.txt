Itâ€™s 5:30pm where I am. Iâ€™m killing myself by 10pmThereâ€™s no complete way to explain why this is my only option. Iâ€™ve tried everything I could to get better, but I just get more and more depressed. When I thought it couldnâ€™t get any worse, it did. Life shit on me and then shit on me again. I have no doubt that so many people have it worse than I do. I know this makes me weak. But it doesnâ€™t make a difference anymore. I canâ€™t do it. Iâ€™ve tried. Iâ€™m so sorry.
