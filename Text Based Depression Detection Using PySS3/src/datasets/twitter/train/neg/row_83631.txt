Most of the time I just wanna go to sleep and never wake upIâ€™ve got to the point where this is just what I want to do..... I mean Iâ€™ve become so anti social, I might seem selfish but Iâ€™m struggling with other people attitude. I was brought up to be compassionate and to mind my Ps and Qs yet the more people I meet the less I see this. Itâ€™s more of a case of every man for himself. Whereâ€™s the humanity gone. Iâ€™m not talking about protests for this that and whatever Iâ€™m talking about just basic manners for fucks sake
