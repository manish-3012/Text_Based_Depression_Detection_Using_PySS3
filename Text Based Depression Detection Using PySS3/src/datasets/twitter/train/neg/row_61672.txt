My parents are forcing me to go back to university after two dropouts and a suicide attempt.Title pretty much says it all. I attempted suicide on campus during my second year of university. My university years have been the worst years of my life and I fell into an abyss. But no. I have to go back. I have to go back to that place with my heavy social anxiety and intense bpd and face it all again because a degree is more important than their daughter being alive. Maybe I should just take the choice out of their hands.
