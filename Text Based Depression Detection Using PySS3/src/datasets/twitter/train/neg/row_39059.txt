I'm sick of this.I've been contemplating suicide for days. Weeks. Months. I've tried many times in the past. 
I can't keep living this "life". 
I'm not even alive. Just existing.
Constantly I'm bombardes with traumatic memories. 
I'm always alone and I have no friends. Talking to people online doesn't feel the same. I haven't had an irl friend in 4 years. 
My parents don't care. My dad gets pissed. My mom knows I've been depressed and instead of giving me a break she tells me to finish my schoolwork. She says its the most important thing right now.
My grades won't matter when I'm dead.
The person I loved was abusive but she gets to live a happy life.
I'm so damn frustrated. I don't want to be alive anymore.
If I try again and I mess up I'll be put in a hospital. My parents will be FURIOUS. 
If I call for help I'll have my phone taken away.
Hotlines don't help anyway. 

NOTHING I DO MAKES SENSE AND EVERY CHOICE I MAKE IS PAINFUL. I WANT IT ALL TO STOP.
