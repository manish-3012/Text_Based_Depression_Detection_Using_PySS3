not afraid of deathI've never been afraid of death in my waking life, but I dreamt about dying the other day and I was terrified in my dream.. I remember being so mortified of dying and not knowing what's next that I was shaking... when I woke up it went back to me not being afraid..
I've always known I'm gonna die young, I'm too depressed to keep on living.. can't see the positive side of anything.
