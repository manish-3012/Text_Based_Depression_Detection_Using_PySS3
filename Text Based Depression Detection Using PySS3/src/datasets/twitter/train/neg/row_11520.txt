iâ€™m killing myself tomorrowthis feels weird to write and NOT have a throwaway account or something like that. if you search my history here on reddit, I make posts on jacksepticeye and things like that. mundane things. but thatâ€™s because Iâ€™ve been fighting SO hard... so fucking hard to just... be happy. one minute of happiness. iâ€™d settle with that. so iâ€™d know what itâ€™s like. so i could have something to strive for. but itâ€™s not there. 

people canâ€™t tell though. I have my â€˜happy maskâ€™ that makes it look like things are okay. but theyâ€™re not. and trust me when i say Iâ€™ve tried literally everything to make them okay. 

most recently was moving to the opposite side of the country to try a â€˜fresh startâ€™. but it just reminded me of everything that everyone else had and what I didnâ€™t. so I ran. literally. this evening a have a shift at the hostel that I volunteer at in turn for staying there. but instead i got in my car, took the last $150 out of account (I would have never been enough for food for the month anyways...), and just drove. i got on a ferry and am headed to a random island. thereâ€™s no way now Iâ€™d ever be able to make it back in time for my shift. theyâ€™ll notice Iâ€™m missing (and literally just left all my shit on there). but it doesnâ€™t matter. 

thereâ€™s an amazing park on the island with a cool abandoned train trestle in it, and I have some good rope in my car. 

my mum passed away a year and a half ago; we were really closeâ€” so it makes me happy to think of seeing her soon.
