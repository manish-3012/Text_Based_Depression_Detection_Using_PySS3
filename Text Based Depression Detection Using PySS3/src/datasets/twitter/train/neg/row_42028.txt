Depression.I consider myself a little bit stronger than most people. Not killing yourself by the age or thirty after being depressed for the last seventeen years is something to be proud of. At least thatâ€™s my opinion. The problem is even if i make to 101....i wonâ€™t be considered a survivor seeing as how Iâ€™m a man and men arenâ€™t allowed to be depressed. No one believes us.
