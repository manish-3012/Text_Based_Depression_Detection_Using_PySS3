about to lose my shitcollege is hard, i have a good grade right now in biology but it doesnt matter. because no matter how hard i try i fucking suck and my brain doesnt retain jack shit of what i just read. my boyfriend who's poly has been streaming with his boyfriend on his days off even though he said wed talk more. i dont fucking blame him, im not even interesting at all. i knew i would eventually be replaced anyway, who the fuck wants to hang out with someone like me. he doesnt even want to text me at night anymore like we used to. im being left behind and im stupid enough to try to think its not actually happening. i hate this, i hate being who i am, i hate existing. im so tired all i want to do is sleep. im just tired. i want to give up on everything. i hate myself
