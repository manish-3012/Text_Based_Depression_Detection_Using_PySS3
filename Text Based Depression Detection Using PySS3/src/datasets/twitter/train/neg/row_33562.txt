No where else to share my problems.Monday afternoon I took a bunch of pills and I messaged a few of my family telling them I felt suicidal. They seemed to care when I was talking to them, but since then not one of them has bothered to ring me asking how I am. So do they really care? My brother just thinks there's nothing wrong with me and it's taken a long time for my family to actually help me. I have no friends to talk to and I don't even that special someone to keep me going. Maybe not today, or next week, but one day I'm afraid that I'm going to take my own life. And I'm not sure what it is, but I think I might have having angina attacks which started two weeks ago.
