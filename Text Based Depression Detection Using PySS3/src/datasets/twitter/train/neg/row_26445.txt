I'm not depressed I'm angryMy suicidal thoughts have evolved from being depressed to just being anger towards life. It's not the same as when your sad . This is much darker. I could never harm a soul. But I don't know how to continue to go on. I turn 21 on 9/14 . Life is just starting but is it honestly worthit? I can't control my feelings anymore I just want people to support me/my actions I feel like I have nothing to live for.
 I recently been able to distract myself with a couple of hobbies but the thoughts are still there. I need people to talk to. Anyone
