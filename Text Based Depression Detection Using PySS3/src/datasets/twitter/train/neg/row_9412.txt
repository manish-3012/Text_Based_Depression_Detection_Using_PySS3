Lost ImageI think I saw it when browsing imgur, but it was a few years ago (or longer). I think it was a Tumblr post? They spoke of how if you wanted to commit suicide you should go do something meaningful in dangerous places, like volunteering in war torn places. Or go do the things you were too afraid to do, like sky diving. The worst that could happen is you die, the best is that you discover a reason to live.

I found it very helpful, even though I can't remember it very well anymore. If someone has it saved or can do a better Google search than me could you post it? Maybe someone else will find it helpful. I know it can't help everyone but maybe it can help just one more person.
