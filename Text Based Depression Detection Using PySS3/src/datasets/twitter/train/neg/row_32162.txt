Nothing I do matters to anyoneI've been really depressed lately. I'm failing the majority of my classes, I have about two acquaintances but they probably hate me, my parents think I'm a disappointment. I've been depressed for as long as I can remember. Have been self harming for months. Why not just end it all?
