When I was younger I was at a window on the 2nd floor of our house, contemplating whether I should jump.It was probably childish, as I cannot remember the reasoning, but I know it was because of something my dad said. I went to the bathroom on the 2nd level, upset. I opened a window and wanted to jump because of what i was feeling. 

And in came my dad. He laughed, mocked me and left. And I really think that kinda fucked me up.
