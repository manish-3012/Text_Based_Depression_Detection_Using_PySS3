I just want to die already.Iâ€™ve never been lonelier than I have been now. Iâ€™m tired of being sad. I know a lot of other people have much bigger problems. But I just feel like Iâ€™m going to put a bullet in my head soon. Iâ€™m just over it. I have good friends. But I canâ€™t shake the feeling. Iâ€™m never good enough for women to take me seriously even though Iâ€™m handsome as hell. Iâ€™ve never been loved by anyone besides my sister. I think that itâ€™s just my destiny to kill myself. I just lost my motivation to be happy.
