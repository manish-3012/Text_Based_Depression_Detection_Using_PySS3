Took 10x my prescriptionI took myself off meds about a month ago, I donâ€™t like being on them, they make me too numb. Was doing okay and feeling again but last night i had a mental break down. Woke up this morning in pain from my sadness so I took 1000 mg of Zoloft to feel something other than sad. Maybe Iâ€™ll take more, maybe I wonâ€™t.
