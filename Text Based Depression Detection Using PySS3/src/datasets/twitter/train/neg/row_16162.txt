Why bother?Why bother continuing to grind through the slog when weâ€™re all destined to die? Why bother advance a career, when all the data shows your ceiling is determined by the circumstances of your birth? Why bother rising in the morning, to spend an entire day under the thumb of others? Why bother choosing, when all the choices we have are limited and dictated by the powerful?

Why bother living? Iâ€™ve yet to hear even a reasonable response.
