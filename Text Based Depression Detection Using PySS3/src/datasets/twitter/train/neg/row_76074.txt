How long does therapy usually take to work?I know it depends on person a lot, but after what time it is okay/time to just finally give up?
It's really my last resort now and anything else isn't even nearly working, because going for a jog etc, is not gonna make my life any better, and it keeps getting worse day by day.

Starting therapy in ~2 weeks.
