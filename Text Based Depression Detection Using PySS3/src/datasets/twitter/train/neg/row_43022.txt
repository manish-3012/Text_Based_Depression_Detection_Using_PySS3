I plan on killing myself tomorrowI'm 15 years old/sophomore in highschool and I decided to kill myself at around 5 or 6 pm today. I understand that it's a selfish decision, will hurt those around me and I've spent the past few hours writing letters (all positive) to my parents, aunts/uncles, teachers, and friends. Maybe about 16 people in all. Basically saying goodbye to them and telling them that there's no way they could've known and nothing they could've done. 

I hope to lessen a lot of the guilt that they may feel. That's probably the best I can do.

Here's the ending of a letter to one of my teachers who I'm close with:

&gt;Mr. Martin:
I feel as though you will most understand where I'm coming from, and will be saddened by it. I'm sorry, there's no way you could've known or nothing you could've done.

**Why am I committing suicide?**

I've had odd suicidal thoughts for the past few months (years actually, just been more frequent these months). In the recent months loneliness, bad choices (on my part/purely my fault) which led to horrible grades, and curiosity have gone up.

Loneliness:

I can hold a conversation, be funny, be sociable in a new environment, etc. In some classes the teachers love me, and I often make funny comments that everyone laughs at (even the teacher) and the moods lightened.

Ex. 

[English Teacher is discussing a father/son story, room is quiet] 

Teacher: Now none of you have children right? (obviously rhetorical) 
Me: I'll wait and see in 9 months. 
Class + Teacher laughs for a few minutes, jokes are had, etc.

I also have tons of acquaintances, people who I'll talk and joke with during classes but only 1 good friend at school. Weekends are spent alone at home with family, I'm ok with that worse things have happened. But the odd pangs of loneliness have become more frequent.

**Bad Choices**

In middle school my main motivation to do well was fear of my parents yelling at me. In highschool, with my parents not checking my grades I've had periods of me losing all motivation for school and grades dropping to b's, c's, and d's. I've failed algebra2/trig honors this year and will have to retake it over the summer. I fell into the cycle of not doing hw (thus not learning), bombing tests, promising myself i'll study over the weekend, weekend comes, no hw done, bomb test, repeat. My parents don't know yet and I'm sure they'll be mad. 

There'll probably be several fun filled days of them yelling, trying to guilt trip me about the $9k they spend a year (i go to private school) when I even asked to go to a public school last year so they could save money...

**Curiosity:**

I'm fairly curious about death. I don't fear it or view it as a bad thing. To me it's just atoms rearranging in such a way that life no longer continues. The negative emotions we often feel b/c of death are products of evolution. 

&gt;Death does not concern us, because as long as we exist, death is not here. And when it does come, we no longer exist. 

Epikuros

That quote would probably best explain my view on death. My view on life is a lot more elaborate but can be summed down into:

You're born, you do stuff, and you die. You can either find beauty and happiness in life or hate it. Create or destroy, it's your choice. 

I'm also very curious as to what'll happen after death. Will it be the same as before I was born/no consciousness + peace? Will I wake up in Hades? etc. 

Anyway:

**Tl;dr**

Slightly depressed teen (that's rare) planning on committing suicide tomorrow. I thought I might post here and see if I can be convinced otherwise.
