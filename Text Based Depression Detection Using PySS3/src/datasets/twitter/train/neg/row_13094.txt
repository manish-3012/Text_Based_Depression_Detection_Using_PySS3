Feeling Suicidal. I hate posting here because I feel weak but I canâ€™t stand this anymore. Iâ€™m sorry.Iâ€™m sorry Iâ€™ll try to keep this as short as possible:


Iâ€™ve just been feeling terrible as of late (again), Iâ€™ve been doing Xanax and a bunch of other pills and skipping my Bipolar Meds/Sleep Meds and I havenâ€™t taken them in about 1-2 months.i used to post here all the time but I deleted my posts in a burst of manic energy (sadly. Iâ€™ve been heavily considering self harm and Iâ€™ve been thinking very dark things as of recent, and I donâ€™t see myself living past 36 at the absolute most. Iâ€™ve endured extensive trauma through my life, I was raped twice, Iâ€™ve been kidnapped as a child and I was beaten throughout most of my childhood and Iâ€™ve been hospitalized on 3 separate occasions for suicidal thoughts, behaviors, and urges. Iâ€™ve been in 3 psychiatric wards (if you couldnâ€™t tell), all at 16, which is an absolute shame. Iâ€™m sorry this is so short but Iâ€™m too sad to really elaborate In extreme detail but if anyone cares thanks in advance. I left out a ton but hopefully this is enough.
