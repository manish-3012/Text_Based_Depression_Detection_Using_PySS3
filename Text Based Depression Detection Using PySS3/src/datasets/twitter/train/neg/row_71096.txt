Considering actual suicide for the first timeIn the past, I've thought about it. Suicide ideation, I guess. But I knew I would never do it.

But now I really do feel like I want to do it. I'm just so unhappy. I've been unhappy for 10 years. I'm too shy, too quiet, too introverted. That changed for a little bit and I met a girl who I thought had fallen in love with me, since she said she wanted to marry me and sent me pictures of baby clothes, but I blew that somehow and I don't know how. Probably by being too quiet.

I just feel like I'm there, like I'm invisible and nobody will be interested in me because why would they? I feel boring. That's probably why my gf split up with me too. I just had nothing to say to her anymore. In fact, I even said to her "I feel like I'm boring you when I'm like this and have nothing to say."

All my insecurities ruined what was the best thing that ever happened to me.

Now it's like The Shins song New Slang..."I'm looking in at the good life I might be doomed never to find."

Once my parents are gone, apart from my sister, I'm just going to be alone.
