I want to jump off a bridge tonight.Itâ€™s been my â€œback upâ€ plan since I was 15 years old. Almost ten years. My momâ€™s boyfriend explained to me that thereâ€™s a dam underneath. So if you fall in, you get sucked under the water and pushed to the bottom of the river until you drown. Other people have died there. On purpose and by accident. Iâ€™ve been thinking about it for a very long time. Iâ€™ve even driven over there and looked down into the rushing water when things have been really bad, but Iâ€™ve always backed out. Iâ€™m ready now.
