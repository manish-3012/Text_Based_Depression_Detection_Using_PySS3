Sure there will be people who will miss me, but they'll get over it and be happier in the long run.I'm not adding much to anyone's life. Most of what I hear is criticism. No one acknowledges anything that I do well. All I hear is what I'm doing wrong. My family is upset over the things that are wrong or imperfect in my life and are really upset that I'm unhappy. As if I can just snap out of it. They make me feel like garbage to try to motivate me, but it only makes me feel worse.

If I'm gone, there won't be anyone to be upset over. My depression won't bother anyone. Problem solved. I won't be a burden to them with my flaws. 

I think I might drive off a cliff. It'll be poetic because the last argument I had with my family was over which car I'm going to get. They were upset that I didn't care what I drive as long as it works. Or I might take the full bottle of antidepressants that have for sure stopped working.
