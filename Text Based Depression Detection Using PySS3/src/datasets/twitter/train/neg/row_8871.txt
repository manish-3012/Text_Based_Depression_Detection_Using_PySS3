Thinking about distracting myself from suicide. I'm thinking about writing a romance story to distract myself from suicidal thoughts. I suffer from bipolar disorder and am about to seek help. But it is difficult in South Korea to get immediate help- I have to wait until Wednesday. I feel like I am going to kill myself if I don't find a distraction. But if I write and fantasize romance, will it disappoint me? It's about an overworked, depressed person finding a soul mate who can help him out. But from what I've learned, romanticism can bring greater hurts. In reality, people are different in real life than some stupid romance stories. People can't for each other's needs, and they can bring greater disappointments in real life. But what the hey- how much a disappointment cost? I think being turned hurts a lot less than suicide, right?
