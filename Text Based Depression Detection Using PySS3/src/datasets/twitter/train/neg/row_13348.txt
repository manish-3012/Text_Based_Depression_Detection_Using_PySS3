Iâ€™ve made plans but I want to have hope for happinessHi. The title says it all. I have plans to kill myself but I want to believe I can still live a happy life. Iâ€™ve attempted twice and ended up in hospitals both times. But Iâ€™m just so hurt and hopeless that if I do it Iâ€™ll make sure it works this time. Basically what Iâ€™m saying is, can anyone
encourage me? Iâ€™d love that
