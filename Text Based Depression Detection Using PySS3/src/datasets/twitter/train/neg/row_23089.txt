my life is a wasteIâ€™m not really sure how much information is generally acceptable in these posts but since Iâ€™m feeling this way for a lot of reasons I think itâ€™d be easiest to start with some background. Iâ€™m twenty years old and in my third year of college and I havenâ€™t done anything meaningful with my life. Iâ€™ve been ostracized by peers for as long as I can remember and Iâ€™m trapped in a cycle of social anxiety that prevents me from being anything more than acquaintances with others. I canâ€™t get a jobâ€”I canâ€™t even get volunteer positionsâ€”and I live with my parents and am financially dependent on them. I feel like calling me a â€œloserâ€ would be generous.

Iâ€™m also struggling because I recently came out to my family and some relatives havenâ€™t taken it as well as Iâ€™d expected; one of them became very abusive until I backed off and basically retracted what I had said earlier about my identity. Before this, Iâ€™d been hoping to join lgbt groups on campus but now I feel like it would set people off (and most of the people Iâ€™ve met in the community are a lot more outgoing than I am, and I feel really out of place).

I honestly donâ€™t feel like a â€œpersonâ€ and I have nowhere to turn for support. All I can think about is hanging myself and after at least ten years of feeling isolated and almost constantly suicidal I feel like Iâ€™m finally reaching a breaking point.

Sorry this got so long.
