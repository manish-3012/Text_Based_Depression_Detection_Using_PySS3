I wasnâ€™t sure where I should go so Iâ€™m posting here.Iâ€™m sorry I am so so fucking sorry. I know I sound like a cliche but I so badly wished I was good enough. I never was and maybe I just was lazy and didnâ€™t try hard enough but I truly did try. Iâ€™m so so sorry to the baby Iâ€™m carrying but I canâ€™t do this anymore dear, Iâ€™ve been in pain and looking for an exit my entire life. I donâ€™t want to burden you by being raised by me. I already ruined your brother. I wish I could make your father love me. I just wasnâ€™t good enough. I could have been, but I wasnâ€™t. 

This is literally no ones fault or decision but my own. I was always planning to *leave* but I kept pressing a â€œpauseâ€ button and waiting and waiting and trying so hard to enjoy life. I really liked falling in love. I liked owning dogs and loving them. I used to like drifting cars. I made a few friends. Iâ€™m glad I pressed pause but Iâ€™m all out of presses. 

Please it hurts so bad I just need to be done. Iâ€™m so sorry I really truly tried and Iâ€™m sorry I wasnâ€™t good enough.
