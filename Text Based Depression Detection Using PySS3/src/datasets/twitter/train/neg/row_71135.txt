Gave away all my stuff, fixed up my things and going to hang myself tomorrow AMAI made 3 posts a few days ago saying I would give away all my possessions as I had no use for them. Just dumped everything at the Post Office and am sitting here writing this post. I'm going to post my suicide note on here tomorrow night since nobody in real life cares enough to read mine. I'll be around for a few hours until Saturday night 1/13/18 when I go to the woods and do the deed. Until then, you can ask me any questions you would like about suicide and I'll answer them to the best of my ability.
