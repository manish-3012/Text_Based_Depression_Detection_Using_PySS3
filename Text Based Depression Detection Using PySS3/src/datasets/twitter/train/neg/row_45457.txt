Already decided that I will kill myself soon.Well. I did all the advice that I was told on this subreddit, and tried to tell my parents 15 minutes from when I am writing this. I attempted to tell the people that had been the main cause of it from the start. Because of their voices, I wanted to die. I tried to open up the conversation with a joke since I didn't really know how to start conversations. Almost immediately I was ridiculed and insulted. Well that was the final straw. They really are bad parents. I tried to tell a friend who right after I dropped off. He was always the class clown, attention seeking type, but he was really easy to talk with and could be mature if needed. I told him I wanted to kill myself and he asked why. I went into the main cause, which is my home life. He immediately said that his was worse and I was just soft. I immediately put two and two, well actually more like 1000 and 1000 together and realized all the red flags. Like all the "You did much better than I expected, well at least for somebody like you." Also, "You'd be a terrible (this or that)"  So yeah, I am done. If my parents get annoyed when I talk to them, then they will no longer have to deal with my presence.
