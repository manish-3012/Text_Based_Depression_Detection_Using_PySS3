[UPDATE] I'm Donehttps://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/39b6nx/im_done/

Hey i poested i think about a week ago about my problem and i tried opening up to my mom about what i did and how changing my class would affect me and she just started yelling at me about how what i did was wrong and i admit it it was wrong and i know that but she just made me feel worse and whats worse is that right after she just continued in an ordinary conversation with me like she's bipolar or something. Damn i thought i was in the clear but she always finds a way to make me feel like shit.
