I don't believe anything can help me.In the last three years, I have:

- been single for the longest stretch of my life since age 14 after breaking off yet another codependent/ abusive relationship
- been sober for the longest stretch of my life since age 17 after finally quitting drugs, drinking and smoking
- been living alone with my dog and trying to learn how to "fill" my own space
- been steadily in therapy
- tried a variety of medication options after having spent a lifetime swearing I would never try that
- completed a group therapy program for people who have experienced trauma
- formed and joined meetup.com and ravelry groups and gone to meetings with total strangers to try to make friends and get out of the house
- spent nearly two years completely estranged from my dysfunctional family
- gotten back in touch with my parents and gotten them to agree to family counseling
- made significant career advancements
- done well budgeting a shitty income
- flown to far- away places to visit foreign countries and cities and meet and spend time with people, strangers and colleagues

In the last three years, I have also:

- continued to intermittently self-harm
- barely slept
- not been able to get through a week without at least one anxiety or panic attack
- spent countless nights sobbing on the floor with my dog, unable to calm down
- consistently wished I was dead
- felt completely, incredibly, painfully isolated and alone
- experienced the loss/ betrayal of my two closest/ only friends
- not felt any joy in anything I do in life

This past weekend, I:

- had an ER-worthy breakdown
- emailed my therapist a desperate cry for help message that she did not reply to
- could not actually go to the ER because none of my "friends" could watch my dog for a few hours
.- watched a documentary on suicide, read suicide notes, counted pharmaceuticals, adjusted life insurance, etc. trying to steel myself up for it
- have stopped believing there is any hope for me

Things I cannot stand to hear:

- "it takes time"
- "you can't see it but you are doing better"
- "things will get better"
- "you just have to try x--it will totally help"

I don't even know why I am posting this. I guess I wish there was some kind of help. I don't feel like there is though.
