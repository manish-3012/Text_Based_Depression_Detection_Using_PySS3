Venting about lifeSo im not gonna be using correct grammar cause 1 i dont give a fuck 2 english is my second language. So excuse me for any typos and stuff. 

So im starting to write this in march 14. There is all the hastle about coronavirus and shit. All the toilet paper is gone from the stores. So thats kinda stupid. I dont know if im going to finish this or not. Maybe ill copy it and continue writing this later. Youll see further in the text if so or not.

Anyway i feel like my "depression" started about 2 years ago when i started listening to iamjakehill and Josh a. I was listening to -suicidal thoughts and -endless nightmare mainly. Im not sure if i was depressed or anything but i was definetly feeling down. That was probably because my parents divorced like a year ago then and i was still getting used to having two houses. My parents didnt talk at all and my mom had and still has my dad blocked on all messaging services. 

Anyways when I properly realised that there was actually some shit going on was in december of 2019.
We were thinking if we should go to my granpas house for christmas. I really didnt want to go cause i was really tired of everything physically and mentally. When i told my mom that i didnt want to go cause i was tired of everything. I stressed the word everyhting but my mom didnt probably didnt notice so she just said that i shouldnt be on my phone all night in an angry tone. Which in turn made me feel so much shittier cause i use my phone and laptop as a distraction from my life so i dont need to think of the shit ive gone through.

Which leads me to another point. I feel like the stuff i have gone through is not as bad as with most people. I can make it seem traumatizing. But then i think that it actually was traumatizing. But then i feel like a faker and an attention whore. And that makes me isolate myself. Which makes me crave for more attention. And then its and infinite loop of fucking stress, anxiety and depression.

Now for the things I've gone through. I'll just list the things and go in a bit more depth in a bit
-was bullied in school (not too serious)
-brother has bullied me my entire life (worse than i imagine it is with others)
-brother has told me to kill myself without knowing i have a bit of suicidal thoughts
-brother has physically abused me a bit in several occaisons (cant remember even half of the times. I just remeber pain)
-when he gets mad (has anger issues and adhd) he is very fucking threatning. Im always scared of what hes goung to do
-and now why im scared if him: he held a knife on my neck

Okay im getting tired of writing (on a phone). I think now ill actually post this and edit it tomorrow. Yeah ill do that. Ill be reading comments tomorrow on saturday. Sorry i left you on a cliff hanger. Peace.
