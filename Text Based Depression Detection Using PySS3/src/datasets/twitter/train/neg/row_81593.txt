Finally Got over my urge to Commit Murder.Thanks guys.A while ago a few of you guys managed to talk me out of commiting murder.It's simply not the right answer. I don't want to spend the rest of my life In jail over one effing guy or commit suicide after killing him.And If I were to go on a shooting rampage,I'd end up killing some truly Innocent/decent ppl. Not worth It and not fair.That's douchebaggary at best.
