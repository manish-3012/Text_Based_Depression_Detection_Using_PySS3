i'm going to kill myself in a monthi already have a method and a date chosen. all i ever hear is that my life is going to change eventually so i shouldnt do it, but i dont think thats true. ive been suicidal for almost a year now and nothing has changed for me. theres still nobody in my life who loves me, i still have barely any friends, etc. if anybody here lives in western pennsylvania and sees a suicide on february 20th, that was me
