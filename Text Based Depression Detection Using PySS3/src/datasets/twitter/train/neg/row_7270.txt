Dealing with a chronic mystery condition. Why should I keep living?It started a year ago. I just woke up one day and, out of nowhere, suddenly it was like I was living in a fog. Every movement makes me dizzy, I'm detached from reality, and I can't focus or concentrate. I can't enjoy TV/movies or even play video games anymore because my eyes are constantly so disoriented that they don't "know" where to look. Everything is just a huge mess when motion gets involved.

I've seen every doctor under the sun. No one knows what's wrong with me. A few people online report similar symptoms, but none of them have found a cause or a way to relieve symptoms. I had to quit my job because just moving my eyes is enough to make me dizzy.

Plus, I feel fucking stupid now. That's not an exaggeration. I can barely think. It's referred to as "brain fog", and it's the final nail in the coffin for me. My only achievements as a kid were related to doing well in math and school. Now, I have fucking nothing.

I feel bad knowing that there are people who have it even worse than me, but I don't think I could go on living in their shoes either. The only times I feel even remotely happy (or even content) are when I can distract myself and forget about my life situation. That's not a sustainable long-term strategy. I'm an unemployed single guy in my late 20's, and I just can't go anywhere anymore. In one year, I went from someone with a promising life ahead of them to a husk of a man with nothing to look forward to. I just don't want to live anymore.
