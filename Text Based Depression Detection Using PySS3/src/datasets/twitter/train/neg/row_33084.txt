The thoughts are returning worse than ever...I always feel empty and broken. From growing up as a fat little outcast being bullied all the time. For a few years in high school I was â€œcoolâ€ when I was in a metal band and people seemed to love me but I was continuously feeling depressed and that was just one form on venting. No one ever looked into the lyrics I wrote and asked about it. I cut myself from when I was 13-20 years old. I am now 23 engaged to a beautiful woman with two amazing step daughters. But still canâ€™t help feeling broken. The thoughts of suicide began coming back after my parents split. This was two years ago. I got tattoos on my forearms to prevent me from cutting. But the thoughts are continuing to race. My father always made jokes about me not being his son growing up. I look exactly like my mother and nothing like him but I never thought anything of it until recently. My mother recently have a hysterectomy from a possibly cancerous tumor. My father met me at the hospital. But my moms â€œfriendâ€ at least what she says came too. Now Iâ€™ve been trying not to acknowledge the fact that they are obviously together now but I had a conversation with my brother about my parents and he is 6 years older. He told me that my parents seperated when he was around 5 and both were seeing other people. And it all began to make sense. Why my dad always said I wasnâ€™t his kid. Why he was always more attached to my older brother. I want to know the truth but I am too afraid of what the answer might be... Iâ€™m trying to stay strong for my fiancÃ© and our daughters but the facade I am putting on comes out as asshole ness and I feel I am unfairly punishing them for things they have nothing to do with... I donâ€™t know how to cope, vent, anything anymore.....
