why am i still alive?i think this everyday why havent i killed myself i really dont know i think i should commit suicide. i cut myself once it hurt like hell. i thin i really need help i cant concentrate on class and on tests i just sit there and stare at the questions thinking "i dont know these." and i look around and see everyone else hard at work. i dont know how too confront people i have been in a physical altercation and after i had a mental breakdown and cried in front of the whole school. my family seems to hate me all they do is yell and scream at me and say so much mean things about me they hate the way i live i'm a gamer who stays inside and they hate that about me they want me too go outside be like other kids be "normal" "be skinny go outside do something just dont stay here and play games stop eating so much food i'm gonna smash your xbox if you dont go outside" i dont think i can take it anymore the only way out is too commit suicide my depression isnt helping in this situation either nothing i do makes it better cutting therapy gaming reading movies i just really hate my life the only thing i get up in the morning is too read a book not go to school not get bullied i just lock myself in my room and write on reddit and read books i dont game anymore my parents kinda ruined it i still dont go outside they wanted me to play sports i said airsoft they said "fuck no! thats the worse sport to choose its too expensive theres no areana near us" and i say "i have all the stuff i have bb's i have protective gear i have the guns theres a arena a couple blocks down the road" "no do you pay for gas?!" "no but still i shouldnt pay for gas" "yes you should" "fuck you!" "well the there goes your xbox forever!" "i dont care!" then i go in my room and think if i should stay here longer i think i might kill myself after this post or in a wekk or something
