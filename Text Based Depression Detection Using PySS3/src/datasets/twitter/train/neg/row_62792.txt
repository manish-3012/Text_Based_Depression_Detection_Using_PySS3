So fucking overwhelmedOnline school is kicking my ass hard. I had some issue with the computer my school gave me and wasnâ€™t able to submit assignments and now Iâ€™m almost a month and a half behind on schoolwork and I am desperately trying to catch up. Iâ€™m working from 10 am til 12-1am trying to get caught up and it doesnâ€™t help that my mom constantly pesters me to turn in assignments like theyâ€™re short worksheets that take a few minutes to fill out as opposed to whole fucking units. Iâ€™m not taking breaks, and Iâ€™m not sleeping because Iâ€™m stressed that my grades will be too shit to get accepted into the college I wanna go to. If I didnâ€™t have my girlfriend I would probably just fucking kill myself because I am strung the fuck out. I started self harming and before this year that wasnâ€™t even something Iâ€™d do, Iâ€™d just sleep but I canâ€™t even do that. I feel like Iâ€™m losing my mind.
