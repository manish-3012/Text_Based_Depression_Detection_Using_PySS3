Was it so hard to want even a single ounce of kindness for christmas and my birthday?You know what i did on the 24th? I went to DQ, I brought an icecream cake and I went back home, I kicked my shoes off and i sat at my table. No one was there to wish me happy birthday, no one was there to hug me, no one was there to light the candles on my cake, no one was there to hand me a present that was a pack of socks.....and worst of all....no one was even there. Not my mother, not my brother, not my father, not even the person i called friend. I sat there in a lonley house and ate the whole thing myself on what fells like the loneliest day of my life. No one should have to feel this lonely in their birthday. Christmas came around....i kicked back in my empty living room, in my empty house. Not a single present was under the tree, the car couldnt be driven because countless tears and panic attacks were shed because I couldnt pay for insurance. These were supposed to be the only two happiest days of the year for me and not even a phone call was given either. This was the first year ive ever felt the very soul of my happiness ripped out of my chest and shredded to pieces. This was supposed to be the one day i felt happy. This was supposed to go ok. I wasnt supposed to be having a panic attack despite 60mg of Cymbalta. I wasnt supposed to feel this way. I wasnt supposed to feel tempted to take a drive tonight and run out of gas till i stop and freeze along side the road. Was it really that hard to say happy birthday or merry christmas.....
