I don't know who I am anymoreI don't know what I have become but after many failed suicide attempts I can't live with myself.. I am just a failure. The laughing stock. No one cares. No one wants to see me succeed. I live in a minimum wage household with fighting everyday and addiction. I can't help but try to just end my life with what I have left.
