School makes me feel hopelessI'm currently in college and attending online classes (for obvious reasons). I really don't want to go to college and the only reason I am is because I get paid to go. The money is nice and I need it so I can move out. But I still feel completely unmotivated to try. I attend most of my class sessions (I miss a couple for appointments) and I try to complete all the assignments I can. But I hate the way everything is set up. Its utterly confusing and everything crosses over a handful of different websites and some need codes to access.

I thought college would be better than high school cause I would be treated like an adult and have more say in what I do. But now I just feel like I'm being bleed dry of everything I have to offer. One of my professors emailed me today asking if I was okay because "you're very attendant but you're missing a lot of assignments". I just started bawling because I'm really not okay.

I'm stuck in an abusive household and I'm being forced to go to school because my parents want my money. I hate money so much. It's the only thing my parents seem to care about and it makes life so much harder. I just want to disappear under mysterious circumstances and be declared dead. This life that I'm working towards just doesn't seem worth the effort. I don't want to be a wage slave, I don't want to be in debt for the rest of my life. I just want to live with my friends and my sisters and not have to worry about if I'm going to have enough to eat or stay in my house. It's not fair. Why even bring me into this world?

I'm not going to do anything to harm myself because I still have something. It's a feeble hope but it's there. I'm just not sure what to do. I'm not sure there is anything I can do besides continuing this cycle.
