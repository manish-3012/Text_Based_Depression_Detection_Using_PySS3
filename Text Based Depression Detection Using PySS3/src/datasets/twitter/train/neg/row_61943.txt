Im not doing well, havent for a while, and i have no escape.Tldr because idk. I guess im disassociating.

Living paycheck to paycheck.
Cant seem to save money, cant seem to get a side hustle, cant get anything off the ground. Everything just gets worse and ive been telling myself itll get better for YEARS now. And its only ever gotten worse. No matter how nice i try to be, no matter what i try to do, people just shit all over me or go out of their way to ignore or push me out, leaving me with no connections etc to get anywhere in life. Its almost like i really *am* a ghost already. A side character of a side character, even. 

Lately ive been disassociating more and more. Im afraid of doing something in that state. Im in america, so cant afford therapy, but i make â€œtoo muchâ€ to be put on any sort of assisstance. Theres nothing for me. No help, etc
