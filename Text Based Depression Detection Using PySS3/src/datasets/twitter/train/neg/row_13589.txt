I am a failure.I can't do anything right. I have been consumed by this darkness. Trapped in depression and it isn't getting better. I've been held back for not going to school, now probably going to be held back again. I am a failure and I just needed to get this off my chest cause I have no one else to talk to. I'm starting to see no other options and just seeing schoolwork makes me burst into tears. I've failed and I have no future. I just want to dropout, but I don't expect to make it to 18.
