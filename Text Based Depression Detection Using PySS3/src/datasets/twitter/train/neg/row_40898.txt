I almost did it.About a month ago. I got out out of my shower one night, out my pjs on, nightgown etc. 
Then I got the urge. I don't know where it came from. At all.

I took the tie from my dressing gown and made a noose and was in that moment, ready to hang myself from my shower curtain pole. 
Obviously I didn't do it. I freaked out and immediately felt ashamed. But now I'm worried.
If it came out of nowhere, will it happen again? How long until it happens again? I haven't told anyone about this. I'm scared.
