Tuesday is the day I guessIâ€™ve set the day.finished my letters and and have my texts ready to be sent.  After all my roommates go to bed Iâ€™m driving 40 minuets west to a really nice bay.strapping bricks to my Legs and jumping the fuck in. Iâ€™m in so much pain mentally. Itâ€™s all my fault in the end and I canâ€™t live with the pain and sadness anymore.  People know I suffer from ptsd and depression but no one ever checks in Asks how Iâ€™m doing.nothing. People only get sad and care after your dead. Welp theyâ€™ll fucking care wensday morning. 

I tired i donâ€™t want to die but I just want peace now.
