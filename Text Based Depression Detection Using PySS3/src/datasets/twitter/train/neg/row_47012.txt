DrainedMy life has been slowly spiraling down for as long as I can remember, but lately the pace has picked up. I'm a couple of months away from graduating high school and have absolutely no idea what I am going to do with the rest of my life. I don't want there to BE a 'rest of my life'. 

I'm so exhausted and empty and I just want to end it all. I want to just slip off and be done.
