Iâ€˜ve made peace with it.I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m writing this. 
But Iâ€™ve made peace with it. The last years were enough. I was more than I thought I would be able to handle but I stood up again and again. Iâ€™m proud of myself that I got so far. I really am. But know Iâ€™ve decided that I donâ€™t want to struggle the next years like this. My depression will not get better because my body isnâ€™t working properly and no medication was able to get rid of it. I would have to live with this forever. I donâ€™t want that. I could but I donâ€™t want it. 
Iâ€™ll start preparing everything for after my death. I know how I will end it. Iâ€™m making a list of things to do before I say goodbye. And when Iâ€™m done, I will go. 
Most likely I will go before the new year. Itâ€™s really calming to know that. 
Iâ€™m thankful for you guys. You helped me through a lot of rough times. Thank you!
I hope that you will enjoy this life more than I did and that next year will be better for you.
