How do I make it easier on my family?Hi, I'm killing myself because things have gone to shit and I'm just a burden on my family. I originally planned on doing it this Saturday, as it is the day before my birthday. However, one of my parents parent passed away from illness yesterday and now they're mourning, and I wish to make my death as easy as possible. Should I still go through with it since they already are mourning and one more won't make a difference, or is it better to wait until they've gotten over the parent and might be more stable? I love my family and I don't want to cause them more pain than necessary. Thanks.
