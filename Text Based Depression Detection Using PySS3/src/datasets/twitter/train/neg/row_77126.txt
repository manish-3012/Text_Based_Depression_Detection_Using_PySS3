Thoughts of a Crazy PersonWhy do people insist we need to live? Do they enjoy watching us suffer?


I considered suicide last week and texted the hotline. I forgot to tell them apparently I came off the tracks and ended up with cops at my door an hour later.

So much for anonymity.


I'm just tired of being tired.
 I keep thinking there are so many loose ends but fuck it. 


As soon as my logical mind finds a foolproof solution, I'm gone. Screw them all.
