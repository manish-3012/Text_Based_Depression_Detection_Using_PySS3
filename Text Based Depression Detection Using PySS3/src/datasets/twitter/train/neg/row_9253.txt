I want to dieIâ€™m just tired of being here. Iâ€™m trying so hard but itâ€™s just not enough. The only reason Iâ€™m hesitating is because I have 6 small children and I worry what will happen when Iâ€™m gone. 

I feel so useless even though I KNOW my family needs me. I keep thinking about ending my life especially now that me and my husband had a fight. I think I just need someone to talk to who wonâ€™t judge me about my depression. Iâ€™ve tried talking to my husband about it but he doesnâ€™t understand and brushes me off. I feel like I canâ€™t talk to doctors because I donâ€™t want a label
