What do suicide helplines do?Hi everyone, I am not an immediate threat to myself, so please don't worry about that. My question is, as you might have already guessed from the title,"What do suicide helplines do?" Since I trust only one person i.e, myself, I don't see myself contacting any Helpline ever. There must be many people like me who do not think that contacting such services will help them in any way. A few reasons to contact such helplines will be highly appreciated.
Thanks for reading and hope you have a great day!
