TiredI've been feeling terrible lately, it's dragging me to the end of my rope. I'm running out of resources and things that provide a distraction during the day. I'm tired of battling these thoughts, it's been five long years. I know others have suffered for longer and I can't possibly imagine what that is like, I wish I was strong enough to keep going. 

Talking to friends and asking for help has become difficult, I don't want to burden them with the problems that I carry and it pains me that I cause them as much worry as I already do. I haven't made any plans and try not to because I can't stand the guilt of thinking about it, what it would do to the people I love. I don't want them to suffer because I chose to end my own suffering. I turned 20 yesterday and I'm supposed to have so much life ahead of me but I can barely see myself getting through the next couple of days.
 
Even when I do manage to distract myself from these heavy thoughts, nothing brings me joy. I'm mentally ill and I've been on so many medications, seen so many therapists, done so many different types of outpaitent and inpatient, talked to so many different doctors, im so tired of it. During the day it's all somewhat manageable, but when the night hits and I'm laying alone in my bed, I feel so alone, so isolated from the people I love and care about, like I'm going to be here forever and never get out, always feel like shit. Thoughts of hurting myself or just ending it all consume me and sometimes I think I'm lucky I've been too tired to do anything about it. Its so hard to function and act like everything is okay, holding a stable job has been out of the question.

I don't know if I want to get help. Maybe I do. Killing myself has been a very tempting idea as hurting myself doesn't feel like anything anymore. I'm reaching out here because it felt like the right thing to do before I did something I couldn't come back from.
