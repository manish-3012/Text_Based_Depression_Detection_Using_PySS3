suicide just feels rightlike, itâ€™s not like iâ€™ll make a difference in this world. iâ€™m subpar at everything i do, and even when i do good at something i fuck it up. might as well just stop wasting food and shit that someone else might need.


my entire life iâ€™ve been trying to help people but as soon as i need help everyone turns their backs and acts like nothing is happening. maybe i was too annoying or maybe they just thought i was dead weight. 

iâ€™m sorry to everyone who had to endure me. iâ€™m sorry that iâ€™m not living up to what you wanted mom

iâ€™m sorry
