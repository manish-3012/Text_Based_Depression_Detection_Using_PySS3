Escitalopram is doing nothing for meI've been on escitalopram (Lexapro) for 4 weeks now and it's doing nothing, I know it takes time to work but I can't live like this.

I have no motivation for school or anything. The only time I get temporary relief is when I am at the gym, but the thoughts of jumping off a bridge and cutting come back as soon as I leave.

I wish I was never born. I have an objectively good life - there is something wrong with my brain. I want to die, I am a complete waste of space.

My psychiatrist didn't even remember who I was at my last appointment, because I am totally useless and forgettable.
