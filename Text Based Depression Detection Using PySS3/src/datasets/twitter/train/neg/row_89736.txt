i donâ€™t think i can survive past the next monthim literally so tired of all of this, I have nobody, I have nothing to live for. Iâ€™m going to get no where in life Iâ€™m stupid and ugly. Thereâ€™s no point in trying anymore nobody will care if Iâ€™m gone nobody will even notice 


Iâ€™m worthless I canâ€™t do anything I get everyone upset, why canâ€™t I be worth something, why canâ€™t I matter to people, why donâ€™t people care about me

Iâ€™m supposed to be going to a therapist appointment in a few weeks but I just canâ€™t handle myself, I just canâ€™t do this I have nothing. I shouldnâ€™t be this suicidal Iâ€™m just 13 Iâ€™m supposed to be happy but Iâ€™m just always depressed getting no help, I donâ€™t even want help nobody has ever been able to help. Everyone always says â€œI care about you so muchâ€ when they donâ€™t even show it, whatâ€™s the point of lying right to my face when you canâ€™t even prove that you â€œcareâ€ about me or â€œvalue â€œ me thereâ€™s no point into continuing to keep me alive to suffer, just to feel as if you did something good, you didnâ€™t, telling me to stay alive is just making me more miserable on earth , I donâ€™t wanna be forced to stay here at all
