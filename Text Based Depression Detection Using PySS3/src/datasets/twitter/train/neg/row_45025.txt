You can't say anything to this and why would you want toI want to hang myself in my room when there's no-one around. I'm gonna call the relevant people to find me first before family find me. It's no use continuing on... I can't function, and haven't been able to function for a very long time. I can't think straight. Everything seems unreal. I rely on others to exist, and that's all I'm doing- existing. I'm useless. I battle with severe anxiety and depression. No I cannot get professional help- that's not an option. I don't see how I can manage life, it's just utterly overwhelming. Loud noises freak me out. Sometimes I feel like I'm going mad. I can't do what most everyone else does every day as the norm like it's no big deal. I can't walk out the door, I barely ever even leave my room. I don't talk to anyone. No-one really knows me. No-one wants to know you when you're in the doldrums, and I don't blame them. I wish them all the best but I don't think I was meant to be alive in this world. I wish I could help someone or do something good, but all I do is leech off others. I'm a worthless nobody who does nothing. I wake up feeling hopeless and go to sleep entertaining thoughts of my demise. The only time I feel relief is when I fantasize about ending it. I've written many suicide notes but I keep throwing them away because they're not good enough. I'll be doing everyone a favour if I just got rid of myself. Sorry for all the negativity if you read all this, I wish you well.
