So just took a couple pills....Ive never been this stressed in my life. To put it in perspective I have a laid back personality. Think of someone who is just chill and handles stressful situations in a cool and calm demeanor. But I had a serious panic attack earlier, I was really wanting to cut myself, but instead I popped a couple pain killers I had. I dont even like to drink and I'm trying to let these pills relieve me of my stress. Idk I recently got on reddit and being able to post stuff anonymously actually lets me put this out there. Anyone else trying not to get too far? If you know what I mean?
