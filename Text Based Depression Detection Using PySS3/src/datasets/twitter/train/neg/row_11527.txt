I'm a failure and I can't wait to end myselfSeriously. I don't even know why I am posting this. Perhaps for some weird bittersweet closure. Read it if you wish.

I am a 16 year old lad. Complete failure and wasted intellect. Ugly, manlet, unsuccessful and destined for failure. I was bullied trough my life. I had to fight my way out of it. I struggled to look half decent and to earn some respect from my peers. I have been fucked over by multiple girls.

And that's not even the begginning.

I have horrible relationship with my parents. My parents see me as a failure. I have a younger brother that they really love. My mother is an abusive bitch that constantly berates me, humilliates me and abuses me (I have grown past physical abuse, so she resorts to mental) and yet somehow my father doesn't believe a thing I say and blames me for disrespecting her.

If this is all there is to life, I do not want to live it.

I tried killing myself two times by hanging, failed both times of course.
I confided in my close friend and told her about some of the things above, in hopes she would accept my offer to take my suicide letters and give them to people. She refused, but has been very helpful, but still, I don't think there is something that can change my mind.

I refuse to live my life as a failure and dissapointment, and that's why I decided to end it.

That's about it, lads. Thanks for your attention. I don't really ask for advice or anything. I just wanted to ease myself by typing this out.
