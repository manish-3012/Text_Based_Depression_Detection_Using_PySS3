Hey internetHey reddit I'm gonna commit suicide soon....so I'm gonna spend my last hour going on Redditch and wattpad and sharpening a knife.....and putting together an outfit. Hopefully something clicks in my head not to and I honestly think I'm stupid to wanna dress up for the last hour of my life anyways. I wonder what'll happen to me...reincarnation? Hell? Spend an eternity in a place where I'm neither sad nor happy? I don't know...but I hope the world gets better without me...Bye
