My family. And my friends. My dog.I love them so much. But I don't want to be here anymore. I can't enjoy my life. I thought doing psychedelics would make me feel better, but it's only made me more fascinated with dying. Everyone is the same and nobody tries to stand out anymore. Nobody talks about their feelings anymore. Nobody expresses themselves. Im currently laying next to my dog, and looking at him just makes me want to cry. I love him so much and he would be devastated if I left him. I'm in so much pain and I have been for a long time. I really don't want anyone to feel this way. I'll try and ride it out a few more days, but if I still feel like this, I'm going to eat a whole bottle of xanax and vodka.
