How do I do this?I do not know what is wrong with me. I feel hopeless, that I am a failure, and I am going to die. I started going to therapy for the first time a few weeks ago, been to about 3 sessions, not useful. All we do is go over the many different ways in which I suck, she says nothing, does nothing, it makes me feel worse than if I went back to not talking to anybody. 

How does therapy work, how do I get a good councilor? How do I be happy? Please help, I have nowhere else to turn.......
