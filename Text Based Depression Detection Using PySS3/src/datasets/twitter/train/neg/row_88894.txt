The time has come. I can feel itEver since very first thoughts about ending my own life came into my head I was hoping that I can still achieve something in this life. Turns out it was only a very cheap coping mechanism, fooling myself into thinking that my situation can be fixed, trying hard, working a lot, therapy etc was actually a miserable attempt to convince myself that life is not about pain and suffering that I'm currently going through. But I think it's time for me to accept the reality of this world and simply give up. I'm a pathetic miserable naive human being with no power of fighting this corrupted evil and self-destructive playground designed for no brain consumption addicted sell out bags of flesh and bones. Over the past couple of years I changed so much that I can barely recognise myself. I can't do absolutely nothing properly, my brain's fried up, people ignore me and don't take me seriously. I see no light, no future, no nothing. It's so bland and empty that it is just sickening to keep going. I'm so ready to go. I only need these last bits to be put together to make sense of my departure because I'm fucking tired. I'm done. I'm tired and im done. Tomorrow will be my first attempt. I can't promise that I will succeed because it's only a preparation to see how it feels like to have a noose around a neck in the woods all by myself.
