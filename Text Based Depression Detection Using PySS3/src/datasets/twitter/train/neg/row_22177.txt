I don't know how to deal with this anymore.This is not working any more. Anxiety taking over. A pool of unbearable and agitated thoughts form in my head. Drugs feel like fluffy clouds surrounding me, but they seem as useful as the blank useless wall in front of me. They make me feel nothing more than slightly numb. I feel lonely; I want nothing but to be alone. I cannot stand anyone or anything. The slightest utterance from anyone, loved, hated or stranger will agitate me beyond belief. 

Being sober feels like an unnecessary prelude to being drunk. I need nothing and no one. I canâ€™t accept, anything. I am tried of trying to explain how I am. 

I miss the old me. I miss not having this crippling anxiety. I need to learn to let go. I need someone to see the sober, kind, logical person inside of me. I just want this monster to leave.
