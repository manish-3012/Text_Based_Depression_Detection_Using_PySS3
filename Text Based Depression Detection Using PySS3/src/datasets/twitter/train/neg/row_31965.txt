The ultimate question? Why? The answer can only be explained through deathSo, I'm ADHD-PI and in school. I'm doing OKish.   
My question though is this:   
Why?  
Why are we here? What are we supposed to do here?  
The best answer I've been able to find through exploring my mind is that this reality is just the silver lining of a fluctuation in our universe. We are actually get to create our own heaven by the choices we make in our lifetime. I accept this but what I don't  accept is not knowing what was before and what will come after. It's always in the back of my mind. I've found that meditation and exercise dull the question as well as keeping busy with school, friends, helping people, etc. Keeping busy. I feel like I'm a bit too interested in things for my own good some times. The only way to answer the question and take the next step in life's adventure is by seeing what comes after - am I the only one that thinks this way?
