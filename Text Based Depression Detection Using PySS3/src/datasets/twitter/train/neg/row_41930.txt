I don't feel human anymore.I used to have really big dreams. Hopes for my future. I was going to be something amazing. Then reality set in.

Now I have no dreams, only nightmares. The only thing certain about my future is my near death. I'm failing in every aspect of my life. I'm close to dropping out of high school, as the result of my stupidity, laziness, lack of motivation and me succumbing to my depression. My family doesn't care. I have no friends. No one even knows (or believes) I'm depressed, suicidal and in constant anxiety. There's no one for me here. If I killed myself, there'd be no mourning, only people muttering "what a waste."

I'm just a burden and a major inconvenience. 

And it doesn't get better. I've fucked up that badly. I'm just a useless, worthless, loser. I was an accident and I never belonged here. I feel like nothing, and how I wish that were really true. If only I could disappear into nothingness.

I suppose, life has killed the dream I dreamed. 

Might as well get rid of me too.
