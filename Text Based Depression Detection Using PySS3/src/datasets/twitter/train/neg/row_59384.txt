Writing when I'm feeling downTonight, the feeling came back for whatever reason, and I really didn't feel like going to bed with that thought on my mind, so I wrote about it instead. Here's what I came up with:

.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 


Temple made of flesh and blood,

From forth comes a great red flood.

Unlocked by a bit of lead,

Fired straight into the head.

.


Small white pills like fallen snow,

Scattered where few dare to go.

Fall unto the floor like rain,

First to numb, then kill the pain.

.

Leap of faith into the air,

Streaking tears in wind-blown hair.

As the ground begins to rise,

Something far deep within dies.

.


Spark of hope and energy,

Taken by life's enemy.

Guided by its hand that night,

Into the everlasting light.

.

The ground impacts like a sledge,

Far below the fateful ledge.

Junction where life and death meet.

Crimson rivers in the street.

.


Blackness overcomes a life,

Torn asunder by such strife.

That no hope could spring anew,

Or provide the courage to

.


Slay the Reaper, fight him off

Look into Death's eyes and scoff.

Or let time heal all the wounds,

All because you leapt too soon.
