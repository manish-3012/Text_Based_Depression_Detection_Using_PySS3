I'm just not okayI think I've lost my mind, which has been really the only thing important to me consistently. I can't think about certain things without risking breaking down and that's all I do. Any part of me getting help racks me with guilt. I can't look at pictures of myself smiling because my eyes look so fake. I just wish I had given up sooner so I wouldn't have all this dread.
