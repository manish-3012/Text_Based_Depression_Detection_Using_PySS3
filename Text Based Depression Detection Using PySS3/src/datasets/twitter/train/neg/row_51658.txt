Why am I not happy?I'm in my 20s with a college degree from a prestigious college. I have a full-time career doing something I enjoy for a company that treats me very well with coworkers that are good friends. I have a caring family that helps me with everything and I am engaged to be married to someone I've known and loved for over a decade and have dated for half the time we've known each other. Financially, I have very little debt that will be paid off quite quickly and have a large enough amount of money to put a down payment on a house even after the costs of a wedding. I am living the American dream, yet I still want to kill myself.

But I won't because I don't want to hurt all the people that care about me. I suffer in silence. I've had for 14 years. I can't even shed a tear anymore. I'm completely numb. I don't have hope for anything and I have to fake my emotions. I don't seek medical help because that could hurt my relationships and career as much as killing myself would. To get myself to sleep, I think about just not existing anymore, to have never existed in the first place. That way, I can't hurt anyone that cares about me, cause I was never in their lives.

I don't know why I'm writing this...I guess I'm still trying to understand it, even after 14 years of it.
