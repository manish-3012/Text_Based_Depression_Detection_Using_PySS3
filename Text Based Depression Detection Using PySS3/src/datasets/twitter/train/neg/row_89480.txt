Iâ€™m honestly excited to die of a heroin overdoseFor an extremely long time I had a lot of desire to commit suicide but there was always something holding me back from doing it. I donâ€™t even know what it was to be honest but today I feel content for the first time in my life. Iâ€™ve gone through a few counselling sessions for drug addiction and mental health and it was extremely helpful. The people at A&amp;E when I went was the same and my GP too. Couldnâ€™t ask for more but living a terrible life that wonâ€™t get any better isnâ€™t worth it. My brain chemistry is probably fucked and I wonâ€™t be able to return to normal again and not be depressed. Iâ€™m trying to ruin my life as possible as actively as possible. I binge drugs with the intention of losing my mind and hopefully going crazy to the point I do commit suicide because I havenâ€™t got the courage to do it anyway. 


My belief is that there is no afterlife and once Iâ€™m dead I just simply wonâ€™t exist. No regrets or anything. Suicide DOES fix your problems as far as Iâ€™m concerned. Iâ€™ll be dead so even though the guilt of putting people close to me through this makes me reluctant to do it, I wonâ€™t feel anything towards them anymore when Iâ€™m dead so it really doesnâ€™t matter. 


All my problems will be gone tomorrow or if not very soon. I have Â£120 sitting in my bank account and I might just buy some other drugs that I havenâ€™t tried or just go all out before Iâ€™m gone. I have some heroin that Iâ€™m getting tomorrow and Iâ€™m going to try a few recreational doses first before I fully kill myself. I donâ€™t feel nervous at all and I feel so happy for the first time. I canâ€™t function in this society at all (canâ€™t even do simple things like wake up early) and the life I dream of having is one where I can do drugs all the time without having to worry about other things like money but that isnâ€™t achievable from what I can see. 

Just imagine the rush from IV heroin. I canâ€™t even begin to imagine how good it could possibly feel. I used to dream of the euphoria something like heroin can give someone because itâ€™s a feeling you canâ€™t get when sober or with many other drugs. Iâ€™m going to go out on top of the world. So euphoric, so content and so happy. Iâ€™ll be unconscious by the time I die so I wonâ€™t feel any pain. This is going to be the best thing I ever do and I canâ€™t wait
