How long is a good try?â€œLife is like a movie, if you've sat through more than half of it and its sucked every second so far, it probably isn't gonna get great right at the end and make it all worthwhile. None should blame you for walking out early.â€ This quote is attributed to Doug Stanhope though I cannot verify obviously.

So how long is a good try? I've had depression since I was 8-9, first tried to kill myself at 10, and I'm nearly 30 now. Life has not improved, nothing has changed. I'm depressed year-round but every year during winter I'm crippled to the point where I sleep 22 hours a day and want to end my life the other two. I'd like to devise a method where I get to experience brain death (it's the least I deserve after enduring this life) and also where my corpse is obliterated. I don't want my family being called in to identify my mangled husk.
