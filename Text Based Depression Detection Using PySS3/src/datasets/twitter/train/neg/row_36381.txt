Have you set a date? If so, why did you choose that date?I'm pretty certain that it's time to start wrapping things up here on Earth. But I honestly don't know how much time to give myself. I could go jump in front of a train today, but that seems too soon. I could wait for decades until I hit old age, but that's way too far.

Enough time to get my affairs in order? I don't have much that's worth arranging.

Enough time to maybe change things? I know that it's just going to end with me in the same spot as now, only worse. Why bother.

Enough time to travel and whatnot? Does it really matter how many memories I rack up if I'm going to blow my brains out at the end of it?

Things are starting to spiral and they're going to get much worse over the next five years, so I plan on being gone long before then.
