One last chanceI messed up university the first time around because I got mugged among other things. Now I can't go back unless I pay for it. the degree I want to do requires science qualifications that I don't have. I'm 23 and weigh 256lbs. I have no friends. I self destructed my life. And I can't get back on track. 

If I can't go to university this year then it's all over.     If I don't get in then im done. It's my one and only shot at getting my life back, following my dreams, getting friends. 

I've given it my all for 2 years, researching, saving money, trying to meet people. Finding ways to afford university, looking at alternative careers, I've explored every avenue I can think of. But it seems unlikely. 

There is a very small chance on getting in that requires many unlikely things to go in my favour. But if not. I've ran out of options.

I'm placing everything on it...
