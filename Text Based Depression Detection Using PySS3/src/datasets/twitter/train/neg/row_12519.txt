is there ever an end to mental illness?has anyone else with mental illness escaped or improved. or do we all periodically go back to being sick/selfharming and wanting to end things? it seems I get a good year, a happy year, in between every few years of absolute shit where things spiral out of control again but I don't want things to spiral again. I want things to stay on track, why is it so hard to stay happy when you've had it for a moment or even just a month?
