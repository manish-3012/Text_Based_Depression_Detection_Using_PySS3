How does one push themselves towards suicide?Hello, I'm you're cliche depressed person, I'm lonely, negative, useless, and just a horrible person overall, I have no positive attributes and I've recently made up my mind on commiting suicide, the only thing is there's a teeny tiny problem and that is one of my other negative aspects which is fear. 

I'm afraid of doing it, I know I'm gonna do it one day but I just can't bring myself to it. 

I wanted to ask people who may have had previous attempts on to how they pushed themselves to do it in the first place, any tips are appreciated as they will end my life on this earth, thanks!
