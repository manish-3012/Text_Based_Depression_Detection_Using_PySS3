Iâ€™m ending it this weekI just wrote my suicide letter to my boyfriend, soon to be ex I expect. I donâ€™t think I ever felt so guilty writing a letter to someone, I genuinely love him so much. It was the most heartfelt but also heartbreaking letter Iâ€™ve ever written. Weâ€™re in a long distance relationship so I feel so guilty that Iâ€™ll never actually meet him, and hold him, which is all Iâ€™ve been wanting to do. I donâ€™t think he loves me anymore though so itâ€™s okay. Weâ€™re having an argument and I just canâ€™t handle it anymore. Itâ€™s all piling up and I just want to end it forever. I still have to write to my grandma, my mom, my cat, and my ex best friends. I just wanna thank them all that even despite most of them leaving me, they still had some kind of faith in me. Even my cat, I feel so bad about leaving my baby. Fuck. 
I just posted on r/depression which was a mistake on my end because I know everyone there is basically in the same spot as me which is unhealthy but I just needed to vent. Iâ€™ve been crying for what feels like an eternity now, my eyes and head hurt, my lips and nose are swollen, I havenâ€™t eaten for two days so my stomach is so much pain itâ€™s unbearable. I feel so selfish. So guilty. But I have to do it, everyone will have a better life if Iâ€™m not in it.
