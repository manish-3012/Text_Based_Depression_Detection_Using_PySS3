I am kinda faking my death part 1/2So I decided to fake my death and see how she will react.

Note: This was done to a person I have known for a while.

I texted her some messages about how I almost would've blamed her for my suicide and how I wouldn't be surprised if I mentioned her by name in the suicide note. After that said "I'm losing my mind. I can't, I just can't". Set myself to appear offline and custom status to Dead. Also won't talk to anyone she knows. 

Update is coming in a few days
