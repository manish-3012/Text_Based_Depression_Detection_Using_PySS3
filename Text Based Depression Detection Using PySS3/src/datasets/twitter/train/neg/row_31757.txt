I want to kill myself but I'm afraid to dieI have been dealing with this pain for about 3 years. I have seen many therapists and have tried medication. Nothing has worked. I told my parents tonight that I wanted to commit suicide and it has caused nothing but chaos in my house. I have been looking online for ways to die and have figured that drinking and taking medication is the way to go for me. I have already been drinking but have been hesitant to take medication because I am scared to die. I do not believe in god. I do not know what comes after death. I am scared of pain and afraid that it will hurt and i will not succeed. I have tried reaching out to my ex-boyfriend who told me that he does not wish to help me. He hates me. I called him and told him how I was feeling and he said "I don't care, I'm eating so I'm going to finish dinner"....... it made me sick that someone could have no compassion towards a human life. I've had a hard childhood, both my mom and dad were addicted to narcotics and were hardly there for me. For some reason my brother and sister have turned out ok. I am the youngest at 23 and have been struggling with depression and been keeping it a secret since middle school. I'm writing this because I don't know what to do or where to turn to.
