My end is near. I feel content and relievedLong story short, my life has been a long long time of suffering. Fucked up childhood that fucked me up (I possibly have BPD, or at least very drastic symptoms towards it), bullying and long time depression and suicidal thoughts for the last seven years if not longer. I'm writing this here because my friends and family are alarmed enough and well, I dont really want help. I just want to talk. To tell someone what I'm feeling.

I've tried to kill myself twice this year already, both time just being disappointed it didn't work. I dont see no way out, my moods wont stop and considering possible BPD and all the fucked up things that happen in my brain and the things I do I dont see it changing. I'm hurting the people around me and I can see it. Me dying won't be easy and I know it's a void that will never be filled in many hearts of that I know. But at this point, I find it hard to care. I'm at my happiest when I've thought that I'm finally dying. And with this, I won't be able to hurt those who I love anymore. Im terribly lucky to have them, to have such people love me, and they won't give up on me. I can't make them believe that I'm a lost cause or maybe them give up, I've realized. But I dont see myself backing out on this. I've lost the fear I used to have for death. I'm just very relieved it's all ending soon. I'm very happy.
Thank you for reading. And thank you for doing what you do.
