Suicidal feelingsI feel like my life is empty, I'm very far from my mom and dad, and the family I have near is letting me down in all the ways they can. I feel bad in all the places I go, and even if I have a smile in my face and I seem like someone is happy I just want to cry in my room because I don't know what to do with my life and maybe because I'm too weak to continue with this. 

Lately I've been having suicidal thoughts, but idk what to do.
