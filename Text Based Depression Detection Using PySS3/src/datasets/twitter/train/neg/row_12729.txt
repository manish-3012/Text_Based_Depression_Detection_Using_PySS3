Once poor always poor?Will i be always poor if i'm poor? Yes? Or is it possible to escape? How? What if i can't get an good education? So i would always be an unskilled low paid worker? If i can't escape poverty should i just kill myself or are there options to escape poverty? Because being poor isn't fun. You will always be barely able to survive but can't afford much more.
