Advice, if you want some.I've come here a few times and very kind people have talked me off the ledge. I want to try and give back.

In the past week or so something clicked in my brain. I don't know what it was or what it means, but I became content. Everything is still horrible and sucks, but I found a peace. We're all stuck in this dumb game and it's terrible, but it's the game we're playing and when it's over it's over. So keep playing it. Maybe something good will happen. Probably not, but it might! But even if it's just horror and madness it's still an experience. And when it ends it's over. For good and forever. You'll be dead for infinity. Give life a shot for 80-ish years.

So keep playing. Do your best, be kind, and hope for the best. But keep playing.
