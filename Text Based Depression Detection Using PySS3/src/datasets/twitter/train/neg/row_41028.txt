â€œThis world needs you in itâ€Honestly no it doesnâ€™t. I feel like thatâ€™s just something everyone says in order to try and keep people from killing themselves, but itâ€™s really not true. I can think of maybe 3 people who might actually care if I were to kill myself. And those 3 people are really the only reason why I wonâ€™t do it. But if I were to die, the world would keep spinning, peopleâ€™s lives would go on almost completely unaffected. Yeah, they might be sad for a day or two, but theyâ€™d get over it and get on with their lives soon enough. The world would go on mostly unaffected if I wasnâ€™t here, so the world doesnâ€™t really â€œneed me in it.â€
