I feel hoplessI feel hopeless

So I failed a psychology course and I feel miserable and hopeless right now.I am trying my best to cope with it but I just feel hopeless right now. I feel worthless. I donâ€™t know if I am depress or not but sometimes I do think that dying will make everything easier. I donâ€™t have to a burden to anyone and I donâ€™t have to feel so miserable. I donâ€™t have anyone I can talk to. Days arenâ€™t even getting better. What should I do? I tried my best but I failed. I feel like no university will accept me. I feel shit right now. And sometimes I feel that there are people who are trying their best to live and I think they deserve more than me to live. I donâ€™t know what to do. I have no one I can talk to. Plz help I donâ€™t want to feel so miserable. I... I donâ€™t know what to do in my life. I feel like I donâ€™t deserve to live. I am really a big loser.
