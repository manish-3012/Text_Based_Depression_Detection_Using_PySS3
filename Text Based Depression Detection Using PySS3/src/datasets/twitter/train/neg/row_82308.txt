Ive never felt so aloneI have failed at my career. I have a PhD &amp; six figures of student loan debt &amp; I can't even get a job in retail. I have failed at finances. And now my husband of 15 years just told me he wants a divorce. I've failed at everything. I just want to die. It's 2:30am &amp; I've been up all night. There's nothing in my house to kill myself with. Nobody to talk to. I just want to die.
