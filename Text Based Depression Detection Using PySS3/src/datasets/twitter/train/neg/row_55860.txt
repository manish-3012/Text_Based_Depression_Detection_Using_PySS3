Very worried about friend, help please.My online friend has told me that she has attempted suicide, apparently more than once and one time she almost succeeded. She always told me that she was feeling better now, but last week she confessed to me how she's really feeling. Now I'm really scared that she will try again. She has a lot on her mind and is dealing with a lot of stuff, and although she tells me not to worry I can see how terrible she's feeling. She has an eating disorder to  deal with and has expressed several times how she does not ever wanna be hospitalized again. She takes her work and studies very seriously and they make her really stressed, but she says that her work is also what's keeping her alive and that taking a break / being home sick from work makes her feel worthless. She has fainted several times, she has vomited blood, she has hurt herself...Of course she's not okay. And I'm so afraid that one day it will all be too much for her. Isn't there something I can do? I've tried talking to her and she told me that "you're already doing all you can by talking to me, thank you". But is there no more? I'm desperate.
