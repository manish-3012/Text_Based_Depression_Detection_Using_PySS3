There Is One Reason Why I Donâ€™t Kill MyselfMy daughter is the only reason why I donâ€™t kill myself. 
Iâ€™ve been through some hard shit. My parents were abusive. My mom was a drug addicted narcissist and my dad was a drug addicted pedophile. I feel like a worthless human being. The post-abuse struggles and pain that I feel are inescapable. Iâ€™ve been in intensive therapy for 5 years and while there is some relief, the pain never really goes away. Iâ€™m tired of living this way. I just want to let go...but I have my daughter. Sheâ€™s 7. If I left then she would have no one and I canâ€™t do that to her. She is my only reason for living. She is enough to keep me holding on. Iâ€™m here for the long haul. I just wanted to vent. I hope some of you understand.
