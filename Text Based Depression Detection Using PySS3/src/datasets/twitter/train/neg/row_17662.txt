Should i even bother tryingHello, 
I've been a NEET for seven years now, basically being a trash human being by mooching of my mother.
The things that led to my current state are for one, a crippling addiction to video games and close friends of mine dying by either suicide or overdosing on drugs. 

For a few weeks now I've been trying to get my shit together and sending out my CV and going to job applications.
As you can imagine I only get rejected.
I know that I might get a job if I just keep on pressing forward, but I think I might just take the easy way out.
