I told my mum I wanted to kill myself awhile back, now she brings it up In every argument.She jokes about the fact that I'm suicidal, therefore making me more suicidal. It breaks my heart to leave my little brother and sister but I don't think I can do this anymore. I can't help but feel bad that my mum will blame herself, but I'm sure she'll get over it.

Just wanted to tell someone y'know.
