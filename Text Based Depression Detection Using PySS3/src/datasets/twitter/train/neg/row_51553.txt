being alive is exhausting.i'm sure you guys get it.

i'm tired of living. so tired that ive given up on my life for real. not just for a few days or weeks this time, but for months now i've been done with contacting friends, showing up to work, paying bills, eating, sleeping, living.. quarantine played a big role but this started before then.

i know i have so much to 'live for' ^((?)) and so much 'potential' ^((?)) but i just... don't care anymore. i was registered for grad school courses this summer and i didn't once look at them. finals have come and gone and i still haven't bothered. have i flunked out? who knows. a year ago i would have panicked but i don't feel anything. i can't even bring myself to pretend. 

ive given my 20s a few years and i still dont know what im alive for. it doesn't even matter that i got out of my abusive home anymore because the damage is done. it's a joke calling us 'survivors'. i don't think i've survived at all. the thought of living on just to keep struggling to convince myself to stay alive for the rest of my life... god, it sounds tiring.

i think i've reached my limit.
