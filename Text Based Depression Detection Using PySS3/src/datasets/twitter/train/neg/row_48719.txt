Mental illnesses has taken everything away from me, so what's the point?What's the point of keep living? Knowing that no matter what you do, you will always be uncapable of being happy and normal? 


It keeps taking everything from me even until today.
The amount of time I wasted suffering other people used effectively and now they are at the top meanwhile I see them from down here. I don't understand why... It makes me feel bitter but somehow I think i'm seeing life for what truly is: is not made for everyone, some of us will get left behind.
