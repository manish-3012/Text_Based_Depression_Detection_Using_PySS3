I want to do itI canâ€™t stop thinking about hurting myself. I really want to. I have nothing left to live for anymore. I actually know barely anyone would care. Nobody fucking cares about me. Barely anyone even talks to me. I guarantee if I just stopped showing up at school, nobody would notice. I guarantee that when I die, there will be barely anyone that shows up to my funeral. Sucks for me, but in a way itâ€™s comforting knowing it wouldnâ€™t upset too many people.

Just one more reason to do it.
