I just want to be done with everything. Everyone is constantly yelling at me and blaming everything on me. I really want to walk in front of a train.Today I went to the doctor with boyfriend and he started screaming at me and blaming everything on me. Trying to make me feel like an awful person. Everyone is just constantly yelling at me and ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS blaming EVERYTHING on me.

God I just want to die already 

I feel so alone
