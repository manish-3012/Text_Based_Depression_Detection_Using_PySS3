Just a failureAbout to graduate from a third-tier college. Tons of debt. I'm ugly and have no friends. I have seizures and they ruined my grades during high school. I could have achieved so much more and it's tearing me up inside. Now they just ruin my ability to connect with people and drive a car. Terribly lonely. Most days I sit alone and cry. No one can be bothered to speak to me. I can't even look in a mirror. I just wasn't meant to have friends or be happy. Just a walking genetic defect.
