Idk what to do anymoreI'm at this point where i feel broken. I have nothing ever to say, i never want to do anything. I want to crawl into a hole and dissapear. I'm so stressed out. I am exhausted and can't sleep. I constantly feel like a failure and i just want it to stop. I look in the mirror and am repulsed by what i see. I want a break from life. I want a break from this fucked up thing i call a brain. I want a break from being me.
