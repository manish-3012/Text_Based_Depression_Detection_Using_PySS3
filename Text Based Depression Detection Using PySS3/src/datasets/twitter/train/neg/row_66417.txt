Iâ€™m too broken to keep living.My life has felt like an endless swarm of really terrible events for as long as I can remember. I had childhood mental, physical, and sexual abuse. My dad abandoned my mother and I, she started drinking and I took care of her until I turned 18 and moved out. I turned 19 and then my dad died. I moved countries because I thought it would help, but got into a really abusive relationship that took everything I had left of me for a year. I met someone who is absolutely incredible and I feel so guilty leaving him, but I feel like a shell of who I was. I feel so broken. I took shrooms this weekend and all itâ€™s done is brought up terrible feelings of anger and depression. I canâ€™t move. I canâ€™t stop crying. I kissed my partner goodbye today, and I was no longer crying because I was depressed. I was crying because it was the last time I will see him. Iâ€™m in the bathtub now, Iâ€™m staring down my weapon of choice and trying to get the courage to actually do it. I feel so alone. I want to stop being angry. I want to stop being sad. I just want it all to stop.
