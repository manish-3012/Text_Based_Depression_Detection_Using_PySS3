I just want to Give Up on my Life but I'm Confused As Well.To be Honest,It's like I want to give up on my Life but I don't want to Leave my Brothers Behind if that Makes Sense? 
Part of me Tells me I wouldn't be Missed the other part says they would miss me but would my Brothers actually Miss me? It just feels like I'm falling deeper and deeper into a Pit of wanting to end the Pain as much as I'd Miss Them the Palin's unbearable and There's to much Drama going on its really hard. 
I wouldn't be Surprised if no one sees this which is Fine I don't Expect much out of my Life I feel like my Life isn't going to ever Get Better It's Sad. I'm always Dragged into Drama the Stress triggers my Anger Issues to the Point I lash out on these People who cause Drama making me look like a Jerk. Anyways if I do go through with this and my Brothers/Friends see this Goodbye Love Y'all. 
For the Strangers Seeing this Goodbye May you have a Good Life better than I had same for my Bros and Friends.
