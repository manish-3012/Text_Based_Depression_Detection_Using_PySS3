Ready to goI'm sitting here in my car waiting to go into work and all I can do is think about if I'm going to do it tonight or if I'm going to do it tomorrow. I have no quality of life my mental illness is breaking me. I can't even go into my job without having a massive panic attack I can't afford to lose this job but I also don't want to live anymore so what's the point. I'm a divorced will not even divorced because we never got married. I have two kids they both hate me so I think it probably for the best. I spend time in a psych ward and I never really got anywhere with it I felt good after but I don't know I think it's time to end it.
