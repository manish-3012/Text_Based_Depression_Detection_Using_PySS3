Fuck itI want to do it so bad I wish I could just so I would stop thinking about it. I don't even want to be replied to, I don't want sympathy or help. Which raises a good question why am I posting? The answer I don't know maybe I just feel like Rambling to myself tonight. I think i have enough liquor and painkillers to do it although hanging strikes more of a chord with me personally; seems more involved  and more deliberate. I just don't know if I could hang myself although it doesn't make a difference I won't kill myself anyway I have never been able to. I'm just tired of thinking about it all the time and feeling empty, surely a lack of existence is no worse than I have it now. What gets at me the most is I shouldn't feel this way I have a great family some great friends and I brightish future. I'm so fucking lucky yet I don't feel gratitude to get up in the morning. It's bullshit I have no fucking problems so why 
Fuck it
