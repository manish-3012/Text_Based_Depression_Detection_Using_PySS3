I hate most people and also myselfFuck the world, fuck you, fuck everyone, I hate everyone with more than me and I hate that I'm more lucky than those with less than me, I'm incredibly more lucky than those with less, despite warning essentially nothing, you all have no idea what I want, even though I'm extremely transparent, I just want to drink booze and play online videogames so I can portray myself and be seen a certain way, I don't know what the fuck is wrong with me, other than a lifelong general want for narcissistic attention and adoration, imagine being someone that people like just for themselves, I guess I'll keep living to perpetuate my own delsuions, daydreams, and anything I can do to slightly live them.
