I'm pretty sure I'm going to end up ending it all next year...I don't see any point in living, I have nothing going for me in my life. My family are pretty poor, I'm in college but barely, chances are im going to fail out anyway.

I keep telling myself that my life will get better, that I won't fail out of college (even though right now it's 95% certain I will), that I'll make friends someday, that I'll find a girl who loves me...

Academically I'm pretty bad, not the worst, but it's pretty clear to me now that I'm in no way "gifted" and I'm not going to do anything to change the world.

I don't have any friends, the only people I talk to in college are my housemates and their friends, and if they weren't forced to live with me I don't think they'd bother with me.

Romantically I'm even worse, 19 and I'm still a virgin, never hard a girlfriend and never even kissed a girl. Almost everyone I know has had at least some kind of romantic relationship, but not me.

I'm ugly, I know I'm ugly. I have bad teeth, can't grow a beard, and to top it all off I'm short and skinny (5'7 130lbs) which no girl finds attractive. I'm also horribly socially awkward, shy and introverted. So if someone did overlook everything else they would still quickly lose interest in me.

I figure since I'm probably going to die a virgin living off food stamps why bother living out the rest of my life. The only reason I haven't killed myself yet is because I don't want to upset my family.

I have honestly considered joining the army for the sole fact that there's a chance I might die and at least then my family might  think of me as someone who was fighting for his country instead of a depressed loser who just wanted to kill himself.
