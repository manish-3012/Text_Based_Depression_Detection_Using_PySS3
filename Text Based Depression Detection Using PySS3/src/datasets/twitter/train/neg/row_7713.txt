I'm not at risk I have a questionI recently met a girl on an app like tinder geared towards people under 18. I wasn't using it as a platform to get with girls I was using it to get to know people around the country and what life is like there. One girl I had a nice conversation about hockey with and she said she wanted to add me on Snapchat. That was a few days ago and she texted me tonight saying she was sad and explained how she felt worthless and already tried suicide. I did everything I could to calm her down and get her to not harm herself. After sending her the suicide hotline number and suggesting she call it she became very angry with me. She told me that a boy she met called her a waste of space and that she "has a blade" I tried getting her to calm down and did everything I could to keep a conversation with her but she blocked me. I'm concerned deeply about her. I don't know if I'll ever find out if she is ok or not. If she does do you think I'd find out through police going through her Snapchat and finding our texts?

Shortened: Girl I added on snap may have killed herself after my attempts to talk her out of it may have failed. If she does commit suicide do you think I'd be notified by police or left never to know?
