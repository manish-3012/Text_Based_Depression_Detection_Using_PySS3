I don't know why she insists on hurting me...My wife and I were together 5 years and married for 7months when. She had an affair. Along with the affair I caught her with a different man in our house. We split up and I got my own place. I keep our two kids most days...she gets em every now and again. My first night in my apt alone I bought a pistol and ammo and put the mother fucker in my mouth...i cried and cried and wanted to do it so bad but all I could think about was my son not having a dad around that loved his so much. I gave my pistol away...She and I have been discussing trying again. She says she cut all contact with dude and my stupid ass believed her. The kids have noticed us getting along and I can see that they're think we'll get back together. I cried when my son told me he missed his old life. I still cry. Recently she told me she was ready to try again and we began really communicating better...yesterday, I found out she's pregnant...with the other man's child. There's no way it could be mine because we haven't been intimate at all in...well, since I can remember. She doesn't know if she wants to keep it or not...she knows how I feel... we're still married.. I don't know what to do. 
Right when we began discuss getting back together I told her to be open and honest with me because nothing she can do or say is gonna hurt me any more than the affair did. She sure found a way to up the ante...I'm fucking decimated...my broken heart has been shattered into countless pieces and it feels like there's no coming back. The only thing that could hurt even more, that could rip thes shattered pieces from my chest would be her having that fucking child and raising this token of lies and betrayal alongside my children. If I don't die soon that would kill me more and more every single fucking day until I finally withered away like the spineless, stupid, ignorant, fucking dumbass piece if shit that I am. Fuck. This. Life.
