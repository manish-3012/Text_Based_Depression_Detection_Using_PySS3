my plansafter this carton of fags are gone im going to kill myself. im going to buy some heroin or drink a bottle of scotch, lean and some xanax then its all over.


im so alone. people like me but im no ones friend. im so sad and my family might be but theyll get over it. im the fuckup anyway. no one knows how sad i am. people never start any conversations its always me. its so hard getting out of bed, but i go outside to walk my dog. i love her.



im going to start writing my note soon. its no ones fault. ive been through so much so its only inevitable. 

when i was younger i used to laugh how suicide is so high at christmas but i can see why now. i remember saying that suicide is dumb if you dont do something big before but i see why now. its so much effort. im so sad and lonely and i dont know what to do. im lost. im so young i dont know why it all happens to me.


i wish i could cry i feel like that would help me. i wish someone would tell me how fucking useless and worthless i am. that would comfort me. i always wonder about whats going on in peoples life, on the bus on the train, walking down the street, i could sit down and talk to someone for hours about their life, mundane life just talking and talking.




one more cigarette lit.
