sorry.sorry to everyone ive hurt, despite repeating that a million times before i know saying it has no meaning anyway, and im sorry to all the people who hurt me, for having to put up with me and my bullshit, im sick of my fucking life, and posting to these forums wont ever help anymore anyway, im at the end of my road and my only options is either just fucking end it which im too much of a pussy to choose or continue staying alive and keep wasting my time on my pointless and depressing peice of shit life where all i do is wake up, take drugs, drink, sit my dumb ass infront of my computer all day and do fucking nothing or ocassionally play a game alone because ive lost all my friends and any that i did have i ended up deleteing because im scared of humanity because everyone ive met has intentionally or unintentionally hurt me in some way or another or just never cared about me, the first few days i shrugged it off and thought "fuck it,humanity is shit anyway,im fine spending the rest of my days alone,like i give a shit anyway" and then ive just started breaking down into tears and just crying every moment of my life,the only times im not is when people are around me and i have to put on a fake smile so they dont ask me whats wrong and bug me about it all day,or just get a response of "dont worry about it", im fucked up and i fucking ruin everything, this is the karma i deserve i guess, to be stuck in a dead-end job,sitting infront of my fucking computer all day doing jack shit and fucking crying myself to sleep everynight, not having a single actual friend to talk too who is on my friendslist, i didnt post this looking for help, i mostly just posted this to vent and to apologize for being such a fucking peice of shit and waste of fucking space, if you add me on steam to be my friend and help me you are wasting your time,your help will do nothing anymore,ive blocked everything out of my life, theres no point in being friends with a peice of shit like me, there is no point in adding me as a friend, sorry for everything, maybe ill die soon either intentionally or from an accident,i dont care which, i just want the pain to end.
