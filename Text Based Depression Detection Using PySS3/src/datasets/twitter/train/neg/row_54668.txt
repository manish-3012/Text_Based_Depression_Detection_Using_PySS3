Does this count?I think about suicide a lot, but not about actually comitting it. I mean sometimes I WANT to but I know that I WON'T because I value life too much and don't want to cause pain to my family. I think of it often as an option though, as a just in case kind of thing, in case things get to be too much. I know this isn't an acceptable way to think, but I still keep plenty of sleeping pills on hand. Does this count as "suicidal ideations" even though I don't plan on actually doing it?
