insomniacs of the world uniteive always struggled to get a full night of sleep. i used to be afraid of falling asleep due to night terrors i had as a kid, so i would count backwards from 1,000 and pinch myself every time my eyes started to close. now im not afraid to sleep, i just simply canâ€™t sleep instead. my brain wonâ€™t fucking shut off, itâ€™s so annoying. thoughts and thoughts running back and forth through my brain like itâ€™s some sort of depression marathon. (the winner gets to stare at the ceiling for hours on end!!) all i think of is how much i hate myself, and how much i hate most things. sometimes i fantasize about running away or killing myself or what it would be like to fly. my mind wanders more than i do. ive always wondered what other people think about when they canâ€™t sleep, so i guess im trying to ask?
