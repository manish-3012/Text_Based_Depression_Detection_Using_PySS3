I know things will get better but the pain is unbearableEveryday is a challenge for me. I canâ€™t do anything right. I disappoint everybody around me. Everybody is tired of me. Iâ€™ve tried so hard to keep going and everybody says things will get better. How long do I have to wait for things to get better? Itâ€™s as if Iâ€™m building a wall brick by brick but everyday it gets demolished. Itâ€™s a constant cycle of rebuilding. The bricks get heavier and my motivation becomes scarce. I canâ€™t trust anyone anymore. Iâ€™m truly alone. I donâ€™t want to die young but I canâ€™t bear it anymore.
