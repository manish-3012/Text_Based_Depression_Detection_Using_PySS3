Sorry for posting here so much, but I'm really just done. I want to die.As I'm sitting at school getting ready to be in the pit band for a musical all I'm thinking about is dying. It's messed up. I failed an AP test today. I actually cried during the test because I didn't think I knew anything. I don't know. I don't want to get my score back for this test. My dad is going to kill me but he doesn't understand that this is too much for me to handle. It's way too much. 

I don't want to go home because I'm scared of what I'll do to myself. I feel so out of control and my life just keeps going down and down and I think I've hit rock bottom honestly. Things are just getting worse and idk what to do. I don't know why I'm posting here again. Sorry for wasting people's time but I'm really just feeling so lost. I want to die. I'm not sure going home and being alone is a good idea to be honest. I don't know what's going to happen tonight.
