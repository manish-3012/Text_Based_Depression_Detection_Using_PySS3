numb!!!36 years old and still!!! suicide creeps all through my mind!!! started when i was 15 years old, and now it just seems to get worse by the minute! mainly because i see what everyone else sees now when they look at me!!! and that how ugly i am, it doesn't matter if i'm a nice guy or whatever! still!! that all people will see of me and will only see of me, so whats the point of living!!! no career, no future, no looks, and the health is not too perfect either!!! and now that we are in a pandemic, yes..i'm sad for everyone else that got hit hard by this virus, yet in the back of my mind i'm wishing that i would be next and that this so called life i have will be over and done with!! i know, that terrible right? anyways...soon, my death will happen, this year!!! maybe not by this virus, but it will take place...and i'll admit, my life wasnt all that bad!!! but it was bad enough
