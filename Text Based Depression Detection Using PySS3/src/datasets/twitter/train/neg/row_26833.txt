So much pain.I live with awful chronic pain from a condition that is only going to get worse. I go to a support group and see people with my condition who are even worse than me, knowing that I'm just going to get worse. I don't want to live like this anymore. I don't want to keep being in so much pain. I don't know what to do, but I can't keep going like this.
