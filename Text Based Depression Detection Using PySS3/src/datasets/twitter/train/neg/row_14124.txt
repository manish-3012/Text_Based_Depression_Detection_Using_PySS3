I want to die.I have became even more depressed and in despair this year with the coronavirus and all of that.  I have been stuck alone in my abusive household for 8 months. I have been getting more trauma memory back that I previously had locked away. I've been abused, sexually assaulted as a child, sexually assaulted as a teen, bullied, almost murdered, treated poorly for being bisexual etc.  I don't have access to therapy and I am slipping.  I have severe PTSD and it's getting progressively worse. I am failing my classes because I am in this house.  I have been like this for almost 7 years now, trying to stay alive for no goddamn reason.  I want to get a knife and stab myself to death. There's really no reason anymore. I will always have this fucking horrifying trauma, I will always be mentally ill, I can't take care of myself or get out of bed, I can't get anywhere in life.
