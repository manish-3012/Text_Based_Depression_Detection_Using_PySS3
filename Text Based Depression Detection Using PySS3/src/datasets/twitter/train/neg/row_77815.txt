Got ghosted today. The last thing I needed to make my mind up.Been depressed for years now. Never had the strength to go through with it, but I finally feel there. I met this girl about a week ago, and she was perfect. My last gf was in 2015. (She was married and decided to stay with her husband) That really fucked me up. 

Fast forward to this week. This girl was amazing. Absolutely beautiful, super chill. Honestly the whole time I had no idea why she was talking to me. She could get way better. Most of the time I hate existing, but talking to her made things feel great. Maybe thatâ€™s how everyone else always feels. Then today I saw she unmatched me on tinder, and stopped responding to texts. Idk what I did wrong, and never will. I donâ€™t blame her and Iâ€™m not mad at her in anyway. She doesnâ€™t owe me anything at all. Iâ€™m mad and hate myself for ruining something again.  

Fuck everything at this point. Life is absolute trash. People walk around and convince themselves that any of this matters. It doesnâ€™t. If someone kills themself, everyone whoâ€™s â€œhurtâ€ by it will be gone in 100 years anyway. Nothing matters. In 1000 years no one will even know we ever fucking existed. I think about that everyday. This girl proved my point that living is a waste of time. It doesnâ€™t get better. There arenâ€™t shitty days and mostly good ones. It is all shit. Weâ€™re just here to suffer over and over. 

Being ghosted isnâ€™t something to die over. A lot of other shit has happened. Itâ€™s just the thing that made me see it clearer.
