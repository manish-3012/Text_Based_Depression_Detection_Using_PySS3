The Sorrows of Young WertherAs I write, my eyes are burning from tears.

I was in a secret relationship with a girl who was strictly religious. She was my first big love, we had sex countless of times and I love her 'til death. She broke up with me a year ago and told her church what she had done.

They excommunicated her for a year.

She got back in this month and is already engaged with another guy.

Oh God! How much that hurts. I want to walk through the open door to death.

My grandma died last year of alzheimers and a mental illness. She screamed for hours and hours because of the pain in her soul.

The stress of excommunication, seeing her suffer has spiralled me into a similar mental illness and strong depression. I've lost all of my money, cannot concentrate, and live with my parents. I don't know what to do. I am feeling so much pain, and don't see a way out.

I am 23, I ache for the love we had. I feel so terribly lonely, betrayed and worthless. 

I always told her, "I love you and nothing that you can ever say, think or do will ever change that. You don't have to do anything, for me, you already deserve to be loved for a lifetime." You can see, I really meant that.

I need someone to tell me that I am going to be normal again, even if it takes some medication; that I am going to fall in love again with a loyal woman who will never leave me and we will bond deeper than with this woman although it seems impossible; that we'll have some great kids and she will fully have my back; that we will laugh, cuddle and whatever we had before will be no comparison to what we are going to have.
