Just wanted a place to let it all outI've never been open about how i feel, i've always pretended like its all fine but its not. 6 years ago i broke up with a girl who meant the world to me and since then its destroyed my life, i haven't left the house in those 6 years and i've got to the point where i can't see my life any other way. Every day it seems like i'm getting closer and closer to ending it all, currently i wouldn't because of close family but i'm scared one day i will wake up and be fine with the idea of ending it all.

The break up fucked me up, we was both 15, we had recently found out she was pregnant and her family forced her into an abortion which ultimately led to us breaking up then 4 weeks after we broke up she started dating my cousin which killed me inside even more, we were close but after he started dating her he cut ties with me all together i' now 20 turning 21 in 6 days and i spend 100% of my time in my room and i have nothing in life apart from my mother and sister.

I don't know whats stopping me from ending it but i'm at the point where i think whats the point in living. It feels better putting this into words and i know 21 is still young and i have a long life ahead of me but i can't help but think that nothing will change, i sometimes check her facebook and it makes me feel physically sick. Oh and to top it all off i can't leave the house without being sick from the anxiety i've managed to acquire over the 6 years of not going outside.
