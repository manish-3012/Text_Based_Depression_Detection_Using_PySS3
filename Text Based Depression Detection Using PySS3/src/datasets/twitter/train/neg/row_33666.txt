i want to not feel emotions anymorei can't. i dont want to feel anything anymore. i can't i can't  i can't  i can't  i can't  i can't  i can't  i can't  i can't  i can't  i can't  i can't  i can't  i can't  i can't  i can't  i can't  i can't  i can't  i can't  i can't  i can't  i can't  i can't  i can't  i can't . maybe time will help the emotional pain but nothing will ever truly fix it and nothing will help me regain the person, even just being friends. why did i have to be a romantic and fantasize about relationships and a family since i was young? why do i have to fucking care so much? why did i have to be such a horrible person and fuck things up anyway? does it even matter that i've gotten to be a better person anymore? it doesn't erease the things i've done in the past. why do i have to be so emotional in the first place? why cant i just fucking leave all of this and forget everything. if there was a way to just restart from the time i met her with what i know now i would do it without a single ounce of hesitation even if we just stayed friends. i hate myself and i hate my life and i hate my brain and i wish it would all just dissapear. this is a relapse, i thought i had things under control and i would be able to fight off these thoughts but i can't and i keep fantasizing about dying so i can stop the pain. not to mention i feel damaged and like i'll never find someone else i fit so well with and trying to find relationships is so fucking exhausting and i put so much effort into trying to talk and message people and put myself out there even just on reddit but i get no fucking responses at fucking all.
