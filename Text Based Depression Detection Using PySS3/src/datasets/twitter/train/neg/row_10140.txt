Is it really a bad option?...I have been around the block here and there and have been put through two suicide watches, along with seeing consolable and popping every pill ever prescribed to me. But the suicidal thoughts just never seem to go away. It is always something i find myself thinking about, and it really seems inevitable it will happen. I mean not now, not a week from now, hell i doubt 3 years from now. But at 24  haven't accomplished much and if i am stuck at the same crossroads at 30/35. I can't see why not. I don't want to be a burden to anyone, and  just go out on my own terms rather then by some disease or some sort of accident. I mean is it really a bad option? Or should try to find some more help? What am i to make of these thoughts.?
