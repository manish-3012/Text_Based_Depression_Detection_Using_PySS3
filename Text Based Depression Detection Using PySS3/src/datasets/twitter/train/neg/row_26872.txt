I wanna kill myself, but not really.The reason doesnt matter. Fuck transphobes and capitalism. Fuck asian education systems, especially Korea.

The only thing keeping me here is my few friends telling me they love me.

I feel so depressed. I see memes all the time about how apparently everyone is constantly masking depression.

I need to know. How do you feel like this but still function? This is selfish of me, but I feel like everyone who claims theyre hiding depression is extremely fucking strong, or just liers.
