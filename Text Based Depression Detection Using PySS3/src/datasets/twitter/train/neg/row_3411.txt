My best friend saw me try to hang myselfIâ€™ve had depression for a couple months due to a break up. I know people get over it and whatever but this one was bad and my fault I got with a girl that was gonna do this to me sooner or later. If you guys want to Iâ€™ll go more into detail with it later. 

Well it was one of my good friendâ€™s birthday and we were all supposed to go over to his house. Iâ€™ve gotten my mind off of her mostly but sometimes she pops up. And that day was the worst of them. I spent the whole day in bed listening to depressy music. I guess my best friend(who isnâ€™t the birthday friend) came to check up on me. Thereâ€™s one window that canâ€™t be blocked with shutters so he climbed up to see what I was doing. Keep in mind that it was 9 pm so I couldnâ€™t really see out the window. So I couldnâ€™t see him.

When he looked it was about the time when I was crying and yelling. I then went and took a shit ton of shots of NyQuil which can fuck up your liver. Iâ€™m not sure if he saw me cutting my thigh and hitting myself. I then grabbed a rope tied a noose and hung it up in my closet. The thing is I tried to hang myself but I was too tall to fully do it(Iâ€™m 6 foot 5 inches). All I did was hurt my neck and for a while have a hard time breathing. But he saw all that play out. I locked all the doors so no one could get in so Iâ€™m guessing he waited for my dad to get home to check on me. He came over to my room. I quickly got up and opened the door making it seem like I was asleep and did nothing.

After that the guy confronted me on the phone a day later. And I told him my problems and started crying. Hopefully he didnâ€™t hear that. He didnâ€™t understand why I wanted to do it. Which is fair. Iâ€™m not sure why I wanted to do it. I just got the sudden urge to kill myself. Iâ€™m just tired of me being in pain all the time. And I know that it would hurt the people around but Iâ€™m also hurt and I donâ€™t like it and I canâ€™t ducking stand it.
