Not ending it, because it would hurt my family.I'm staying alive for my loved ones, because I know how much it would hurt them, they would only blame themselves. I wish I lived in a world I could kill myself and there would be no consequences. I think its fucking unfair I have to carry on living just so I don't hurt anyone. It's fucking torture. I fantasize about death all the time, I wish I could kill myself. But I'm a coward, always had been, always will be.
