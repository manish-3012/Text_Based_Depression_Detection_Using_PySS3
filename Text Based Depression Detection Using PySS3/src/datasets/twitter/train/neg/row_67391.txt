I'm struggling to see why i should even carry onI am feeling weak and incapable of going on. I have seen people go through so much. sometimes they don't come out or they struggle so much. some come out stronger. Me, I feel so hopeless and weak. unworthy of the potential of life and the few who would care if i was gone. I wish i wasn't alone. but every day I feel closer to losing what little I have left. I don't see a next chapter of my life, only more misery till i finally give up entirely... i wish it wasn't this way
