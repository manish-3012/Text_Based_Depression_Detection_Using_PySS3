The day I graduate high school is the day it all endsI can't stand to deal with this bullshit. I'm so alone. I can't stand to be so alone. When I'm around people, I just feel so alone and so insignificant. I feel like no one cares. I know some do, but the second I lose a single one of them, I'm ending it completely. I can't say where I'm headed. I just know its not gonna be fun for anyone. I just wanna say that the day I graduate, I'm going to shut out everyone, and fucking blow my brains out.
