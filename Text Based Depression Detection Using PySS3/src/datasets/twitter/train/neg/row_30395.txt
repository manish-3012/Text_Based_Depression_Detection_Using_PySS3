I firmly believe that we as human beings should have the right to die when we so choose.Every human being has a right to live, so how do they not also have the right to die? No one can consent to being born but yet if they wish to leave a life theyâ€™re forced into theyâ€™re talked down upon, condescended and even ostracized.
