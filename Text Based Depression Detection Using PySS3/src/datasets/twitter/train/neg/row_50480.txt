I'm going to kill myself soon...It's been three months since my bestfreind replaced me again, she won't talk to me, ignores my messages, threatened me with the police if I don't stop trying to message her, the last time I messaged I asked her sister to try get her to talk to me and she said she didn't want to so I had to say "Ok sorry again for messaging" while crying, I've cry'd everyday, can't eat, can't sleep, can't work, I feel hopeless I wake up everyday feeling empty inside and devastated, I smoked 80 cigarettes in the last 24 hr's, haven't slept in 2 days, on the verge of starting to cut myself again just so I can feel something that isn't this, I vomited earlier and I only had toast for breakfast, I can't do it anymore, I don't think she knows what shes done to me, I want to die, please help... Ill be dead by the 31st if I don't feel better and she doesn't contact me neither of which I can see happening, I'm sat here with a knife contemplating slitting my throat while I write this, I don't want to feel like this anymore I can't take it, I locked myself out my Facebook and deleted her number so I'm not tempted to message, I want to message her so bad but I know she will just ignore me again no matter what I say
