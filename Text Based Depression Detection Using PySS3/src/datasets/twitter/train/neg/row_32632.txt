LostI work in retail and the company I work for is staying open because we are thriving in non-essential sales right now. I used to love my job before this started, never had any complaints. I was struggling with my mental health before this started though, and now I feel hopeless. 90% of our customers are shopping because they're bored but they're all also disgustingly rude and aggressive. The company gave us a $2per hour raise but now I'm actually making LESS money in my paychecks even though I'm working more hours. If I was on unemployment I would be making double my usual pay. I have no good options. I'm unhappy in and out of work. I think about killing myself on a daily basis and I barely see a point in trying to continue. The only thing stopping me is my dog honestly. But idk how to fix how I feel, because everything I feel like could help me isn't a possibility. I dont know what to do, I feel lost.
