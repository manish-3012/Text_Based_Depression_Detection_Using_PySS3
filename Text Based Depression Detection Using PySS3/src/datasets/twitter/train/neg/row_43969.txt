Trying so hard to stay alive...WARNING: Sorry if my writing is horrible as I am in my Senior Year of High School (M17) and writing has never been my strong suit. This is also a throwaway account hoping that I don't have anyone contact me outside of here. As well this was copied to about 5 subreddits hoping for many responses, so sorry if you've seen this before.

I've been fighting with depression for 8ish grueling years and have been taking an medium dose of prozac for 6 years now (40mg daily) but had it recently bumped up to (60mg daily). This mostly stems from my parents splitting up when i was 6 and myself not having contact with him whatsoever between 8-11 years old. A little over 2 years ago now (July/5/2016) I started my amazing relationship with a girl who I really liked (Lets name her '**C**'). One year in I found out she was cheating on me after she was sexually assaulted by my best friend at that time and immediately was assigned a restraining and no contact order from him. Around these times I helped her through alot and stopped focusing on myself because of it. I have contracted a **MILD** case of PTSD (varified by a psychologist) and have nightmares between 4-7 nights a week. Recently around mid October we seperated before court(her choice) and I found out she was calling me mentally abusive and was sending explict messages to my friends up to 2 months before. At this time I was admitted to the hospital as I cut deep enough almost for stitches and carved a broken heart into my right upper thigh. After this I almost felt better and was getting more help from a school councillor and a outside psychologist. November 23rd one of her old friends (lets call her **T**) contacted me and asked if I wanted to hang out and see if I was really the person **C** said I was. **T** had a kid from a previous sexual assault and he was so cute, and was an amazing mother even though she was only 16 years old...the night of the 23rd we did a ton of fun stuff like walk on a icy lake and flirted a ton. I had a connection with someone and didn't feel sad for a night or thinking about my past break up, it was amazing... but for about the past week she's ghosted me and refused to talk. Rarely she'll respond with a quick hi and then leave me on read when appearently she liked me... I've read up alot about it now and I believe that I have a disorder called **Anxious-Preoccupied Attachement Disorder** (not yet confirmed). I got attached to her very easily and really did like her but was weary because I knew I wasnt ready for a relationship but couldn't help but love everything about her. 

Overall what the meaning of this is meaning is that I have an easily attachable personality and I feel like so many people leave me. I'm really only talked to by 2 people at school and I also have one online friend, I feel so alone even though I know I'm not. I constantly am consumed with thoughts about **T** or suicide and barely enjoy anything anymore, not even video games which I got a small following on YouTube (hence the account change). I don't enjoy anything anymore and cutting feels like the only way I can stop feeling pain for a minute. I'm so close to giving up and this is #5 of my 7 attempts to get help. I don't know what else to do or make myself happy. Leaving this world feels like the only way I can be happy now... please if you have anything helpful to add, I'm desperate to hear it.

Love,
