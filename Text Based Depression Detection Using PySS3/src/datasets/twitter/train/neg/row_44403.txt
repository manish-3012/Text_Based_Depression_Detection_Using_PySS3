Holy shit is today awfulI am having troubles lately. I am trying to find help, but not hard enough. My partner is making things worse with his own stress. He has no idea how close I am. The only reason I don't go is to not cause him any pain. I've never felt so fucking trapt. He started putting me down verbally, so I know he doesn't feel for me the way I feel for him. I need to vent and so here it is. I can't seem to make up my
 mind about leaving this world. I wish I could just fade away. I wish he didn't think of me as garbage. I wish he would stop saying it. Nobody misses garbage when it's gone. I wonder if I did enough good for anyone to remember me.
