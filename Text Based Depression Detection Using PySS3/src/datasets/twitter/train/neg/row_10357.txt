Don't worry; I'll never actually do it. But I think about it every day.It's so fucking hard. I don't want to deal with this any more. I used to cut when I was younger. I've completely stopped that now, but I drink and smoke weed on a regular basis to deal with it all. Today was the first day in over a week that I didn't get very drunk; hell, I didn't even drink at all. I guess you could call it an improvement. I'm depressed though. Weed helps with the depression, but it can't be there for me 24/7. Tonight was extra terrible. I was planning on asking this girl I'm close with to be my girlfriend. She meant a lot to me. She's been helping me deal with my depression. But a bunch of drunken idiots fucked it all up. I'm not gonna have another chance to see her for at least week, and I'm about to start a 50 hour work week tomorrow as well. I'm not ready for this. I don't want to feel a thing any more.
