im literally just donegirlfriend of two years broke up with me end of april, non stop thinking about her since, talking almost every day since just trying to get a chance but i'm not worth it of course.  my life was shit before i met her, she was the only thing that ever mattered to me.  She was the only person who could make me happy.

I know its a breakup up yada yada yada every one goes through it theres other people out there. i don't care. I have no doubt in my mind i can find another girl, but i simply don't want to, i don't care how stubborn or crazy or pathetic i seem.

i was with her since pretty much freshman year. i'm gonna be a senior. same major, same small campus, i'm going to see her every fucking day.  i can't go through this pain anymore.

every fucking night for the past 3 months i think about her having sex with this guy she's been on a couple dates with.  every fucking night i can't sleep because that's all i think about.  I can't go through another month like that and i certainly can't go through my senior year like that.  two of the best years of my life seem like a lie now, and now its been the worst 3 months of my life and i honestly have no idea how i've made it this far.

everything just seems like a lie and i can't live a lie anymore.

All my life i've put everyone before me.  my entire relationship i put her above myself, my family, my friends, everyone and everything.  Maybe its about time I do something for myself you know? Stop my own pain and stop worrying about what everyone else will feel or if they will even feel everything.   And i fucking hope she never comes to my grave and says i love you because those simple three words would have made me stay.
