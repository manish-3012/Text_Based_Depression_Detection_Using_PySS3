It's honestly ironicI've suffered from depression and suicidal thoughts for years through an abusive mother. I started self harm at the age of 11. But there was once upon a time when I conquered my suicidal thoughts and managed to to look at life in an optimistic way. I had a career going, working my way to become an Electrician with the dream to start and support a family of my own one day. Now here I am. Diagnosed with stage 4 lymphoma at the age of 19. I feel empty. I have nowhere to go. I don't have the money for treatment as I'm already barely making enough to pay the bills I currently have. It was all for nothing. Because I chose to not take my life by my own hands, the world is destroying it with its own hideous fingers. Is there anything I can even do?
