home now. first thing my mum said to me was i look like shitthank you it might be because i fell and banged up my hands and knees today running away like a fucking freak frm an old lady unknowingly trying to talk me down from a suicide attempt. i think she thought i looked bad too because she touched my shoulder and asked if id taken anything and if i needed help going home. or maybe its because ive barely gotten through 2000 calories total this week or maybe its just the whole sudden breakdown number who fucking knows thing isnt very flattering on me. last week i cut nearly all my hair off and before it you told me then that im so sickly ill look like id belong in a concentration camp. i know you know why i look this bad. why wont you try to be kind to me when you know i cant cant cant be it to myself. im sorry anyone who messaged me or commented or anything when i was freaking out. nothings working in my head and i cant make myself do anything right anymore and i feel too disgusted by my whole stupid existence to want to see what everyone else thinks of it too. im sorry im sorry im sorry. if i can ill make myself go out and try again tomorrow
