He is throwing me awayMy husband and I have been going through some difficulty for some time now. I was diagnosed with severe recurring depression and anxiety and shortly after lost my job and could not afford meds. I am worse than I was before I started. 

Well he recently asked for a divorce and then has been acting secretive. We discussed divorce a few years ago and decided not to. I found out that he was seeing another girl and kept it going for several months, so the being secret is very alarming to me. I just go crazy and I go into every account, look up phone records, etc.

I found a phone call from a number that I did not recognize for long periods of time, when he should have been working. I call to ask and he says it is JUST some chick he met on facebook. 

I am driving myself crazy... I just want to be gone. I don't want to feel this hurt anymore. He keeps telling me that he doesn't love me and has not in a long time and that he does not want to be with me, etc. 

When I married him, I married for better or worse... divorce just is not an option for me... death before divorce.
