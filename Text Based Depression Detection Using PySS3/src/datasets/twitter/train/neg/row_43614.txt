Early beginning faseSo, recently these last few months have been hard on me. Broke up with my gf. smoked so much weed that I couldn't keep up with studies. Opened up to my friends about my suicidal thoughts, didn't seem to take it seriously. Had to move back in with my parents. Family hates me, but puts up a front to save face. 

Honestly I hate my life and I try very hard not to think about suicide. But every time I close my eyes I keep fantasising about my death. I haven't reach the point of planning yet. But I feel it getting closer every day. Talked to a doctor about it, but she deemed it to be due to stress. I have to drink to get away from my emotions for a sense of relief. 

Today wasn't such a good day. My cousin just got his bachelors and there was a gathering here. I couldn't make my self go out and be social. I don't have the strength to be active, socially. I don't want to talk to anyone about this because of fear of being misunderstood. I locked my self in my room all day and tried to get some sleep. Found my self so frustrated that I threw both my active-phone and my old phone on the wall. Both are ruined.

I don't trust my own family, because when I opened up to them I felt no one took me seriously. I feel more and more isolated and I have pushed everyone around me away. 

I fear the eminent worsening of my depression coming and all the psychological self-protection mechanisms failing me. I need to get this stuff out to someone, even a stranger. I'm pessimistic about any consolation that might come my way and I know parts of me will reject it. 

I just needed to get this stuff out.
