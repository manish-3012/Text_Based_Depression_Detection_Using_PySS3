pls respond. i need guidanceAt times i feel like people like me, but mostly thatâ€™s bc of my generosity. I never skimp on covering my boys for money or weed or anything honestly and i always look out for anyone i consider a â€œfriendâ€. But i never get anything close in return. I often never catch an invite when my friends go out or they never try to me in a positive situation when i always look for their best interests. I really think if i just disappeared no one would even notice. I recently just went to Indiana for college (iâ€™m from ny). i thought my situation would change out here. i tried to be meet different people and make new friends but the same shit happens. Iâ€™m just living my same life but in a different state. idk what to do i feel lonely all the time and i donâ€™t hav anyone to talk to. 

If indiana doesnâ€™t work out for me idk what iâ€™ll do. i hate my life back home. It might happen soon.
