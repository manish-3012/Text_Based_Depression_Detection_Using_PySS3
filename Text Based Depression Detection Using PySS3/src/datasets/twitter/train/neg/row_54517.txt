I've decided that I'm going to actually do itAfter 6 years of not listening to it I finally give up. I'm going to do it. I have one week left at my shitty retail job then I'm going to spend my last measly paycheck in ignorant fucking bliss and then leave this shitty place. I'm almost 23, I'm a fucking loser with no aspirations or goals in life. I'm sick of being here and struggling to live a life that's not worth it, I am worthless. I'm sick of my depression and anxiety ruining everything if it hasn't been destroyed already. Nothing interests me, I cannot afford any hobbies nor do I want to continue my hobby now since it will go nowhere and I will never "make it big". I'm not good at anything besides toying over useless complexities of life that mean nothing in the end. I fucked up with the love of my life because of these feelings and there is no going back. I'm sorry Brooke didn't mean to hurt you or myself I'm just this way, I don't know what I was thinking. You deserve so much better. I'm sorry for wanting to leave mom I hope you the best and that my sister gets her kids back. I'm sorry Ross I love you man I'm not as strong as you think I know this will hurt but I can't anymore, I wish you the best after you finish college this year, I'm going to see you one last time.
