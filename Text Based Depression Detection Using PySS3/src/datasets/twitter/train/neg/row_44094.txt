i need to find a stranger that i can talk to face to face.  i'm not suicidal (or maybe not ready to admit that yet) but i feel like i'm slipping more everyday.  it's almost like i know i will one day have to kill myself because i can't stand my own existence.  what's even worse is that i live a very comfortable, normal life, but the more i think about the 'big picture', the less i want to live.  it would be lengthy to put into words, but i would happy to elaborate if anybody wants a further explanation.  i think i need help.  i want to find help but i feel like i cannot talk to my girlfriend, friends or family because it would put a permanent rift between us. they don't really 'know' me because *i* don't really 'know' me.  i'm 26 and on the surface i'm an ordinary male but i have something inside that i have to get out.  can somebody give me advice?  how do i find a therapist that won't break the bank? even something elementary would be appreciated because i don't know where to turn to
