I don't want to live anymoreWell this was bound to happen. I've been having a rough 5 years and this just made it worse. My girlfriend left me and apparently told all of her friends who are some of mine she's stressed and told me she wasnt interested anymore. Life has been shit and i dont want to have to suffer through this anymore. I'm fed up and tired and i'm so comfortable with suicide that i might just dk it. Sorry to everyone that cares/d idk if i'll wake up tmw.
