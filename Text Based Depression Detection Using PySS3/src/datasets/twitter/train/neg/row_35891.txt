My Life Is A WreckI donâ€™t even know what to say. Iâ€™m exhausted and hopeless. Iâ€™ve got anxiety, depression, OCD and an eating disorder and I feel fucked up beyond belief. I guess I just want to rant and feel like somebody actually cares out there. 

I keep fantasizing about stabbing my torso and legs with a steak knife, and I have no clue if thatâ€™s my suicidal ideation or my OCD talking. I just want someone to listen and care, but I feel like such a burden Iâ€™d rather just shut everyone out. 

I should have a great life. I have friends, a boyfriend, a stable house and a family, and yet Iâ€™m just wallowing in my own depression and anxiety. I feel selfish and oh so alone. I just want to feel like someone actually cares.
