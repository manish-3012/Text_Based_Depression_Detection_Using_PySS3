I woke up from a dreamI woke up in the middle of the night after having a dream that I died. I woke up and my heart was pounding. I thought I was gonna die. A part of me was happy that I could in peace, without my family watching. I even wrote a goodbye note. I didnâ€™t want it to be cheesy or depressing, so the note was straightforward and full of heart. I was scared to die. Looking back, my life was emptier than empty. An echo of an a echo. I was afraid to die. I went to sleep and woke up at 12:30 pm. It was 30 minutes ago. And Iâ€™m filled with joy and disappointment. Anger and frustration. Nothing really changed, because I donâ€™t wanna die and I just want a reason to live. Oh well, at least I get to watch the Attack on Titan season finale.
