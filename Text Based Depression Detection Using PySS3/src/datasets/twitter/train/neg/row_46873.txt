I don't really have a good reason to be depressed

I'm just stuck in a perpetual state of loneliness and sadness.  I feel this extremely strong drive to just end it and it's scaring me.  I've already made plans, set the date.  I'm going to go to the bay by my house and swim out as far as I can.  I'll either drown or starve, or get eaten by sharks, I don't know and I don't care.  It will be peaceful out there.  I'll bring one day flare and one night flare if I change my mind.  Regardless, I'll try to shoot one or the other off when I feel the end is near so they'll have an easier time finding the body.

We can't afford therapy, and we've already tried pills.  If I tell my parents they'll only plunge themselves into more debt trying to fix me.  My friends ignore my hints.  I tried telling one of them but it didn't go so well.

I don't know.  I might not do it this year.  Maybe 2019.  I don't know
