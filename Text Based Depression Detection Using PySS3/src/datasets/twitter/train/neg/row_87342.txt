There's nothing going on in my life yet it's too much for me to bearI'm a dropout and just lie around all day yet I can't handle my thoughts anymore, nothing is fun anymore, my antidepressants suddenly stopped working and the only thing calming me down is smoking but I have almost no acces to cigarettes, I can't vent to a professional because I can't go back to psych ward, I hated it there... I'm thinking about returning to school next year to have less time to think but the thought makes me feel sometimes horrible and sometimes calm... I wish I had the courage to go through my plan...
