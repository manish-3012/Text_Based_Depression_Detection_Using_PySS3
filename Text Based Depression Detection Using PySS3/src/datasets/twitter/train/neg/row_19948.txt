I cannot take it anymoreQuarantine is killing me.
I donâ€™t know what to do anymore..
I live together with my â€œloveâ€ in my parents house
Long story short: we took him in bc abuse at his place

Now, heâ€™s abusing me. Verbally. Constantly making me feel like shit.
When there was no quarantine, i had school to keep my mind clear,
Now thereâ€™s nothing. Nothing to do, nothing to see. Just a dark cloud and the constant hate.. 
I used to have a dog, she kept me alive for a while


I want to see her again...
Iâ€™m just scared of the pain.
