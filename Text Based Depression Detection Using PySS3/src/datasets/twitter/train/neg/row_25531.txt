i have all the materials for suicide. i could die right fucking now if i wanted to. what's the point?my grades are shit, my life feels like shit. i've relapsed, i starve and cut myself. i do drugs regularly. i cant concentrate in class from malnutrition. i cant do anything. im highly dependent on my antidepressants, without them i am a mess 24/7. i hate myself and my body. 

im not even 14 yet and i'm already a pathetic waste of air.
