RecentlyIt has come to my attention that perhaps giving up is the best option.

I havenâ€™t been happy in a long time and all I see are things being broken right in front of me - heart, trust, relationships, happiness..that I am tired of fixing or mending it all. Iâ€™m always the one being hurt nowadays and I think I had enough..iâ€™m too hollow now. I want to say my final goodbyes to the ones that mean dear to me..this world has been relentless at beating me down, and quite frankly Iâ€™m too tired to get back up anymore.
