Help. CPS took my kids.I'm on the line between "Without them what do I live for?" and "I can't die, that will break my daughter's heart."
I can't believe I fucked up this bad. I don't know what to do.

edit: I think I have an undiagnosed/misdiagnosed personality disorder. Maybe I should just be committed.
