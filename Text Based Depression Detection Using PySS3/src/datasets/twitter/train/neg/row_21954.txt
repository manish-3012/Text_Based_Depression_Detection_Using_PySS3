It will all be over soon so wait for itFor everyone out there suffering the degree of pain i'm suffering right now i sincerely wish you'd die as soon as possible because i know very well the hell on earth you're living through and i think you have to die as i have to die too. As for myself i know i won't die right now because death is too good for me and unfortunately i cannot kill myself right now, not because i'm afraid or still have hope, but because it's literally out of my control. I know that i won't last 5 years anyways because of how hellish i feel inside. It's impossible for a human body to take all that stress, sadness, despair and keep going for more than 10 years maximum without killing itself with a heart attack or something to escape the pain. So here i'am waiting for it, it will come soon, soon, so wait with me and we will all die soon don't worry it will be all over.
