My sister is moving out. Canâ€™t afford rent alone. I will off myself once she leavesBc of my depression and nihilistic way of thinking, Iâ€™m not the best roommate. I have debilitating depression and anxiety. I donâ€™t work that much bc of it. I can go on and on but I just need a plan on how to do it. My mother wants to put me in a mental hospital. I have no desire to get help. Iâ€™ve been trying to get help for almost a decade now. Idk why Iâ€™m posting this.
