Does anyone else get that feeling that you just wish you had never been born?I honestly think everyone's lives would be easier and better if I didn't exist. I put my marriage in jeopardy by allowing my depression to influence my lifestyle. I'm terrified she's going to leave, and if she does I just don't know if I'm going to make it.
