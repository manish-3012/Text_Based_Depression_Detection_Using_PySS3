Sick of Living, Tired of PainI feel close to a breaking point. It doesn't seem to matter how much I try to do the right things to improve my life.
I still wind up back feeling like this, like I would rather cease all sensation than bear the pain of being present in my life any longer.

The only thing that makes me feel whole is cannabis and it's illegal in my country. I also live with my parents who are 'good, kind, Christian folk' who are loved and accepting, until it's something against the law then it's clearly wrong and so is anyone who does it. Whether it's  their own son or not. So yeah my one real respite in this world is something I have to break the law to get, putting myself at risk, causing me stress and I get judged by my own family for trying to escape my pain.  Maybe they are actually arrogant enough to think them showing me some kindness is enough. 

I get herb from the dark web and it would be so easy to find some Fentanyl and go out on an OD.  Can't stop thinking about making an order.
