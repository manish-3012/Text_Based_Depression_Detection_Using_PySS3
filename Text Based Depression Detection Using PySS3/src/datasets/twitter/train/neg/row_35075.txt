My life is hanging by a threadI was a grown in Jehovah's witness, my parents got in this cult when I was two years old and they started to fade out of it when I was approximately 13. Problem is, you can't simply get out of a cult that quick. At 15, when my father died, I was thinking I would come back one day or the other because I still believed all their shits. As a result, I was filled with anxiety and fears and I was socially impaired. Anyway, I still wanted to come back because two of my older sisters were (and are still) in the cult and it's not that easy to remove all the crazy thoughts they implant in your mind. The reason why I didn't come back was because I wanted to go to college, so I did and I learned tons of things especially regarding logical fallacies. I decided I did not want to come back but I was still (and I'm still) filled with anxiety. I have to take medication to alleviate this anxiety and right now, I don't even have the money to buy those pills. They ruined my life and my life, right now, is going down the drain. I'm just a 32 years old guy filled with anxiety and social phobia, out of job and money. In fact, I received a letter today telling me that my unemployment insurance may be cut. Everyday, it's becoming darker and darker and I'm slipping into depressing thoughts. When I was 28, I had the hope I could become a social service worker, so I got a degree (doing it part time) and I worked for 4 years. But now, in 2015, I tried to get a new job, jobs are available but every time I'm called for an interview, they tell me afterward that I'm lacking self-assurance. So, here I am, with more anxiety than ever because I don't even know if I'll be able to buy milk. I don't know what I'm going to do next, I just want to end this pain and this struggle to survive everyday with the feeling that I can't do anything worthy because of social anxiety.
