I'm Lost, I'm Giving Up, I Think It's Too Late**A way too brief history, for context (discretion advised):**

I started self harming in 5th grade, about 10 years old, as a result of intense bullying. When I got to **middle school** things got even worse. My status was clear. I ate lunch in the bathroom, was never picked for groups, the only words that came out of my mouth all day were those in the pledge of allegiance. I was the butt of every joke and target of every rumor, and nobody seemed to care. As a result I tried to kill myself three times during my 7th grade year. 

The first time was hanging, but the rope snapped. The second was gunshot, but I couldn't find the key to unlock the trigger guard. The third time I dug a pair of scissors in my wrist, but I woke up. While I no longer have the scars the memory stuck with me. 

Now, I don't know if you've *seriously* cut your wrist but I certainly hope you haven't. Myself and my self harming brothers and sisters know that shit never leaves you.

When my family found out about my suicide attempts *they didn't believe me.*

When I got to **high school** my world collapsed. As a result of my suicide attempts, and subsequent follow-up attempts, although to a lesser degree, my sanity began to fade. I began feeling and seeing blood and scars on my wrist even though it had healed. I've since been diagnosed with PTSD and schizoaffective disorder. Regardless, I would wear bandages to school to cover the self harm in addition to my worsening hallucinations. For example, I took a physics test and before I could start the second page I couldn't see the test as it, my sleeve, desk, and floor, was covered in blood.

I did, however, manage two girlfriends. The first accused me of sexually assaulting her/raping her after a long and difficult period of her mentally abusing me (threatening to kill herself if I left, demanding constant attention, building up her emotions and exploding at me). My next girlfriend, who I dated for 3 years, was amazing. I fantasized about being with her from the moment I saw here in class and when we first kissed during a singing lesson we knew we were in love. But, she left me. The only person I've ever spoken to this about, aside from you all and my therapist, left me for a fitter, smarter, better man. I will never forget what she said when she left me: 

"you were my first true love." 

But not your last.

We broke up almost a year ago.

**My problem:**

I am currently 21 and single. Not a day's gone by since I was 10 where I haven't thought of cutting or killing myself. My dream girl is with another man and my other ex is out there *still* spreading false rumors of my sexual conduct. My wrist hurts and no one is there to hold it, or me. I don't hallucinate as much anymore but still feel the pain. Even now I have to hold back tears and keep my mind off my wrist and the cutting, dripping, sensation it brings. I don't intend for this post to be a pity party, but I think, as my therapist does, that sharing is important.

The reason I'm posting is to... I'm not really sure. I want to kill myself. That's a given. But I don't know anything else. I have nothing to look forward too. I know in my heart that my love life will never be as good, especially as I and my prospective partners age. My youth was stolen and my prospects are fading. I feel as if I peaked with my fiancÃ© (we planned to marry) sometime in 2018. The only small consolation I have is that somewhere, in another universe, she and I are still very happy. But, here, right now, I feel as if I'm going to kill myself. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow. 

But soon.

**Follow up:**

I don't know what I want to hear, maybe I don't want to hear anything. Either way, do with this what you will. I'll answer literally any question and respond dutifully, but in the end I don't know what difference it will make.
