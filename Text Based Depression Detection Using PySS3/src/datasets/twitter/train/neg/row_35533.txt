Crisis text will only talk to you every other day.When you text 741741 they auto respond with a message that you can only text with them for 45 minutes at a time, every 48 hours.  No idea if the hold time counts. 

Thanks assholes. What would I do without waiting around for your shitty resources and two-hour long hold time.

I guess the only option left is to kill myself. Everyone abandoned me.  And don't @me with that "it gets better go to therapy" shit.  Not all problems are temporary.
