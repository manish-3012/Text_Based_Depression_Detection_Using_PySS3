Intentional OverdoseHow exquisite corpse she had, a decomposing body locked in the recesses of an old apartment. She laid curled up in a blanket unmoving, four white walls caged her here for eternity. When the smell grew too foul, the roommates called the building manager. When they broke in to find a black tar like substance and little bags throughout the room, a crushed white substance and tablets all over the bed with rolled up bills near her hand and the jewel atop it all a dead body. Her family non-existent, her old lovers uncaring, and her friends, who were they again? It was all quite a selfish affair, I mean the PR storm and the clean-up. I'd hate to be the janitor, yeesh. I have a few more days until I get enough Heroin, Xanax, and Alcohol. I was thinking 500mg Heroin, 10mg Xanax, and as much Alcohol I can down before passing out. Whatever happens happens.
