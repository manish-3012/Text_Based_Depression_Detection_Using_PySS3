I'm doneI'm fucked up, I keep fucking up, and I will fuck up again. Maybe I'll have to do this again because my life keeps fucking up and I have no control over it. 

All the advice from those books I've read-- even the stupid profound ones like Siddhartha, Fuck Feelings and Mans Search for Meaning-- do not help. None of this bs has helped me because I am unable to know how to correctly put effort in. I can't do this anymore. I have to die.
