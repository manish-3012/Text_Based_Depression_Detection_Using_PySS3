I am bored to death.I can't think of a single thing I actually want to do. Even when I bring myself to do things like paint, play video games or make music, it's not very fun and I usually lose focus very quickly. Everything is just *fine*, never exciting or entertaining. I really miss actually enjoying things. What is the point of being alive if nothing brings me any joy at all?
