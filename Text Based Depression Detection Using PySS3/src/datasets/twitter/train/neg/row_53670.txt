Need an honest opinionI'll keep this as brief as my emotions allow. 

Is it selfish to want to die, even if you are sure that there is no way you could live peacefully with your past? I feel like I've already died and buried my soul. As if my heart is beating out of spite. There are good days and bad days, but underneath it all, there is nothing. I don't feel anything anymore, emotionally, except for self hatred. 
I've done it to myself of course, ruined any chance I had at finding a partner, a friend. I'm terrified of people, so I am alone. Being alone is hard, but, being alone with yourself, with nothing but your own thoughts as company, well, even more so. 
So, is it selfish to just simply want to end it? Is it cowardly? I've no one left to cry for me when I'm gone. My future doesn't look so great either. 
Thing is, I'm scared. What happens when we die? What if there is an afterlife and I'm stuck in a hell, how would one know which "religion" is true? Weird thing is, I'm not scared of "hell", but rather the notion of dying itself. It seems so painful and undignified and yet, its all I can hope for. 
Perhaps it would be better that no afterlife waits for me, and that I simply cease to be. In its own way, nonexistence is a heaven. No pain, no anything. 
My therapist told me to think positive thoughts, and I tried. Best I could come up with was "more air for the people that matter, more food and shelter"
The best thing I will ever do for the human race, is end my life, because in doing so, I may give another person, a better person a chance at life, like Will Smith and the Jellyfish. Except, that Will Smith played a much better person than I am in real life. That is my happy place, knowing that from my body, I can give life to someone who wants to live, who loves and is loved, someone that matters. 
I've written enough, I guess. If there is a God, let God speak to me soon, I really can't do this much longer, or can I? I just don't know
