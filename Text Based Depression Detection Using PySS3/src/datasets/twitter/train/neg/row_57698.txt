Help, pleaseI've been here before, but this time it's worse, I'm constantly emotionally and physically drained, I'm having mental breakdowns every day, I'll find myself just bawling my eyes out randomly for no reason other than exhaustion. I feel like I'm just a burden to everyone I know. I genuinely think it'd be better, not only for myself, but for everyone I know, if I wasn't here....
