I just moved to a new area with lots of bridges and water. I canâ€™t afford my medication because of the transition of movingIâ€™ve been off of my medication for almost 2 weeks. I was doing alright but I can feel the darkness creeping back into me. Iâ€™ve been working out and sleeping enough. I feel like itâ€™s inevitable and I canâ€™t get over how easy it would be to jump off one of the bridges here. I should be able to get in to see a doctor soon but I am in a bad place and it hurts even worse knowing that this is my natural state. Above everything, I should be happy right now and now I believe that there is nothing that will do it for me. Please help
