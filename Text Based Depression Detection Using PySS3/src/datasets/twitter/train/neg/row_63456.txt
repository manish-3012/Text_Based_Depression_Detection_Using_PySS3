I'm going to end it all... if not tonight, then soonI'm done. I just turned 20. I'm a fat nearly 300 lbs cow, I'm a spending addict because Im trying to fill in that void in my soul, and I'm scared im becoming a narcissist, and I DON'T want to be that. I've read enough of those horror stories on that subreddit. I'm exhausted. the only reasons I haven't done it yet are because im a coward, we just had a death in the family (not suicide), and because I work with little kids and the school is depending on my pair of hands being there to help from 3 to 6. College sucks ASS, I've never felt stupider. No matter what ways i've tried to lose weight, i always end up getting depressed and then using food to cope, which leads to more weight gain. I've been told in no uncertain terms that I'm the size of a cow and that as an Armenian, no Armenian man will ever want to marry a fat cow like me, or that "you could be so pretty if you lost weight!". I know my coworkers worry about my weight, and that my bitch aunts talk about it behind my back. I never seem to have enough money for my ambitions. I live in Los Angeles, and our fucking politicians tax us on everything so i can't afford to move out. I will never become anything worthy, so why waste the oxygen? IDK if i will do anything tonight because i'm so tired, but it's definitely there.
