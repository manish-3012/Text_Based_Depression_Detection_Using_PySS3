I feel like a monsterI cant bear people looking at me l am so discusting to look at . I am 20lbs overweight ( working on it but have bulimia)gender confused freak  l m covered in scars and have a shitty personality  no one should ever have to look at someyhing this discusting. 
Im  stupid lazy and probably abusive in my anger , not violently but verbally . 
I feel disconnected from reality and the small moment i feel like im "awake" are scary . I feel like l dont exist and everything is fake . 
I have brought nothing but misery in my wake l am a bad person and the fact l know people will be hurt when l die makes me feel like a monster because l know my suicide in inevitable . 
" All l am is a leach . A parasite ,the machinations of a dying light that has never done anything deserving of adoration in the stint of it's pathetic existance . "- the thing that describes me the best .
