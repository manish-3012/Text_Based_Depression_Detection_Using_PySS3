Suicidal rantMy parents don't know anything about me failing college. It's about time to tell them. They've been paying for everything. I'm not sure if I'll be able to find and sustain a job or start in a new course and keep up. I have horrible social anxiety that transforms into general mistrust of others, no faith in humanity and nihilism. I have dreams and passions I'm good at, passions I always wanted to turn into careers but I'm lucid enough to know that it's like trying to win a lottery. I don't see any point nor meaning in my life aside them. I confront all this on a daily basis which makes me unable to do things I need and want to do. Suicide is often on my mind, as an expression of guilt, hopelessness, sometimes a proof of my commitment or an odd motivator. It's become increasingly hard to just keep living. I'm alone in all this, people understand me and try to change me for my own good but I know that I can't change. I'd rather kill myself than aim for a pointless life of suffering.
