I give upItâ€™s pretty sad you know. I try hard and always fail. I hate the life I was given, and I know that Iâ€™ll be in hell. Sad that Iâ€™m going to die a virgin, that I wonâ€™t ever experience what itâ€™s like to be a mother and get married, to fall in love and learn to love life. But I just canâ€™t do it anymore. For me life is pretty shitty. Canâ€™t afford school and Iâ€™ve tried therapy as well. The one thing, the one final thing that made me happy was taken away from me. I just canâ€™t do it anymore. I hate it here. I fucking hate it here. I hate it. I hate it. Itâ€™s terrible. I just want a best friend. Someone who cares for me. I just canâ€™t do life anymore. It sucks, and Iâ€™ve accepted my fate of going to hell. I know itâ€™ll be terrible but...it is what it is.
