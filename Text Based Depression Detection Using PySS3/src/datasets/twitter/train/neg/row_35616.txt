I've thought about it.Im young, 14 years old and I feel like life already hates me. Im asian, and of course my parents want me to "be the best" and "get straight A's" but i don't care about that. I want to enjoy my life, follow my passion (animation) and hang out with mu friends. Life wasn't the best but then it happened. On the last day of Thanksgiving break, my mom pulled me over and told me my Dad was doing drugs. To some people this might not be much, but in the place i live in, smoking is uncommon. When I was told this, it hit me like a bullet. I didn't know how to feel but my mom just said "we need to encourage him to get out of the bad habit". This went on for about 2 months before my dad said something - he wanted a divorce. Later we found him doing drugs in our house and my mom kicked him out. I really don't know what to think. On top of this shit i get bullied at school. Every day someone flips my lock, and people call me a faggot. I don't know what to do, what to think. I've considered suicide but I just don't know. Please. Help me.
