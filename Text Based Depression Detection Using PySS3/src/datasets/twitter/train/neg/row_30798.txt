Sick of feeling thisI feel so lost in sadness and anger every single day. I have nobody around that gives the slightest sign of caring about or understanding me and live in a shithole with no way to leave for years. All I want is to have one person to meaningfully. I only ever felt loved when I had a girlfriend and when she left I just had no one again. I miss feeling so close to someone, everybody else feels so cold towards me.

It hurts to just go to bed because I miss having her beside me and cuddling to sleep. Nothing else mattered in that moment and I felt warmth for once. All I have that I can connect to is music. I just wish I could belong somewhere, I'm just drifting through life until I finally break.
