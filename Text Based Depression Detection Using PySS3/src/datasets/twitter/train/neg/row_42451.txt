House of cardsI just can't do it anymore... I got my girlfriend pregnant. The  relationship ended because she became hormonal af. Tried to run me over, punched me, tried to kill us in the car. So I had to throw her out. Which she resented me for but I couldn't deal with the abuse (pregnant or not). Been miserable about being a single father. She doesn't want to work things out. I bought a house for us and the kid but she doesn't want it nor me. I do NOT want to be a single father. I know the child will need me (maybe). Ive been giving my baby momma $100 a week for support in hoping it will rekindle us enough to get support. She doesn't want to be anything more than co-parents. I've been single and miserable for over the last 30 days. Miserable for far longer. I am the happiest being around people and I've been so miserable since I've moved out of state.  


On the surface my life is great: Nice car, new house, really stellar job with great pay. I have money in the bank. I'm attractive with a nice dick (so Im told). I am just miserable and I'm just tired of life. GOD I AM SO TIRED. The unhappiness and hopelessness has never been greater. I've tried connecting with my spiritual side which helps but I can't keep hold. I've tried to hold on to faith (spiritually not religiously). I try so hard to manifest happiness but every thing just blows over. Working from home leaves me so alone... I'm almost 32, my birthday is in couple of weeks and I have no one to spend it with. I keep going through periods of brief happiness then something happens and Im recovering my mental health for most of the year. I might be 3 months of happy followed by 6-9 months of misery. It's been this way for as far as I can remember. I just want it all to end. The only thing stopping me from eating a bullet is how unhappy my family would be (they're out of state). I do wish for death from some outside force.
