What's holding me back?I was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder a year and a half ago, after very nearly attempting suicide. The meds have been extremely helpful, but only enough to level things out just a bit; the symptoms aren't fully treated, I'd say. Still, though, I find myself stuck in the comfort of silent suffering, which is what held me back from seeking help the first time around, and it's begun to exhaust me. I'm tired of being thrust into happiness and being quickly shrouded in depression a few days later. I don't know who I am, and I can never know what to attribute my emotions to: depression, a bad day, hypomania, a really good day? Such things anger me to a great extent, which is equally distressing, especially when I unrightfully shout at others. I'm 20 years old, and I'm not so sure I can live in chaos for the rest f my natural life. An artificial, self-imposed end, though, I could find much more agreeable.
