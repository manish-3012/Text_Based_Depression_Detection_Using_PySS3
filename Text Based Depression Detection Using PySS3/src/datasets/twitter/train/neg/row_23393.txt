Finish the raceMy life isn't bad, I make it that way. I race cars so that I can tell myself things are okay, being on the brink of death every day kinda of let's me feel like I am having fun but at the same time if it ends badly I would be just as happy, I do what I love to it's fullest extent because it temporarily let's me be free of the voices inside my head. There are days where I am genuinely happy, but then I see what this world has come to as if I don't live on this planet and I think "Why would anyone want to live in a place where we make up our own rules and then tell others that they are wrong for not following them". Every day I don't try to tell myself this, but I WANT to tell myself "Be your best so you can change atleast one person's mind about this crappy world".
We live in a lie telling ourselves it isn't all bad, but when it comes down to it there are only two rules... Do or Do not, is or is not, exist or do not, this applies to literally everything, those feelings in between are just things to fill the gap inside our heads so we don't end it too quick. If I can be alive long enough for my next tattoo I want it to say "Please finish the race", and I have to add the please because at this point I have to beg myself not to do it before it gets worse. Tonight is the one time the voices stopped and I felt bliss, the feeling of just listening to the trees and the wind and the crickets chirping, I want all this suffering to stop, for myself and the rest of the world, I am not religious but I asked god when I was younger for the ability to take other people's pain away and to give it to myself in the Hope's I can make the world a better place... I didnt realise the world was hurting this bad...
