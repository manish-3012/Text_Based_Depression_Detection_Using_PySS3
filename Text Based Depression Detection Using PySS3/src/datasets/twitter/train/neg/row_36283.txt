I could use a friend...Where to begin.... Iâ€™m 30 years old, A military veteran and ever since coming home from the service in 2011, Iâ€™ve had a consistent struggle to find happiness. Late 2013 I made three attempts on my life in the same day: lethal limits of alcohol, crashing my car 100 mph into a tree without a seat belt, and then finally I had used my 9mm glock to try and end the pain...

 In my drunken stupor I missed my heart and most vital organs, however I had clipped my lung and woke up in harbor view hospital a week later crying out to God â€œwhy the fuck am I still alive?!â€

2015 I finally found my purpose in Nursing... it was like I finally found my purpose for living in life, and had hope for a future going to school and working as a CNA. I had happiness in life, and felt like the world was brighter.

Last year, I made some poor decisions for a woman I thought was to be my wife.. I moved to be closer to her (back home in Seattle) and I dropped out of school, and got a job that pays well in order to survive (pay bills). However, we separated six months ago, and this job isnâ€™t what I want for my future as much as I need it at the moment to be successful... those old feelings are flooding back, and most nights I donâ€™t sleep at all because all I can think about is checking out... It got to the point 4 months ago that I had a shotgun barrel in my mouth, and toe on a trigger while fully clothed in a bathtub, and a lot of fear in my heart.
