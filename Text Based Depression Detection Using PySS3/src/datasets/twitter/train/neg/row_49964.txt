PleaseI'm eightteen, and a drug addict and i don't feel like i want to be here when the sun rises in the morning. I don't want to deal with this anymore. I know this is puerile and desperate but i feel overwhelmingly conflicted and confused about what i should do. Please, i just want someone to talk to. If anyone understands hard drug addiction.. i need to know what i should do.
