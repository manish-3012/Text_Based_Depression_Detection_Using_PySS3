Dating for a week, then she just disappeared.I was taking this girl out on a date for a week, we met up three times and I honestly had one of the best times of my life, she was absolutely beautiful and we got along very well. Took her out to eat, went to the movies and she was all over me, cuddly, affectionate and seemed compassionate.

I stayed at her house and we ended up getting intimate, it was like an angel graced my presence, unfortunately I kinda of let the "I love you" slip out and kind of made her back off. 

We talked a bit about it and I apologized for coming on so strong and that we can take it slow. The following day we made plans to hang out and I asked when she said: "Whenever."

That is the last time I have heard from her, my heart feels like it is going to explode and my suicidal thoughts are racing.

I fell head over heels for this girl and she was really into me too, then just left like nothing.

Fuck this hurts.
