Why should I have to live for others?Itâ€™s pretty convenient stating that youâ€™ll support me for the rest of your life when youâ€™re the one whoâ€™s doing okey. I have to be this bipolar crazy and sad for the rest of my life. Iâ€™m the one who canâ€™t finish a high school diploma or get a permanent full time job. Iâ€™m the one who has to feel shitty for the rest of my life so that you can have me in yours. If I die, you wonâ€™t have that pressure on you to check up on me, support me or even babysit me. No more difficult behaviour or fights. Youâ€™ll feel sad for a while but youâ€™ll get over it because youâ€™ll know that Iâ€™d be happier in death than in life. Like wtf, how am I the who is selfish when Iâ€™m the one whoâ€™s got to live this way. Youâ€™re selfish for keeping me here. And Iâ€™m so done with all this bs.
