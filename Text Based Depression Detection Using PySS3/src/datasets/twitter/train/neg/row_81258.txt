I'm 26 yr old trans aspie and I feel completely lost and isolated in this world.I want to die. I didn't do anything to deserve this life of isolation and loneliness. When I loved out of my parents two years ago, I had hope. I though it was a matter of reaching out to people. Over the last year's years any illusion of this has collasped and I don't see any hope for the future, and worst I feel like having any hope will just lead to more pain in the future. The chances I go through with it are astronomically low, but I never asked to enter this world or be like I am, I owe it nothing least of all my continued existence. I've been seriously trying to think of ways to bolster my resolve to go through with it.
