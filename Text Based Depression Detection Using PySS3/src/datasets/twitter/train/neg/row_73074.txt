I failedI have spent a large portion of my non-working life on this sub-reddit trying to convince people not to commit suicide (I use a separate account for that everything else, and am posting on the everything else one). The only problem is, despite not violating any of the guidelines to prevent someone from doing more harm than good I don't think I have ever saved anyone's life. I have the blood of those who have killed themselves on my hands. I want to take my own life to apologise to those I have killed, and have half an hour until my room mate wakes up.
