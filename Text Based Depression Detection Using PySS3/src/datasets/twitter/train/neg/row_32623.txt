LonelyI am being abandoned since my childhood, my parents abandoned me , I was struggling and found the best friend of my life and almost after 10 years she passed away and now I am all alone , got no friends online or offline. I live alone had 2 dogs and they passed away too. Iâ€™m self employed doing good with considerable work. During work I stay busy but after work tough life starts. Earlier I used to come home and my dogs would jump and hug me. And I was like wow my boys and now I donâ€™t have anyone to share my life with.
