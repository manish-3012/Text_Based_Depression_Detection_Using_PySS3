I donâ€™t think I can do it any longerEveryone walks past and thinks Iâ€™m lazy or unmotivated but they have no clue I love life and I want to be happy but everyone around me doesnâ€™t take me seriously in anything I do all my brain is anymore is just jumbled thoughts and being worried all day the only keeping me alive is my cat my mom called me a piece of shit the other day and itâ€™s really starting to sit that I am and that Iâ€™m a waste and a failure
