At the end of the lineStruggling these past few months. I feel like I'm at the end of the line and really don't know what to do. Lost my health insurance in January and it's kind of been a downward spiral since then. I'm extremely depressed but don't have the money to get to the doctor. Was paying the bills through an online job that I was laid off from last month. Tried to do some uber/food delivery work but my car broke down and I don't have the money to fix it. My back went out two days ago and I've barely been able to stand or even sit up the past few days. I don't know how I'm going to pay my rent this month. I feel like a failure. I can never seem to get my head above water. I've spent so many days just lying in bed this month when I should have been applying to more jobs, going to interviews, coming up with some money somehow to at least pay my rent. I'm almost 30 years old and I'm still struggling with this basic shit. I have no friends, no life, no nothing. I have -$4 in my checking account and serious debt. My whole adult life has just been a struggle to keep my head above water and I can't even do the basics. I can't keep keep doing this year after year, I'm just not made for it. There is just too much on my plate and I can't seem to do any of it. Basic things that are just normal life for everyone else are a fucking millstone around my neck. I will be homeless in under a month and I choose to just die instead. I honestly don't want to die but living is just too fucking painful.... I can't keep doing it day after day. I have no motivation in me whatsoever and it's just over I think.
