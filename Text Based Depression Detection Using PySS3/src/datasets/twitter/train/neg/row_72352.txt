Whatâ€™d you have done, if you knew that this is what life would be like for you?If you were a child, and somehow you could see it all unfold, like in a vision. 

I would run, run as far away as I could. But, then Iâ€™d realize there was nowhere to go. Would I even be able to comprehend, that a person could get so diseased and deformed, and that I would be that person. 

I told my mom when she was screaming at me to have fun writing my obituary in between my sobs. She said she will. She will. Will she? 

I wish I could go back, take me away, or make myself stronger. My little brother needed me but I was too gone to help him. Now heâ€™s almost an adult, and itâ€™s too late. I never imagined as a kid that my life would be this, for years and years would be this. Iâ€™m just a disease, a rabid animal, thatâ€™s how I was treated, and thatâ€™s all I am.
