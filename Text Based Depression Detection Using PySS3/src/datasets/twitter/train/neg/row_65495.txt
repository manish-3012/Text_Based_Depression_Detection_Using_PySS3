So i learned how to make a hangsman's noose...well i guess everything is set, my notes are done, my "will" at place. what's left now is just doing the deed. I'm going to spend as much time as i can with my family tomorrow, i already said goodbye to my friends and probably do it in the middle of the night...

...i really don't wanna do this, i take absolutely no joy in inflicting this much pain to the people i care about, but life just keeps putting me in inescapable shitty and depressive situations. I'm sorry but, i just can't go any farther.
