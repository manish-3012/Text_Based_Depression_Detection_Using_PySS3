i want to dieIâ€™ve recently been released from jail, and am now a homeless, felon, veteran who seems to have fallen through the cracks when it pertains to any sort of assistance.  I have 3 days left of my prozac, and have lost all hope.  Iâ€™m 36, and feel like Iâ€™ve wasted most of my life.  My wife left me two years ago, and Iâ€™ve just recently lost the most amazing girlfriend ever.  Iâ€™m recovering from heroine addiction, and have nothing else to live for.  I have no family that will speak to me, Iâ€™ve hurt and pushed away all but one friend.  I have no job, no money, and no reason to keep moving on.  i started walking towards a bridge thatâ€™s about 25 miles away. Itâ€™s 191 feet tall so I figure that will be high enough to take care of the job.  A friend happened to drive past me and stopped and convinced me to stay the night in her parents garage, but tomorrow Iâ€™m pretty sure the best thing for everyone involved is for me to end it.  Iâ€™m so tired of being a burden on society.  Iâ€™ve ruined every opportunity Iâ€™ve ever had in life, and Iâ€™ve run out of options.  I just wanted to tell someone before I did it.
