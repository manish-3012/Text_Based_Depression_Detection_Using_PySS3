I want to die, because what's the f*cking point of livingEverytime, every freaking time my dad gives me his opinion on something my sister or I did, he has to remind how cruel real life is and how things like "doing what I like" is bullsh*t.

And is on really stupid stuff and maybe I'm being overdramatic but f****ck!!!. Today my sister showed him her new ear piercings helix style, and he went on and on about how first impression matter most, and how she was creating unnecesary obstacles in her life, and he basically implied that she should let her hair longer so she  does not get misgendered.

So yeah it is not the first time we get this talk, and every time I end up thinking "Yeah what is f*cking point of living if I can't do what I like and I'm obligated to live my life trying to please everyone, ignoring what I like, because that is convenient and that is how life is".

So yeah I kind of want to die right now and save me the problems.
