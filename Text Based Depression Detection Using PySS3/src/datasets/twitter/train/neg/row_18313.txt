Everyday I get a stronger urge
Using my throwaway.  

Iâ€™m so tired of being strong. 
No one cares about me. 
I hurt so much inside. Iâ€™ve lost so much. Everyday I get up and fight for my kids sake. But they would be better off with out me. Each day I know is a day closer. This emptiness is killing me. 
Iâ€™m crying out for help. For anyone to notice my pain. To save me. 

No one comes to help. They only chip away and take. Until I am an empty vessel. 

So here I am. Wondering if I take these pills will my kids be able to unlock the door for help?
