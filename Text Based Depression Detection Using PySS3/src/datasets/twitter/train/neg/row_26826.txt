I'm alive after my attempt and not happy about it.If there was one thing I could do right, it could have at least been fucking killing myself. Now I'm just in pain. Physical and emotional, and feeling worse than before my attempt. If I wasn't in physical pain I'd have attempted again already. I'm literally fucking crying because I didn't die and if that isn't pathetic I don't know what is. Not to mention my feelings of impending doom from the anxiety I now have about upcoming events. I wish someone would shoot me. I wish God would've killed me when I asked him as a kid. I wish I had had balls and didn't back down from my first attempt when I was 10.
