Help me tread water* I'm not actively suicidal, and I am afraid of self-harm.
* I still find a way to enjoy simple things, however I am extremely unmotivated and in the "what's the point?" mindset. It has been this way for a while and March will be the 10th month.
* I gave up my job 2 years ago, been working part-time and currently at a low of about one 10-12 hour shift per month. I hate my job/career, it is people-intensive and there are no adequate breaks, lots of physical and emotional burnout even after one shift.
* Living at parents' home as a 35 year old

At least it's sunny today in this ugly rat-race gray winter city...I'll be taking a walk to the park with my podcast. Not in any kind of therapy or counseling.

Besides that...what do you recommend to tread water, push through the dark phase? I've been hoping and waiting for a sense of motivation and purpose to come back, I still get hit with crying spells (of guilt and sadness) from my partner leaving me last year.
