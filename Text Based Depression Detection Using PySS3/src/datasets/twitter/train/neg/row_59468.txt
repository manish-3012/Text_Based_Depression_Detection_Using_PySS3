Wanting to try again and correctly this timeI overdosed two months ago on allergy medicine as a suicide attempt. I was taken to the emergency room and to the psych ward. I remember texting people I thought who cared about me that I was ready to die, but no one was there for me. I remember holding the pills in my hand and swallowing them, just waiting to go. Iâ€™m contemplating a suicide again, the only thing stopping me is whether the overdose would be enough for my body to stop. Everything just seems wrong in my life. Iâ€™ve failed my academics, and I tried to transfer into my dream university to study art but eventually declined bc I couldnâ€™t afford tuition. I have no one at my university, and I have no one in my hometown. Iâ€™m a burden to my family, and Iâ€™m a burden on everyone. I trouble everyone in my life, and no one understands my depression anymore. And I really think it wouldnâ€™t hurt that much, and eventually, everyone would move on. So I really do think itâ€™s the best option. Iâ€™m nothing anymore, and no one will ever love me. I feel like the most unwanted person, everyone just leaves.
