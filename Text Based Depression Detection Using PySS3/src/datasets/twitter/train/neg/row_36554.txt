Nearly killed myself a few years ago, and I often wish I had done it.I had been gradually waking up from my indoctrination as one of Jehovah's Witnesses. It felt like the world was falling apart around me. It kinda was. I have never felt so completely alone. I felt so isolated I may as well have been looking at earth from across the solar system. I went to my parents' room and found my mom's handgun, I took it to my room, sat on the floor, and looked at it. I started to do it a few times, but I just couldn't. I was too afraid. I kept thinking about my little sister and how much I would hurt her. I resent her for that now? I guess? Like, I wish that she cared less, so that I could have just gone. I wish I had. So many "good" things have happened since then and none of it stops me from wishing that I had ended my life that night. Life is misery and pain and sadness. I'm surrounded by people and completely alone. I don't know how to describe this feeling without sounding like a sad Disney teen. Everything is so unimaginably shitty and I can't see how any of it ever gets any better. People just don't care about one another. We're all so full of hate. So selfish. I wish I hadn't been here to see it. I wish I hadn't been such a coward.

If my partner sees this. I love you. I truly, deeply love you more than I know how to express. You have brought so much happiness and joy to my life, thank you. But I'm just so broken. I am completely broken and I don't know if I'll ever be better.

We're drowning in shit and no one cares. All we have is this little corner carved out of all the shit where we can sometimes pretend that things are okay, and that it'll all be better someday, and now we don't even get to be safe here.

I don't know if I can do this anymore. I haven't wanted to for a long time.
