I don't see a point anymoreI just don't see a point to living anymore. My clinical depression and grief have consumed me. All I get enjoyment from anymore is trolling the fuck out of people on here.

I don't even enjoy weed anymore. The one thing that helped me see the good in people and made me love life has stopped working.

I just want to end it all and be with my mom who recently passed.

I'm probably gonna be readmitted within a week or two because I just can't do this anymore. I just want to either die or just be in bed all day.
