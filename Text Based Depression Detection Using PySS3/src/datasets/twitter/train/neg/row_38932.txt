PLEAE READ!!!So I used to live in west Africa as part of my dads job. (I am American) but i told my school counselor there I was going to kill myself. The embassy there intervened, threatened to sedate me and put me on a plane to Washington DC for a psychiatric facility. I was there for 4 weeks and then I was discharged. Now, I live in America with just my mom. ( the rest of my family is still in Africa) and life is worse than ever. We are not allowed to go back and I never even got to say goodbye to my best friend.  Thatâ€™s my story, and Iâ€™m putting it here because soon I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll be around to tell it. 

P.S. the therapy and counseling did not help. At all.
