My boyfriend knows about the thoughts Iâ€™ve been having, and wants to send me to a mental health facility. I donâ€™t know what to do, so Iâ€™m just here I guess.I was at work, going over the options I had to make an attempt. Wanted it to be a guaranteed thing but also painless. Didnâ€™t want to OD, too painful and hellish based on the accounts Iâ€™ve read here. No access to a gun. Didnâ€™t want to speed down a road and wreck my car, might end up in the hospital, which is the exact opposite of what I want to happen. Iâ€™d tentatively decided on hanging; Iâ€™d tried it before but freaked out and stopped.

I was debating on writing a note out, an explanation as to why I did it, what I wanted my family to do with my bank accounts and social media accounts, arraignments for what would remain of me, etc.

But Iâ€™ve always had so much trouble writing down what I want. I canâ€™t seem to articulate my emotions, my reasons behind my actions..I donâ€™t think I could ever write it down in a way where it would be comforting to anyone who reads it.

Before Iâ€™d left for work, Iâ€™d given my boyfriend a quick summary on how bad I was feeling (heâ€™d only known about how I hadnâ€™t talked to basically anyone since Friday unless I was approached; or how I didnâ€™t go farther than my bathroom until heâ€™d called me at 11 at night and invited me to his place; how Iâ€™d hadnâ€™t eaten much of anything from Friday night to Tuesday that Iâ€™d felt low energy and weak) but he didnâ€™t know my thoughts, my urges.

He had me look him in the eye and said gingerly, â€œwhen I got off work, weâ€™re going to have a serious talk about this.â€ My mental health is always sporadic, but there have been times where it had gotten so low that Iâ€™d have to stay with him for days at a time so he could keep an eye on me and make sure I was safe and eating at least once every couple of hours.

I got off and went home. I showered and then I went outside, sat in my front steps, and listened to music from life is strange: before the storm, and looked at the cloudy sky.

He pulled up in my driveway and sat down with me and we talked out in the 50 degree night. I was murmuring my words, almost straining to hear myself at times. I talked about how Iâ€™d always kept suicide as an option in the back of my mind and how sometimes the option would be forgotten and how during these times I had high hopes for me to graduate college and start a career and get an apartment and live with the love of my life; and how, when i got bad and the option became more of the only choice I saw, I realized that I was almost convincing myself that I could actually build a life despite believing that I will never amount to anything and how Iâ€™m inferior to everyone my age and how I have no sort of qualities anyone would find redeeming.

I talked about how I felt guilty for feeling this way because everyone Iâ€™ve told either would be absolutely heartbroken or terrified about me. How, if I told my parents, theyâ€™d break down and ask why I didnâ€™t want to go to them and that I could just talk to them any time; how I felt like I couldnâ€™t because, well, we donâ€™t want to bother anyone when weâ€™re like this.

I talked about how itâ€™d be easier if I was completely alone.

He squeezed me tightly. I heard his voice break as he said â€œI know this is selfish of me to ask..but please, donâ€™t do it. For me..â€

My voice didnâ€™t waver as I said â€œIâ€™ve been doing that for 8 years now.â€

He asked if I felt I needed to go to the mental health facility In the capital. Iâ€™ve never been to that one, but Iâ€™ve heard that itâ€™s a bad experience, like most mental health facility experiences are I suppose.

â€œI donâ€™t want to. But I guess I have to.â€ I wanted to die, I wanted to stop existing because I donâ€™t see any sort of reason for me to try building this pathetic thing someone would call a â€œlifeâ€. But..at the same time, Iâ€™m scared. I guess itâ€™s human instinct to be scared of what we donâ€™t know, scared of death because we donâ€™t know what will happen to our consciousness.

I wanted to die, but at the same time, I guess I was hesitant because maybe some sliver of hope existed within me that **maybe, just maybe** I could actually amount to something and build some semblance of a life.

He kissed me on the forehead. â€œHow about you come over to my apartment and spend the night? I can keep an eye on you, and we can call that facility in the morning. But weâ€™re gonna have to talk to your father about this.â€

That was all last night. Itâ€™s now 1 in the afternoon. Heâ€™s been hesitant about making the call, debating on whether or not we should talk with my parents first. I donâ€™t know what to do about it. Iâ€™m just here, in his apartment, waiting for something to happen.

I donâ€™t like the idea of a psychiatric ward. I feel like itâ€™s not going to helpâ€”Iâ€™m already in weekly dbt group, bi weekly individual therapy, and on medication. Iâ€™m convinced nothing is going to help and that Iâ€™ll be like this for the rest of my days, whether those days are limited or just a long stretch of time. Iâ€™ve been to 5 psychiatrists; 6 different medications, some for years at a time before I realized it wasnâ€™t helping at all; 7 therapists. Nothing has helped me in the long run. Nothing has helped me â€œget betterâ€ in any capacity.

At this point..I think Iâ€™m just trying for other people. Maybe Iâ€™m just putting off the inevitable, shoving it aside for the next couple months or year or years.

I know that committing yourself takes a certain strength; but I feel like I would have been stronger if I had committed suicide.
