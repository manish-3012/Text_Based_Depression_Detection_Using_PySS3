I have seen the real world and I do not like it. I'm getting out of here.It's not fair. I've been depressed since I was 15. That's 10 years. It seems to have just gotten worse since I've left college. I wasn't able to prepare for the real world. I barely have any ambition anymore to do anything other than writing and I keep getting told to find something else to do alongside writing. Nothing else really seems interesting.
