I want to dieI want to die so bad but iâ€™m so fucking scared. Iâ€™m so immobile. I tried March 2019 and I spent a couple days in the hospital and then a couple weeks in a mental hospital. It was terrifying and I donâ€™t want to go through it again. I know that if i truly again I canâ€™t fail because I canâ€™t do it again. But i canâ€™t keep living with myself. Iâ€™m so fucking stupid and worthless and all I do is sit on my phone all day because I canâ€™t face anything. Iâ€™m in college right now and I go to a really religious and conservative school because my parents forced me too. Iâ€™m bi and I canâ€™t tell anyone. I was raped when I was 11 and I canâ€™t tell anyone. And all the therapists here just tell me I need to pray and read the scriptures more. And trust me Iâ€™ve tried but I know God isnt real, and if he is real he does not give a fuck about me. Itâ€™s my moms birthday today and I canâ€™t do it today because that would crush her. I just got broken up with and it is killing me. I know itâ€™s my fault. This is the 3rd time iâ€™ve been broken up with. Every single one of my relationships iâ€™ve been broken up with. So i know itâ€™s me. I know iâ€™m the problem, I know iâ€™m toxic. I donâ€™t want anyone else to have to deal with me. I canâ€™t even deal with myself. I want to do it so bad. Anyways can anyone relate
