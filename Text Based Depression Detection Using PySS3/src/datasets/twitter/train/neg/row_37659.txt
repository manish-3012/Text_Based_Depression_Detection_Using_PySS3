I almost did something horribleHi, when i was a kid, i had some serious problems, iâ€™ve lost all of my grandparents when i was younger, and my brother, he died few hours after he was born. I got bullied in school, people usually say, youâ€™re a fat fuck or something like that, that iâ€™m ugly, stinking unintelligent dumbass, every time someone mentions my name, only the bad things about me will be discussed, i have bad grades, little to no friends, the girls in the class would never want to sit next to me. I was addicted to cannabis and LSD, iâ€™m also a smoker. When i was 17, i had to repeat my grade (in my country, repeaters are considered the worst kind of kids and you shouldnâ€™t hang around with them) just a few months before new year, i planned an attack in my high school, firearms are forbidden in my country so i get my hands on other types of weapons, axe, blades, knives, i even made a few firebombs and got everything set up perfectly, where and when to attack, with no restriction of targets, just, Everyone, i hated the teachers, i hated the kids in my school, i wanted them to die slowly... but for some reason, that didnâ€™t happen, i donâ€™t know why but Iâ€™ve told my dad, that i didnâ€™t want to go to school anymore, and he understood my situation, so he kept an eye on me, my family threw away all of the potential weapons, had a family meeting and talked, i didnâ€™t have to go to school, but then i had a job. Thatâ€™s how i prevented myself from doing such a horrible thing. Then I took a break, for a period of time, to find peace for my mind, be with my family, let everything go. Thanks for reading this.
