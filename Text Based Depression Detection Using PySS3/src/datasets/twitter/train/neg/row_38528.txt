High school is finally overAnd I look at all these happy people who took pictures with their friends and relatively had a good time and Iâ€™m just so fucking close to going through with my plan. Since last year Iâ€™ve planning to kill myself after graduation. I donâ€™t have any friends. I donâ€™t have a fucking life. I donâ€™t have any money for things that I truly need and then I see everyone else in their fucking Audiâ€™s and Infinitiâ€™s. I want to fucking end the pain so bad, and even though I know I canâ€™t, God I wish I could. 

I know I sound like a whiny bitter little asshole, and honestly, I kind of am. Iâ€™m happy to have graduated, truly. But Iâ€™m a fucking loser. No one likes me, no one cares about me. And I donâ€™t want to find out the same thing in college either.
