14 Feb - Valentines DayI don't feel like a person anymore. My parents don't let me be who I want to be and they don't realise that people can develop mental illnesses. I've had these thoughts for as long as I can remember and I don't want to tell anyone because they tell me to go away every time.

There is no one in this world who shows that they love you or anything until you're gone. Everyone has left me and i'm always 'there', i'm never apart of any conversations and I just want to die.

If i don't chicken out, i'm killing myself on Valentines Day because it just reminds me of how alone I am in this world. What's the easiest way to go? Please tell me. I don't want to live anymore, I wish people cared.
