I've had this urge since I was 13I can't shake it, I am 24 now and still almost every day I want to die. I am a worthless piece of shit. Here is some shit to back that up.         
I am still living with my parents, who hate my presence    
I don't have any good skills worthwhile
I am not attracted to people, and have never been in a relationship    
Have no way of moving out, I couldn't support myself.  

I cannot mentally work more than a couple days a week without cutting myself all over wishing for this torture to end, how can anyone? When I am off of work I get berated by my dad telling me to be useful which I cant. He laughed at me for telling him that I was suicidal, saying it was an excuse. He comes at me just about everyday screaming and yelling, then later tries to apologize but reaffirms what he previously said. I can't take this mental degradation either. I am constantly threatened about being kicked out,  I am very close to truly killing myself. I don't know what to do.
