Donâ€™t want to bother people in my life with these issues, so Iâ€™m coming here. My hypochondria has made me so suicidal.Cant afford the medication that actually helps. Itâ€™s $290-$350 WITH discounts, no insurance. (Itâ€™s called Viibryd, if you wanna look it up :() Private insurance is too expensive so Iâ€™m not even bothering getting that. 

I canâ€™t even stay home alone anymore because I instantly panic. My boyfriend had to leave his old job in order to stay home with me. But today he went back to work. He just left and the panic is starting to ensue. Iâ€™m just gonna try and sleep for the day until my doctor appointment at 11:30.  Iâ€™m so depressed that medication is expensive. Iâ€™ve tried every other damn drug for my anxiety. Iâ€™m so convinced I was meant to die. Iâ€™m newly religious so it helps, but god this sucks.
