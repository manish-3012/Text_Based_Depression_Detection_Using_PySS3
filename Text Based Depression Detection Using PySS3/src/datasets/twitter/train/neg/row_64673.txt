Guys I need helpI'm so tired of this life. I'm lifeless to that point i started losing my best friend. I feel like like this whole week. I felt like this before and now I'm tired. I just want someone/something to bring me back. My best friend is female and I had crush on her and I told her how I feel... and you know what happened.. lol. We have met in summer 2017 and we clicked and start hangin out more. Then shit happend. We walked away from our group of friends becuase they was thinking that she's possesed cuz she was drunk af (we are teenagers  16-17y). And she lost her bestfriend that she known for 10y, it was same for me.And then we went to other group of friends and every single day we were hangin out, that's where I start to grow feelings for her. And then shit happend. But we never lost contact. Till these few days. Now I don't have feelings for her but she's my best friend and I want things to be like they was. I'm in deppresion and I told her that and she asked why, I told that I don't know. I guess I just dont have luck... fuck
