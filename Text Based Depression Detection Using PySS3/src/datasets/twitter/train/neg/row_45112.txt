looking for something to do for a friend who will probably kill themself either wayi have a friend whos been very suicidal from a young age. both of their parents have abused them horribly. this is their second to last semester in college, which is getting paid for by their parents. after theyâ€™re done with school they plan to kill themself so that the money their parents spent on their college will go to waste, and also because life doesnâ€™t seem really promising for them, or really any 20-something living in america right now. i canâ€™t blame them. Iâ€™d really like it if they didnt kill themself, theyre one of my best friends, and it hurts so fucking much to think about life without them, but it feels so selfish to ask them not to. shit sucks for them all the time, and im pretty sure itâ€™d just make them feel worse to stick around. I guess i just want to know if anyoneâ€™s dealt with something like this, anything i can say or do to help them at all, I love them a lot and i just want them to be happy for as long as they decide to stick around
