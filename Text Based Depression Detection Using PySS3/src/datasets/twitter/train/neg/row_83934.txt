I cant keep feeling this wayI dont know where to start. Im in a absolutely toxic marriage I know hes a bad person but I pretty much worship the ground he walks on. Im not perfect by any means but I do anything and everything he says. From being pressured to sleep with other people and letting him watch and join to cooking him a full meal at 3am every night. I recently found out that I have hpv, possible cervical cancer (still waiting on results), watching my mom live out her last few days, and started a antidepressant. Well last night I had a few drinks for the first time since starting zoloft and completely blacked out. I apparently said ALOT of hurtful things and let everything out about how I feel. Well today he told me to get the kids things and get out. I have bent over backwards to keep him happy. From telling me that the kids and I deserve nothing more than the bare essentials to taking my keys so I can't leave when he goes to work its been nothing but mental and emotional abuse but I still can't let go. The only thing that is keeping me from swallowing handfuls of sleeping pills is my 3 year old awake past her bedtime wanting me to braid her hair like elsa while she sings let it go. I cant walk away but I keep living like this. I know the kids love me and their bio dad will take care of them.
