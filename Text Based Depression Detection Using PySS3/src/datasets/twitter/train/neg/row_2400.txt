I just want the pain to stop for goodIâ€™ve been suicidal for 6 years straight and severely depressed for as long as I can remember. While some things in my life have improved, by and large, others have only gotten worse as Iâ€™ve gotten older, the biggest one being my mental health. Iâ€™ve been to the same psych ward three times now and have tried to kill myself twice, the most recent attempt that I unfortunately botched having left me in agonizing pain every single day nearly 6 months later. Iâ€™m surrounded by people who love and care about me but none of them can ever really get through to me no matter how hard they try.

Iâ€™m tired of trying everything under the sun that seems to work for everyone else but doesnâ€™t do jack shit for me and being more frustrated and disappointed that Iâ€™m only getting worse in the meantime. Iâ€™m tired of how miserable I am because of all the pain Iâ€™m in which nothing helps with and how shitty my life has turned out to be. But most of all, Iâ€™m tired of pretending like things will improve when I know deep down that they probably wonâ€™t.

Life is a fucking joke and Iâ€™m tired of being the goddamn punchline.
