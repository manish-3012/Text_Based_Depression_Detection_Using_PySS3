i just lost a frienddisclaimer: my native language isnt english so sorry for any typos or idk

so im a student, i started going to university in october and in order to study i had to move and so my only female friend now lives 200km away and we had a hard time maintaining our relationship which, before i left, was fantastic and we both had a great time and she actually wanted to join me and live with me in a year. so it all started falling apart at the beginning of october when she had birthday and we planned that she would come to me for a night and we would hang out but i freaked out about whole university thing and said that she'll be better off staying at home and not going to me and she was very upset about this which is totally understandable. then we had bunch of arguments and i was behaving like an asshole and this weekend we had a talk and i really wanted her to not to get rid of me because of the arguments earlier and i said i want to improve and i tried to explain to her why i was behaving like a total idiot and when everything was looking to be better she said that im an idiot and she had many friends but no one was as stupid as me and she doesnt reply to my texts since

she is basically everything to me and without her my life is meaningless and im sitting there crying for like 2 hours and i dont know what to do

its funny because i read about suicide methods like two weeks ago and i thought which would be the most effective and i actually tried to kill myself once by jumping under a train but somehow i managed to keep myself together
