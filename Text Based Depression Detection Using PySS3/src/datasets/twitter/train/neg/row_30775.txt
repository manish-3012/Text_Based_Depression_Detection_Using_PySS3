Get him a feel better card after attempt?My friend just had a suicide attempt, a couple of us were there at the time and restrained him. The police were called and he was taken to the hospital. We're both part of a social club on campus that's relatively tight knit.  

I can only imagine how down he must feel right now, would a 'get well' card from the group give him something to hold on to, or make him feel worse?
