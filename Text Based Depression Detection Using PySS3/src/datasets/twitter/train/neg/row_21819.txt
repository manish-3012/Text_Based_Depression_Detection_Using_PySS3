Hate myselfIm just fed up with failing in everything. This is my last year in school and im trying to get into med school but i nearly lost all hope of getting accepted into any of my choices. Its always been my goal and i dont know what else i could do. Everyone has such high expectations of me but i know i cant satisfy them. My grades are falling quickly and the lower they get the less motivated i am to do anything about it. Even my teachers have told me to either get my shit together or rethink my choices. I tried telling my mom about this but she keeps saying that ill make it for sure but she doesnt know shit about the schooling system (were foreign). I cant concentrate on enything but how ive put my self in this shithole of a situation. I dont know whats wrong with me. 

This is my only goal in life and without it i dont know what to do. Im not ready for a failure like this. More and more i just cant help but think suicide would make the most sense in my situation. I cant enjoy anything in life anymore and im distant all the time. I really just wanna fuckin end it because the constant insecurities about my future are killing me.
