What the hell are you supposed to title these posts, anyway.I am that kid that everyone hates being around. You know the type, you groan when you see them coming because they're obnoxious as fuck and you don't give a shit what they have to say.

I never chose to be this way. I can't believe how many nights I've cried alone in my room, wishing I was normal. It's like I function on a different clock. I can never shut up. I talk too much. I annoy everyone. I have no fucking filter and I never know when I've gone too far or it's too much. And I think that maybe things are getting better. Maybe I'm finally making friends, and people will want to be around me. That's never the case.

I've been at this college for three years. I've tried three different medications at 8 different dosages. I'm starting to think that there's no medicine out there that can change who I am. There's nothing out there that can make me function normal, or work just like everybody else. Three years of not being able to make friends is so damn frustrating. 

I hate the obligation of living for everybody else. I never chose to be alive. 

The logical part of my brain knows that I would never do it, but I guess this subreddit is just an excuse to admit that I do have suicidal thoughts, even with the antidepressants.

I would give anything to wake up tomorrow morning and be somebody else.
