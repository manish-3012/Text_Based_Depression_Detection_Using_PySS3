Is it okay to kill yourself if youâ€™re a bad person ?They say itâ€™s a selfish thing to do but what if youâ€™re already selfish as fuck?

Think about your friends and  family . What if you have no friends and family hates you ?

Youâ€™re just projecting the pain onto them . What if youâ€™re already causing them pain . 

What if the things you have done are unforgivable things and youâ€™re a bad person and always will be .

It would cause people around me pain sure , but it would make them better people and benefit everyone 1.they will be better friends for their whole life 2.parents will raise my sister better 3.theyâ€™ll have extra weight off their shoulders even if itâ€™s not instant. If that happens thatâ€™s gonna leave a positive effect maybe not right away but in a year two yeah .

What Iâ€™m saying is , is suicide ever the right thing to do in certain circumstances or is it always gonna be something wrong and selfish
