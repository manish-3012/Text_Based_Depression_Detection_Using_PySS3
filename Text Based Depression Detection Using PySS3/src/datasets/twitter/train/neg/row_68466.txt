i think i will end my life at the end of the monthIm a 17 year old male that is about to get kicked out of highschool. Ive given it all that i could while dealing with my depression but its just not enough. My life has progressively gotten worse. My teachers are constantly telling me that i never try and that they are ashamed to have said they taught me along with one of my teachers telling me that my dad would be disappointed in me (my dad worked in this field). I hate being at school but i still find it better than being at home. My parents tell me i dont give a shit about shcool, i am going to amount to nothing, i am a failure and that they are disappointed in me. The only reason that i have not killed myself yet is because a couple of months ago i found a really cool group of friends which has never happened to me before. I really care about them and so i am trying to push myself away from them to lessen the pain when they find out. at the end of this month, when i get asked to leave the school and take all the punishments from my parents, i will end my life
