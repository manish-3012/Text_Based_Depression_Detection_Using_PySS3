Suicidal thoughts (getting worse)If you can see my other post on this account, I'm 20 years old and I have no social life, no friends to rely on, my family are fantastic the only reason I'm still here is because of them.

Everyday it's getting harder, I know tomorrow I'll be stuck in the same unhappy routine again, I thought college was the answer, until I'm with a bunch of people much older than I am

I'm seeing a therapist about my depression but it's not working, I haven't felt this shit in all my life I don't know what the fuck is wrong with me.

Applying for volunteering work because if I do kill myself I'd like to at least do something useful before I go.

I just want somebody I can call a friend, is that too much to ask?
