I feel just so.... doneeverything just seems so... hard. life is so unbearable, i slit my wrists everyday, and i don't even feel like i want to stop. i'm so miserable 25/8, i cant stop feeling like shit, and my hallucinations are getting so much worse

life is just getting worse and worse, day by day, and some people don't even understand; they don't understand how badly i want to die, but that i can't because people care about me 

i just want to end everything, i don't even care anymore
