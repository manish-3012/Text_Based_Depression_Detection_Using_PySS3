The wonders of CollegeJust got told that my college has denied my progression onto the second year due to the fact I'm 10 Mark's below the threshold needed to pass even though I scored a passing grade of 40 percent overall even after my lecturers falsely listed me as absent for a module with no repliesto any emails I sent, and with college Grant's being my only source of income for rent and food, guess it's become homeless or hang myself in my bathroom. And I'm flippin a fairly one sided coin.ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
