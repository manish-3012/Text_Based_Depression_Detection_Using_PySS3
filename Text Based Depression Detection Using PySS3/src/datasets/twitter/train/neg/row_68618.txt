Suicide and Life InsuranceI'm ready. I've been ready. I have my will. I bought a plot next to mom. The only thing holding me is the fact that my life insurance doesn't cover suicide. Trying to get more has been difficult with my mental health/hospitalizations history. I got through the cracks on one, but they'll only cover it after two years. I dont think I have two years. I dont think I have two weeks. I know how hard the financial burden is, my mother died unexpectedly and with no insurance.  It took me three years to pay it off. Even though I requested a direct burial (which is cheaper), it's still not a steal. I cant do that. The emotional burden is enough. 

I've searched on many suicide forums, many people in the same situation talk of making it look like an accident, car crash, death by cop, drug overdose....

I feel so stuck. The depression has become  excruciating, crippling. I use to be able to hide it, force my smiles, I cant even do that anymore. I'm not able to pretend, even if I wanted to. I'm so tired. I'm ready.
