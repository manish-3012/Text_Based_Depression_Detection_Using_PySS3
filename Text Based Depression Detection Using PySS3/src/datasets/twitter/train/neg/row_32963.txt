after next month, I plan to do it, I just can't take it all anymore...I don't see anything positive anymore, I have a job but the money is so poor, I sometimes can't afford to buy food and rely on my boyfriend. I love him, but he's not affectionate and not romantic and never wants to do anything besides go out to restaurants and eat or sit at home or do something with his friends. I want to go fishing, but he says he doesn't enjoy it anymore, or a movie but says it's a waste of money, or even just the two of us to smoke weed together and sit at home...he'll smoke around his friends but not with me and makes excuses he will get paranoid.

Not to mention my dad is battling cancer right now in another country, when only last year my mum passed away from cancer...

I'm so tempted to do it all now because I got a call and was asked if I can come in to work tomorrow and I said yes and I feel like crap now for doing so...I called again to say I can't do it, and feel maybe it's time to end it all tomorrow morning, just to have one more night to relax and be happy.
