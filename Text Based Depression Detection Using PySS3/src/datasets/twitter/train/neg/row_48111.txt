How do I explain to my dad that I don't want to live?He knows I've been pretty miserable lately (moved across the country to live with him) and to be fair, he's been trying his best to tell me to "look on the brightside, stay hopeful" etc.

I want to tell him that I'm not suicidal, but I just don't want to live. I feel he would just freak out and not listen to my explanation but I don't know how to break it to him gently. He's studying to be a nurse and I feel that he would go overboard if I told him anything that involved the words "me" and "suicidal". I do want help, but not a psych ward. I just need a starting point to explain my feelings.
