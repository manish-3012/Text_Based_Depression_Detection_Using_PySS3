Please,i need helpI'm in desperate need of help,i don't know what to do anymore. I've had suicidal thaughts for 5 years and i'm 18. My life is just going from bad to worse. I'm not able to talk to my parents,i have only a few friends but i don't know how to say it,even though i trust them,i'm to afraid to ask for help,i'm scared. I can't sleep at night. In my head,all day long is just a thaught...that it would be better if i end it all...please,if anyone can help me,i would apreciate it.
