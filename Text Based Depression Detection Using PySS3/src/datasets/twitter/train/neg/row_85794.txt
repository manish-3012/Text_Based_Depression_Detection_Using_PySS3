Iâ€™m so tired. (Child abuse TW)24/F. 

Lately, Iâ€™ve been thinking a lot about my past. From ages 8 to 12, I was molested by my (at the time) brother-in-law. At the time, I knew it was wrong, but I was terrified of him and my family. It finally ended when I told a friend from the internet that I was being hurt by someone close. When the friend messaged my sister, she confronted me about it and I told her that he had only asked to kiss me, because I didnâ€™t want him to hurt me. My mother and sister confronted him and he went along with the lie. We werenâ€™t left alone together after that. 

Around 18, my sister found out the entire truth but didnâ€™t want me to tell anyone because she doesnâ€™t want to stop receiving child support for my niece. The longer I keep quiet, the more I want to end it. Iâ€™ve wanted to die since I was 10, and I think Iâ€™ve finally gotten the courage to do it. 

Iâ€™m telling my mom this Friday. Antidepressants and anxiety medication hasnâ€™t helped. Seeing a therapist hasnâ€™t helped. I want my mom to know so that she can watch out for my niece when Iâ€™m gone. Iâ€™m so fucking tired.
