What is the most calm and peacefull way to do it?The only thing keeping me alive is music, videogames and the fear of failing it.

Whats the most calm way to do it? Probably overdose right? I'll just close my eyes, and never open them again, yey. I mean i dont deserve it, i deserve a pain full slow fucking death but whatever.

I WANT TO DIE EVERY FUCKING DAY

Honestly, wouldn't mind Getting hit by a truck.

Why should i keep on living? Nothing is enjoyeble, school is fucking hell and all of that shit. I mean whats gonna happen after school? A job, so i can still feel Hope less and miserable And I'll wake up an hour earlier (if some is stupid enough to hire me, a stupid fat and ugly idiot.
