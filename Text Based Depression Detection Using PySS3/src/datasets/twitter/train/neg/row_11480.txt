I wish I could reply to you allI wish I could reply to everyone on this thread. It pains me to see the amount of other pain others are holding too.

As someoneâ€™s whose contemplated suicide many many times, the biggest, and only problem I see with this planet, is the people. 

Put me on an island by myself and Iâ€™ll be a happy chappy but I ainâ€™t got the money for that. 

Itâ€™s just the ultimate recurring toxicity, pressure, cunts that make this place terrible. And it leaves us outsiders feeling fucking bad. 

I understand we are all going through something somewhat similar- wanting to be non existent. 

But then I remember the money and time my family have put into raising me and I would not be able to leave them like that. 

For those with no family, I pray you find a way to keep going, a way to find the other side and a light at the end of the tunnel.,

I hope everyone feeling down today finds the strength to keep going. The people enjoying the toxicity of this planet, are the problem, we are merely in the back trying to keep going so the others donâ€™t get too upset. 

And thatâ€™s deeply painful to go through every. Single. Day.  But weâ€™ve kept going. So props to us! 

And those who decide to go through with whatâ€™s playing on all our minds, I hope your soul has eternal restâ¤ï¸cmon soldiers we got this
