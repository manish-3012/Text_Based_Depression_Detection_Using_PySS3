Choosing death was the most peaceful calm I've felt in yearsYou know that overwhelming panic when you feel like you're drowning, like you're going to die and you give your everything to fight it off? Last night I gave in and just let myself sink into the hole.  

For years voices have been telling me they'll kill me in my sleep and I won't wake up. I've reached a point where that's exactly what I want. I wrote a goodbye note, lay down and waited. I was relaxed for the first time in a long time. Felt a weird calm and thought I'm ready, just kill me. I really thought I could die by letting voices or telling my brain to. I was hoping my brain would switch off or my heart would just stop. Nothing. No voices, first radio silence I've had in years. After years of hearing how they would kill me, there was nothing.  

I woke up today and everything was back, worry, noise, constant talking. Wanting to die was the most calm and peaceful night I've had in years, that's scary and I don't know what to think.  

Unsure whether this is the right place to post but just wanted to let the feels out.
