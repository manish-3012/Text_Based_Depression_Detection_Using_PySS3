I hope I attempt tonightIt's been so hard working up the courage and motivation to try anything. Largely bc I feel like I'll likely fail and I can't afford or cope with the aftermath. So I just lay here suffering constantly. I'm to the point where i cant get out of bed at all other than to pee obviously and i feel horrible. But i have a funny little feeling maybe tonight will be a good night. Maybe i can perform a miracle and work up the energy to do literally anything, and maybe it'll be the thing i wanna do. Even if it fails it's something. Then i'll just go keep doing nothing in the hospital i guess. Then ill get out of the hospital with my $15k bill and go lay on the sidewalk and do nothing. Until i starve to death. That's where it's headed for me. Hopefully i beat the odds and succeed in escaping and can finally just be done.
