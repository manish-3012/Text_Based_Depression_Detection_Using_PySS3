i have lots of things people would die for. but i still want to kill myself.a great family, friends, and an excellent support system. i live in a great neighbourhood, and go to the best high school in my city. if i get into the university i want, itll be one of the best in my country and ill be on the path to becoming a doctor like i have always dreamt of 

but for some reason i just want to end it here. i dont want to continue. i have a dream but i have no energy to pursue it. i am so drained and i want nothing out of life
