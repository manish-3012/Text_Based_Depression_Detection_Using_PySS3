Fuck this lifeI read some post about being depressed for like 2 years and all that.. Iâ€™m depressed my whole life lmao.. Iâ€™ve been hurting my self, scratching my skin and banging my head to the wall since i was 5-6 years old. Iâ€™m curious how normal people live... while for me everyday is very tiring Iâ€™m just so tired... itâ€™s been what? 15 years? Or more? I donâ€™t know what to do anymore Iâ€™m failing my life cause I never wanted to live in the first place... I just want to end it all if only someone would kill me.. if only I was never born... someone could just take this life if they really wanted to live cause I donâ€™t deserve nor want it... they Thought I was depress because I was bullied or because I have a failing grade.. itâ€™s not that... itâ€™s actually the other way round... I was bullied and failed in school and life cause  I was depress and never wanted to love... living with anxiety makes me feel numb ... I feel like thatâ€™s normal.. to feel pain, to suffer and to hurt myself thatâ€™s normal
