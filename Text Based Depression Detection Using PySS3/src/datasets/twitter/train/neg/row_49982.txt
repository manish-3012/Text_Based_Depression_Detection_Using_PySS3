i'm drowning in self-loathingI'm so fucking stupid it's ridiculous. I literally have no intelligent thought process that goes through my head at any given time. I can't do well at exams that are so fucking basic even a monkey can do them. Everyone fucking thinks shit is so easy but I dont think so and that makes me stupid. I'm so god damn stupid I'm a blight upon humanity and deserve to die. I hate being so stupid. Why won't anyone put me out of this misery? I wish no one ever believed in me so I wouldn't have to keep disappointing people again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again until they realise I'm really just a loser in life who everyone thinks is smart but actually is the biggest fucking piece of shit to ever sully this Earth. Someone please help me I feel like hyperventilating all the fucking time and I think I'm going to die soon.
