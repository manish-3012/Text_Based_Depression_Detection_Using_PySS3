I think some people here might be able to help others... idk but itâ€™s a thoughtThis might get me kicked off the community; however, I think that a few others here might be able to help others out here.

I saw a few posts of people who are wealthy yet donâ€™t really have a reason to live because they did something stupid like reason X and now donâ€™t think they are worth redemption. On the other side there are people who feel really screwed by their financial circumstances like not being able to pay a months rent.  

I know this sounds stupid but just hear me out canâ€™t like people who are wealthy give a little money to those who really need it. I mean charity does help to reduce symptoms of depression, give a little sense of empowerment as you are able to help someone, and might act as a reason to continue ( like for a short while ) and this may help the former. As for the later I think this financial support just might be the thing to pull them out of this situation. 

Yes I understand rent is not always chip change but I am not asking you to give the entire amount like even small amounts. 
I mean yes itâ€™s stupid but hey just think about if. Also sorry if I somehow insulted someone in any manner 

Note: I am 17 m and did some charity work a few months back [ went to some remote area and taught a student for a while]  and I can say that was probably the best 2 weeks of my life. I didnâ€™t even cut or have suicidal taught and that kept me pretty happy and fulfilled in myself for like a solid month. 

Support doesnâ€™t have to be financial always !! If you guys have any ideas can you list them down. Some people could really use some help here!
