Today is a national holiday in my countryIt's a huge event, and people usually start the day with a breakfast with friends, and then go to see family. I genuinely thought that everyone would be in the same boat as me this year, because of the corona situation. I thought I wouldn't feel like a lonely freak, but here we are. 

Most of my friends are in serious, long term relationships, and all of those who aren't have other friend groups. I feel alone and forgotten. This holiday is a fucking huge and, and I feel like a loser. I could probably beg some of my friends to spend time with me, but that just feels so pathetic.

This happens every holiday and every major vacation.

I haven't felt suicidal in a long time now, but this has opened the floodgates. I want to self harm so bad, but I have a slight cold and I just can't deal with doctors and nurses is hazmat suits today. I just want to not be anymore.
