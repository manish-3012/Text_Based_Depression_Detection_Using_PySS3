How to cope with suicidal thoughts at work?I struggle with bad depression and daily suicidal thoughts, and Iâ€™m trying really hard to get better.

No matter how much I look I canâ€™t find any coping strategies for dealing with suicidal thought at work. Worst case scenario when Iâ€™m home I can just take sleeping pills and sleep it away, but I have no idea what to do when Iâ€™m work and canâ€™t focus on anything other than wanting to just walk out and off myself.

What are some coping techniques that have worked for you when youâ€™re so focused on suicidal ideation that you can barely do your job?
