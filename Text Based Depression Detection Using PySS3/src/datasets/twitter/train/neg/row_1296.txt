I don't wanna live anymore. Life is senseless. Please change my mind.Hello. I created this reddit account for the sake of this post.

On January 2020, I had been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, and it's taking its toll on me. I couldn't go to therapy because of the coronavirus outbreak. Whenever me and my mother have arguments, I'm always the wrong one. She always keeps herself on top, and I couldn't take things anymore. I just want to die. Prolonging the time before we die is senseless: because we'll all die in the future anyway.

What's the point of living, really? We just get raised by our parents, then what? Compete ourselves with others using our learned skills and knowledge, and compete for the best resources available? Try to gain as much experiences, relationships, achievements, knowledge, and satisfaction, when at the end you'll just die anyway? 

Humans are worthless, selfish pieces of crap. All we ever really did was compete for resources. And they didn't even see global warming as a result of their selfish deeds, competing for resources against the other species of the animal kingdom. Not only that: Humans are well known to compete with other humans too. You have IQ and skills? You climb up the hierarchy. Acquire financial and relationship status. Gain self esteem. You don't have IQ or skills? You stay down the ladder. Live the worst life possible. None to low financial or relationship status. You gain the least esteem. All because of fucking brain and hormonal differences.  

The world is mad. We just stress ourselves out for senseless selfish deeds, when at the end we'll all just die anyway. We are just letting emotional and physical pains, insecurities, anxieties, and fears of death stay on our sides, when at the end we'll all just die anyway. 

Or should I say, we are just prolonging the time left before our final line: death. It's senseless.
