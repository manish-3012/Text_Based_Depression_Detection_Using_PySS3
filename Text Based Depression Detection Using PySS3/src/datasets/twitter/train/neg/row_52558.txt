Too Longthis depression has been going on for ever. this episode has been going on for almost 18 mos. Last year I tried and failed, ended up in the MH for a while. My life really isnt that bad, my youngest boy was accepted to Law School, older one is going to be a chemist. My wife is beautiful and puts up with me, I have a steady job, the house is paid off. My problems are related to the past from cptsd. I dont know if I was ever really happy w/o being "medicated"maybe when I was 4. there were some good years when the kids came along, but my past has come back to haunt me. My Nmother and her AH husband died, the woman I loved many years ago died, I wanted to contact her to ask her to forgive me after all these years. Now Im fighting OCD besides the MDD, mental illness is very xpensive and the potions the psyc. gives doesnt do anything, therapy is a waste,  Im 61 and I cry at least 1 a week. I really dont have any more to look forward to. My kids you say, grandkids. I have no feelings left I am as empty as Donald Trumps head.The ruminating wont cease, I cant change my mind, the anxiety is horrible. I see no way out
