I'll clean toilets if that's what it takes to escape from my cruel parents...but I can't even find a job doing that. I've applied to every job, asked every college loaner for a loan, and asked every friend for help, but all have turned me down. If my parents see me hanging out with a friend in town, they force me to come home with the threat of withholding food and phone and kicking me out. I fear I'll become homeless and I don't see any hope for the freedom to hang out with friends.
