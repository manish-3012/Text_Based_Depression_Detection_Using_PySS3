Why can't I just let her go? It just makes me want to die.I've been in love with a girl since I was 14. Maybe it's more of an obsession, really. I know it's unhealthy, for sure. I want to do it. I want to just end it all rather than deal with these fucking feelings that will never be returned. I'm going all over the damn Internet, asking people to pretend to be her in role plays, for fuck's sake. I'm just so tired of this. I'm so tired of feeling like crap all the time. It's not just her, either. I just constantly feel depressed. But I can usually deal with it. Right now, i just don't know if I can. I'm lost. Can someone tell me what I can do? I want to be able to live happily. I don't really want to die. But I'm starting to feel like there's less of a choice every day...

Edit: Even reddit doesn't give a shit, apparently. Why should I?
