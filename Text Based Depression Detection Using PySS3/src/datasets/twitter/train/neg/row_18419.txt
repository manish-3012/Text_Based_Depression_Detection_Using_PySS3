Failing in classI'm failing almost all my classes, either because of my time on the hospital (2 weeks) or because my depression... I can't concentrate on anything... nothing makes me happy and I just don't care... tbh I hope I actually fail, so that I have something to say when someone asks "why are you sad?"... I can finnaly kms knowing that I'm a failure
