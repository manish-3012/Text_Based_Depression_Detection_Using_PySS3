Want Death; Can't Die16, almost 17 male here.

I'm not going to explain my entire situation in this little box, so I'll just cut to it. I want to die, and I've fantasized about exactly how I'm going to do it for almost 2 years now.

Problem is, the only method I feel 'safe' using is shotgun to head. Unfortunately, I do not own a shotgun. The earliest time I'll be able to buy a shotgun is quite a bit into the future when I live on my own. So I'm stuck here, unable to die, still working hard in school to fool everyone into thinking I care about life.

I'm getting so sick of it. All the time, I consider jumping in front of traffic, off bridges, taking a crap ton of pills... but I decide not to every time because it won't kill me. It will just screw me up a little bit and expose my secret too soon to everyone. And then they'll proceed to make my life hell, and try to stop me.

Damn it, I want to die SO BADLY. I want this existence to end. But I can't. And I'm essentially forced to work work work like I care about my future just so I can get to the point in my life to kill myself.

I've posted to r/depression a few times, and I feel like posting here today because I honestly am uncertain if I have depression at all. Thing is, I'm kind of happy about 1/3 of the time. I don't feel like I'm in a deep, dark pit. I just think I'm in a bright and sunny, but very painful box.

If any trolls out there want to tell me some new methods, I'm all ears. Otherwise, if anyone can tell me how to get through these years without going mad, I'd greatly appreciate it.

TL:DR - I want to kill myself, but I can't for at least another 4-8 years. In the mean time, I'm in a very unpleasant situation. What do?
