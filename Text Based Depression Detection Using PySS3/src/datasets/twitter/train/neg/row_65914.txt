What if I just want to keep sinking into the abyss?My dad and siblings know about my suicidal thoughts. My dad in particular keeps trying to make it a point to see me more often and trying to get the family more involved together. I'm finding it annoying and a waste of my precious weekends off work. What's worse, is that despite feeling some relief after getting back home after these events, I also just feel so much worse. I could have a good or terrible time with them, but the urge to kill myself just hits me so hard when I finally get back home. I just feel like I'm better off alone letting the dark thoughts consume me until I finally decide to call it a life. The sooner the better. 

I know they're just trying to help, but I don't want help. While I understand the hypocrisy I am babbling right now, I just want to be done with this life.
