Life isnâ€™t worth livingIf you see it logically, humans are bad for planet earth. We kill masses of animals we donâ€™t even need. That means animals die just so we throw them in the trash- because we killed more than we needed. The educational system is a literal joke. Seriously. In my country you get money when you donâ€™t even have a job and they pay your apartment. So working for under 2,500â‚¬ is a waste of time. So what else can you do? Go to university and do something decent? Sure. After that youâ€™re in debts that you canâ€™t ever pay back. Humans are mostly mean and trashy. You get canceled so easily. I wish my mother never gave birth to me so I wouldnâ€™t have to have this wretched life. Itâ€™s not a nice thing to give birth to someone. Itâ€™s a torture.
