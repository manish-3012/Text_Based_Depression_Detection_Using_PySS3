I'm scared of living my life just to die.Okay, This is my first time posting something like this, I'm not the suicidal type of person but, I feel like I'm just wasting my time here on earth I know if I was to kill my self my family would miss me but that's not enough to keep me alive I feel it's just a waste to live on with no after life and I'm not the attractive type to grow up and get a family but I'm also scared of death but I'm too scared to kill my self I honestly am just lost I'm almost 17 and i feel like I missed way too much of my life and it's slipping away too fast and I'm not keeping up.
