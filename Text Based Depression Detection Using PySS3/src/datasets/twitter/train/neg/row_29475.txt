Borderline Personality Disorder and how to handle it.Hello there, I'm not sure where else to know people who can give me advice on my depression. I've been diagnosed with BPD years ago, and its getting harder and harder everyday for me.
I am an artist, and without art I woudnt be able to cope, but recently I been having lots of mood disorders and I've been less and less productive.
Two years ago I dropped school to move half the world away with my former internet boyfriend. And it was a mess, It triggered my depression way too far, when I came back the doctor gave me lots of new pills, some of them for epilepsy and similar, now I am on injections too, my mind is a mess and all my friends and family get disapointed with me, it seems like I can't finish anything...

What advice can you give me? Is there a 'cure' for this illness? will with time it get better?

Thanks a lot,

Lila.
