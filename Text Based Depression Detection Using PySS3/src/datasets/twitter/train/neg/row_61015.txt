Over ItIâ€™m so angry at myself for still being alive. I finally left my house to go to the dermatologist today. They told me about some treatment options but warned me of side effects. I played down my mental health issues and Iâ€™m choosing not to take the medicine due to fear of a suicide attempt. My depression is already terrible. I hate my life. I hate my appearance and I hate my sexuality. I feel trapped. I wish I was normal and good looking. I wish I wasnâ€™t a degenerate homo destined for Hell. God, I wish for so many ways of not being myself: ugly as sin, black, gay and so much more. I see no point in my life these past few years. I have no enjoyment in life, only pain and anger for tolerating breathing air. I feel worthless by the people who even raised me. Iâ€™m what they are against and Iâ€™m tired of being in the closet. I just want to go away. I envy those are in happy relationships and are generally attractive. Itâ€™s sad knowing not only that no one will care for you but you donâ€™t deserve the sinful love you crave ever since you were a child. I would never choose to be this disgusting sexuality but I canâ€™t change it. Maybe a bullet will take me out of my misery.
