Iâ€™ve been writing a suicide note for a yearSo weird how this stupid note is the one thing thatâ€™s keeping me in the world right now.

Iâ€™ve been trying to get it right for so long that Iâ€™ve ended up writing about 20k words and itâ€™s turning into a book where Iâ€™ve basically documented my entire nervous breakdown. Some stuff in there is really messed up, my deepest thoughts and basically every reason why id ever want to take my own life. Iâ€™ve thought about everything, and I still have so much that I want to add.

This is such a weird situation, but now that Iâ€™ve wrote like a quarter of a book I donâ€™t feel like I can leave the world until itâ€™s done and I have something that Iâ€™m actually proud of to leave behind. But itâ€™s ruining everything else in my life right now because I have no motivation and I just keep telling myself that nothing matters because Iâ€™ll be dead anyway once my note is done. 

Iâ€™m just so torn about whether to finish this shit or just give up sooner rather than later. This is such a weird situation. I donâ€™t even know why Iâ€™m putting this here either so donâ€™t bother asking what the point is. I guess I just think itâ€™s fucked up that Iâ€™ve took a suicide note and made it my lifeline for a year, but I canâ€™t exactly tell that to anyone irl. So, here you go, Reddit.
