Want to get this off my chestAt times, I'm the type of person who has to smile, act like everything is okay and go about my day. In actuality, I'm fighting an internal battle with myself, convincing myself of all the reasons I have to live. I try to think about the people who love me, the ones who try to make me feel better. 

Sometimes I wonder if I am beyond help, if I'm destined to be trapped inside this small dark room with just me and my thoughts. Why I'm not good enough to keep breathing, everything that is wrong with me. I can't remember what it is like to truly be happy and worry free.

I have little desire to do things these days, getting out of bed and getting to work is an accomplishment. I'm not cleaning my house, I'm not paying my bills on time. I drink every night hoping my brain will forget what a terrible place it has become. I'm losing my will to live again. When I'm lost in thought I think about what it would be like to close my eyes and never wake up again. What it would be like if I had nothing to worry about again.

I'm so scared to ask for help. Every time I do, nothing happens. I started to see a doctor early this year, he put me on antidepressants. After a month into it, he upped me from 50mg to 100mg. After two days I tried to kill myself, and ended up in the hospital psych ward. 

I'm rambling, I'm sorry. These are things I've never been able to actually say to another human being. Its much easier to type these things out. I'm so alone, and I'm in so much pain. I don't know how much longer I can go on like this.
