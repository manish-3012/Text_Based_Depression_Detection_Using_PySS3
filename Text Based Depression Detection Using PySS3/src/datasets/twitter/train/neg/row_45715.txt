Its 2am. I cannot sleep. I want to go drown myself in the ocean because I am not loved.My abusers lead happy successful lives whers they are well loved and liked. All of them. 

They left me disabled. It doesnt matter how hard I work or how much I get away from them, they have wealth and happiness. 

One has fame. Her trust fund and support group carried her. 

My family is homophobic and racist. 

I realize I am nothing. My good work ethic is nothing.  My hard work is for nothing. 

I need to kill myself but I am too afraid. 

I wanted to go enjoy my life one last time but I'm a woman and I've been sexually assaulted. I cant roam the country like a man can.
