I have no reason to be alive.I fucked up my life. I thought getting away from racist teachers in high school by going online might be better, but it was so much worse. I learned everything myself but my friends and support drifted away. I didn't receive any support or advice on college from that online school, and ended up scaring myself by putting myself in debt immediately and dropping out. My dad always abused me over money, and spending money became the most horrifying thing in the world. Right when I tried to go to college again, my dad evicted us from what I always had thought of as my house, but apparently he was the homeowner and could win the trial. Now I'm 23, I'll be 22 this summer and not even living at home, but I've been living in a 2 star motel for 3 years with my mom. I quit every job I get, I don't even care about making money anymore, if it's not there to spend, then I can't be responsible for it.   
I really just want to die a this point. I haven't left this room since maybe the summer, just a few times to go out and buy food or something.  
It probably sounds stupid as fuck but I see no other way out. I'm so embarrassed of myself and hate what my life has become.
