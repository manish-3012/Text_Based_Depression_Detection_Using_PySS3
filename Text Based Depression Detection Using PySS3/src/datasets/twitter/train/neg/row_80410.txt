I have no excuseI know I have a fortunate life, I know I come from a rich white family who lives by a lake and has a boat . I know I am a white man and it could be worse. I know there are people less fortunate and it could always be worse. This is always the response I get. Why are you so depressed you dont have any problems? JUST BECAUSE IM FORTUNATE DOESNT MEAN I DONT HAVE PROBLEMS!!! I feel like my problems always get neglected because of my background. all of my opinions, neglected because I had a fortunate beginning. That doesnt mean Im not upset or should feel bad for wanting to end myself. Every FUCKING TIME. Im so fucking tired of this. Its not an excuse. Im done. I HAVE PROBLEMS I DONT CARE IF YOU HAD HARD TIMES I GET THAT!!! IM MENTALLY FUCKING ILL I DONT GIVE A SHIT!!! FUCK THIS AND FUCK EVERYONE I HATE MYSELF. I constantly feel shitty for being upset when i am so fortunate because its been drilled into my fucking head by everyone ive talked to. I want help, not guilt.
