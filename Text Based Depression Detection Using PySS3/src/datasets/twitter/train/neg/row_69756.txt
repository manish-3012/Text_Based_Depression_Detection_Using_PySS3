It's so hardIt's so hard getting through each day. It's like my body's full of bricks and I'm trying to drag it forward through life. My body's heavy and tiring. It's leading to little progress. And nothing makes me happy :( The pain's not bad, but I don't have the strength to push on. I don't have the motivation either. I don't have it in me to be happy. I don't have it in me to pretend. I just want to lay here and stare at the sky and watch the clouds drift by. I want silence and peace. I want no worries. I want no one to have any expectations from me. I don't want responsibilities.
