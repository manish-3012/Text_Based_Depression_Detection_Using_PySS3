I need helpI am really confused because I want to be okay but at the same time I want someone to hurt me right now. I guess this is sorta a self harm thing because i don't want to be the one inflicting pain on myself or making wounds I don't want my dad or mom or anyone to see it cause they won't understand and when they try to ask me what's wrong they get angry when I am not instantly happy afterwards like they say suck it up other people have it much worse than you stop being a baby and my dad mocks me by fake crying calling me a crybaby I hate it I hate it so much the pain and the angry just makes me want to hit him punch him in the face he hurts me emotionally I rather be hit instead of getting insulted Atleast physically I heal better if I got punch in the face it would hurt to the touch but I wouldn't want to die. Just I am going crazy in a way I sorta want a relationship In a way I sorta want a new dad and mom cause I want to feel loved but to be honest I think it's too late because even when I found someone who Loves me I still want to die.
