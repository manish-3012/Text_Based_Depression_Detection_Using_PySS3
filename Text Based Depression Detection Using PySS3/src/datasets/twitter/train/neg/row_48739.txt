Goodbye everybody.I'm really tired of struggling and fighting and doing anything.  So I'm killing myself.  I'm transgender mtf, I hate myself and my body and everything about myself.  I'll never find somebody to love me, so I'm leaving.  Love you guys.  Bye.

EDIT: okay well I got out of a psych hospital just now but I'm alive, I'm ok and I'm doing a little bit better.  Thank you all for your kind words.
