Why...why did she leave like this?Ghosting is the worst. Its almost about to be a year and I still have no closure, not the slightest idea why she left. It was an online relationship (we met in this very subreddit believe it or not) and though we were thousands of miles away we were (after months of being supportive friends) in love.

And then she just... leaves. No reason, no message, no nothing. Her entire internet footprint too, just gone. No mail activity, nothing on social media. Gone.

Gone.

Why?
