TiredThere's so much to live for but god I wish I could just stop everything and fall asleep forever. Anything I do, even waking up is immediately exhausting. The rare days I get out of bed energized end in the worst ways with a breakdown, usually something of my own doing to mess it up. 

I'm sick of this cycle. I'll never take the final leap to end it, yet these thoughts constantly pop up after everything I do. It's never enough. 

I'm lucky that people care. I absolutely wouldn't be here otherwise.
