Feel sad everyday, please read and helpHey everyone, just need to get this off my chest. Iâ€™m 24 and male and have always had pretty bad general and social anxiety with some depression. At 22 I decided to finally see a psychiatrist. He prescribed me Gabapentin. Stayed on for a year and it actually helped a good amount. Still had some anxiety but was able to go out with friends and out to eat and stuff which I never could do before. I read bad stuff about staying on it long term so I tapered off. The withdrawals were pretty bad and I never felt right so after about 4 months I went back on. Felt a bit better but never good so I asked to try an SSRI (Celexa) to go along with my Gabapentin. Side effects sucked on week 3, so I quit. I stayed on the Gabapentin and upped my dose a little. Still am on Gabapentin now. Ever since quitting Celexa last August, my libido has been very low and it was super high before Celexa. I only took Celexa for 3 weeks. I have read about permanent sexual issues from SSRIâ€™s and I worry everyday about it. I miss my sex drive. Nothing feels good anymore. I have way less anxiety now and am still on Gabapentin but I feel the Celexa permanently took away sex drive and other feelings.
