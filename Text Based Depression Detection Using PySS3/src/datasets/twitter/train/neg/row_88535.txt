Clearly something is wrong with me.I always try to be kind. So many people wax poetically about how all the world needs is more kindness. And yet, all it ever gets me is shit shoveled into my face. Getting used by "friends" for whatever, the whole schtick. At this point I've edged out all but the very last of my facebook friends - college friends, high school friends, even most family, all gone. Most numbers deleted in my phone, not that anyone contacts me anyway. I've managed to scale back the social side of my life to the barest minimum while maintaining a decent job. Yet I can't shake the discomfort of being around people, especially young women around my age. The frustration of it is almost too much to bear.

First girlfriend was dumb as rocks and entirely codependent, the next turned out to be lesbian, the next was emotionally manipulative, and then the latest (and most significant) started developing schizophrenia 2 1/2 years in. Even better, thanks to the way it can come in waves I got to watch her lose her mind twice, with eight months in between of life on eggshells hoping that it wouldn't return. 

So now I'm alone and get to thinking, "Why is it that nobody around me seems to be worth the time? Am I?"

Honestly, I just don't think that I am anymore. Suicide has been on my mind for more than a decade. How long do I have to wait before sacking up and just doing it? It's not like it'll be hard.
