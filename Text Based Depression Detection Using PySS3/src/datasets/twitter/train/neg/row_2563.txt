Please helpIt hurts so much.  I don't actually want to die, I just don't want to hurt anymore.  I'm in such bad shape, and I don't know if I last very much longer.  My story is long and complicated and I'm about to be homeless and I don't want to be a burden but I can't find a job my body can take and I am about to just end it.  I have posted about my problems before and ranted and no one every answers.  

I am crying in the dark and I feel all alone.
