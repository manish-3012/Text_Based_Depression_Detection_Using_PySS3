ending it a week after my 24th birthdayI turn 24 next month and I've already picked my date. I feel pretty at peace with my decision. I know I won't be suffering with untreatable depression anymore, day after day. I won't be wasting space or anyone's time. I'll be gone. If these last several months have taught me anything, it's that my life will always be sad, lonely and pathetic. things might get better for some people but for a lot of people things unfortunately do not get better, and that life sucks unless you're pretty, smart, have money, are sociable, if treatments for mental illness are helpful, etc. I've failed to seek comfort in talking about my problems since it doesn't solve my issues or make me feel better. medications have never helped. I used to be extremely ambitious. I had lots of goals and cared a lot. All of that is gone. I've literally never been this depressed for such an extended period of time in my life and I know that there is no turning back. I don't even know why I am posting this to be honest. 

Good luck I guess, everyone. Thank you to those who've tried to help me and who read my numerous and pathetic breakup posts of me whining about someone who doesn't give a shit about me anymore. I don't really know what else to say. that's it.
