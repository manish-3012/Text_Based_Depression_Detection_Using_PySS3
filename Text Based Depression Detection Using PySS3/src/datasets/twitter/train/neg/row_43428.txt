Why do some people joke about suicide?So there are a few people in some of my classes that do the strangest thing: they say things like 'If I have to do that, then I'll kill myself!"  or somerimes they say something like.. " If we do that then I swear I'll kill myself!' I know they're joking, but I feel uncomfortable when they say something like that. 
My parents often make jokes about suicide as well. This morning I asked my dad if he could help me with my homework but he said "If you can't do that, just go and kill yourself!" I know he's just joking. Should I laugh then? I'm just wondering if anybody has experienced people doing this, and why?
