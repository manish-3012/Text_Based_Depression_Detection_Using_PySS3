Talk to me?Recently, feeling like a failure. Never good enough for anything, always just better than average but never good enough. No one really sees how I am on the inside, everyone thinks I'm doing okay, I'm smart, I'm pretty, I'm successful. Went to talk to a shrink. She didn't help either. No one sees past all those layers, everyone just assumes I'm okay, that I'll be okay, that people like me will always be okay. But I'm not. I'm really not.

History of self-harm going back a decade, one undocumented suicide attempt involving a stockpile of prescription painkillers, sleeping pills and anti-nausea meds, plus tylenol from a bottle to top it up. I survived it, not sure how...I remember being disappointed. I thought I'd planned well, I took enough pills that when it finally came back up 18 hours+ later, you could still see completely undissolved pills even when I took all that on an empty stomach. That was a few years ago, I'm back at that same point emotionally again. Everything's going sideways and I don't know how to fix it. I'm just tired of never being good enough. Been crying off and on for 3 hours now.

Edit: I'm gonna delete this account or at least not log back on, don't worry about me, I'll either do it or I won't. I'll figure out which by tonight.
