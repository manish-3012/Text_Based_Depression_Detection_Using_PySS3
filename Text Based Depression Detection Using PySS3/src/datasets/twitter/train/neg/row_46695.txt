Just need to ventI just want to vent here, because I can't justify bothering anyone in real life with my horse shit.  So here it goes I guess:

I feel lonely all the time, but lately it's been really bad.  I think it's because of all the visiting; seeing all the happy couples in my life continuously reminding me that it's something beyond my reach.  I've single handedly fucked up enough potential relationships to convince me of that fact.  But I'm a desperately lonely individual: 21, virgin, never even had a girlfriend, only kissed a girl once (and according to her I wasn't even good at that).  But it's all my own damned fault, I know deep down I have an admittedly shallow and misogynistic desire to just have someone willing to have sex with me whenever I feel like it, but I also have an almost toddler like need for constant emotional reassurance (which I am incapable of reciprocating).

I've been suicidal - on and off - for as long as I can remember feeling anything, but I'm fairly confident I would never go through with it.  Knowing that, I've considered castrating myself just to get rid of my ridiculous hope that my unrealistic perfect woman will come along and go out of her way to get to know my pathetically shy ass, but I don't have the balls to do even that (ha, I made a funny in a suicide thread).  

Even if I did meet someone, I'd almost hope they were just using me, because I always feel like complete shit when anyone gives me anything, because deep down I know they've been deceived into thinking I'm not a complete waste of space.

If you've made it this far I'd like to apologize formwasting your time with my aforementioned horse shit, it's really not your problem but I don't have the guts to just suck it up like I should.  Also the atrociousness of the flow and formatting is blamed on my tiny iPod touch screen.
