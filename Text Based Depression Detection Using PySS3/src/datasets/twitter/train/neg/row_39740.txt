Should I even qualify to live?My life has always been riddled with failures. My depression wasn't that bad back then but it's gotten worse as an adult. I'm severely lonely and everyday is just a repeat of the previous. I try to distract myself with activities to cope with loneliness but I often quit early. And this god damn pandemic isn't helping either. I'm tired of wasting away being sad and lonely, as the world passes me as if I don't matter. I wanna scream and show my worth but as an adult "I have to keep my composure". I've been hiding myself for years now, I've never told anyone how I really am. I usually hide it with a smile like everything is fine when it's not. I'm so tired of being worthless piece of trash. I keep saying I want to die but I don't have the courage to do it. It's like something is always holding me back, maybe a false hope that things will get better or the fact if I die who will take care of my father the only family member who has my back. But even that I never told him I have depression and how bad it's gotten. I don't want to be a burden. Regardless am I even qualified to keep on living? , when I'm just wasting time withering away as the clock keeps ticking?
