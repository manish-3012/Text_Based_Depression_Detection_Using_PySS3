My View On Life.I'm very focused on scientific philosophy, and there isn't one solid reason for life. I'm very stubborn and rejecting, and won't do anything without a good reason for it. So I seek no reason in life. I refuse to work all my life, because that is just suffering. I'm not scared of death at all, it does not worry me, I welcome it. I'm not even sad or depressed or have any real problems in my life, I just want to die. I'm very happy at the thought of my death. I hope that I will be killed in an accident, rather than me having to take my own life. If my parents found out how I felt about life they would go crazy, and would probably say something like "Your only 14 don't have these thoughts". I don't really know how to successfully commit suicide, and research doesn't help. I just want to die. I'm not even sad, in fact I am very happy!
