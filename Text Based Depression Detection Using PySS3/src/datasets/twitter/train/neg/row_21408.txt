I Hate Myself and Wish I was DeadMy eating habits just make me miserable and I have no restraint when it comes to food. It seems like I'm constantly compulsively craving something to eat even when I'm not hungry and it seems like I can have no positive quality of life because my body feels like absolute garbage from eating too much.

I just feel like an absolute embarrassment around people, I don't enjoy being around people anymore. I don't really have anything to live for, especially if I can no longer be around people. I'm too stupid too advance well in life and I know that constant unrelated worries about aspects of my health are going to make life potentially unbearable.

I don't know what I'm trying to say. I thought things were going better lately but now it just seems pointless to even bother trying.
