Appreciation post.One year ago, I was on one of the worst phases in my life, I felt like nobody gave a shit about me, all my life collapsed, people told me that it's all temporary but I didn't believe them since the past 2 years felt like forever, I tried to end my life 2 times thank god I failed, I used to spend my whole day laying in my bed overthinking shit that happened years ago and I'm pretty sure no one remembers it. When I asked my parents to take me to a therapist they refused and called me crazy.

When I discovered this subreddit every post was relatable, I kept reading how people feel and the comments kinda made sense,for the first time in my life I felt like someone actually cares if I'm alive, even when the comments weren't directed to me. I actually wrote a post here and it got ignored so I just deleted it lol.

I made a decision to take some advices from your comments and try them out since I have nothing to do, I started working out, I tried getting back to my hobbies ( making shitty software ), I left myself do whatever I want, I wanna scream ? Do it, wanna cry ? Do it, wanna play a game ? Do it, wanna go outside ? Do it ( not currently bois ).

Now after a year from this, I actually feel better than before, I still overthink sometimes but totally less than before, no more suicidal thoughts, I can live with my mistakes now, and it's all because of you everybody, I want to thank every single person who gave some of his time to write a comment on this subreddit for the sake of helping people he doesn't know.

And for everyone who's going though shit in his life, take it from me, I know how bad it is and how it feels like it will never be over, but it will, ik it' sounds clichÃ© but it's the truth, I love you random citizen â™¥ï¸
