Itâ€™s selfish that my family wants me to stay alive just because it would disgust them if I killed myselfIâ€™m forced to be alive. My grandmother loves me and would be devastated if I kill myself. My little cousin would be traumatized if I die. But I live in absolute agony. None of my friends care about me once they found out I have binge eating disorder. Suddenly being 3 lbs overweight is â€œdisgusting.â€ Suddenly when I eat a whole slice of cake it is â€œnasty.â€ When before they knew this about me it was fine. Every day I count calories. Itâ€™s been this way for a decade. I lost my job. I gained 20 lbs. now Iâ€™m 3 lbs overweight and I spent all year gaining and losing the 3 lbs. itâ€™s torture. I donâ€™t want to be alive. Me being alive for others comfort is utterly disgusting, Iâ€™m like a fucking circus monkey. I live to serve them, even as a shell of myself. Iâ€™m IN therapy. Iâ€™ve TRIED medicine. Iâ€™m just beyond help. I wonâ€™t be happy until Iâ€™m skinny and free of worry. Iâ€™ll never be the second one.
