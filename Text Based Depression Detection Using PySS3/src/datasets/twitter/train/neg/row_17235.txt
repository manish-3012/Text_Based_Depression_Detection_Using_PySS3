I lost the only person that showed me love.I made an account on here just to post this because im running out of options. 3 months ago i broke up with my girlfriend of 2 years because I started to feel like she lost love for me. All we would do is fight and she'd throw my abusive childhood in my face saying thats no excuse for how I am. But I live in my head and I would always think she was going to hurt me. I couldn't help it and I hate myself for it. I finally made an appointment next week for my mental health just so I could try and get better for her. Because we even have an unborn child that she miscarried. I texted her after not talking for 3 weeks because she got mad i was self harming and talking to other girls just to feel that emptyness in my heart. No matter how much I explained that my mind is a fucking maze she didnt understand. I used to tell her to leave me when I'd have a mental breakdown and trip on her for no reason. And she told me she'd love me forever... Anyways i texted her last night after 3 weeks and she text me back saying i was too toxic. And my "mental problems were no excuse for being a piece of shit" she already started talking to someone else and now im alone again. My appt is on monday and i dont even know what to do. I feel like a hopeless fucking kid again. I just want to die I have no friend's or family that cares. No matter what I do i cant escape my pain and my insane mind.... I lost the only person that showed me love in my life. All because of my mind. I cant fucking do this anymore...
