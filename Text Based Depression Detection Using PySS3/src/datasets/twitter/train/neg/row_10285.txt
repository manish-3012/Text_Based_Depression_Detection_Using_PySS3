hey ;)im an anorexic with bulimic tendencies, i know this isnt a eating disorder subreddit but i also know people with eating disorders are 3-6 times more likely to commit suicide than anyone without one. i had depression which i learned to overcome but when i finally found a way to cope it kind of changed colours like a chameleon hiding from predators. also side note im obsessed with weed and alcohol not in a sad "i need this to cope" way im just a total stoner/drunkorexic
