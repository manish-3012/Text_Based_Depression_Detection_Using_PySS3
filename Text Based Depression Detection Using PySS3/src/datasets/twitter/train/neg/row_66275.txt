I feel like a piece of shit for thisBut the recurring thought I keep having re the shootings on the news is "better go get a gun and kill myself before they're all taken away."

Even if I can find the right combination of therapy and meds, that won't fix the way I look or the way I feel about it. I'm nobody's first choice. Not my girlfriend's, not my friends, not my family. I'm just done.
