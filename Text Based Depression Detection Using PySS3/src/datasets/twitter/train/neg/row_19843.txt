Suicidal Medical StudentGosh. On the outside, I seem to have to all. But really, I don't. I don't like myself. My family doesn't like me either. I am at the bottom of my class. I'm gay. Hispanic. Bipolar. Hot. Instagram famous. Miserable. I want out. I did bad on my first board exam that basically determines where and what I can do with my life. I want out. I have been so depressed these past two weeks. Gained 13 pounds. I don't want to fail but I don't want to study. I feel hopeless and ready to go.
