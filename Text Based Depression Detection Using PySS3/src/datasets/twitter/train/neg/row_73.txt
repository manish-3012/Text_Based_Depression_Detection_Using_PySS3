I probably won't... but it just seems like an easy end to the pain....Truthfully, like most people here... I just want an outside reason or voice to give me some light and make it seem worth it... For the past few weeks I'll grab my gun, unloaded, cock it, and just put it to my head and pull the trigger just to hear the 'click'... It's pretty fucked up considering I haven't felt like this since High School. If anyone cares for the story, I've posted it in r/offmychest and r/relationship_advice. Of course this is all over a girl and I know it'll pass.... I just hate that my mind is trying to kill me....
