When do I ask for help?I have had persistent suicidal ideation for a couple years now. I am in therapy that is helpful for a lot of things but not the suicidal ideation. 

Recently the thoughts have been so much more violent than usual and I'm afraid I might actually have intent (not sure???). When is it time to tell my friends and family. I don't want to freak them out over nothing but honestly I feel so scared and alone.
