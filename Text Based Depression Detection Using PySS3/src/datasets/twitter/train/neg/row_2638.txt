am i fucked in the headI constantly wish something tragic happened to me. l wish someone I love like my family or one of my closest friends got into a car accident or something so I actually have a reason to kill myself. I want to now but whenever I think about it, theres nothing wrong with my life. I have loving parents and a brother who supports me but I'm still unhappy with everything. It just makes me feel like I'm too weak to live life as a human being, with all these complex emotions I don't understand. Why couldn't I just be a jellyfish?
Idk why I'm sharing this. Maybe I wanna see if other people think these things so I can come to a conclusion that I'm a fucked up person.
