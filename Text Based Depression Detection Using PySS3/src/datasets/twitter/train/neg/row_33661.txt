I feel like I can't live anymore.As of the summer of 7th grade, of being 13 about to turn 14, I feel like, I have no friends. I feel like I never can get out of my fucking house. I feel, like ending it. Since of being in position of a fishing pocket knife about 7 months ago in 7th grade, all my friends left me... I am a social outcast, and I get bullied of bringing that knife. I will regret for the rest of my life. I am so afraid to go to school in 8th grade... I am very afraid. Every day I wake up, splash my face with cool water, and look at my door hanger for towels and thinking raping my belt around my throat and putting a hook on it and putting a chair below the door hanger and kicking the chair while standing on it and plop down killing myself. But, as of now, that was nearly 8 months ago and I seem that I infer that everyone will forget that 7th grade moment. I watch you tube videos on "suicide" and I am just so sad, and just want to suck out all the pain out my life. I don't really know how. But I am ending it if I get bullied in 8th grade, and getting made fun of, and not having relationships, etc... This past year I am having such a hard time... I don't know what to do anymore, I hate this feeling. I want to get rid of it.

But this was my pervious suicide thread that explains it all: http://redd.it/30jjiw
