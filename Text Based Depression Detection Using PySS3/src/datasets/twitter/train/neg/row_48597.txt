I don't know what is happening with me...This isn't a throwaway because I don't give a fuck.

Lately, I've felt empty. I don't want air to fill my lungs or for my feet to touch the ground. I'm tired of living life. My life is *very* boring.

Recently, I was hospitalized, and when I was admitted, my girlfriend was hanging out at home with one of her "friends" who happened to be male, and I have never met. I love her so much, but she did that..

I'm was diagnosed with chronic depression and some sort of bipolar issues in July and was prescribed to Abilify in November. Well, after about two months on it, I felt okay. I stopped taking my pills, and I was *happy*. I loved life. I was finally happy again!

Well, now it's March. Recently I lost my best friend that I've had since 7th grade. He told me that he doesn't want to talk to me anymore and that I make his life shit. He sees me on campus and does a complete 180 and walks the other way. I have no idea what I did wrong.

I lost my best friend, and my girlfriend was at home with another guy. Oh, I should say that my girlfriend told me she was going to lunch with the guy, named Ty, and I explicitly told her that I didn't want her to see Ty. She said "okay" and that she would just stay at home with her friend, who we'll call Scarlett. Well, turns out that she lied and was with Ty...

Reddit, am I over thinking things? I lost my best friend and I'm not sure that my girlfriend is faithful or not. I'm tired of living my life. I want a way out and don't know what to do.

Any help would be better than no help.

I can't take this pain much longer.
