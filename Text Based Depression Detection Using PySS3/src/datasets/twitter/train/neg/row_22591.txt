I don't knowI don't have a long post. I don't know why I'm here. I don't know why I think about killing myself. I want it to stop, but I also want to end myself. I just want help but I don't know what kind of help I want. I don't know what would help. Sometimes my life feels together and other times it feels like I'm trying to pick up shattered glass.
