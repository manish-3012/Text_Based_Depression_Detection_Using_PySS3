I was calling the hotline then It was dropped because of high volume... I find that saddening...I was calling the hotline and It was dropped because of high volume found it pretty sad that they couldn't answer my call because there were too many people calling for the same reason...

I'm not mad that they didn't take my call but I'm happy that others are getting the help they needed... And I'm proud of them for calling
