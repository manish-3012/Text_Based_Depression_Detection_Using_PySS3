LonelyI (22f) met a girl same age from Puerto rico. I fell in love. I still am. We video chat all day whenever we can and sleep on the chat too. But she has a boyfriend. Neither of us are out. He doesnt know about me. I know she loves me too. We know each other so well. As if we can read each others minds. I don't want to hear about cheating or that she doesn't love me enough if she is with someone else. Think what you want.  I'm a piece of shit either way. I had my car totaled in august and I should have died. Why am I here. I have no friends at my small college. I sit alone everyday. I want to die. I couldn't see a future and didnt care to until I met her. I just want someone who would go the lengths I would for someone else. I want someone to text me before I text them. To tell me they love me before I do. I hate being the one who cares more every time. I'm trapped in a Christian world and I think I'm lesbian.  All I know is that I want to die. My peek was in highschool. I failed student teaching and my college wont let me continue that major and I'm switching. I procrastinate too much. I didnt get the pills I needed to make myself do things. I didnt do shit I needed to do. I dont need to be here. Idk why I'm here anymore. I dont want to live.
