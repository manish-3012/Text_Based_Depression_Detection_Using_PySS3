When does it get better...?I'm constantly told that it gets better. I'm sure I've told people that myself in the past. But.. When? Ive been waiting a couple years now and everythings constantly getting worse. No matter how much I try I'm constantly fucking myself over. Constantly making myself worse off that I was. I screwed stuff up with school and now I'm in 55k+ debt from that with no degree. I fucked things up with someone I loved. I fucked up so many things and now I feel alone, I work so much to pay my bills and get by and every day doesn't feel real anymore. I never used to be depressed but over these past couple years it's gotten so bad, I'm not really sure who I am anymore. I guess I wish I could see a therapist but I don't have insurance at the moment. I don't really have friends anymore so I guess I don't know who to turn to anymore. I just know I spent most of my free time crying and wishing I wasn't here anymore
