I recognize that it is important for me to reach out to someone right now.I am no stranger to suicidal ideations, but I am forming a very real plan for the first time. I would appreciate if anyone could spare some time just to talk to me. I almost feel selfish for asking, but I am truly in a bad place and need the distraction. Thank you in advance for any kindness.
