I dont know if this belongs here..I don't plan to kill myself, but I wouldn't mind if someone very quickly murdered me. I'm not upset with life or anything. I'm not, suicidal, not anymore, I just think about it everyday. 

If I were to die, if someone were to kill me, it is what it is, right? I guess I just don't want to be responsible for my own death, but I'm ready to leave. 

I think the only thing that truly ties me to this earth is my dog. Once she dies, I won't be so afraid anymore.
