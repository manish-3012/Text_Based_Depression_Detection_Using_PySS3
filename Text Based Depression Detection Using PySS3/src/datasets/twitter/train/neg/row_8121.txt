Please helpI always see comments about suicide hotlines and support groups and even subreddits when there's a post about depression or whatever. My girlfriend has been depressed for some time but last night she told me that she lays awake and contemplates suicide as it would be easier. Her problems are first world and involve the incompletion of her master's degree and her families unacceptable attitude towards everything during her entire life. To hear my beautiful best friend of almost 10 years doesn't want to live is indescribable. I am heartbroken. She tells me she loves me and I'm her other half and it's true. But also that lately I'm the only thing that makes her feel anything at all. She's lost any joy from singing and other hobbies and is numb. I must persue certain long term goals to establish a life together but right now I am lost. She's expressed in the past that she doesn't want therapy or medication but I think maybe a professional can help. I just need at least some information or advice? Please help.
