tomorrow's the dayive wanted to die for some time now. about 4 years of my life wasted and wishing i was dead. ive failed multiple times in taking my life. been hospitalized, on medication, in therapy, you name it.

a couple of days ago my mother uncovered some things about me she was never supposed to know. i cant go into detail, but the bottom line is- ive reached the final breaking point.

these new issues on top of everything else i deal with on a day to day basis have all finally suffocated me.

this is what ive wanted for years. tomorrow is the day. im going to go through with it. 

i dont want advice, or consoling, i just want somebody to know. 

thank you, reddit. 

see you on the other side
