Life has no meaningMy life has no meaning. I canâ€™t imagine myself five years from now. I donâ€™t want to. Someone told me the best thing that could happen to you in life is death. So there it is. I donâ€™t want to upset my friends or family. But they seriously will only be upset for a short while and move on. They might even talk bad about me. If I die I will be at peace from everything, the pain of this world. I donâ€™t have anyone who is remotely interested in dating me, I donâ€™t have anyone who texts me aside from my one and only friend. There is nothing for me out here. Absolutely nothing.
