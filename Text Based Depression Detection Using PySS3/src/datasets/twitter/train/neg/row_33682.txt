Canâ€™t see myself moving to 4031, gambling addict, broke. Bad hypochondriac, I get strange physical symptoms Iâ€™m sure are cancer or a disease they canâ€™t cure or treat which will leave me sick and dying.

I donâ€™t go to the doctor because Iâ€™m afraid to know.

Iâ€™ve lived a crazy life, but I fizzled our with all my dreams around 26, making amazing money, my own business. Ka-poof.

I donâ€™t blame anyone, I just donâ€™t logically see a point in life? Chronic never-ending dread, everyone I love getting older- when they pass how will I handle it?

Why would I want to endure? I had a lot of dreams but they all seem so futile.

I really would like to live and be happy, lay in the grass and be grateful I get to watch the bees buzz, and the butterflies dance.

I donâ€™t actually want to die, I just wish to cease existing. 

Constant dread. To better my life requires immense amounts of work I am just not willing to do, or unable to do small intervals of focus and hope are greatly outweighed by just laying in my bed numbly scrolling my phone, not even blinking.
