I'm officially a burden to my familyI caught my Mom and Dad texting each-other talking smack about me, "I'm depressing to be around" is what one of the texts said, "same crap, crying, and my Dad is tired of feeling sorry for me." All I want is God back :-( I don't want to kill myself but I'm tired of myself too, aww :-( I'm sad

I'm too old for this so I understand, I'm 27.
