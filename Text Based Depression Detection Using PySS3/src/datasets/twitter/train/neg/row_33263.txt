I am sure I will eventually kill myselfI have been having suicidal thoughts for almost 4 years. I know I will eventually kill myself.
I don't want to. I really want to get help but I don't know who to go to. To get a therapist i'll have to tell my mom and she will just think i'm an idiot and don't grasp the concept of depression.
I don't have anyone I trust enough to talk about this with- they will probably tell our the teachers.
I honestly don't know what to do. I have no idea how to cope with these thoughts. Some nights I just curl into a ball and begin scratching myself since I feel so terrible.
