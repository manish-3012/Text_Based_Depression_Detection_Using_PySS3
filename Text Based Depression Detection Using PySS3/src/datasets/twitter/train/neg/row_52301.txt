People are fucking terrible.People suck. And that's the one constant in life. No matter how many change my worldview, no matter how good or bad my mental health gets.

Sure there are a few good people. But there's just so many terrible people in the world, and it's impossible to avoid them. I don't mean people who say mean things. I mean that its impossible to escape this world where the rich get to make *more* money off people's suffering. Oh, and I'm one of those people, and so is everyone else. 

It's a problem I *can't* solve. No matter what I do, this is a *permanent* problem. The only solutions are numbing my mind to it and ignoring it, or killing myself because I refuse to deal with it. 

Is this really what life is? "Get used to it, it stays this bad"? I know the answer is yes, and I know that means I want to escape.
