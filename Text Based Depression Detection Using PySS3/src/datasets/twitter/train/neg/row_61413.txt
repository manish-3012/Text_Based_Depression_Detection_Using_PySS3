Good moments are illusion, those moments are temporary and suicide is inevitable for meI thought that depression will kill me, sooner or later, but my gambling addiction  will help me end this sooner.

Planning suicide, having enough money would solve my problem, but unfortunately i dont have any options.

Im fucking piece of shit, i cant rely on anyone anymore.
