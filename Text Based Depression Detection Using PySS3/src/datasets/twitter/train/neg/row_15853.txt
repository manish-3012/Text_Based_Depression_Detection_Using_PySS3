I'm too young...Here's a bit of background info; I turn 16 in about 2 weeks, I'm in my sophomore year of high school, I have a great family and some really great friends. I have a really great life...from the outside. Ever since I was 7 years old I have had depression and have been on medication for at least 4 years. When I was a little bit younger I tried killing myself a few times but since I have been on meds its been a lot better. I'm only 2 weeks into school but I already can't take it. The past 3 night Iv'e cried myself to sleep, not wanting to wake up. I've always had the tough of killing myself in the back of my mind for a long time but could never do it. At first I was too scared, hanging myself or whatever I decided scared me a lot. I could never bring myself to do it which made me feel like a wuss. I've always kinda wanted to pull the trigger (literally or metaphorically) but know I could never, which I hate. In the past year or 2 I've come across a really great group of friends who I really like hanging out with and am semi open about my past suicidal tendencies with which has been a little helpful. Another thing I hate is that I feel like **I can't tell anyone about anything I'm feeling**. I've been going to a therapist for 3 years and haven't said a single word about how I really feel about anything personal. I'm pretty close with my mom and dad and will occasionally tell them when I'm stressed but never about any internal struggles or things regarding my depression. They of course know about it and are very supportive and loving but it seems like nothing is enough. It seems irrational **but I won't talk to anyone about it**, even my best friend of 14 years, about my depression. It's not that I feel weaker or more vulnerable. I really don't know why I can't tell anyone. Maybe I'm embarrassed? Or just don't know how to describe what I'm feeling. I would really like help on how to talk to my therapist about topics, normally I just hope he brings them up and I'll answer but even then I'm too scared to respond..I don't want to even though I know I should. As of recently the want to end it is really resurfacing. Again, I can't do it, I never could, but this time it's just because I'm thinking of all the pain it causes on others. I have so many friends and loved ones that would be devastated, I can't even comprehend if my best friend where to do anything to himself. I feel at this point **I have to suffer day by day just so others don't have to**. I haven't killed myself because of the pain it would cause others. Why do I have to suffer? School has been really triggering these thoughts again and it really annoys me. School isn't even that bad, I'm not bullied, I have friends, I'm smart, I even laugh during the day. It's just every night I think of how much school sucks out of me. By the time I get home I have absolutely no drive to do anything the rest of the day. My schedule goes; wake up, go to school, get home, do homework, eat dinner, go to bed. I have no time to do anything anymore. I'm a pretty good student but recently I just stopped doing my homework, I get home sit there for 45 minutes and do absolutely nothing. I'm so exhausted and emotionless I cant even process thoughts. Another thing that gets me each night is how long I still have to go. If I go to collage (which my dad will  make me) I have at least 7 more years of suffering through each boring day. It doesn't matter if I have friends or laugh, I still suffer. 7 years, of waking up, going to school, sleep. repeat. 180 days a year. I don't even look forward to the weekends anymore, it just means I have to go back in 2 days. It's just an emotionless cycles of school until I either end it myself or lose sanity. I don't know how people do it, go day by day, month by month doing the same stupid thing. I keep having anxiety attacks each night and I start hyperventilating and crying. How much longer do I have to suffer this routine? At some points I even like crying just so I know I have another emotion other than '**empty**'. I've tried really hard but I just can't talk to anyone about it, and I'm not sure I want to. Strangely enough I feel a little bit better just putting it out on the internet for a random person to see. Something about the other end being faceless, or maybe being able to take my time to write. I really want to end it all, ^(I keep thinking of standing in the center of the school cafeteria, putting a gun to my chin, and just let the booming echo of the shot ring through the walls... than silence...finally.) But I can't. I'm too scared, I don't want to make other mourn because of the decisions I have made. But I don't want to keep doing this, crying every night about how much longer I have to.
