Pills, pills, pillsMy God have I overdosed. Worst I managed was to aspirate some bloody biscuits and end up on a ventilator with pneumonia.

This is interest, not research for an attempt. I've passed that. I have someone to live for, and I'm finding different ways to move my addiction away from drugs.

Now, assuming a very high tolerance to opiates and benzodiazepines the following turn someones lights out for good:

* 98mg of Klonopin
* 55mg of Xanax
* 780mg of codeine
* 200mg of morphine sulphate (XR, but can be defeated to make immediate)
* A nice bottle of red wine
