Why does the thought of suicide give me tranquility?Backround information: I have had a ongoing depression since the beginning of this year, its sparked from constant lonliness and stress from a traumatic surgery, but lately its gone to a point where I am having breakdowns on occasions and the thought of suicide has actually put my mind at peace. Why do I feel this way towards suicide and how can I combat this?
