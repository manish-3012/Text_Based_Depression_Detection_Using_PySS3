I just had my family over and I've never felt so alone.I can't get better. I can't stop being the controlling, mean, unempathetic person I am. I don't know why I'm like this, my siblings have such personality and there's just something wrong with me. 


I know they could care less about me. I don't even blame them. 


My situation could get better. Maybe I won't be so stressed anymore after school ends and maybe I'll be in a different surrounding if I move to the UK. But how much better could things really get? I'm still me and that won't change and I hate that. 

I don't want to feel like this anymore. 


Life is just too fucking much for me. Other people can handle this but honestly I'm just so weak. I can't be vulnerable and I'm so afraid of being abandoned but every thing I do as a result of that pushes people away. Days can be good days can be bad but overall it's still a fucking rollercoaster. Even my "good" days just aren't worth it. 


I've been here before. I can't make myself swallow the whole bottle or jump off the bridge but I think I can if I'm drunk.
