Facebook has thrown me over the edge.Long story short, a girl I cared about for 15 years is on my Facebook. We didn't work out for whatever reasons, but I poured my heart out about it to my "friend" years ago. He only met her once briefly. He talks to me irregularly and doesn't hardly communicate but he immediately added her on there and likes every damn one of her pictures and statuses. Every damn one. I confided in this asshole and now all I want to do is kick his ass. I feel betrayed and feel like shit. I hate the world. Maybe this is petty AF to you but it's really made me start to lose my damned mind. This with anxiety and depression is making me want to end my own life. It's been a long time that I've been dealing with this problem.
