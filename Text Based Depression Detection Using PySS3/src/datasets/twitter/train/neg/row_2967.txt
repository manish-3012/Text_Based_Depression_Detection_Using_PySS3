Would it be better to leave a letter?I'm not going to do anything right now, so please no one worry. I was just thinking if I were to kill myself, would it be better for my family for me to have written a letter? I feel like I wouldn't want to go without telling them at least why I did it? I'm not sure. Thanks guys.
