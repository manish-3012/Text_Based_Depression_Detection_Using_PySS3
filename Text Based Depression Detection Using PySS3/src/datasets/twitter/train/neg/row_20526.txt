The world has been wonderful to me, I'm just not worthy of itUnlike many other suicide people, I don't hate the world around me. It has never been too cruel, nor too injust, nor too corrupted.

The problem was always me. I have always been horrible at EVERYTHING, it is seriously astonishing how the hell could I be so bad at all things at the same time.

I will kill myself because of shame, guilt and regret. I cannot live considering my past. I will never be happy. Nothing that I do in the future will compensate for my past mistakes.
