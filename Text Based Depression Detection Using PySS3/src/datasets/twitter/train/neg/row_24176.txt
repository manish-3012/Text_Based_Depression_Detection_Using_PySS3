I don't know how much longer I can do this.I've read a lot of things on here, never posted anything before though. I don't even really know what category this fits under. I absolutely hate my life, I can't say that i've actually 'enjoyed' a moment of it since I was 13. I've grown up with no father, an alcoholic mother and little to no money in the family. The roof is starting to sink in on our house because of the rain, there are windows that have been broken for over a year and never been fixed. I just want out. I feel like everyday is just draining me slowly, I really don't see the grass getting any greener... I don't know if anyone will read this let alone comment on it. But I need help and I really don't know where else to go.. I don't think I will ever have the guts to actually talk to a real person about all of my issues, so here I am... I can't really say that I would kill myself, but I really don't care if I live or not... IAMA 17yo M
