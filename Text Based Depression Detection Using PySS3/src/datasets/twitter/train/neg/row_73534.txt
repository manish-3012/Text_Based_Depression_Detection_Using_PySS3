i just need someone tell me not to do iti just want a simple â€œdonâ€™t do itâ€. i donâ€™t want you to make it about how hurt youâ€™ll be. i donâ€™t want you to tell me i might regret it. iâ€™m on medication, going to therapy, but the thought of suicide always lingers. it eats at my brain taking up more and more space. i just need it to stop.
