I donâ€™t want to be here.I donâ€™t want to live anymore. I havenâ€™t since I was 13 and now Iâ€™m 23. Everyone made it seem like things would get better once I was sober or on anti depressants but nothing helped. Not alcohol, ssri, benzo, or marijuana. I just donâ€™t want to live. I have a great boyfriend and a mom who couldnâ€™t live without me.  I have a couple of friends. However I still want to purchase a pistol and end it. I feel guilty still cause I got a dui at 21 and even though I didnâ€™t crash or hurt someone I just feel like I canâ€™t redeem myself. I quit drinking, successfully completed probation. I have a chance to have it removed from my record next year but I donâ€™t want to because it deserves to be there. 
At 18 I watched my step dad die in the house and had to help my mom clean all the shit and blood up, and honestly since then things have just been awful.  I loved him so much and he was my dad. My real dad has colon cancer and wonâ€™t get help for it even though heâ€™s bleeding everyday but reminds me of everything month that Iâ€™ll probably end up with it to. He also drinks everyday and doesnâ€™t gives fuck to get better. This isnâ€™t really for anyone to read. I just needed a place to rant and somewhere safe to say I just want to end it. I donâ€™t want to live and I just want to be gone. For good.
