Happiness is running awayI genuinely donâ€™t like feeling happy, and thatâ€™s scary. Iâ€™ve been pushing away this thought for years now but now I realize that maybe my brain is damaged. Maybe itâ€™s not normal. I want someone to love me. But everyday that passes makes me feel like itâ€™s never going to happen. Which hurts so bad because thatâ€™s all I want.
