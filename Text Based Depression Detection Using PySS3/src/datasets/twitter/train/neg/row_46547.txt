What's the pointLong rant. 

I feel like I'm at the ultimate breaking point. I've tried so hard in my life and it's gotten me no where. No one loves me, likes me, or even wants to have me around. I swear I'm like a lepper. I've done everything I possibly can "right" in life. Went to college. Straight A student. Fully supporting myself when most people my age are still fucking around. I was an ugly mother fucker in high school so I drug myself out of that. Have now (not according to me) reached hot girl status. I take care of myself. I have hobbies. I think I'm funny. But it's never, ever good enough for anyone. 

Acquaintances don't care to learn more about me. I just got home from a party and no one even makes an effort with me. 

Romantic partners move on and find better people. The last guy I dated started dating other people a week after we became exclusive. We talked about a future together. We said we loved each other. 

Not even good enough for FWB/hookups. Earlier this weekend, walked in on FWB getting it on with another girl. After he'd already invited me over. 

I've dated about 10 people in the last year and it happens with all of them. We'll be doing good and then someone else comes along and swoops them away. I'm discarded and never contacted again.  

"Friends" purposely exclude me from fun stuff, even when I express interest in going. I'm involved in the planning process and then they take off and go without me. I find out later on social media. 

I feel absolutely worthless. I don't feel like there's much more I can do. And if all of this happens SO often, it's gotta be me. I AM worthless. I AM a miserable person. I deserve this. And I just want to end it all and be done.
