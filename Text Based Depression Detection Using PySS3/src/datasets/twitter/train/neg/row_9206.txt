Nothing MattersI have reached a point where I feel stuck. I am a janitor at a university at 22. Iâ€™m constantly surrounded by people who made better choices than I did. I canâ€™t continue college without going a dumbass amount in debt, and the only thing keeping me alive is my beautiful fiancÃ© who Iâ€™ve been with since 18.
