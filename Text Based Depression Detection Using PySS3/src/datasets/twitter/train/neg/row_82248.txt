Iâ€™m just scaredI donâ€™t even know what else to say. My PTSD flashbacks have been cycling and my depression is worse than ever and now Iâ€™m Iâ€™m debating on resigning from a job and have been at for over a year now because a new coworkers comments and actions. I feel like a failure with my myself, kids, husband, friends, and family. I just can not control my emotions. I reverted back to restricting what Iâ€™m eating, getting urges to make myself like again and in the last few days the only thing cycling my mind is how much better everything would be without me in it. It feels like taking my own life is the answer. 

4 years ago was the last time I got to this point. It was a year after my daughter had passed away. and I unsuccessfully tried to take my own life. Iâ€™m still alive and regretting it now... 

My reasoning is stilly good and I keep reminding myself of all the good in it, but I tried reaching out to the people closest to me but it didnâ€™t go well... Iâ€™m sure people think Iâ€™m doing it for attention. Iâ€™m debating on going to the ER, but again, I feel like Iâ€™ll only be looked at for attention. My boss asked me if i wanted to go home early from work because he could see I wasnâ€™t myself but I expressed that i wanted to stay, (main reason is that Iâ€™m afraid to be home some right now) 

I just hate this fucking feeling and feeling like this is my only way to make the fucking nightmare stop. 

Im sorry for ranting. Iâ€™m sorry for burdening anyone with these stupid thoughts.
