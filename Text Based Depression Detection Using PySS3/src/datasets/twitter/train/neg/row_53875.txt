Attempted Friday, really unsure where to go now, even after getting helpFour weeks ago I received help for a suicide plan I had in place. Four weeks ago, the help I received ended up not working for me. It's mostly my fault, I suspect. But it's been five years of an eating disorder and now I've recently been diagnosed with depression. I'm having the fucking time of my life.

And now I'm here. And I've got more help. And I don't know what to do. I'm so close to just going and doing it. I've rung helplines, I've gone to online chats, I've...talked to my friends but I've felt like I've wasted too much of their time. Even when one of them says my suicide would end them. That they'd feel guilty. I could never do it to them, at least in that time of them telling me so.

Then I just think that really, they must not be telling the truth. To be kind. To stop somebody killing themselves, which is compassionate and I respect it. I'm not good enough.

I'm seeing my psychologist in a few days, I saw my doctor today, and...I'm just sort of crying on my bed and pretending everything is staying in stasis, which it isn't. Normally poetry or art would help, history, art, so on and so forth. Christ. 
I was prescribed anti-depressants today. But I have to wait for those to work. Right now, I'm just really, really, really low. I feel bad even talking to my friends now, which are the only people I have that I love other than my sibling. We're distant, though. So it's just my dear friends and even then, I doubt how much I mean to them.

This is so long and it's ridiculous. I'm sorry.

edit: and yeah you can see in my post history I tried Monday, too. It's a long story and I don't want to go into detail, also for the subreddit's rules.
