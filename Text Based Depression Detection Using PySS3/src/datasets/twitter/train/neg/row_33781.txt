Not depressed, just suicidalIt's 5 am for me rn, so please excuse any spelling mistakes. I honestly don't consider myself depressed, I feel as being depressed is feeling that there is nothing in life to enjoy, I still know there are things in life living that you can enjoy, just don't think it's living for, rn I'm loving for my best friend, not because I think he's living for, rather cause he told me that if I suicided he would never forgive himself, I want to just end it, but I can't see him go thru the suffering, I tried to explain to him that life goes on, but I don't think they seem to understand, my suicide is most likely inevitable, sometimes I just lose control of my body and just watch, like when I cut, as for cutting I can still try to control it, I went for 6 days but quit due to withdrawals, I have already attempted 3 times, and he keeps bringing up that at 13 I'm too young to die, when I can barely control myself, any tips on calming him down to be a bit more accepting of my impending death?
