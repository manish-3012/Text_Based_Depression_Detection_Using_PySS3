Just need to have a pity party real quickI can only move slowly, as if I'm wading through water. Even getting up to use the bathroom is tiresome because it takes so long to get back to bed. Simple tasks I used to do everyday have become fights against the current.

As far as my appetite goes I'm only hungry when I'm high; if it weren't for the munchies I would starve. Pot is also the only reason that I can sleep or socialize nowadays. My memory gets worse by the day, which is most likely also thanks to the miracle of marajuana, but it's worth it to feel something other than empty all the time.

Maybe the worst part of all is that everyone around me can tell that I'm slipping. I'm just not fun to be around anymore. Close friends keep trying to engage with me but I have nothing left to give them. My family is ashamed of me. I am a barren wastland of emotional intelligence and exhausting to spend time with.

The voices in my head have stolen eleven years of my life, and soon they will lead me to my end. Even if I could be cured of this "mindset," not much would be left waiting for me in the aftermath. This life was never anything special to begin with. I'm at peace knowing that I'm almost free.
