How to deal with manipulative/overly obsessed parents?I am M[18] yet they have almost all the control over my life. It is affecting me so much. They physically and mentally abuse me, I cannot even close the fucking door to my room. They neither ever gave me any pocket money. The only thing that keeps me going is my girlfriend. I really don't want to end my life as she'd do the same. But it feels like the only choices I have are either to kill myself or run away.  
  
I have tried to tell them how everything they do is affecting me but they laugh it off or make a joke out of it. My mother leaves no chance to make me realize how ugly I look, how shitty my personality is and how I don't have any friends. I have never had a proper conversation with my dad. When I try to have a conversation with him it often ends in a one way talk of how I will fail at life and I would account for nothing.
