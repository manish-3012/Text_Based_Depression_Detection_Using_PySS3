Fuck being alone.I'm the youngest of 6. I'm left out of everything. It's been like that since.. well forever. Maybe it's because I had a different dad? Maybe it's because I'm a girl? Maybe they just don't like me? Idk. Maybe I'll never know. 

But, I'm hurting so bad right now. No one even bothers to check up on me, even though I just got diagnosed with a pretty serious autoimmune disease. 

I have severe slinical depression, and no one even bothers to say hi every once in awhile. 

Fuck pity invites, fuck my shitty body, and fuck everyone who will only stand up and say anything once I'm already dead. 

I feel like I don't even exsist. I feel like I'm already dead, or was never even alive in the first place. My mom has completely abandoned me for the final time last year... and.. I just.... i don't know what I'm doing so wrong. I don't want to be here anymore. I wish i could just dissipate into nothingness.
