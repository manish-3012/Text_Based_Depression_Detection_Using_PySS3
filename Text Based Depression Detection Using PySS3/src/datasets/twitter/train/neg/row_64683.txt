im impossible to loveim so difficult to have a relationship with. i know my boyfriend has other things to do in his life that donâ€™t include me, yet i always take up most of his time. i get jealous over the slightest things. i know how hard it is for him to be with me and i feel like i donâ€™t deserve his love, if he still loves me at all. i donâ€™t have a purpose in this world without him, but i know heâ€™d be better off without me. i might as well just off myself so he doesnâ€™t have to deal with my annoying ass anymore. heâ€™d be happier when im gone.
