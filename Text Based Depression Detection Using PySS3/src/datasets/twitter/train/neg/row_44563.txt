I donâ€™t understand why I feel like thisMy life is probably in the best state itâ€™s been in for a while now but strangely enough I feel like shit. I feel just as bad as I did two years ago when my life and situation was at itâ€™s lowest point, if not worse. Iâ€™ve begun self harming again after managing to stay clean for months, my emotions are constantly between either extremely happy and content or extremely depressed and suicidal. Itâ€™s to the point where I donâ€™t think I can handle the whiplash of going between the two states anymore, Iâ€™ve reached a level of suicidality where I donâ€™t particularly care about how itâ€™ll impact those who care about me anymore because I know theyâ€™ll get over it and move on. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore and at this point I just want to end it to end the internal turmoil and put my mind to rest. 

TLDR: My emotions are out of wack and I just want to end it
