This is my storyHello reddit! Let me say now I'm on a iPod and I might make mistakes but here we go. It all started last year when I met my friend kaila she introduced me to "emo" so ever since then my life has been all about piercings and dark clothing. Then I started to realize I was starting to fall for her. And I was falling hard. But then she got a girlfriend. I got so depressed with everything my parents calling me a freak constantly and calling me bad names because I told them I was lesbian so I started cutting and it just felt so right and I loved it I continued to cut until there was no more room on my hips I cut on my waist line so no one could see the scars so then i started on my wrists and it just escalated from there... So now I'm terribly suicidal and I don't want to live anymore I just. Cant do there's my story thanks for listening reddit I appreciated it.
