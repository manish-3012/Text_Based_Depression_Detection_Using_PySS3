Life has frozenI used to be suicidal from a very rough upbringing. I stopped feeling that way when I started getting into dating late in high school, along with some of my problems at home being resolved. 

These problems I grew up with were out of my control (a result of other people that raised me), so I can understand why I was so downtrodden about them. I felt like my life was out of my own hands, and to end that pain that suicide was the only option. 

Itâ€™s was over four years since I had a suicidal thought. Life was going great for a while. I got through the beginning of college without a hitch, and exceeded above my own expectations both socially and academically. I met some of the greatest friends Iâ€™ve ever had, and I currently am living in a house with them off campus at my university (I am currently in the end of my third year). 

But things in my life changed during sophomore year. I got dumped by the girl of my dreams in in between semesters, and I hit rock bottom. I gained weight. I stopped giving a shit about anything. Our relationship was going downhill prior, and my grades were suffering. I felt hopeless, but I figured I had already been through hell. Things couldnâ€™t get much worse. 

Situationally, they didnâ€™t get worse. I finished sophomore year strong, and felt like I could really be out of my rut. But I was wrong. 

This year I was met with the most challenging deadline-oriented semester of college I had ever faced. I went all out and made Deanâ€™s List for the first time since freshman year. As an aerospace engineer, I thought that I should feel much better about all of the effort that I put in than I did. But I felt empty. I was a work zombie, and felt completely burned out in the end. 

I also started to realize that I became increasingly less social than ever. I started to shut myself in. I lost basically all of my self confidence. Whereas I used to be able to strike up a conversation with anyone about anything, I can barely keep a conversation going for more than a few stupid remarks. I donâ€™t feel like myself anymore. 

Second semester started fine. Classes got very interesting, and I felt like I was finally turning around. Unfortunately, my cousin was killed in a car accident and I was gone from school for a week, missing two crucial exams to attend his funeral. He was a 28 year old Marine veteran, and very close to my immediate family. Iâ€™ve never cried harder in my life than at his funeral.

I returned to school to find that I was screwed. I had missed so much material, but instead of catching up I just stopped. I gave up. I currently feel like life has been frozen, and that I canâ€™t go on any longer. 
 
It feels like time hasnâ€™t passed since then. I feel like itâ€™s been barely a couple of weeks. It has been over two months. I feel like life is justâ€¦ happening to me. Iâ€™m ignoring responsibilities that are extremely crucial to my success in my future. My life is falling apart. Iâ€™ve been thinking about how to kill myself in the least painful way possible on a regular basis. I want to reach out but I donâ€™t know where to go. 

If you read this, Iâ€™m begging you to give me some advice. I donâ€™t know why I canâ€™t get off my ass and get some help. 

What is wrong with me?
