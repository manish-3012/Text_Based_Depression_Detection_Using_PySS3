I'm falling apartI fell in love with you and the whole time you were just using me. We talked every single day and We kissed hello n Goodbye every single time. We grew up together, known each other since the 3rd grade, thought maybe I might mean a little sometime to you. I have been thinking back on everything lately and honestly you were a fucking dick!

When I sent you that Snap chat of me smoking a blunt and said "wake n bake" thinking you would maybe think it was funny but instead you replied " don't send me that fucking shit" "what are you 14 years old?" Honestly you made me feel stupid a lot and yeah I love you but fuck you! 

you chose Katey and think that I have been trying to trick you on somethings and its like you didn't know me at all! You have no idea how much I would honestly do for you and it kills me you think the things you do but also I am so mad at you, idk what to do!!  You know how fucking stupid I actually am, I thought you loved me too but you didn't not even a little, I haven't seen you in like 2 months but I still cry over you in fact I am crying right now. I miss you so much and yes, I know this post is all of the place but I am sooo sad, I cant think straight and I don't want to live in a world where Justin isn't in my life. I hate hearing how there are more fish in the sea type shit because those other fish are not Justin.
