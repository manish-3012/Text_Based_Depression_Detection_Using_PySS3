Probably not going to kill myself, but who knows.Setting:

After college and one and a half years of grad school. School loses accreditation. If I finish my degree will be worthless. Have RIGHT NOW over $125,000 in student loan debt. Grades in college were bad. Probably won't get into a better grad school.

Unemployed living in a one bedroom apt in a bad neighborhood. Married to a fantastic lady, says she'll stand by me despite our combined debt (hers is much smaller than mine). She knows how much I owe, but still afraid she'll leave when she finds out how hard it is to be poor.

If I die, she is not legally obligated to carry my debt since I signed on to it before we got married.

Friends from high school and college all have careers (not just jobs) or are at prestigious schools to get what they want out of life. Feel like a failure in comparison.

See no way to pay back over $100k in ten years. Will default. Won't be able to save money to help children go to school, if I eve have kids. Will have to work so much won't be able to be a part of kid's lives. Will be just like own father. Overworked, practically a stranger to family.

Wife deserves better. Want it to be over.
