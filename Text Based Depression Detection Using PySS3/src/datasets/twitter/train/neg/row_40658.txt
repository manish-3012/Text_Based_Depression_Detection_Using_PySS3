I don't know how much longer I can hold on...I'm really struggling. I've dealt with depression, self harm, eating disorder, and suicidal thoughts for a long time, but these past couple of months I've really been wanting to just end everything. I'm overwhelmed and I'm hurting so bad right now. Its taking all I have to not just take the full bottle of all my medications. :(
