What's the point?I've been questioning on going on and living this life I was given. To make it my own and to make something of it, so it's not entirely worthless. I have always had trouble with rejection, disappointment, and abandonment. I am a computer science student, at a decent college. No friends, I put on a show for everyone to make sure that they think that I'm okay. But I'm really not. Screwed up the best relationship of my life by telling a stupid lie at the beginning of it... I always ask myself why I did that... especially if I loved her so much. And after almost two years with her... everything falls apart. Everyone tells me theres more fish in the sea, but I cannot bring myself to stop loving her. I just want her to be happy, even if it means me being unhappy.

I fell in love with her at first sight, and we grew through some hardtimes... but many good times I feel. It's been a month since we stopped talking, and everyday I miss her more. It's as if I have had another half ripped away from me. It seems that every night, I go back and think of her and all the memories I cherish with her. And it just destroys me more, even as I write this. I just pray that she is happy, and she isn't feeling as bad as I am. 

In essence, I feel as though I am a failure... in school and all of my relationships. I have no friends, and I never can maintain a relationship with anyone. I just wonder if this world is meant for me. This just drives me crazy with each day. I feel as if my mind is going to explode.
