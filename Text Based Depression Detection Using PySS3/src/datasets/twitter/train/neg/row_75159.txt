I know nobody outside of my own familyLoneliness has encapsulated me inside of an extremely sad cocoon.

I have no friends. Not to mention relationships, Its hard to think anyone could love me for anything, there's nothing about me that is attractive. 

I try to make friendships online but the friendships are always either shallow or the person loses interest and ghosts me after a week.

I don't really put any value on familial love because the reason family loves you is only because of the luck of being born in the group. It has nothing to do with you personally, you could be a complete asshole and your mother still loves you. Like those serial killers who still have their mother in their corner.

The fact that no one loves me outside of my family 8s very telling. You'd think I'd have at least one person , one best friend however no, everyone I knew pre pandemic have ghosted me.
