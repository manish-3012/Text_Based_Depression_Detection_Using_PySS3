Little strings    When I was younger my Mother would tell me to hold myself together by little strings. I never really understood what she meant back then. I understand now that those strings are the little things in life. A friend to tell you it's all ok, a bright sunny day, the sound of the birds in the trees. I'm trying to hold on to these things. I don't want to lose my hope of a better future. 
    Unfortunately my strings seem to be snapping. 
Day after day it's something new that pushes me down. I'm struggling to stand on my own. I'm struggling to hold on to myself. I don't recognize who I am anymore. Sadness comes and goes but at the end of the day, I'm just left empty. So I stare at the ceiling, hoping I can find something inside myself worth saving. I can't help but think sometimes, I'm not worth saving.
