I just got an eviction notice - never wanted to kill myself more.Title.  


I totally deserve it. I am a mess. I can't clean after myself and the place looks like a fucking mess after the time I've lived there. I wish it didn't come to this. I guess this was just the last drop that tipped me over the ledge.   


I can't focus, I can't eat. My head is spinning. I can't do anything right now. Why is it so hard to just let fucking go?   


In addition to the eviction notice I've also gathered upwards of $10k in credit card debt, for random stuff that I don't need.  
I am a complete failure.   


I need to clean the house in 5 days to avoid legal charges. Right now, death seems like the obvious choice here...  


Im sorry
