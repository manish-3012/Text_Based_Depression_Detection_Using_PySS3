I want to kill myselfI have always been depressed , I'm 21 and a girl . The main thing sparking it this time is the fact I think I have inherited female pattern baldness from my mum , and the thought of living with no hair is making me want to kill myself . Anyone else feel like killing themselves because of their appearance or hair loss ?
