Dr WallI have this attitude of not telling doctors fucking anything. I come across as angry apparently. I have these really strict limits and walls. Itâ€™s so fuckin stupid. I need the help. 

My psychiatrist is transferring me to a new person because â€œmaybe you will click better - ...you always seem angryâ€. 

That is distressing because it took me years to trust him at all. 

I dont know what he wants out of me. All Ive done is say everything is ok to get my meds. I feel like I cant do anything right, isnt that what they are supposed to want? 

I mean ok I cant hide that I get super anxious so I cry or whatever, I cant help that. But so what? What do they even want from me? Im making their jobs easier anyway
