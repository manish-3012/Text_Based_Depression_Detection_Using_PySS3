A confession while I self harm:I tell everybody I meet I'm not scared of being alone, which is why I have nobody in my life.

I'm fucking terrified of being alone.

I just don't fear death. Having someone there keeps me around.

But today's my lucky day. I lost the very last person in my life. 

Once i finishing cutting up my entire body, I'm going to overdose. 

Just wanted to share with someone, anyone. And give a final goodbye, even though it's literally worthless. 

Take care, world. It was (not) fun while it lasted.
