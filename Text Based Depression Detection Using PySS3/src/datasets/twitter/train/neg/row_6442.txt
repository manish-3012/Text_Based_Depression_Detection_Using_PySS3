Escalating. Not sure what to do next.I am worried. I have had bad thoughts for many many years. When I have imagined actually going through with ending my breath, it has always been with a gun. My spouse has guns, in a locked safe. I do not know the combo or know where the special key is. Not because of my thoughts, just because. But that layer of â€œprotectionâ€ has always given me a sense of safety. That I wouldnâ€™t actually do it. 

Ever since last week. I keep thinking about bathrobe belts. My parents bought me a bathrobe for Christmas. It is still wrapped up nicely. I donâ€™t typically use a robe. But now, I canâ€™t get these thoughts of the belt out of my head. 

I am worried because this is actually â€œdoableâ€. I do not know how to make the knot. Or where I would hook it up to. But I am kinda scared that I am planning this out and thinking about the little steps I need to learn. 

I am a mom. I get torn between: they deserve a mother- even if she is a basket case loser / they would be far better off without me. 

I feel so isolated and forgettable. I donâ€™t have insurance, so getting professional â€œhelpâ€ is out of the question.
