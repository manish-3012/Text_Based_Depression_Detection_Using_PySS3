i feel guiltyim not naive, I know people love me and will be very hurt if I die, I have a loving boyfriend and an entire theatre community supporting me but I just want to die. I feel guilty everytime I tell my boyfriend (who also struggles w depression and stuff) that I love him because I feel like Im keeping this massive secret from him and I jist think about how much it would affect him if I die. but I'm struggling so much. Ive had an ED for a few years on and off but nobody seems to notice it, or at least nobody cares enough to try to ask. I'm applying to college but my grades are so awful lately because I can't work up enough energy to do anything so I feel like I'm not even going to get in anywhere and I know if I don't I will kill myself. I don't want to die because I don't want to hurt anyone but I desperately want to because I just cannot handle this anymore and I feel so hopeless.
