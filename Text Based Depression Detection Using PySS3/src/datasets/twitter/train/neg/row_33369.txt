Are pain pills effective if you take enough?I read that 4,000mg is enough to overdose on acetaminophen, but it seems more like, that's the amount to get you taken to the hospital to get your stomach pumped. 

I have a full bottle here, which would be exponentially more than that if taken all at once.

Although it's only acetaminophen, would such an enormous dose be enough to kill you? I don't want to just be very very ill and wreck my liver, I want to die.

I know what would really be the best would be an overdose on sleeping pills, but they're more difficult and suspicious to get. 

I'm not an immediate danger case, it would just be extremely comforting to know that the pills I have around would be effective.
