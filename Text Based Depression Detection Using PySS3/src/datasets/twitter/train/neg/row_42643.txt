how do i reach out to irls when iâ€™m suicidali only have a few from work but everything has been so horrible lately i feel like i cant do it anymore
i just need some human contact like a hug or literally anything from another human being in person even like listening to them make jokes or something but i dont know how to ask without seeming like a fucking freak 
i could post a â€œsosâ€ on snapchat and just ask for someone to come over but i dont want to seem attention seeking i just feel so fucking bad
