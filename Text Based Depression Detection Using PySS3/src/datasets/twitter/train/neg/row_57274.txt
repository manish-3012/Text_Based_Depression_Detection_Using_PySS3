I've been thinking about it alot latelyThis summer I started a new job in a smaller city where everyone knows everyone and maybe it's because I'm not used to this kind of environment but lately every second thought I have is "I'm going to kill myself"

I've had a history of depression before but I was able to get over by living in a city where no one knows me but in the smaller community I'm trying by best not to fuck up and it's stressful

There's alot more problems that have started happening like flashbacks of bad memories have been happening more often than usual, I told my boss I'm taking a sick day tommorow but i don't know what I should do to stop these thoughts
