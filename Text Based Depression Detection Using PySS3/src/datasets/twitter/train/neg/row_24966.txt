I want to die but I dont want to be selfishI kind of feel like Im whining in that i havent killed myself yet and have been wanting to do it for an extremely long time but I dont want to hurt the three people that care about me. I just feel like it'd be better if I was gone for everyone but those three people. I feel like such a burden all the time and I just dont have anyone to seriously talk to about this. I mean some of my friends know but I havent really talked to them about it because I dont want to be a burden and I want to get a therapist but theyre expensive. These thoughts, theyre constant and it causes me literal pain to keep me from killing myself. I find myself sitting on my bed rocking and repeating "dont be selfish " over and over again but thats starting to not be enough. I sometimes write poetry to help but I just dont know if I can do this anymore and I need someone to talk to about it
