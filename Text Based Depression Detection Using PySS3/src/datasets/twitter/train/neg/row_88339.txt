I didn't expect myself to be living so longWhen I was 12-13 I was thinking I won't stay alive for my 20th birth, and I've reached it... Actually I have no idea about my future, in less than 5 month I'm going to finish the study and start "new life" but... The only thing I want is death. Not brave enough to do it by myself so I'm waiting for fate to end it all... Few years ago I had some interests though, I've been playing computer games and didn't think about problems I have, but now they're all gone, and the only things I do is read some stuff like Nietzsche and Schopenhauer and listening depressed music and looking at the walls in my room...

P.S. sorry about my English
