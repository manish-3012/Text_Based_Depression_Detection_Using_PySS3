Life is shit, it's a dog eats dog world, nobody ever cared and nobody would ever careI don't have tools to disappear, I'm sad and lonely, nobody understand this feeling. (except you) 
Look at the bright side of the things, there is more out there and those bullsh*t just not for me. I feel i can't talk to anyone, I have few friends but everybody happy right now so why should I bother them? What could they say to this?
I mentioned the suicidal things to one and the answer was a sad smiley and some horse poop about some life purposes. 
Its not their problem. I have to solve it but frankly, I dont have the motivation.
I feel stupid and wortheless im hipersensitive and I wanna cry almost all the time. The situation at work shit, my relationship with my mother not exists and I dont have a partner but I dont want. Why should I want one? Im not looking for anything or anyone. I dont wanna ruin one other life with my nonsense. 
I dont fear the afterlife, I fear the pain and the not succesfull attempt because it cause more trouble what I dont want at this point.

Im glad because I minimised my stuff so when Im gone they dont have to pack the cr*p what I hoarded during the years. I thought it would be easier with less and in a sense its good. Every time when I throw out or give someone else something I feel less connected to the current place. I just wish to disappear as those items but its not happening.

Just my friends are disappearing.
