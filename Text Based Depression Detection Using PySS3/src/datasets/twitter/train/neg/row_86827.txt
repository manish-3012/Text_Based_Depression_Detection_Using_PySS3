Need advice quicklySo, seventeen days ago was a bad day for me. Iâ€™ve been with someone for 5 years and she suddenly decided to move on. The problem is, is sheâ€™s a bit cruel. She texted me things that sheâ€™s doing with another guy and I couldnâ€™t take it, so I cut an inch deep on my leg. Got stitches and staples then went home to a crying mother. Now? Sheâ€™s sending me pictures and I dare not look. I know what they are. This individual is not a good person. Sheâ€™s killing me. Now her bf is blowing up my phone. Again, I dare not answer. I have to face it soon and Iâ€™m terrified. Iâ€™m in love with this one and when I face it, Iâ€™m scared the pain will be too bad and Iâ€™ll slit my throat because through death, the pain ends. Itâ€™s the only way itâ€™ll stop hurting. I canâ€™t block her number because Iâ€™m hoping sheâ€™ll come back to me one day, so please tell me what I should do. I need help.
