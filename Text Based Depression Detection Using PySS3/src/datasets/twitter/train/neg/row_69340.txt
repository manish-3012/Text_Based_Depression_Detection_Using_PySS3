I am the most waste-of-space person you could think ofI was originally diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome (by a real physiologist in 1994, I am not one of those self-diagnosed annoying people). Maybe thatâ€™s my problem, the neuron connections in my brain are just to malformed to work. Not that my colossal failure of a life is not 100% my fault.

I've had severe problems with anxiety and depression for a very long time. Some problems with self-mutilation, I have a pretty good amount of cut scars on my arms and legs. I had 2 childhood friends, but then no friends at all through all of middle school, high school, and college. Never so far as even kissed a girl. Got a dumb degree from a shitty diploma mill university. Never held down an actual job. I'm obese as well as alcoholic.

Think about suicide constantly, but I'm apparently so much of a failure I can even follow through with that. Wondering when I should end this waste of resources.
