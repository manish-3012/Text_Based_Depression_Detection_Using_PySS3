Tomorrow is my last day.I think itâ€™s done for me. Iâ€™ve left everyone behind . 
  Iâ€™m done..? 
My boyfriend cheated on me and I forgave him.. then he hurt me really badly again and I broke up with him. 
My mom used to abuse me as a kid and I donâ€™t think I ever healed.
My friends are nonexistent, the ones Iâ€™ve held close have let me down.
My dad is dead.
My grandma is the only one in my life who has shown me unconditional love and support despite everything and I hope to god she realizes I was better off this way. 

I am so scared . 

I cry myself to sleep nearly every night. Self harm is grown to the point of not helping me no matter how much , how often, how deep. 
Getting high does nothing anymore. It just feels like Iâ€™m falling down a hole .
How does someone get this sad? 
How does someone lose this much hope? 
Iâ€™m crying as I write this. Taking breaks to clean my foggy glasses and choke out sobs. 
God, why couldnâ€™t I have died already..?

I donâ€™t know what to do. I donâ€™t know what to do. 
I donâ€™t know if I want help . 
 
I just want to get this out somewhere. I donâ€™t think I can be stopped this time. Iâ€™ve been planning for days. Iâ€™m so sorry. 

Iâ€™m so sorry.
