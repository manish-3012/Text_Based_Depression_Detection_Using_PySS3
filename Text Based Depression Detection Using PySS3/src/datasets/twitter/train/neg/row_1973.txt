I don't want to be like this anymore.Being transgender has ruined my life. I was unhappy before I transitioned, but I had gotten so good at acting I believed it myself most days. Now my girlfriend is breaking up with me, I can find work, and I'm feeling suicidal for the first time in years. Why did I have to be born like this? Why can't I just be normal?
