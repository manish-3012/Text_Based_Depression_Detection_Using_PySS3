I'm to scared to kill myself or get help so I guess I'll just suffer.I'm 23 and I feel like my life is going no where. I'm 4 years into a major I hate. I could switch but there aren't any majors I care about. No jobs seem fun or interesting to me. I have no talents and no passions. I don't have a license, I still live at home, I have never had a physical or emotional romantic relationship but then again I don't really want one. I have friends, not a lot, but we are pretty close. Recently I find myself getting mad at them for no reason and just going radio silent, coming up with excuses for why I can't hang. I've been drinking a lot more than normal. I've talked to my mother about how I feel, she's the only person I've opened up to. She tries to be supportive the best she can but she's strongly against medication or therapy. I mean she's not stopping me, there's nothing she can do to stop me from getting professional help but I don't even think it's worth it. What if it doesn't work? What if it does work but my life is still pathetic? Then I don't have anything to blame my shitty life on. I feel like I'm just destined to suffer. I don't think life has any meaning so you get to pick your own, but I don't want to. I just want to stop existing. My dad killed himself in April and I inherited the gun he used to kill himself with. For months I had dreams about loading up the gun and blowing my brains out. Then it leaked into my day dreams and eventually my thoughts. I was scared I was destined to do it so I gave the gun away. So there it is, I'm too scared to actually kill myself but too pathetic and lazy to seek help. So I guess I'll just suffer. My mom's my only family left, maybe when she dies I'll kill myself since there will be no one left to care but until then I'll suffer through life.
