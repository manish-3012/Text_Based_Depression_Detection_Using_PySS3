Just.Iâ€™m just so tired. Iâ€™m tired of living with PTSD and being medicated up to my eyeballs and somehow still ducking up constantly. Iâ€™m tired of my father, who is estranged due to him hiding my abuse from my mother (divorced), acting as though he has authority over me. Iâ€™m tired of being the â€œsickâ€ one, of going to therapy, of people questioning the validity of my ptsd, of all of it. Iâ€™m tired of therapy and psychiatrist appointments, Iâ€™m just so fucking tired of living with this fucking disease. I just want to throw up, take a shower, and sleep for the rest of my life. Iâ€™m just so ducking sick of this.
