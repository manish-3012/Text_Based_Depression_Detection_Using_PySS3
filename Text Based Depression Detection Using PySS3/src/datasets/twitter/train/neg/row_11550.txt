Why shouldn't I kill myself?Ok, I'm about to graduate high school. I have no future plans. No plans for college, no skills in the workplace, and no motivation. I struggle with anxiety and bipolar, so I'll probably get fired anyway. I hate the world. People amaze me. Society's "rules" are stupid. Everyone in this world is either shallow, a hypocrite, a douchebag, or an idiot. There is too much ignorance in this world for me to handle. No women have EVER shown ANY intrest in me. I'm ugly, fat, and anti-social.  I have very low self-esteem, but everyone seems to put me down about my appearance as well. Also, If I'm going to die someday, why can't I just get it over with. I'm atheist, I have no God to pray for help. I've tried religion, I don't work for me. There is nothing going for me in this world. I've considered suicide ever since I was 11. I've finally came to the end of my rope. Someone convince me in the next hour why I shouldn't. I got the gun right here. Go.
