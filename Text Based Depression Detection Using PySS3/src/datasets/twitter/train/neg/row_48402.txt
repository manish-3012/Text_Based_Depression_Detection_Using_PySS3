Thinking sooner rather than laterThere's no reason for me to be here. I don't like being alove no one wants me here. I have some pills saved up and I looked up how to tie a noose. I know I'm still afraid but I think Im getting to w point where it doesn't matter. Everyone will be happier without me, I already know that. I can't be here anymore
