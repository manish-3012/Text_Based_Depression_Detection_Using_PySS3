IdkLast night I got somewhat drunk and decided that I wanted to die. I'm a 16M in high school. I know overdosing is really painful, so I took 4 motrin instead of everything I could find, and slept on my back. This was in hopes that I would vomit and asphyxiate in my sleep. Obviously it didn't work. I left my life up to luck and I (unfortunately) lived. I have been seeing a therapist for a little while now and one of the first things we set up was a suicide safety plan. I signed the plan saying I would not kill myself and would make it to the next session. I don't usually post on social media because it makes me really anxious, but I have to ask. Was this a violation of the "contract" even though I didn't actively try to kill myself? Do I have to/should I tell my therapist about this?
