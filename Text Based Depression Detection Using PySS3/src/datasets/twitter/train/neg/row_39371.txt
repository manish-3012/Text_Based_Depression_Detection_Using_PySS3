I cheated on himAgain. Itâ€™s how our relationship ended the first time, I broke it off then to soften the blow. I remember the two of us crying on a park bench, I was the one who broke things off but he had time to process it before we saw each other again. After months screwing around I realized he was the only fucking person I cared about other than myself, and still I went and screwed the same emotionally toxic 40-year-old coke head I cheated with last time. 

Seriously, my boyfriend is the only person I can think about and just have to smile without him even having to be around. Heâ€™s the only guy I really feel comfortable being intimate with sober. But here I am, again.

Iâ€™m a disaster. Iâ€™m a 22-year-old autistic college dropout alcoholic, as you already heard Iâ€™m a habitual cheater, and Iâ€™ve been in and out of programs for the last two years. I was given every chance to be successful, but here I still am in all my degeneracy.

I honestly canâ€™t help but think about ways to do it, not quiet ways, but dramatic and grotesque methods. The only thing thatâ€™s stopping me is the worry that heâ€™ll find out and hate me when I die, and that heâ€™ll be scarred by the scene. I canâ€™t stand being hated by the one person who I feel human with. I also canâ€™t stand lying to anyone, especially when itâ€™s someone I love. I donâ€™t want to be alive either way.
