The best help I could get is a nooseI have been dealing with my suicidal thoughts for years now, and I'm so tired of making efforts to fix myself or maintain my shitty life that I really need to give in.

I've been waiting for any glimmer of hope to help me shrug off the depression to no avail. I've been working with a professional therapist and have been attempting to get some sort of medication to help me for almost half a year. I've been trying with other therapists for even longer. It is fucking impossible to be prescribed anything within a reasonable time frame and everything that has been tried has been a horrible failure. The only relief that has even done much was when I would smoke weed, and even then all it does is dull the pain for a very brief while. In truth it isn't helping at all.

There is nothing left in my life worth maintaining it for. My family has continued to treat me more like their tool than their kin, and I have absolutely no positive physical relationships. The only people I ever get to talk to that even appreciate my presence are online, and they have no way of helping me. Venting like this has been a near constant in my life and speaking about my issue never helps, despite the copious amount of research I've done that says otherwise. Everyone I talk to is no help. They either don't know how to respond and soon abandon me or quite frankly don't care and would rather hassle me about all of the things they need from me. I've grown to hate everyone else in my life almost as much as myself.

Everything I've ever loved has faded away and lost its luster. There was once a time where I loved many things, I loved mathematics and the sciences, I loved games and learning to analyze a system, I loved being able to support those around me. Now I can't even derive pleasure from my own sense of taste.

I have no purpose and hate myself. I can't even stand to see my reflection or hear my own voice, and I just want to hang like the sinful refuse I've proven to be. To top it all off, I have virtually no access to my methods, unlike I formerly thought. Even death is too good for the likes of me.
