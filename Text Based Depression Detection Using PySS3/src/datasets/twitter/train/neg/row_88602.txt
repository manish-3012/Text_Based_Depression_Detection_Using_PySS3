Thoughts of suicideFor years now, there's not a day that goes by where I don't think about committing suicide at least once. But tonight is one of those nights where everything's too much.

Where do I even begin with why I'm sat here thinking about ending it? Abusive parents, recently lost some of my close friends because they decided to stab me in the back, general loneliness, I'm bullied out of almost every job I start, discriminated against because of my appearance, shit from the past comes back to haunt me. More of my life gets spent seeing people smirk at me before they even know me nowadays, than interacting with people. Appaently I don't "belong" in this world.

Every now and then, I do find a "purpose" that seems to give me reason to carry on, but then the pressure gets overwhelming because I know it's the only good thing left.

There's not really anywhere you can discuss these things. Certainly not in your 20s. What can I say? Life is pretty ruthless and if there's one thing I've learnt, it's that my words are empty bait for people who pray on those who talk about it.
