I feel empty and everything is pointlessI have always been a sick kid, the entirety of my life. Have had epilepsy, migraine for 9 years, one ankle sprained 11 times, one shoulder dislocated 5 times and then operated on. Constant problems with vertigo,  epilepsy and about 4 years into severe depression and anxiety. 
Few days back had an accident that broke my left ankle and dislocated my other shoulder badly. 
I'm now tired of being so fucking sick all the time. 
Life has been a mess, entire life spent in studying (too strict Indian parents, really bad situation at home), hardly ever went out to play in childhood. 
Couldn't do anything towards my hobbies, I sing and paint really well, but they too don't interest me anymore. 
Everytime I go through being sick again I feel I would be better off dead. Just cease to exist. 
I'm tired now, and everything is bloody pointless.
