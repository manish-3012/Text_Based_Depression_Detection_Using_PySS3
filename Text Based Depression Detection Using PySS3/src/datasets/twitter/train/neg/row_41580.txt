I'm struggling to see a reason to go on.Basically, I can't find the will to go on with life. I have crippling anxiety issues, I can't rest, I can't eat, I can't focus on the things that once enriched my life. I've lost my job, my relationship is in a state of disarray and I've lost my faith. I can't fathom how to continue. I've had countless people say it'll get better and all the clichÃ©s under the sun, but I can't see it. Quite frankly, I can't face waking up every morning, only to again realize that there is nothing to wake up too. I've tried to reach out to "friends" but they give me the usual "you're an attention seeker" nonsense. All I've ever wanted is to understand and to be understood, but now, I have no hope left within me.
