I feel worthless and like I donâ€™t deserve this life life at allWhen quarantine first started, I was pretty okay staying inside with my family for a month. Things were fine. But during the second month, I started browsing the internet like your typical teenager, and I was curious about loli porn so I searched ....and, I did my thingy... and ever since then Ive been super depressed again. Youâ€™re probably wondering â€œyou masturbated, howâ€™d that make you sad?â€ Well I suffer from sever anxiety and a pressuring amount of OCD (which is a form of anxiety) and I panic left and right whenever I get too anxious. I feel so stupid and not capable of anything. So after that I searched more into it and ran by a bunch of people on reddit saying that lolis are bad and that people who watch lolis are pedos, it made me question my self deeply and for the past few weeks ive been considering ending it. I feel so ashamed, I donâ€™t deserve this life at all, another kid couldâ€™ve came along instead of me and been something great but nope, the universe decided to have me born instead. Its not right that im here, everytime I want to end it I think about my family but everytime i think about the peace and quiet rewarded after suicide it makes me drawn to it even more. Im so torn...
