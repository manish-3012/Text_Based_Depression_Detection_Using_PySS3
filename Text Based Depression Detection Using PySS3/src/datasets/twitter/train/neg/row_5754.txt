Sobrietys too hard yoThere's too much pain in the world for it to be worth it. Takes a full year to fully recover mentally from drug abuse and get your dopamine back and even then I'll still be depressed and anxious so what's the point. Statistically speaking, most people who wanna get sober never do so why even try, especially when doing so doesn't guarantee happiness (in fact, quite the opposite for a while). I wanna keep drinking and smoking till I kill myself because it's a safe bet.
