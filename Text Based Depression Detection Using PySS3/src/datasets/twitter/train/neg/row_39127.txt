At the end of my rope* I don't think I can handle life much longer. Each night I hold my bottle of sleeping meds and think that it's a nice, easy way to go, just go to sleep and not wake back up. I'm on the verge of bankruptcy, I don't have enough money to get my medications, the easiest thing to do would be to just stop everything else and just kill myself with the withdrawals. I live with my mom and stepfather, and my stepfather hates me. He refuses to speak to me and if I'm in the room he leaves.  I won't leave a note, maybe they will think it was an accident. I don't want my nieces to know I killed myself, they are at an impressional age. Maybe I'll rent a cheap hotel room and do the deed there. Then I wouldn't be a burden and a disappointment.
