I'm in love with death.My girlfriend, let's call her C. C and I are perfect together. Everything is great. We love each other, we want kids, we love each other very much. 

Only problem is, she has liver cancer. I've been crying for the past few days,since I've found out. She has a transplant lined up, the only problem is it costs $360,000. Nobody can afford that. Our children's children's children would be in debt. Currently they're trying to find blood for the surgery. Just our luck, her blood type is AB- one of the rarest bloodtypes. Of course, thanks to this blood type she can take other other types of blood. More common ones.

Stupid me though. I looked at the survival rate of a transplant.. Over five years there's a 22% chance of death. That's a big number. I can't live without her. If she goes, I'll be polishing my gun. 

Fuck cancer. 

Fuck everything. 

I need my baby. She's all I have. She's what's kept me breathing, eating, and loving. 

I can't take this anymore. I'll sell my kidneys, arms, legs, brain, eyes, ears, anything. As long as she lives. Hell, I'll even give her my liver. I need her. 

The doctor gave her 3 months to live and that's not a long time. I can't take it. I feel like I have water in my lungs and I just can't take it anymore.
