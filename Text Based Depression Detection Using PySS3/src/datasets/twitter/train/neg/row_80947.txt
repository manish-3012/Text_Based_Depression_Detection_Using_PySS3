I have no place on this EarthFuck life. Iâ€™m over being alive at this point. My girlfriend left me for somebody else while I was dealing with anniversary of my moms passing. I was in love with her. I loved her. Iâ€™m still in love with her. But she hates me and I know she wants me dead. I granting her wish today. Bri, if you ever see this, remember that I told you that Iâ€™d die for you. I know you want me to hate you but I donâ€™t. I canâ€™t. But I hope you come to my funeral and fucking spit on my grave and tell the few people that might not even show up that you did this to me. Tell them how much you hate me. Tell them you lied to me. Tell them you never loved me. You broke what was left of my heart. You promised you wouldnâ€™t leave no matter how hard things got. You said that if we met during our tough times then why would we leave in our tough times. I wanted to do everything sheâ€™s doing for you but I needed time. You said youâ€™d wait for me. You said you saw a future with me....now thereâ€™s no future for me. Iâ€™m sorry I couldnâ€™t be the person you wanted me to be. But I tried. I tried so damn hard to get better for you and for us. I wanted us to be happy. You won, Bri. Congratulations.
