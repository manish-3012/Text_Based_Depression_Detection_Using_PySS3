Life is great. Why canâ€™t I stay aliveI wanna die so bad. I hate myself, I hate being alone and iLl always be alone because iâ€™m trans so no one can ever love me. My job is hell and i have to work with an ex friend who hurt me really badly everyone gets to hurt me and never face any consequences. 

i can do it tonight because i just refilled my scripts for propanol. but i have a new job starting in a few days. i got nominated for a prestigious scholarship. iâ€™m getting top grades. i canâ€™t throw this all away but fuck i just want to be loved and. if i canâ€™t have that i need to die
