Minor checking myself into the hospital for being suicidal, need some information about the processI can't take it anymore. I'm an American, unfortunately. I think I'm going to drive myself to the hospital when I get home from school tomorrow. What is this going to cost my parents financially when I stroll into the hospital and tell the doctors that I'm suicidal? Do I go to the ER and just say that? Will they even take me? I guess the most I would have on me is my ID. I guess I just need to know, if I want to check myself into the hospital as a minor what do I even do? Just go to the ER? Will most insurance plans cover this, and will it put my parents in debt? Will they take me if I'm alone and only have pictures of my insurance information?
