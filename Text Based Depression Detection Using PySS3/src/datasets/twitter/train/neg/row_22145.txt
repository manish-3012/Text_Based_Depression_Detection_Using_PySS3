Why canâ€™t I just let go?My parents divorced when I was 16. I was mentally abused and neglected until I was kicked out by momâ€™s BF at 19.


Iâ€™m 22 now, been in therapy for a little while now after slowly refusing to work due to the amount of panic attacks and lack of sleep Iâ€™d get due to the panic attacks. Itâ€™s almost been an entire year since I started really struggling, after 6 years of what I thought was already struggling. 

Everything hurts more now in my 20â€™s than it even did when it was happening. I just want to forget it all. I hate that it defines me, I hate how being neglected and mistreated has made me feel all these things. I donâ€™t feel like itâ€™s ever going to get better, and I really donâ€™t want to live my life with this shitty mental illness. 

I want so badly, to just give up and die, or just not feel this shitty anxiety and depression all the fucking time. Fuck life.
