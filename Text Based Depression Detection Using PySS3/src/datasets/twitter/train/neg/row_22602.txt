People on TV work to extend their lives and I don't understand whyA while back I saw a House MD episode where one of the doctors who'd been given 10 years to live was working out and getting treatment to extend her lifespan and I was so confused, like dude, why? You've got a date, you know when it's gonna end, you've won. You don't have to worry about anything anymore, you've already succeeded. Like getting a diagnosis saying when you're life's gonna be over is the dream for me. Then go my remaining time I wouldn't have to worry about anything, stress about my career or goals or work or making sure I don't make bad decisions, because nothing matters anymore. I could do whatever I wanted, finally live free. That's the ultimate goal, why would you try to screw that up by living longer? Fuck I really don't get it
