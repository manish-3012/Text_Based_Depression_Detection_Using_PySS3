This probably doesn't belong here.(Apologies for typos and such, using a mobile device.)

So, history:  multiple suicide attempts, fairly regular suicidal ideation, but no present intent toward self-harm. Given that last point, I probably shouldn't waste people's time with my B.S..

But I guess I am, anyway. It's not at all infrequent that I lay in bed at night, wishing I had the wherwithal to just kill myself and be done with life, or to wake up in the morning and resent the fact that I still exist. I've talked to counselors and psychiatrists, and they've tried to help, but it really just drives home the point of how much of a failure I am. I don't really have anyone I can talk to, either; my friends wouldn't be such for long if they had to deal with... well, me, rather than the facade I have to put on that I'm actually someone worthwhile. And it just gets so fucking exhausting, that I sometimes think its not worth the effort, anyway. Not like anyone would actually give a damn if I did kill myself.

...I'm just rambling at this point. Apologies for wasting the time of anyone bored enough to read this dreck.
