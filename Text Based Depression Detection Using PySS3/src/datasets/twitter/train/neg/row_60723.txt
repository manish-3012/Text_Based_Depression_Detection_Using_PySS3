Burdening people with my sob storyI feel like a burden. All the self care work I've done is congratulatory bullshit and I haven't actually become a better person. Any trauma I've gone through is no excuse and everyone is just humoring me so that they don't have to be in my presence longer than necessary. And I can't blame them. If I really am this angry and horrible and selfish it must be leaking through and show all over my face. I don't know why it's worth it to keep trying anymore, I end up bothering and hurting people and it's a waste to keep me around if I can't shape up. I've done therapy and meditation and tried talking to trusted friends. But I keep fucking up majorly every other month or so and this can't keep happening. I have to hold myself accountable. I know they're wondering why I don't just get better.

I have researched everything and I'm fucking terrified but I know it has to happen soon. That's the only thing keeping me functioning right now. Putting everything in order. Making sure I don't inconvenience people further. I can't keep pretending to be a good person and crying out for help if I keep acting like shit. I'm supposed to get better, not stay mired in my fucking tragedy.
