I was dreading todayIt's been the worst year of my life and I've come close a few times to not being here.

People on here have been kind and supportive and it's wonderful to read comments here of everyone helping each other and lending an ear to listen.

I'm still not in a great place and there are still many days I feel like it's all too much, but right now I'm still here and fighting.

Thank you to everyone who has helped me over these past months, and to everyone I've spoken to I hope you are doing ok and getting through.  Try and have a peaceful Christmas if it's something you do, and if not try and have a peaceful day anyway x
