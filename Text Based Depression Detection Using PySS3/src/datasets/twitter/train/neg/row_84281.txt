Need advice for a friendMy friend has recently lost his potential job due to matters out of his hands. His health is on the decline and he feels like he's an embarrassment to his family and friends. He hasn't seen the light of day for weeks now and I'm worrying about him. He hasn't talked to any of his friends except me. 

I can't sugar coat anything because his life is absolutely terrible compared to what it was just months ago. He knows that and gets angry if someone tries to act like it's not that bad. 

This is the first time he told me about the possibility of just "ending it all."

He wants to go through with it tomorrow so he has time to prepare a proper suicide letter..how can I change his mind? From what I know about his situation, he's screwed for life due to recent events Im not at liberty to divulge. 

So basically, how can I convince someone who's life truly is terrible to not kill themselves?

Also, he's already on antidepressants that he just started due to this situation.

Edit: I should note that his number once concern is the loss of his job that he will never be able to get back...or any other job in that field he spent years of studying in for the rest of his life.
