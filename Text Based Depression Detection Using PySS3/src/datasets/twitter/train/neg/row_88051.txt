Can't be arsed to do much of anythingSo I am up early on a Saturday morning and I have a ton of homework due tomorrow night but I can't be arsed to do it. I am exhausted and in physical pain from my bike ride to one of my AA meetings from last night. Rode about 4 miles total and it did nothing to help me with sleeping. I'm just tired and exhausted and really starting to doubt that my parents are going to visit me like they said that would. I just feel abandoned and no one in my adoptive family really gives a shit about how I feel. I have two ropes and I don't care about what I am going to miss. I'm just done living in this hell hole that is Southern California
