would you trade your troubles with a random person on the street?i've heard that question before and for some reason, honestly, it always gives me a bright perspective change. 

i think a great thing about a sub like this, as well as similar places, is that you get to witness the raw struggle that seems to be inherent to a lot of life. Everybody has their fucking problems; including obviously(but maybe not *especially*?) you &amp; me. that may sound cliche and a tad insensitive but i still think it's true.

 I wouldn't want anything other than a better(easier/funner/simpler/kinder/etc..) version of my own life. i just don't know if/how that version will ever arrive
