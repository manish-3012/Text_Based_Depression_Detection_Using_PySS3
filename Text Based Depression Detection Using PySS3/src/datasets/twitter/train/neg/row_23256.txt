I disappointed my parentsI'm in the english education program at my school and I fucking hate it. I don't want to teach anymore.

I have to complete the program so I can go to grad school for library sciences and be a youth librarian. My parents won't let me quit. But I hate the program and it scares me and I want to quit.

It's not just that though. I don't want to do anything. I don't want to get my first job this summer. I don't want to do the program. I don't want to grow up. I don't want to move out. I don't want to feel this anymore and I don't want to be this anymore. Life is keeping going without me and I'm not cool with it and I want it to stop. It's too much.

Fuck the early 20s. I should have killed myself last semester when I was still sort of happy. I wouldn't have had to deal with this. I wouldn't have done this to my family.
