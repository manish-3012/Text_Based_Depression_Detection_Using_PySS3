This night might really be my final nightI'm going to be honest. I've wanted to die for a long time. I sometimes felt really bad and sometimes not as bad. But right now, I feel like there really is no alternative. The only thing that I do is drink on my family expense. Been doing this for like 3 to 4 years now. No perspective, no drive, no friends. I got nothing. I'm thinking of either driving a car to my train station and doing decapitation by train or going into the forest and do a short drop suspension. Prefer train, but the next one comes in 3 hours.
