I DON'T FEEL GOOD. SOMEONE READ THIS PLEASE.Hi there readers,

To whoever is reading you must be wondering why such a common title but let me tell you why. 

I am going to pursue my masters degree in canada next year. But here's the thing there is so much pressure in this process of securing funds and filing my visa which I dont even know will it get approved. My life is so uncertain right now I dont feel confident about it. 

Its not a good feeling, I have worked my ass off to get my admits and all I am getting is uncertainty about my future, my job prospects, etc 

I feel like crying everyday because its so hard. Its so hard to cope up. I just dont want to take this pressure, this is way too much. 

Suicidal thoughts keeps appearing in my head, sometimes I feel it will set me free. But I have such beautiful parents, I want to see them happy. But deep down I am really unhappy.
Even after working so hard, spending my day and night working I still feel uncertain and useless. 

Its so hard. I just vented it out here, but honestly I dont feel good at all. 

Thanks for listening to me you all.
