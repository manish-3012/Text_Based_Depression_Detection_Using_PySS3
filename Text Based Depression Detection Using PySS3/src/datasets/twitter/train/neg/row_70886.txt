I think I fucked myself over with work..I have been dealing with depression all of my life but it has gotten worse these past few months since college graduation. I have a bad tendency of self-sabotage and succumbing to pressure from others so as to not disappoint. I took up a crappy part-time job that I loathed just so my parents would stfu about me not working, as IF I choose to be unemployed.  I would just go to work with barely any acknowledgement from my boss and doing work that wasn't mentioned on the job description. I had enough today, as I got offered another job today, and went into my office, let my key and ID, and walked out of of the back entrance so no one will see me. Nobody called me or anything so I figured they didn't notice so should I even bother to email my boss I quit and send him the work I finished? At this point, I do not even care about being paid for the hours I worked since that means going in person to hand in a worksheet where I logged my hours and I cannot bring myself to do it. I finally got a full-time job but got scared and told them I will start this week and now I emailed my boss to start on the 4th of November and my new boss know wants to talk on the phone with me as to why this coming Monday. Wtf do I say? I feel like a fucking loser. Maybe I should say I can start on Wednesday? idk I feel like I fucked up majorly and should just end it.
