Not sure what to do, where to go. So I'm here.I posted something in /r/depression and got no response so here it is on some of the main background,

http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1cu98v/why_is_it_so_hard_to_be_happy/

The thing is I just missed class (again) because I just didn't feel like going to it. My depression has gotten worse. Much worse. I called my grandma who I'm close to and the only one who I can really talk to about these things, even though I leave my suicidal thoughts out of it. She's gone through depression spells 3 times in her 80+ years of life.

I feel like I've been on a downward spiral for a long time, if it's just going to get worse I don't want to suffer through it. I don't care about school right now, I don't care about anything, except that I always try to stick it through so I don't hurt my grandma by killing myself, but it's just getting so hard. 

I have no purpose, I also have class tomorrow with a term paper due, but maybe I'll just drink a bunch of soda stay up all night and not give a fuck and miss class, fail out, and who knows maybe I'll drive into the mini-lake near my apartment, or maybe I'll just find out how to hang myself without it being painful...

Like the title says, I'm not sure what to do, where to go. So I'm here.
