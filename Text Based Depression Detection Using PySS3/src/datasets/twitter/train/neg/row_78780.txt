32 and seriously am ready to go.I honestly am just tired of living, nothing goes right like EVER, Canâ€™t afford to do fertility bullshit and canâ€™t afford to fucking adopt so Iâ€™ll never have kids.Iâ€™m just tired or trying and caring and I have no quality of life. There is nothing good or exciting. All I do is work and pay bullshit off and clean and sleep. I really donâ€™t want to commit suicide for  he simple fact that I would like for my husband to collect on the life insurance so he can pay off some of our debt. I took myself off all my meds because Whatâ€™s the point of taking meds to allow me to function when all I want to fucking do is die, wether Iâ€™m medicated or not I feel the same. What do to? Is there ways to make your death look like an accident and not intentional?..... ðŸ¤”
