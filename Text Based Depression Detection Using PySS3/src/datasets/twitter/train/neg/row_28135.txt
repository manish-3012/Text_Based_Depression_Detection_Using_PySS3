To the people who are truly on the suicide watch, Thank you.One unfortunate thing about this subreddit is that it's objective isn't compatible with reddit's voting system. You'll be giving attention only to those who're already getting it if you simply join the sub and respond to the posts on your home page.

Everyone who needs support deserves to find it, Even if their problems aren't relatable for most people or don't get as many people to respond to them as other posts.

I have found though, That no matter how low the engagement is on a post, There's always at least one person to respond. Even the really lengthy posts that most people won't read. I myself have posted here when I needed to vent using throwaways before and I would've felt really bad and ignored if not for that one response.

To those who take the time to visit the subreddit, Sort by new to listen and respond to everyone, Keep doing the good work. I encourage everyone who wants to help and is willing to take the time to, This could help a lot of people. There's a new post here every few minutes and sometimes every minute or two. It's sad the number of posts that are rarely seen if ever.
