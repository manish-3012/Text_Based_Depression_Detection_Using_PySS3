My ex says he wants to kill himself frequently. I have no idea if he's serious, what should I do?He's always been a very negative person, everything that happens is shit and he seems to be incapable of finding true joy in things. Sure he can be happy when playing starcraft for example, but I get the idea he's never been truly happy, not even with me. He's said that I was the only positive thing that ever happened to him, that he doesn't deserve a person like me because he's so messed up and that I make him happ**ier**... but not happy. Not even a person who loves him with all her heart can make him happy.

Multiple times, even before we broke up (he broke up with me btw), he said he wants to kill himself, or he wished he were dead, out of the blue and I have no idea how to respond to that, especially now that we've broke up. He seems to have all the symptoms of a depression yet he doesn't want to seek help ("what help could talking to a shrink do..?") and before and after the break up I've tried to support him as much as I can. He's unemployed and I keep encouraging him to send out application letters, the only possible next step would be to write the letters for him...

Just now I tried to make him promise to at least try once a day to write the letter (he has one but it needs to be adjusted to fit the jobs he's applying for) and his response was "I'm trying hard not to kill myself &gt;.&gt;"

Is this serious? Is this just a cry for attention since we've broke up? Do I ignore it or force him to see a psychiatrist? I don't know what to do and my world would crash if he ever did kill himself :(

PS: he's 22, I'm 21.
