Trapped in a cornerIâ€™m really ashamed to be posting stuff like this. Itâ€™s hard to word thoughts in a way that doesnâ€™t come across as overdramatic, but itâ€™s my truth I guess. Iâ€™m not good at anything. Not one thing. This isnâ€™t an exaggeration or some weird psychological thing, I just canâ€™t function. Iâ€™m not talented, I can barely do basic human tasks, Iâ€™m so overwhelmed about everything. Iâ€™ve been doing better these days, working very hard at getting bettering my health and finding ways to achieve my goals, but then I look back at the progress Iâ€™ve made and say to myself â€œwhy not just die?â€ Why not just fucking die. That would literally solve all of my problems in one quick albeit scary motion. Iâ€™d never stress, Iâ€™d never feel joy, there would be only peace. Thatâ€™s the thing Iâ€™ve always wanted but could never get. Peace. Is there actually a reason to keep going or should I just shoot myself in the head? My friends view me as a walking favor and none of them really care about me as a person. My family is pretty neutral to me existing. Itâ€™s a pretty whiny attitude to have, but if I died there wouldnâ€™t be much of a void. The only people that would be hurt would be my family, but honestly thatâ€™s fine. Not like Iâ€™ll see or know how they feel. Again, selfish, but thatâ€™s the tone of a ropeâ€™s end as it were. Is there anything I can do?
