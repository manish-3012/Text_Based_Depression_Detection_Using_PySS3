Everything hurtsI'm so fucking sick of hurting all the time.  I'm scared and afraid most of my waking hours.  If I had noone close to me or dependant on me, I would off myself.  Life isn't fun anymore.  I have horrible thoughts too often.  I'm an empath and a cynic.  I see too much while not being able to understand the half of it.  I've been a contradiction for years, and trying to fight my way to a modicum of consistency makes me burn.  I'm on fire and I can't reach out for help, or my life would be destroyed.  I have a little hope for the future but it seems so very far away.  I've squandered every opportunity I've had in life and now my depression is eating my future ones, too.  I'd rather die than witness yesterday again.  I'm so tired of being in pain.  I just want it to stop.  Aside from trying hard drugs or offing myself, I don't know what else to do.
