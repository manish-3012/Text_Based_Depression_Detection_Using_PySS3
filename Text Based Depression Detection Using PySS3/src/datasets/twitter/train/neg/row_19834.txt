TiredIâ€™m tired of constantly feeling like such a burden, especially emotionally. Even on good days I manage to fuck everything up in the last few minutes. Iâ€™m sick of seeing myself tear the people I love down and making them feel like shit just because I canâ€™t be happy with myself. Iâ€™m tired of feeling so selfish. All I want is to feel like Iâ€™m someoneâ€™s priority, not just someone they can put on the backburner when things deemed more important come up. But I know thatâ€™s selfish. I just want to feel important to someone since I canâ€™t feel important to myself. But no one should have to deal with that burden. No one should have to deal with me. Iâ€™m so tired of all of the failed attempts but at the same time Iâ€™m too tired to try again. I just want to feel like I matter, like my still being alive matters, like Iâ€™m not just taking up space and weighing everyone around me down by still being here.
