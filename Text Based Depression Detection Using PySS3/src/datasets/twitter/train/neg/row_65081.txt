thanks for listening to mea few months ago, I started feeling suicidal. my life was falling apart and I couldn't do anything right. this went downhill for the next few months until now. you know the feeling when your whole body is aching? I would feel like that, except mentally, not physically. the mental pain was immense. that's the best I can do to describe how I feel. there would be so many negative emotions within me and I would constantly have an overwhelming feeling of wanting to die. 

if my emotions were illustrated by a bottle, the bottle be so filled on some days that it was going to burst and I would be on the point of almost breaking down. other days it wasn't so bad. but what really kept me going was someone that I could talk to. I never talked to my family about how I actually felt but this someone (my friend) listened to me. she listened. when I talked to her, I would be emptying out my bottle of emotions. it was not almost completely empty after talking but I would feel so much better. I think this was what kept me going and prevented a complete breakdown. 

to my friend, I don't think you'll ever see this but if you do (and know that it's you), I don't think you have any idea how grateful I am for you. if it weren't for you, I might not be alive and typing this right now.

I still struggle a lot with suicidal thoughts and I wish I could just kill myself painlessly. I know that I probably won't but I'll just continue to struggle massively internally. I'm hoping to get better with therapy but meanwhile holding on and talking about how I really feel to her. 

to anyone and everyone who is reading this, I hope that you also have someone to talk to and share how you really feel so that you don't have to bottle it up and live in pain by yourself.

feel free to reply :)
