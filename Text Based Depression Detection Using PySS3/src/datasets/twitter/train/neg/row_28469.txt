RantReally regret not ending my life months ago. Things just keeping getting worse and more demoralizing, my life has essentially become a slow-motion trainwreck that Iâ€™m powerless to stop. The lows get lower and the highs have all but disappeared. Iâ€™m either numb or in agony, and Iâ€™m realizing the extent to how little most people care. Iâ€™m learning that reaching out does nothing but irritate people, that love both platonic and romantic is a wasted and useless emotion that only causes suffering to the beholder. Everything feels void and meaningless. 

I just wish there was an easy, guaranteed and painless way to do it. Iâ€™m so fucking frustrated that this country doesnâ€™t have guns or psychiatric euthanasia. I just want to be gone already. Itâ€™s what everyone else wants too. Why does it have to be so hard?
