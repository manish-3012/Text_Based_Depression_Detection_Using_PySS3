God, I bet youâ€™re disappointed with me right now...Iâ€™ve started self-harming again, I thought I would never be back here, but nope. What, 2 years for naught? Cutting my chest up this time round. I wish I didnâ€™t have to stab myself, I wish I could be a kid again, but nope not gonna happen. Not gonna feel that childhood love ever again. I sound so privileged, I mean really! At least I had a good (was it?) childhood! God, I donâ€™t mean to sound weird, but I donâ€™t care: Why canâ€™t I be held in my motherâ€™s arms again? Why canâ€™t my dad lift me high up on his shoulders and narrate what I see? How blessed were those moments that now I am beginning to lose sight of what iâ€™ve lost? Iâ€™ve started conceding the reasons why I want to die, and instead replacing it with more and more self-loathing. Help me
