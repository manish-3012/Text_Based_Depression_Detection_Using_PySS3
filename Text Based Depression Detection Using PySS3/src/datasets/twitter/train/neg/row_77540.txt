I donâ€™t know what happened.3 years ago I had a girlfriend, a group of friends who actually cared about and supported me, I had a path forward in life, and three years later itâ€™s all gone. Every day I pray that Iâ€™ll find the strength to be able to talk to someone or find someone new but every day is a disappointment and drags me further down. I never accomplish what I set out to do. When I was one year in that didnâ€™t seem like a big deal because itâ€™s only been a year right? But 3 years later I still have not found a relationship that fulfills any of my needs. Not a romantic relationship mind you, but just any relationship. I have not found another person who I can really talk to since 2017. 

I realize that my plight may seem silly to some who have had it worse for longer, but to them I say, how did you feel three years in? I sympathize with everyone who is suffering from loneliness and I wish I had the confidence to talk to any of you or answer any of your PMâ€™s. However know that I love you all and I wish you the best
