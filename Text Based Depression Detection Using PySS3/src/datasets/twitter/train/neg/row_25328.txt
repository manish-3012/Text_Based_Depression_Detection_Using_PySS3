The thought of a girl ever liking me is laughableIâ€™m 21 Iâ€™m unattractive Iâ€™m weird Iâ€™m boring Iâ€™m basically the least attractive person on earth Iâ€™m super awkward around girls and itâ€™s like I turn into a completely different person. Everyone says oh youâ€™re only 21 you have so much time but every year my chances of meeting a girl just gets lower and lower Idk how to tell my family Iâ€™m gonna be alone forever
