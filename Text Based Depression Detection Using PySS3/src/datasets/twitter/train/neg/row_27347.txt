Anxiety and suicide 27 yr old womanI have extreme anxiety and itâ€™s debilitating. Iâ€™m in contact with a therapist but I really need anti anxiety medication. However I currently work a safety job where to my knowledge itâ€™s prohibited. Itâ€™s hard wanting to just be free from getting anxiety about life issues and challenges the average person wouldnâ€™t be affected by. I sometimes cry at the fact that I canâ€™t get out if my own head. And feel the only way us through death. I have no friends and feel itâ€™s hard to keep them due to my overthinking, overcompensating etc. but itâ€™s my survival and coping mechanism since childhood. I would give anything to be anxiety free even for a second. Some days I donâ€™t eat, drink water or sleep because if it. And although I know a lot of it comes from things I canâ€™t change it uncertainty, I feel like there is only so much hurt and disappointment one person can take. And I think Iâ€™m 27 years can I really live another 27 years or even a year like this? I try to hide it but outside of reddit and google searches late at night or occasionally telling bits and pieces to my therapist, Iâ€™m alone and yes many days lonely.
