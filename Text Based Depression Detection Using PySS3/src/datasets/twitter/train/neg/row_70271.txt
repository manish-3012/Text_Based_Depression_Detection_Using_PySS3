"Your job is just to make it to tomorrow"I called the suicide hotline for the first time this weekend. The operator was nice and calmed me down enough to not hurt myself but he gave me this advice and it just feels so useless. Like sure, it's a nice idea but it's not true. I'm totally overwhelmed by the work I have to do (even though a part of me thinks it's not really that much and I'm just a bad person). 

At night I get so anxious because I know another day is coming and in the mornings I wake up sick to my stomach that I have to go through another day. I've been having trouble eating, getting out of bed, and talking to friends. I feel trapped and I want to just have everything stop so I can start breathing again.
