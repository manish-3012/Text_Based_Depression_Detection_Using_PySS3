I have sudden urges to kill myself. I know I won't but I still think about itI'll right off the bet say **I AM NOT GOING TO HURT MYSELF** so this might not be the place to vent. But sometimes when I have an average day, don't talk to too many people, I'll just sit at night and fantasize about killing myself. The thought genuinely makes me feel something. I know I won't do it, nor do I intend to, but I kind of want to. Again - **I am not going to kill myself** - so maybe the focus should go on other people in this sub with actual problems. But it sometimes bothers me how much I find suicide appealing at times.
