I think Iâ€™m done.Iâ€™ve been juggling these thoughts in my head, and everyday the anger and sadness is just so overwhelming, I canâ€™t find a way to cope.

Iâ€™m so sorry, Reddit I just donâ€™t know what to do anymore. I love you all and thank you guys for being there for everyone. But I donâ€™t think I can continue.

I try everyday and itâ€™s so hard.
