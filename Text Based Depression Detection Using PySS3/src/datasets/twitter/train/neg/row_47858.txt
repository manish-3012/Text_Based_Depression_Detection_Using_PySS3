You literally don't play and therefore do nothing due to no directionAn idle mind is the devil's workshop. And what does Satan do? this.

Suicidal? Because your mind is idle. Why is your mind idle? Because you literally have little direction. Why little direction, because you don't plan out your day? Why do you not plan out your day? Because you see nothing in planning out your day. Why do you see nothing in planning out your day? Because you are used to wasted days not knowing that a filled day is like the difference between day and night. Why not go right now and plan out your day? Because lucifer wants you dead and is holding you back due to slippery words that you fail to recognize were of Satan.
