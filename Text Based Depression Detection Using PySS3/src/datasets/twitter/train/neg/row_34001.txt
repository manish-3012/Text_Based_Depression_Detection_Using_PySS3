Its a giant loopWhy do i keep making the same mistakes over and over again why cant  i be a normal person and just learn from them. Everytime i try the same things  and fail them in the same way. Then i become a emotional wreck and worsen the situation. Im so fucking retarded like goddamn i feel bad that im associating with retarded people because they are way smarter than me. Im just such a fucking moron and i get disgusted by myself. I cant even take control over my own emotions. A heartache feels like my heart is getting clammed between two concrete slabs.  I cant take this pain anymore. I have people that love me but im a ungrateful piece of shit and have a feeling they pity me and thats why they befriend me. There is litterally no benefit bring friends with me outside buying shit for you because im too afraid that my personality on its own wont be enough. Im getting fucking suicidal again and damn this time i feel like i really fucked it up again. I mean like people will say that you have experienced once so you can experience it again. But how many more times will my retarded ass make the same mistakes and for how long people will take my shit. I already realiser one friend of mine has grown a little tired of me. Actually make that two maybe three. I just want to fucking scream my lungs out and cry like a fucking bitch all one in my room so nobody will see me and give a shit. Comeone i want everyone to suddenly hate and give up on me. That will push me enough over the edge to fucking quit.
