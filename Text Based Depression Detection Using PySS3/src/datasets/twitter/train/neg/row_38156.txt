i dont really wanna be alive anymore.5 years ago i felt like i was saved by my wife. and now my pain that i bottled up for her is back and she still doesnt care. when shes the reason for 80% of the pain. i havent wanted to die in 5 years. but for some reason i find myself remembering the passcode to my stepfathers gun safe.
