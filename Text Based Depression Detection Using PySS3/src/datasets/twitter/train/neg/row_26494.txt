The older you get the more the regret.I'm close to 30 and it's dawning on me more and more how many phases I missed out on in life. Virgin, etc. If you're still a teenager I'd suggest you do what you can now to change your life. I didn't. Don't be me. Do what you can because things won't magically change. I know I'm not one to preach, but maybe my purpose is to help people to not become me by warning them. Peace.
