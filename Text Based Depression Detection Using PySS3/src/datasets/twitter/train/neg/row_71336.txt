Just found out today how my parents really see me.So there's talk about a job offer my dad got, one where he'd basically be moving (but able to visit weekends) 


And he tells me, if it happens, I'll have to 'step up'

I've been a second mother in this house since I was 11, but I need to 'step up'



I asked him how I needed to 'step up' and he told me I need to actually get dressed (because wearing pjs at *home* when I'm not going out anywhere is *bad*)


Then he went on to say that he'd be gone a lot, and I said, 'we've managed before when you've left'

And he said I've given my mom hell too...

Who took care of the house, dogs, and my brothers AND my mom when she got depressed or sick? Me


Who has never ever been allowed to have a bad day? Me


I have mental illnesses seven ways to Sunday, and I'm expected to be walked all over and mistreated and just take it and be okay with it.




I mentioned to mom I would apply to X place because Y place wouldn't hire me, and she got upset


I later said I wanted to get a job because I didn't want to be living with them in my 50's (no offense to anyone who still lives with their fam, but my fam are abusive so...)


And she tells me "you might have to" [live with us until you're 50]


Because you can't make a living on X place pay


Well dad made it out of X



"Yeah but he had experience to fall on"



So not only have they cheated me any kind of future by denying me just about everything you need to survive in this world, but they're also saying I'm a waste of space who does nothing and basically it's my fault they did what they did to me.



If I don't get out soon, I will buy a gun and end myself once and for all.
