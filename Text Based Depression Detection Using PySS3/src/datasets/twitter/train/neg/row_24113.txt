Guilt is haunting meI did something horrible, extremely disrespectful and something that I never thought I would do. It happened a couple of days ago and I havenâ€™t been able to sleep, think of anything else or engage with people properly. Whenever I think about what I did my heart skips a beat and I start thinking exponentially. I donâ€™t know how I am going to live with this crippling guilt and regret and I just donâ€™t know what to do.
