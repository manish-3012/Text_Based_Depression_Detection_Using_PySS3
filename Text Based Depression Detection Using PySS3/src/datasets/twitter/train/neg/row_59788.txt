Just want the pain to stopSince 1 year ago im having a problem where my eyes hurts a lot and gets strained all the time. I cant play video games study or go for a walk anymore without the annoying pain being there making me unable to concetrate or enjoy anything. Ive alredy been to like 4 opthalmologist and they say all is okay and get psychological help. Now I know that anxiety can cause weird symptoms but this fucking pain is in no wway psychosomatic . how the fuck can it be. 

My mother thinks im making it up and berates me constantly. Im severely depressed. She says im lazy. How can I bee motivated to do aanything if I cant look at a book or screen for 5 secs without pain.I cant wear glasses because they make it worse and without them I cant see shitt. I had to drop out of school because of this. I hate having to endure this. I want out. Im too pussy to kill myself. Im hoping for some miracle where my eyes get cured and I can escape this fucking bitch. But its never going to happen. All I do is lay in bed and stare at the ceiling. If anyone is evven reading this garbage and has any idea what it could be pls let me know. Its terrible being basically disabled and also berated and not believed . Fuck man. She just came in my room and told me to die. Might just do that
