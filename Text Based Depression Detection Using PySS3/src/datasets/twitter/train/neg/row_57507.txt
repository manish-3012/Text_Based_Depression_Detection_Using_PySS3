I hate my dad. He makes me want to kill myself.I say that really casually. But it's the truth. I hate him. I've never smiled at him since 9 years old. He always scolds me, swears at me for everything and anything. It's so exhausting. I thought he did it bc he cared, that he wanted the best for me but no. He screams at me all the time. How useless I am, how I'm a disappointment.

It was fine til I was young, 8 or something, I really liked him back then. But then as I grew older, he started making me feel more and more unwanted. He's pretty pedophilistic too. I'll be sleeping and he'll kiss my cheek, right besides my lips and WON'T stop til I wake up and push him away. I wear shorts in my house usually, and he'll make these comments, "I want to lick you", "I'll bite you on your ass" and it makes me really uncomfortable. When I was 11 something, he said, "I wanna give you raspberries on your stomach" and then he scooted right over and did it, I tried to move and push him off but he's way stronger than I'll ever be.

I don't know what to do, who to tell. He makes me want to kill myself. I want to live, but I don't want to live with him, I don't want to be near him. It's been going on for about 8 years now. I really hate this. When I was younger, I had written this letter to my mom saying that I was sorry for all she had to go through, he'd fight with her a lot too. I apologized and said that I should've never been born, that it was my fault for being alive. That man made me regret being alive at 9 years. I want help, I really do. But I can't get it. I want to go away, with my mom but I can't. Everytime an argument starts between whoever, it always ends him bashing me and swearing at me.

I really want to kill myself, at least I won't have to see him again.
