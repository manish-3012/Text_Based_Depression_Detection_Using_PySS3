I'm going to be on suicide watch, I've only heard horror stories and I'm scaredI don't know what being on "suicide watch" actually entails. I'm (15F) scared because this is the stuff my father told me about and I don't want to be out in a white room with a glass panel. I'm scared, could someone please help me?
