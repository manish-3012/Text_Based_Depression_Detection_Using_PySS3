Please help. Please do not involve hotline because I will get into trouble.I've been holding on for too long. I can't take it anymore, I'm so tired of everything; I want to end it. I feel so alone,and I have no one to talk to. Even my boyfriend(we're a long distance away) because the last time I said I wanted to die, I hurt him. It was a mistake,I feel. It would be better if I would just leave because I'm tired of fighting my depression and my mom, even though she is aware of my mental health, she makes it worse and blames me for it. I didn't ask for years of trauma, bullying, and having to keep to myself and be by myself for almost all my life. I'm sorry I really wasn't planning it at all. I am just so tired... I want to actually off myself, I really do. I canâ€™t do this anymore. :(
