How to explain that being dismissive of suicide/mental illness doesn't help?Edit for clarity's sake: 

I've been seeing a therapist since I was 19 and the suicidal ideation is under control. This teacher I attempted to share my experience with is like a mentor to me, hence why I was trying to explain what was going on in my life, and also why I am invested in the possibility of changing his mindset or approach to handling students issues. 

I've been on and off suicidal for as long as I can remember, and recently I told a teacher I trusted about it. He told me it was stupid and that I'm lucky to be alive, which while true in some cases does not help the situation at all. 

Explaining myself to him might be futile and stressful, but I'd really like for him to know that his response was inappropriate, even damaging, and that the least that could happen is that I no longer trust him to be vulnerable around him, and the worst is...you know. 

I don't want him to do this to another student who might be strong enough to handle the dismissal.
