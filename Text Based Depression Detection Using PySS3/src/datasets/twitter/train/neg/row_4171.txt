My NephewsI feel like I'm at the end point. It's not a momentary thing. I've felt this way for a long time now and I'm ready to go. I have a diagnosis and am in treatment but it's not helping. If anything it gives me less hope that this is something that will pass long enough for me to get a foothold on life again.

The one thing keeping me from doing it right this minute is the thought of my nephews. We are especially close and their mother died of a heroin overdose two years ago. I don't want to subject them to the loss of someone else they care about and trust. Please understand, I love them dearly but when things get bad I almost resent them for being the one thing standing in my way. I know that that is fucked up but I really just want to die. I'm tired. 

I'm not in the most hopeful of positions in general. I'm 37. I'm crashing at a friend's (my nephews' dead mother's, actually) parents' place and have been for about eight months. I have a moderate to severe mental illness that has negatively impacted every aspect of my life since childhood (and not for a lack of fighting it). I have a shitty job at a grocery store and a part-time job admining websites for a non-profit. I can't even afford to rent a room. My world is always one minor problem from crashing down. I don't know. I could keep going on and on but the point is that there isn't a lot of hope and I'm not sure how much longer the thought of my nephews is going to keep me from offing myself. It becomes less and less of a deterrent each day. If I can't take it anymore and kill myself, if I subject them to the loss of another close family member, one they trusted would be there for them, am I a monster? Does the amount of pain I'm going through justify the act? Am I a piece of shit for even asking the question?
