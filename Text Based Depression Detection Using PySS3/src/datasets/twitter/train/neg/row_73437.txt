Iâ€™m at university in the hopes of meeting someone. I donâ€™t care about my degreeI do not have any motivation or care about my degree. I know it is selfish of me to be at university and essentially waste mine and my parents money. I know I can not hold down a full time job, or anything too intellectual demanding. 

But without university I wouldnâ€™t have any friends. I would barely socialise and I would have no chance of meeting someone I can spend my life with. I am doing the bare minimum in my degree just to keep going. And even that is fucking hard with how bad my situation is. University will not be worth it for me unless I make some life long friends and find a loyal and long lasting girlfriend. And someone who accepts and can understand my situation. 

Itâ€™s a complex one that involves a lot of different treatment avenues, and I donâ€™t know if I can find someone who could deal with that. They would have to be deeply in love with my personality and care about me enough to ride it through with me. Realistically, I canâ€™t see it happening. 
I also have my parents expectations and so I canâ€™t drop out of uni. We would have fights if I lived at home full time. My siblings are very academic and successful. People donâ€™t know what itâ€™s like unless they have the same situation. 

If my degree ends and I havenâ€™t found the things Iâ€™m looking for, itâ€™s sealed for me. I will end my suffering and die, being intelligent and aware enough to be able to see my future.
