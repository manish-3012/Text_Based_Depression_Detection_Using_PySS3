I know people care, I just can't feel it anymore and I don't think I can stand it any longerYes, I know people care and I know my death would affect them negatively. I know I'm considering suicide for all the wrong reasons and I know that they're really insignificant things but I just can't take it anymore. I want to just sit in my garage and just leave the car running so that there will be less of a cleanup. I just can't fucking stand the emptiness anymore.
