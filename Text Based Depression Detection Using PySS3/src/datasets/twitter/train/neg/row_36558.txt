Iâ€™m tiredIâ€™m truly and simply tired of being on this earth. My constant trauma from childhood and now through adulthood have molded my attitude to where I mostly hate everybody and in return this leaves people to obviously not favor me. I canâ€™t keep a job because of my negative outlook/ attitude and coupled with the resulting depression/ anxiety- Iâ€™ve practically been dead broke my entire adulthood thus far no matter what steps I take to do better. My current thoughts is well if people donâ€™t like me and I donâ€™t like them AND Iâ€™m broke... why continue with life? Also, living in a social media age where all you see are kids my age and YOUNGER now living lavish lives, I canâ€™t help but envy and itâ€™s toxic because my depression hinders me from even trying to reach my ideal potential. Or at least move out of my dadâ€™s one bedroom apartment. Everybody posts about being there to talk when anybody feels down/ suicidal yada yada but seems like bs to me. We all ask how each other is doing and respond â€œgoodâ€ like a bunch of robots and Iâ€™m tired. Truly tired. I donâ€™t have access to a gun at the moment, but I wish I did.
