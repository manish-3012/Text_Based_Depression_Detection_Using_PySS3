I'm not sure if things are better, but the fact that I'm questioning it gives me some hope4 years ago almost to the day, I put the idea in my head I was going to kill myself in 4 years if things didn't get better. By better I mean if my depression wasn't totally cured and gone... That time has almost come and whether it be fear, or anxiety or what, I don't think I can go through with the plan.


I don't know if I ever was going to, I don't know what would have happened if this ended up being bad week instead of an average week. I don't know if I fully believe I won't still do it, but I do know there was a point in my life when I wouldn't have even hesitated if I knew the state I would be in today. Still a mess, a drug addict, little emotional connections to anyone outside of my aging pets. 


I think I should take this as a sign of improvement, a sign that I'm learning to cope with my depressions and dark tendencies. It may just be wishful thinking, I don't know. 


I'm very very unsure of what I'm doing and where I'm going. I still think part of me knows it will eventually end in suicide, but that day won't be today, or tomorrow, or anytime in the next week and I'm proud of that. Maybe I'll wait another 4 years
