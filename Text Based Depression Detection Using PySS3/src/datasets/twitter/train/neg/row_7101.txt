Thatâ€™s probably too long to read.I am an 18 year old boy (soon to be 19). I graduated from school last year in December and since then have spent almost everyday waking up in the afternoon to waste time in my room doing nothing until I fall asleep, usually in the afternoon. I do not want to live but I am too cowardly to take that final step to end it all. I tried once last year and ended up in a psychiatric ward after the hospital for a few days and that was enough to dissuade me from attempting the same method again. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. I canâ€™t see myself going anywhere in life simply based on the fact that I donâ€™t want to succeed and am contempt with failure. I donâ€™t even know what I aim to achieve with this post but itâ€™s five am and all I can think about is swallowing as many paracetamol tablets as I can. I simply wish I had the testicular fortitude to do it. I hate myself so much.
