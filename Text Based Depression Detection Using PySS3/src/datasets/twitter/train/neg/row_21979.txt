Hey, I'm Marc and I'm drunk for the 3rd time this week. Can I just ask what makes you happy?I've been tugging through life for too long. Young adult, college dropout, no perspective. I work on a construction site 10-12 hours a day, earning money to barely pay my bills. Funny thing is, I can't find a better job. Anywhere. Believe me I tried.

But it's not that. Fuck it, everyone has a job, almost everyone works their ass off. It's not that job - it's the fact that I have nothing outside of it. I don't have a girlfriend and I don't plan on getting any. I have some friends I see once a month and a family that thinks I'm so fuckin great hardworking man. Hardworking man, I'm nothing else.

I haven't been happy in over a decade. There were serious ups and downs, but my happiness is a slave to gravity, it simply always falls down crushing itself and everyone around. I'm bitter deep down, bitter because the life fucked me over. I deserve better, I'll just say it. I see all these people finishing colleges and getting money and I can't because of the factors I'm not even responsible for. Life is a lottery. 

I love to travel, but I rarely can. So yeah, I'm a poor man who likes nothing except money. I thought about just dropping everything and being homeless, I feel like it would be an adventure. I'm actually scared. I'm scared I'll kill myself outside, I'm selfish and I'd want more. More and more, it's a paradox. 

Between working 70 hours a week and killing myself, I have no fuckin idea what to choose. Feeling that my family and friends I have left would feel like crap on my funeral keeps me alive for now. You know, I can't go much longer. I'm tired. 

Tell me, what makes you happy? Maybe someone will tell a secret to me.
