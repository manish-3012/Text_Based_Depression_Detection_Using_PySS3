pain.im lying in bed with my cat next to me, usually this is when i feel most calm and okay. tonight i can not stop crying trying to hold back my sobs so my family doesnt wake up. im a shell of the person i used to be and i cant stand it. i cant stand feeling all this pain and no one understanding. my family doesnâ€™t exactly believe in mental illness so i cant get help. i feel so fucking stuck. my best friend (who i think im in love with) told me that she would blame herself if anything happened to me and that is on my mind so much. i love her with my entire fucking heart i dont want to hurt her but this pain is unbearable. im supposed to be going to my favorite place in the world on saturday and i dont even want to go at this point for no reason?? i dont know who i am anymore. everything is shit. i really think monday is possibly it for me. i cant go on feeling this low everyday. i wish someone cared and wanted to save me.
