Don't give me a reasonI'm tired. I have just enough left in me to get far away from family. I'm going to cut myself out of their lives that way they won't know where I am. Then I'm going to commit. I'm a disgrace to what it means to be human, while I preach about it to others. So I've grown silent, and now watch the world pass me by though the tiny screen of a phone. It's better that way. I was and am the toxic one.
