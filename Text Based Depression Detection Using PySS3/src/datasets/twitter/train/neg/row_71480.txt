My love interest, who is long distance, is suicidal. What can I say to him?He (M35) has his dark days. Usually doesnâ€™t reach out. We hadnâ€™t spoken in a few days and at 1:30 am he actually texted to tell me he was sorry he has been distant but he is struggling. I said I was there for him and we can get on a call and not talk. He sent me AudioSlave - Like a Stone. 

I asked if he wanted to call me. He said he wants to but he canâ€™t. I said I understand. I asked if he wanted me to call. I called and must have accidentally video called him but he answered. He couldnâ€™t talk. He said.. god, what did he say.. something like, â€œIâ€™m doneâ€ or jeez I canâ€™t remember. I started to cry. He said he had to go. He said he would call me tomorrow. 

I texted him that I understand he is struggling but I want to talk to him tomorrow and to send me another song. He sent another song about depression and suicide and told me to pay attention to the lyrics. I sent him Into The Ocean by Blue October. He saw that message. Then after a search, I sent, â€œI am worried about you and I want to help. I am here for you. And I love you. I canâ€™t even begin to imagine what you are going through but I am here and weâ€™ll go through this together.â€ He hasnâ€™t received the message or been online in 30 min. Itâ€™s 2:30 am. 

I donâ€™t know where he lives exactly. I donâ€™t know his friends. He is in therapy. His doctor recently lowered his SSRI dosage. 

I (F34) have depression and BPD and while sometimes I want to not feel and just get completely blasted on pills and booze, I donâ€™t understand being suicidal. 

Did I handle this okay?
