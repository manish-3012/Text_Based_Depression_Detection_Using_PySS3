Even the good is badEven when I have "good times" it doesnt feel right. On the rare occasion that I'm in a positive state of mind and there shouldnt be a problem I'm still not happy. I'm 19 and havent felt happiness and carelessness since I'm 16. Even if I would forever feel like the best I've felt in the past years it wouldnt feel good enough to live like that.
