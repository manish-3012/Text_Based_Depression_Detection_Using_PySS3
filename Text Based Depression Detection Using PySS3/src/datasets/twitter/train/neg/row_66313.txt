Realizing you dont have anybody to fall back on sucks.Falling on hard times makes you realize how important a good support system is. Someone to call to rescue you to from a bad date, soneone to bring you food when your sick, someone that will let you cry in their lap when you need to. It hurts so fucking bad when you have no one to call or text to help you with these things.

99% of my online friends have been temporary and in real life i was always by myself or on the outskirts of a group. Hardly anyone ever really tried to get to know me.  And i ended up rarely feeling like i fit in. Always the "shy girl".

My depression has been getting worse lately after being better for several years. Ive struggled with it for 7 years now. Now if anything even remotely bad happens I just think about killing myself. I'll be looking at how ugly i am, or looking at a bad grade, or i'll just feel alone and I'll silently just wish i was dead. It seems easier.

I know it gets better, ive felt it before. But sometimes it is hard to keep on keeping on. Dont know what the point of this is but maybe it was relatable for some of you? Thank you for reading.
