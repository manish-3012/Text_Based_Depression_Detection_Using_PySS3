The saddest part about everything I've gone through. There's no positive.I let too many bad people into my life. When I was lucky enough to actually have real friends. Not druggie flatterers. I got brought down so badly. Destroyed so badly. That there's truly no benefit to any of this. 

The best thing I can hope for is pick up my life where I left off. To break away from every bad habit I've been given to find my emotions again. And to be left the same happy kid I used to be, except this time with trust issues, no friends, a shit life, and perhaps worst of all. A self conscious mind. I'll always be mindful of every step I take. I'll always be mindful that the people I talk to aren't judging me. I'll never be able to float through the world again. I'll always be judging my own thoughts and be constantly ripped out of the world. I'll constantly be trying to figure out what's wrong with me. And never following my own instincts.

It angers me so much that I was abused. But there's nothing I can do now. My life is shit, and I'll always live with a broken mind.

I'm smart enough to realize that we're all just robots, and the scariest idea to me is what happens when robots actually break? Imagine the horror of creating a horde of human clones and watching with sadness as the robot who had everything taken from him tries desperately to find himself again.

I'll never have a normal childhood, I'll never have a friend group that I can trust. I'll never have bright eyes. I'll never be the same again.

I'll never got those 3 years back, and when I finally pick up where I left off I'll have learned nothing but to be cautious of strangers. I won't be a stronger person, I'll be a weaker person. I won't be a happier person, I'll be a more cautious person.

I fucked up my life, and I can't even cry it out.
