Honestly on the verge of suicide.Hey hey. Im Eileen (or whatever you wanna call me i change my name so often it doesnt even matter anymore) im a 17 year old trans girl and honestly im practically on the verge of suicide, and have been for a long time. Every day i wake up knowing that I'll never be myself, never be happy, and will die alone. I honestly have no idea why i havent fucking killed myself yet. Everyday I think about fucking ending it. I have no friends and everyone i know hates me. Im so close to the end that I might honestly kill myself soon. I dont know what to do anymore and honestly i just need support...
