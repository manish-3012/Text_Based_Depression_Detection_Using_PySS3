Itâ€™s ready to go, Itâ€™s just not the right place.Iâ€™m sat with my end plan in front of me. Healthcare professionals have told me itâ€™s foolproof. I could be gone in two hours. The only thing stopping me is Iâ€™m currently staying with my parents and itâ€™s unfair for them to be the ones to find me. I could be gone within two hours and I just want to not be here anymore.

Childhood trauma fucked me up. Being raped when I was a kid has fucked all my chances of being in a healthy relationship because eventually people get sick of me not being able to fake a smile and realise that no matter how happy they might be able to make me, it never lasts. Iâ€™ll be back into a rut where I canâ€™t get out of bed or shower or drink water or eat. 

Drugs used to help me escape but Iâ€™m just not wanting a temporary escape I just want out. The last time I attempted I didnâ€™t succeed and I was in a much better place back then, I wish I could be as fortunate as I was then but I just keep experiencing trauma and I canâ€™t be fixed anymore. Multiple therapists have had to give up on me because they just canâ€™t help. Antidepressants havenâ€™t ever worked. Iâ€™ve been on fluoxetine, sertraline, mirtazapine, citalopram and venlafaxine. Nada. No help. I stuck to docs dosage schedules, Iâ€™ve had doses raised, Iâ€™ve tried different types of specialist therapies and nothing works. Nothing can stop the shit Iâ€™m going through because itâ€™s not possible to change. 

The pain is intolerable. The flashbacks are intolerable. I dissociate so much Iâ€™m missing out on all things important. I keep getting told things will get better but without fail life just gets harder and harder to cope with. 

I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m going to see the end of the year through. I guess 12 year old me was right, I wasnâ€™t going to live past the age of 20 after all.
