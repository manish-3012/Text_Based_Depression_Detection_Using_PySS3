I'm hella depressed and I don't know what to do.I've been out of work for over a month.  I've been self harming with alcohol and sharp despite the fact that I'm taking antidepressants, getting therapy, and getting ECT.

I really need help. I don't know what to do at this point. I don't know how to get better. I feel like I'm crashing badly and I don't know if I'm gonna be able to survive this. I just want to feel better for once in my life.
