Advice? Inpatient care?Hey everyone, 

First of all if youâ€™re going through a hard time my heart reaches out to you, and chances are if youâ€™re on this thread then itâ€™s a pretty likely possibility. 

Iâ€™ve had some major mental health issues this past year. Iâ€™m diagnosed ADHD and depression/anxiety but I think I may have the â€œquietâ€ or â€œquieterâ€ strand of BPD, but wait times for psychiatry are so long Iâ€™m in a period of unknowing limbo right now. Iâ€™ve been seeing a therapist for about half a year which has been helpful but Iâ€™m still really suicidal, self-loathing, and unable to keep up with school. 

I self-medicate with weed all the time to cope with how intense and chaotic my thoughts and feelings are, I self-harm pretty frequently, and suicide is constantly on my mind and acts as a comfort to me. Iâ€™m super behind in school and Iâ€™m convinced all my profs hate me since Iâ€™m the difficult and stupid kid who keeps needing extensions. I start a new job tomorrow and the thought of interacting with so many people makes me want to shut down and die. I feel like such a failure all the time and I canâ€™t sit down and do the work I need to do no matter how hard I try. I feel like such a loser. 

Iâ€™m debating inpatient care since I donâ€™t think I can keep doing this anymore, but I have so many commitments, like school and work, that I donâ€™t want to completely gas and get more behind than I already am. I wake up and feel like Iâ€™m on an emotional roller coaster. I also have no self worth and feel pretty detached from everything. I feel like a piece of shit human and a waste of space. Sorry if this is heavy for those reading, but I donâ€™t have anyone else to talk to. 

I wonâ€™t see a psychiatrist for 5 months with wait times and I just want someone to help me or hold me or tell me itâ€™s going to be okay. Will inpatient care help? Do I seem like Iâ€™m at that point where I even deserve that level of care? I feel so lost and alone. Anyways, if you took the time to read this terribly unorganized and self-pitying post, thanks so much. Any advice or comments are appreciated.
