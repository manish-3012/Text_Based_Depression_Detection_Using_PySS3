I did some bad shit and now Iâ€™m on the brinkIâ€™ve been hurt by incels for so long, but this might just be the breaking point.

Long story short I called out some incels for being incels and they harassed me by mockingg my appearance and posting stuff about me on their subreddits. I have no idea what to do with them. They just doxxed some poor girl on r/teenagers and forced her to delete her account. I donâ€™t want to end up like her.

Iâ€™m already insecure about my appearance. This made me so much more insecure. Iâ€™m so sorry for poking a sleeping bear. I hope that all the incel subreddits are banned.
