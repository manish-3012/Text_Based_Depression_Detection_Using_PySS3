What's the point..I'm a huge disappointment to my parents and pretty much everyone I know. I dropped out of University when the only thing left to get my bachelor's degree was writing my thesis.

My job is terrible and I'm the laughing stock of my Co-Workers for being on my 3rd car within 3 years of getting my licence. I dread going to work tomorrow because I just totaled another one. I always thought I was an okay driver, but apparently I am too useless even for that.

The only thing that motivated me for the longest time was my passion for video games, but even that is pretty much gone lately.

I'm an empty shell with no motivation for anything and nothing to show for my 29 years on this planet. I constantly wonder why I even still bother..
