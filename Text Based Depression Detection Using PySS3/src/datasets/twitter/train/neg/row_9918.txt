I need help to make that leap of faithMy sister (may her soul rest in peace) killed herself almost 6 months ago. The first 2-3 months I felt suicidal, depressed and extremely sad. I started isolating my self I didn't go outside for 4 months and cut all contact with my friends and took a sabbatical year from school. I (22 M) still live with my parents, and they are worried I stay home all day doing nothing but playing video games. I'm one semester from finishing a degree in math/stats but I'm too stressed/anxious to go back to school and to join real life.

I don't know what to do, I feel like after staying that long isolated I don't have any confidence to go back interacting with people which is making me depressed. I feel like I lost all my social skills. Do I need to see a therapist first, does it really help ?
