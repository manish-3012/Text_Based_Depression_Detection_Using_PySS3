Realized that killing myself will be a blessing to others.After some unfortunate events yesterday, I realized my suicide will benefit others. At this point, I am selfish for still living because my life is merely a burden for others. I don't contribute to this world. I've reached the point where I don't have any friends. I stopped keeping in contact with others. If I do hang out with others, they are forced to deal with my weird, socially awkward self if I'm sober or my belligerent self if I'm drunk. I'm a burden to my family as they have to support me financially with rent, food, college tuition, etc. I don't want to live for me. I hate myself. I never achieve the goals I set. I give up because I want to be realistic with myself in what I can and cannot do. But afterwards, I am disappointed in myself. The only person I love in this world is my boyfriend. My boyfriend constantly has to deal with me venting about my issues pertaining to anxiety, depression, or just life. He helps me and fixes every problem I encounter. While I freak out, shut down, and cry. I hate myself for what I make him deal with. When I asked him why he loved me today, I was surprised he had many reasons. He said helping me with my problems are insignificant and do not affect his opinion of me. I think I brainwashed him. I should kill myself so he doesn't have to deal with me anymore. I don't positively effect him or anyone.
