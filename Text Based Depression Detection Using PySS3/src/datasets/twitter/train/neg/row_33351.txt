What constitutes an attempt?Last week i kinda flipped out and went into full autopilot. I had my mate over and we were enjoying some pizza with the kids. My tooth broke and it brought back memories of the years of agony i have endured in the past because dentists are too expensive.

 Next thing i realize is that i hear my son calling out to me. I am in the garage with a rope around my neck. There is a throbbing behind my eyes and i am seeing black spots. My lips are tingling so bad! The floor is cold! This is not right! 

 I got up and hid the evidence. I mean to go out, in control one day. But not where my kids will ever be at risk of finding me! That is so fucked up! Looking back on the experience is both liberating and fucking terrifying. There was no pain! Mild discomfort but the cold floor was the worst of it. Thats liberating. The scary part is the loss of control. I plan to go out on my terms, in my own time. 

 I did not make a conscious choice to try to take my life that night. I only realized what was happening moments before the point of no return. I hate this mental weakness!

 Thoughts? Was this an attempt or an accident? I am reluctant to label it an attempt and break my 6 year streak.
