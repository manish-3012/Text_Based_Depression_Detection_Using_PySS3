Can't help but feel that this is the end.I'm a shit situation, I've got no money, no job, no friends, terminal family illness and have been suffering from depression and anxiety for the past two years. I used to be a proud guy working long hours to provide yet in the previous two years I've barely become a ghost of that man. The only positive I have in my life is my longterm girlfriend, we're on the brink of trying to turn our lives around and start a family when she tells me that she isnt sure if I can make her happy anymore.

I'm honestly at a loss as to what to do and I feel that if she leaves me I wont have anything worth living for. I've suspected this was coming for a while but I've chalked it up to my paranoid nature due to the depression now it's been confirmed I feel like I'm suffocating. Without her I wont have anything worth living for.
