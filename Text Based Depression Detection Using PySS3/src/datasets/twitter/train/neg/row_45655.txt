I don't know what's wrong with me.Whenever i thought it will be better in future,it really sucks day by day.I was jobless 2 years ago (I am 22 btw),i was feeling like shit.I thought that if i get a job,it will be better.So i get a job,at first.I thought all my worries,all my sadness has washed away.But 2 years later now and i feel worse than ever.I love my job but i can't get along with people,i have a lover,we are good,i love her but i don't think she understands my pain.There is a feeling that something pressing on my chest.I feel like I am not still ready for modern,adult life.I want to wake up from this nightmare.I tried anything you can imagine,psychiatrists,religion,exercises everything but it doesn't work.This wasn't the life i imagined.I don't know how much longer i can make it...
