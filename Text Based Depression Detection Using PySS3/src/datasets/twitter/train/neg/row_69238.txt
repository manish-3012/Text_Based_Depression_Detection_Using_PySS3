Struggling with nigh constant suicidal thoughts.Like every good story it's often difficult to find a starting point. So, why not start at the end of this story. Eight months ago I lost my best friend. I lost the woman of my dreams. I lost everything I had ever loved. It has been eight months since our relationship ended, it has also been eight months since I have spoken to her, a woman I spent the past 8 years with. She wasn't just my girlfriend she was my one and only friend. And now, because of her new boyfriend I can't speak to her. I'm not hoping to rekindle a relationship, I just want someone to talk to. I have nothing. I've lost all of my friends. 

The last time that I spoke with her she told me that I wan't suicidal, that I wasn't depressed, I was just lonely. And yet now? I find myself wanting to, yearning to prove that statement wrong. I don't wish to kill myself, but I am terrified that in a fit of rage and despair I will turn my pistol to my temple. I don't want to do that. But I have no one to turn to, no one to trust, no one to talk to. I don't know what to do. Furthermore, I hope that this is just a phase. I don't want to write this and seek help and yet despite trying my best to be a responsible gun owner have it turn against me. I don't know how to get help without being vilified.
