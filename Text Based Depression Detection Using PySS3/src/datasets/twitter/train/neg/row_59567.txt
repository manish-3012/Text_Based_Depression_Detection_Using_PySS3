Keeping onI have a good job, good friends and family but I still think about killing myself everyday.  A week ago I took a leave of absence from work and started to see a therapist.  I've been running everyday and trying to meditate more.  I've been trying to hang out with friends more (a little bit hard with corona) and text them how much they mean to me.  I also printed a bunch of positive quotes out and put them in my room.  I expected the improvement process to be linear and not as rocky as it has been.  All you people are amazing and I hope you all get through whatever it is you are going through! â¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸
