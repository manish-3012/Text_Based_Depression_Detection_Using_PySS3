Fighting myselfI've always grown up in negative environment. I guess it's really catching up to me lately. Past few years I just purely hate myself and feel like I'm making other people's lives harder. Don't get me wrong I'm pretty well off for my age and I have so many things. But even if I try buying things I like, I still breakdown wanting to kill myself everyday. I just don't have the balls, I always chicken out last second... I honestly just hate myself and also growing with multiple families all about pride doesn't make me feel better and being the only boy too. I just feel like I'll never accomplish anything and that I myself just will never get better. I've been thinking about overdosing for a good amount of time. I just don't even know anymore. Haha never even been in a serious relationship. Always been alone haha. I'm just fucking pitiful and a degenerate. Only thing I'm good at is gaming and that won't get me anywhere in life...
