Self hatredI dunno if I can do this anymore. My lack of social skills have practically made me a target my whole life. I've come to hate myself and who I am. Like I mean thoroughly hate. I have a low iq and can't read social situations for the life of me. Its not like I haven't tried  to be a "social" person, i have, but it  always ends up with me making a fool of myself. My familily don't give a shit about me &amp; the few friendships I managed to form I've lost because of my inability to have a 5 minute conversation with someone.

Literally the one place I had left where I can talk without fear perma banned me (4chan) purely for posting too much "low quality posts" and now I don't even know what to do with myself anymore. That sounds super sad I know but it was really all I had left.

It's been a good ride but this world doesn't have anything left to offer me. Have a bottle of pills ready and 0 will to live, well , I'm sure you can see where this is going.
