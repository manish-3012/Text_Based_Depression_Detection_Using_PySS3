Having some serious anxiety and spiraling out of controlI just applied for a job and had to take a drug test for it. I can't afford my normal meds, so I've had to go a cheaper route and smoke. I'm quitting soon, but I'm not sure how I'm gonna manage with zero coping tools. It's kept me from suicide for a long time.

I'm also anxious about the results of the test. Used the same method I did before and passed, but I have a family and can't fail them. But I do acknowledge if I do, it's solely based on my choices. It's fucking with my head.

I just feel like I'm in over my head with having a family being this fucked up. 

I'm not asking for advice, just venting. Thanks if you read this far.
