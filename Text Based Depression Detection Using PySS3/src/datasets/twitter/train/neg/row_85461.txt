I feel betrayed, hurt and suicidalAll of my friends spread rumors about me to my boyfriend and his friends and he actually believes them and is deciding if he is gonna leave me.
They lied to him today and said that I was talking shit about him and they were telling a bunch of nasty rumors about me to him and 
I've never felt more hurt and betrayed in my life. They were my only friends and they betrayed me. And my bf believes them and I want to kill my self so badly rn and I'm scared I will
I've never been more hurt
I thought I could trust them

Sorry if this is annoying or confusing, or I'm being a pussy and what happened shouldn't have bothered  me, what happened kinda shook me up and I can't think right rn
