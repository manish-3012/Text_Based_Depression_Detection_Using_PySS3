Just an update for those who careI originally created this account separate from my everyday account. 

I started off with this: https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/5m1qpe/how_do_i_get_help/

Then this happened: https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/67seu1/i_have_lost_the_only_person_that_i_will_ever_love/

Then I tried to salvage things: https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/68awf7/im_going_to_give_it_my_all_to_fix_things_with_her/

tldr; I fucked everything up. 

From my last post i was felling hopeful. Wrote her a song and told her I would play it if she wants to hear me sing and play it. She didn't want to hear it.

My birthday is coming up very soon and hers is almost immediately following mine.

She is currently sleeping in our spare bedroom every night and I don't know how much longer I can do this.

I just need to get this out there since I literally in every sense of the word have nobody else.

If things don't improve I will end it. No doubt. 

I'm not a religious person, but if some of you can please throw something my way whether it's a prayer, a thought or magic for all I care I would greatly appreciate it. 

I'm hanging by threads here, and they're all fraying.

I love you all.

Thanks for reading.
