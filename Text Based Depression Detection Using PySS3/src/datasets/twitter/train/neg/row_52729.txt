I lost today after battling for 3 monthsI lost today. I was without meds for almost 3 months since it was pandemic. So I was battling with my thoughts and emotions for most of the days. Today marks the day I lostto my demons. I slit my wrist again after all those battles. I knew I lost. And I want to rest. I do not have any plans but I want to keep it in mind. I want to decide on what to do.

I am &lt;name&gt;, mu birthday is around the corner.
