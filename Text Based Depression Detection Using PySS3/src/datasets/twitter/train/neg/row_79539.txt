I feel lost and misguided.Hi, I'm a 19 year old 2nd year college student and Ive been getting uneasy feelings. My life is slowly becoming consumed and clutter by all the overwhelming work from college. It's mainly because of my poor procrastination habits. I don't have any friends that I talk to on a daily basis. Some may see me as antisocial because I don't talk to anyone at all other than my family. I love my mom and she means the world to me. I don't know what to do with my life anymore. I don't enjoy college at all and do not know what can I do if i drop out. I want to continue to try to get my degree but the thought of failing any class in college just ruins my low self-esteem and confidence. I don't want to hurt myself in anyway but I just don't want to deal with these stress problems anymore. I just hate myself for not being able to persevere in school. I don't know what to do anymore.. I'm about to collapse.
