A need to vent.Hello, I'm 18 at the moment and, yeah, things are just not going well for me. You see, I was always a negative person since I was like 13 or so, tried to change that by trying different approaches to life. I started listening to more calming and positive music, tried to think positive, tried to look forward into developing myself as a person but...just can't change anything. I have almost no friends, and the ones I have have followed their own paths, so basically you could say I'm practically alone. Tried to develop a career as an artist, but school? No luck, can't even finish high school. A job? Wish to have one very deeply, I could have one, but nothing. I don't particularly care about **me**, the problem is my family, because I just don't want to be a deadweight to them. Everyday my life feels like a constant nightmare, in which time vanishes like sand in my hands. As time passes, my anxiety becomes more and more extreme, leading to a point I almost can't breathe. I don't want to die, but don't want to live either. I just don't know what to do i mean, what's the point? 

I...need advice?
