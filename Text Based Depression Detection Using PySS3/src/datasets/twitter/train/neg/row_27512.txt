I think Iâ€™m going to do it on my class trip in October.Iâ€™m in college, and one of my classes is taking a mandatory camping trip this semester. I think I might use that as an opportunity to do what Iâ€™ve felt compelled to do for years now. I will be away from home, in the middle of nowhere, basically, so there will be no chance of my family being traumatized by finding my body. In fact, where weâ€™re going, I donâ€™t think anyone will. Maybe theyâ€™ll just assume I was eaten by a bear or something.

Iâ€™m just so done with life. My heart has been in nothing but pain ever since I hit puberty. I hate myself and Iâ€™ve given up trying to be someone whoâ€™s good enough.
