Anyone else want to die but can't bring themselves to do it because of someone?I honestly want to die, and I hope soon I do. I don't care about my health anymore. I can't bring myself to end it because of my 8 and 10 year old sisters... How could I leave them with such a burden? We always used to play on the trampoline and I love them but I'm so conflicted Because I just want to go. My older sister who also has depression and anxiety lives away at university.. What if she follows suit when she finds out? How could I leave all this behind me?

I notice now that when I cross at a crosswalk I sometimes hope that a car will hit me, and when someone doesnt see you and has to slam on the brakes (happened today at my shit job) I get a wave of relief flow over me. I'm also joining the canadian army reserves to maybe go out with a purpose. Anyone ever feel this way?
