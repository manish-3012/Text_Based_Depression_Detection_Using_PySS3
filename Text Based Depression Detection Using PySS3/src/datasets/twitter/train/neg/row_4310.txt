I'm a Total Loser, and I just Don't See the Point in Going On.
For a long time now, I've woken up every morning and tried to convince myself that "Today is Going to be a Good Day." But I just end up wanting to die at the end of the day anyways. I'm about to give up. I might end my life the evening before I go back to school, so like the end of August. I *can't* survive another year of high school. It's hell. I'm a total loser because if I can't even convince myself to push through high school, how am I supposed to convince myself to push through the rest of my life?

I'm just so done. I'm not important in the slightest. In forty or fifty years, I'd be long forgotten. What's the point in living any further when I'm so miserable. Heck, the only reason I want to live until the end of August is so I can say goodbye to my friends and family and maybe give away some of my stuff. 

My head and heart hurts all the time. I just want it to end.
