I'm in Pain!I sometimes think that if I decide to die and set some date life would be peaceful knowing that the end is near. But it's the opposite. Death is scary and the pain it would cause others is much more scarier. I'm not able to bear the pain. I surrounded by many people now so can't act on anything till the corona virus fades away. Someone please help me stop the pain. I'm jot able to bear it.
