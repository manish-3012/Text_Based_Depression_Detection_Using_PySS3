How can I help this person?Person has thoughts of hating existence, not wanting to feel anymore, feeling empty, wishing they didn't have to love anymore. They say that they would never kill themselves, that they are just battling these feelings, but they've tried before, and failed...

They refuse to get help because they don't want to be hospitalized... they say because they have no intent to kill themselves, that Suicide Hotlines are too extreme. They feel that there is no 'middle ground' for them to fall in to.

How can I help them? If I report them what will happen in their case? What can I do?
