Need helpHi guys I need help. I am sitting in university and feel burn out because of social anxiety. I don't know why but I feel that everyone is against me. Sometimes I get shifted that everything is ok but that's 1% of the day. I hate this life right now. Can't hold connection with anyone. It's my attitude that sucks but I can't get rid of it. I think everyone is against me but in reality it isn't. My mind sucks...
