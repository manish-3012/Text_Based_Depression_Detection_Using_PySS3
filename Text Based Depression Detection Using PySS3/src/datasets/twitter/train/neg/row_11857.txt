Can't stop thinking about emotional abuse. I cry on the drive home every day and wonder what would happen if I just run my car off the road...I can't get these thoughts out of my head that my ex-boyfriend is such a bad person. I recently realized his actions were emotional abuse that I put up with. I can't get anything out of my head. Even when I'm having a great day, any sudden lack of activity switches my mind to him. I want to email all of his friends and family a list of all the things he did to show them he's a bad person...
I don't know how to get him out of my head...
