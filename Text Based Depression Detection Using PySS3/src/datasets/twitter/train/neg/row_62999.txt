I can not end my relationshipI am currently 19 years old. I have known my SO for nearly 7 years. I met her in middle school, 7th grade, and by the first few months  of high school we were dating.

As we have grown up together we have changed and are drifting apart. I no longer feel loved in this relationship and its killing me to lay in bed with someone and feel twice as lonely than being isolated. I don't know how to overcome this as we both love each other but hate the relationship.

I hate being in this relationship but I hate the idea of being without her even more.

I am not suicidal but I am so utterly depressed by it all that I don't know what to do.

Nothing makes me happy anymore and I have seen anti-depressants do horrible things to people I love, so I am reluctant to try it. I don't know what to do or what to change to make things right. If I leave her I feel like I would have given up the most important memories and years of my life. If I stay and try to make it work I will have to suppress all the awful memories and push past my current situation just to get to feel *normal.* 

I don't know what I want out of life and I'm feeling as if there is no saving grace to redeem me. I constantly feel unattractive, worthless, unwanted, unloved and I can not shake it. 

I do not know what to do other than be unhappy.
