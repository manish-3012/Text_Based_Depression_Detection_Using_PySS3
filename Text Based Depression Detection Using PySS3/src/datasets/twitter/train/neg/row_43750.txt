I have so many other feelings than this... But this is all I could think off right now.let me drown in suicide

since the day he was born
he knew what they thought
he had heard what they said 
about him
they destroyed him
so they moved on 
but he was damaged
he had now told himself
you're too fucking ugly
nobody will love you
you fuck up everything
it was endless suffering
he made a journal to express his pain

The Diary of Lost Words
nothing else was written but
people are not good to each other
people are not good to each other
people are not good to each other

he knew this feeling was true

he watched it happen everyday
he watched it happen to his friends
he watched it happen to himself

why
he asked himself as he looked around himself
he couldn't take it
this was no place for him
he couldn't take it any longer
it ruined his heart

he had just wanted to be accepted and wanted
but he now saw that it doesn't exist
all he saw was people using others as an excuse to fill their insecurities and voids 
he started blaming himself
and soon started asking 
why am i alive

and as time passed he started hating himself so much
he started blaming himself
he started hating himself

the pain and suffering was indescribable 
he never was suicidal but he felt it inching closer

until he set the date that he was going to die 
to die alone
this was the path of irreversible scars

LET ME DROWN IN SUICIDE 
it was yelled
it was felt
nothing mattered anymore

and as he put his neck around his poorly tired noose
it was time to leave his life
and to dissolve into nothingness
farewell life 
people are not good to each other

he had left his journal in hopes of changing things for the better
and with it he left a rose
his last farewell for his fading heartbeat

hurt gone forgotten
