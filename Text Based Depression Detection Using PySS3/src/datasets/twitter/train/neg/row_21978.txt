DecisionsI want to write out my life story, but I won't. It may be recognized. I'll just have to be annoyingly vague. 

I have very little money. I have looked into the various methods of suicide, and it seems that I will need to acquire a gun. None of the other methods are possible or certain enough. But in paying for a gun, I will put myself in a very awkward position. If I buy it and don't use it, I will most likely be literally homeless on the streets shortly afterward. So if I buy it, I will have to use it. I have to commit to this course of action. I would prefer to make the final decision without that pressure, but I don't think I can. 

My reasons for ending my life are not worth arguing about. I have been alone, unwanted, and unloved for far longer than most people reading this have been alive. This is not a problem amenable to solution. I cannot be loved. I can't prove that, but it is so far beyond obvious, after all these years, that I don't care to even discuss it. 

It may seem that I am unsatisfied in my relationships. No. I simply have none. I am not relevant to any person, emotionally. I never have been, even as a child. I do not know why. 

I do not wish to be this person any longer; I cannot be anyone else; I need to die. 

I have to decide very soon whether to make that purchase. I just want to be clear before I commit. I think nearly 50 years of evidence is sufficient. I am defective. I am garbage. No one says so, in words. But they say it. Kind, decent people unwittingly say it and show it every day. 

I've been miserable long enough. It is time.
