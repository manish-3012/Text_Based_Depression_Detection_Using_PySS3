I'm so emptyI feel numb. A shell of my former self. Every day I think about dying. I feel like my life will never be as happy or full as love as it once was.   

I'm so hurt. Destroyed.  

If the one I love hurts me so much I must not be worthy of love and kindness. If the person I loved more than anything can do this to me then I'm safe with no one. I must be nothing. I want to become nothing.  

The reason life was worth living is gone to me now.
