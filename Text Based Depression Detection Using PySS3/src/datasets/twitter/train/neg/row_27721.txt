I wanna end my life tonight i guess. VentI haven't tried suicide in about 1.5 weeks, same for cutting. i finally broke, im sick of these feelings i have, i fuck up to much, i even resorted to drugs to fill in this emptyness, every time im happy i still feel depression hitting me, theres always somthing i do to make me depressed, my hands are really shakey now. I hitted a vein last night cutting but why didn't i die? It was deepish. So many times i tried to die but fucking failed. Honestly only reason i dont want to end my life is because of my family. I dont want to leave them. hell anxiety depression and constant suicidal thoughts are reason im failing school with an avrage of 27% i cant even write or sleep at night. Fuck, i refuse to talk to a guidance councillor, and everyone who i pm doesn't reply back, because its disturbing.One thing that depresses me out is, yesterday i was hanging with my friend laughing our asses of about stuff and i saw a kid and his mom walking in to a&amp;w to eat. The kid was so happy and excited i wish i was the kid, happy and living life, i wish i had a dad not the abusive asshole my mom devorced , but a good one,i wish i was like 8 and my mom was holding my hand and dad was holding the other as we walked to a resturant. Everytime i think about this it makes me cry, i guess i gotta let it go as it will never happen.  Im actually hitted inanity, i once in awhile hear a voice in my head of a girl saying ''take the razor again'' and or  ''it will be a few seconds to go'' im crazy. I even have dreams at night ending up with me dying by a gun or a blade. My goal in life is to live in japan tokyo by age 25. 16 and cant even make it though a day without trying to kill myself.
