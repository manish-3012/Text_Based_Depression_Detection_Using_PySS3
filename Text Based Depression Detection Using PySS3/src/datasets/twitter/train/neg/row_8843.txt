Why do people think that suicide is something for those who think they are a burden?For background: i continuously think about suicide.. ive half arse tried a fair few times.. and once woken up in hospital after a v serious attempt. 
Iâ€™ve done inpatient time and always proactively spoke down with people and attempted to look myself 
(note the health care system and bad doctors who have been flippant with meds havenâ€™t helped)

What i donâ€™t understand is this misconception that people who want to kill themselves feel like other will be better off without them?
I know I am destroying lives around me when I think about trying... are those who donâ€™t understand just trying to justify it?

I honestly have a great life but I wake up every morning so exhausted I just want out.. the only thing that keeps me here (again) is the damage I would do

Can some help me reconcile this
