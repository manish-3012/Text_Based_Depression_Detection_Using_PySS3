Suicidal and nobody to go to.Thanksgiving my friend told me his grandma may have covid. We're pretty sure now that she doesn't. Since I have bipolar 2 when depression hits it doesn't go away for quite awhile. So right after that news I had gotten majorly depressed. I couldn't take it the day before yesterday so I self harmed and tried to be honest to my friend that I did so. 

Now I've pissed him off understandably but am scared that I will have nobody to talk to for around 6 months till my friend feels like talking to me. I don't really have anyone to go to about me being suicidal. I have a therapist but I can't really tell them cause of the risk of hospitalization.

So I sit here alone scared if I might do something. I know I'm strong and I could probably make it through this. But with nobody to really go to I feel lost and hopeless for anything now.
