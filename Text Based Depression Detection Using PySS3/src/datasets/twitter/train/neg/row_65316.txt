I just want somebody to talk to.I'm 19 male. Ive grown up with abusive parents my whole life. Never had any friends never had anything. Kepy everything bottle up my whole life. Finally met a girl with who i fel in love with immediately. We started dating and i felt so much better. I poured out 18 years worth of guts to her and i felt amazing. Now after 1 amazing best year of my life. Shes breaking up with me. Im to much of a spineless dastardly kill myself even though i think about it daily. I dont know what to do without her. She showed me what happiness was. She taught me how to smile and made my cheeks hurt so much cause id never smiled before. She took my virginity. She was my only friend. My only girlfriend. Now I once again have nothing.
