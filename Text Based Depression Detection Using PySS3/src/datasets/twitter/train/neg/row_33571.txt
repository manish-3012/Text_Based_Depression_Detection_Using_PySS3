Felt a little too comfortable with the idea of killing myself this morning.This morning, I was chillingly okay with the idea of dying. It was relieving when I thought of not existing anymore. I hadn't experienced that before until now--like a sudden weight lifted. Previous suicide attempts (many years ago) had always been angsty, chaotic, and panicky. This morning, the idea of being dead was so much more tranquil and inviting.

I don't plan on committing suicide. But, I don't know how to digest this new perspective, and I don't want to let it get out of control.
