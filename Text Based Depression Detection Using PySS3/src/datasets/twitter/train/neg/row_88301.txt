I feel like I'm on the verge of killing myself but I can't tell anyone because everyone is tired of me being depressedI've not planned on being alive for this long, something my friends are all very aware of, and I just want it all to be finally over. Normally I'd vent to one of my friends about this type of thing to try and release some of the distress, but I'm sick and tired of just being a burden on them all.

I've got most of what I need set up I'm just too lethargic to take the final steps, as much as Im dying for it.
