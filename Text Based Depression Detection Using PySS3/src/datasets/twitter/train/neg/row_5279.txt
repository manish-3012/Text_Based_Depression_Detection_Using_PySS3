When I was a little kid, I promise I'll die onI'll die on the happiest day of my life. I remember suicide is such a common thing in my home town. Dying naturally be it accident or desease is too depressing. So I say if I don't get to choose when or why I was born, I should at least choose when I can die. And I will show people that dying shouldn't just be a"way out". People should not die unhappy. So I promised myself I'll get everything I want and will die at the high point of my life. 

I think I just got there. I'm on antidepressants. I have a good job. I just bought a condo. I think I'm ready. I never did enjoy life much still. And I'm wasting so much resources, resource that could've gone to people who actually like life. And I don't want to just die. I want to spent my life. I want to donate all my organs. If I were to die to capital punishment, I want to commit a crime that is of my Life's worth, whatever it is. I thought about it a lot. If I find a clinic in Mexico, I don't think my organs will go fairly to people that needs it. I don't want them to go to the highest bidder. Maybe Netherland can be my best bet. I don't know how to get a doctor to help me with such what seem silly idea. But I know I'm just a Google away from the answer. 

I've seen brilliant people here with beautiful response. So what say you? I don't even know if I am looking for a CMV. I just feel like I want to share. And I love Reddit. If I've decided what to do Reddit will have my last word for sure.
