Not gonna make itItâ€™s as definite as it can be without me actually being dead right now.  

Too much sick stuff has happened to me.  Recently and in life.  

Itâ€™s way too sick.  Way way way way way too sick.  Even getting out of it.  Iâ€™m tainted forever.   Deep sick trauma.

If I lied to myself that it was reconciled, like when I escaped my sick family, itâ€™ll just happen again later. 

This world is a sick fucked up place.  I want to die.  I canâ€™t wait to die.

These fucking â€œfriendsâ€ who call me pessimistic and clingy.   Hah !   No, I really honestly donâ€™t care about you, sorry you think Iâ€™m clingy, you wonâ€™t have to deal with me at all when Iâ€™m physically gone.  Iâ€™m already mentally checked out. 

Too fucking damn bad that I just have to spread my toxicity to everyone around me till Iâ€™m gone.  Iâ€™m poisoned.  Tainted.   Not even worth a text back from the people I cared about.  Who I thought cared about me.
