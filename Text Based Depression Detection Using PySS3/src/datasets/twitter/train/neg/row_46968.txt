Dying is the optimal choiceI think that everyone who is contemplating suicide should do it as quickly as possible without thinking about it. Living has risk and could result in pain, dying is a much safer choice. There are many ways to die painlessly such as jumping off a high place, shooting yourself, drug overdose, etc.
