What's after if we go...Being that the reason we're here is likely because we are thinking or thought about ending it at one point, has anyone ever wondered what's after. Do you think there is an after? What are your thoughts? I wonder about this a lot and i feel like it's important since we believe there peace after.

Please don't hate on each other, accept that we all have different views. Simply say how you feel about it or think could happen...anything, it might help one of us in any way in any direction.
