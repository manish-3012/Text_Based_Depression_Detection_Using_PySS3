I want to dieIâ€™ve always had thought since 10th grade because of my past and last year I finally thought I was getting my life back on track after two years of feeling numb I found what I thought to be the love of my life I was willing to go out and get interviews and applied to college but everything just went to rock bottom so fast my gf left me after 6 months the hospital job that i was interviewed twice for didnâ€™t hire me and now Iâ€™m in college and it just doesnâ€™t feel right. Mostly suicidal about my ex but she knew about my past (my cousin mr steal your girl my other ex) and we said a lot of things to each other and when we met (two hours from each other) it felt so real and I actually felt what being in love was like we talked about our future together type of shit. And I know there are many people out there that has it worst than me but that just makes me feel worst lol.
