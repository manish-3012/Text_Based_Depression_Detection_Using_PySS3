I don't get how normal people do itHow do normal people just get through life? 

I have nothing to live for. Nobody cares about me, and I know how it sounds but I don't care about anyone in particular. And I know for certain I'll never have a positive effect on the world. But how do people live with that? I just don't get how people don't feel the same way I do. I want this painful life to end. 

Are they happier than me? Or are they just not fucked up in the head. I wish I could be like them and at least be able to handle this life.
