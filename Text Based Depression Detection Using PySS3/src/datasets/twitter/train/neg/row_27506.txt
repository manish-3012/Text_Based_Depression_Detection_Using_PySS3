What to do?Okay here it goes, I've done a lot of thinking and I've come to the conclusion that there is no point in life.

 I used to to think that the point of life is happiness, but then I thought that humans have just evolved to get happiness from things like sex, eating food, and adrenaline... I feel manipulated by evolution, happiness is pretty much things that keep me alive.

You could say that theres nothing wrong with being manipulated by evolution and to just stay alive and keep living your life happily.

But I don't wanna be a puppet dancing on the strings of natural selection.

Ever since I've come to that realization, I've also been losing my morals. Who cares if a child is raped, or murdered, we're all just cleverly arranged atoms in fucking space, and who cares if a group of those atoms gets a different shape AKA death.

Ever since that realization, I've noticed things matter about 80% less to me, I'm not depressed though.

I'm thinking that killing ones self isn't really that bad, I mean if we're alive for 80/1000000000000000 years of the universe why go ballistic if someone picks 15/1000000000000000 instead.

It's been 2 months and I don't know why I havent killed myself yet, I wanna know why you guys think "the living state" is so much better than "the nonliving state". 

What should I do?

Edit: i dont have any love affair right now, not grieving, not sad, actually pretty content with life right now, just thinking..
