I can't see tomorrow and it scares me.Hi everyone, I don't really know what to say. I feel exhausted and there's so much I want to get off my chest but what is any of it worth? I feel stupid.
Loneliness is driving me insane and I just want to physically be hugged or held by someone. I know it sounds dumb but I just want to feel loved. I don't really have any friends and honestly it's not something I want from my family.

I know I'll get criticised for this but I really just want someone who's close to me to show interest in me.

I know all of you will say everything takes time but I've waited and I'm sick of waiting especially when there's people out there who can get whoever they want.

I don't want someone to tell me that everything will be okay.

I just want someone to show interest in me in an intimate way. I need that.

Call me crazy or dependant or whatever you want but I don't give a fuck. I'm sick of this shit and I'm finally speaking out because lonely people get given shit for wanting to feel what everyone else feels.

I'm done hurting emotionally and physically. You don't know what it feels like to look like a regular guy but have no one give a fuck about you.

So much tension and so much anger but nothing to release. And no I don't want suggestions, I don't want to be told to go to the doctor.

I want to be loved like everyone else.

It kills me to see people who want to die on here and sometimes I have a hard time wrapping my head around it.
I never thought I'd ever consider suicide as an option again.

This isn't a threat or me saying I'm going to kill myself and I don't want anyone to be scared for me or worry.
I'm just in that state where nothing else is in my mind but that.

Sorry about that rant but I needed to get it out.
