social anxiety is killing mei hate myself. i hate my teachers for laughing in my face when i stutter. i hate them for not even bothering to understand and forcing me to speak up when i'm clearly uncomfortable. i like to believe that i'm doing my best, or at least trying to but its getting harder day by day. its gotten to the point where i would rather kill myself than present in class. i hate everyone in my class. i see them pointing at me and saying my name and then laughing just because i'm that quiet kid who is awkward and its apparently so funny to watch me stumble over my words and cry in front of everyone. i hate myself so much and i don't think i can live like this anymore. i don't even pay attention in class anymore, i just sit there thinking of ways to kill myself. i can't talk to anyone about this. i don't know what to do anymore.
