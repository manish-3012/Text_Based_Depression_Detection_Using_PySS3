Being Alive is already the best that I can doI don't understand why I can't just be happy, there's definitely reasons I should be. But I feel nothing, I don't like being awake, and I can't find enjoyment when I am. I hate that this feeling lingers often. I know this is my only chance at experience, but I can't find the energy to enjoy it. I'm not sad, I've been depressed for years, have terrible social anxiety. I just don't know how to break myself out of this. I guess I'm just trying to stay level. I'm not even sure how I could even do it, that existential fear....but I know it won't matter after or now. My nihilism by definition can't help. I don't know what I'm afraid of, which is all that really puts me off, that and not owning a gun I guess. I figure if I can't pinpoint why I care enough not to act with impulse, maybe there's something I'm missing.....I just can't figure out what. I am alive. That is the best that I can do...but I don't know how long
