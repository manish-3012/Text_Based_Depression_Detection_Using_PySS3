it feels like my life is nothing but survival every time I think I'm getting somewhere I fuck it up, every time I try to do more than just live, try to really experience anything and prioritise something beyond self-protection the universe just reminds me that I can't do anything more than barely stay alive and knocks me right back to where I started, what's the point if I'm just supposed to live life on autopilot? If my destiny is just to live in this little bubble of self-protection why should I even bother? what's the point of living if life is all about survival?
