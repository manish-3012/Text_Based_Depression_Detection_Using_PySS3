Add a headache to a depressed person and you get a big black holeI am ignored by someone who seemed to care

im not her business i understand, but it hurts so bad. 


Aside from that, im a fucking useless pos, i cannot even land a temp part time job. I apply from 'low end' to 'high end' , various types of jobs and nothing. Im a socially retarded nervous wreck so 'selling' my body is out of the question. im so low. 10 years ago I was thinking about what medical profession I wanted to study in. now im a depressed pos who got kicked out of grad school lab after attempting suicide. i deserved it, nobody wants a depressing mess around chemicals.


and today morning presented me with a big fucking headachr that lasts all day long


now its late afternoon and still my head hurts


i wanted to go outside to get some fresh air but it is boiling hot. im good at nothing


Last night i woke up with a weird feeling in my heart, in the middlenof the night. was slightly  conscious (i think) but couldnt move at all. and my heat started beating weird. and you know what i felt? peace. i hope i just die in sleep
