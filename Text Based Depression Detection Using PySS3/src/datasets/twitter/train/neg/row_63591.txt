Requiem for the RedeemedTraipsing a delicate line between remaining here and existing elsewhere; being split apart from the opposing forces. 
After death is the symmetry of before conception. Imperfect proof of another life, devoid of squandered potential. 

My existence is defective, and suicide feels like macro-apoptosis to me. 

Perhaps someday soon Iâ€™ll be able to succeed. 

Requiem for the Redeemed.
