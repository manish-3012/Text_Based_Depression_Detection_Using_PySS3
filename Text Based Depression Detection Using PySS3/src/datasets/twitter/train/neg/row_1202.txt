Iâ€™m invisibleI donâ€™t have family Iâ€™m close too, the only friend I thought I had in this lifetime destroyed my life, I wake up and go to bed every day knowing thereâ€™s not a single person who cares about me, who misses me, who would miss me. If I died no one would know, or care. Alone is an understatement. Logically speaking there is no reason or purpose for my existence, I donâ€™t feel like I wasnâ€™t meant to be in this life, my soul just took a wrong turn. I forgot how it feels to be held, loved, wanted. I stay as high as possible to numb it, but we all know that doesnâ€™t work for long. I donâ€™t want to do this if this is all thereâ€™s going to be, who wants to make every memory alone? I donâ€™t understand why Iâ€™m not enough, why was I picked for these memories? Is this really what I stuck around for? All these years convincing myself â€œitâ€™ll get betterâ€. Itâ€™s not going to ever be better, it wonâ€™t even be ok for a little, I accept this. Now what do I do?
