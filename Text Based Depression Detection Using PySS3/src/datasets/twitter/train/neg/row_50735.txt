Im seriously messed upI'm a severe and medication resistant bipolar. That being said I tend to have urges not thoughts about suicide, even when manic. I'm more worried about having urges when manic than when depressed because I tend to lose self control when I'm manic. I've gotten treatment but it's never enough.
I have a child and without him I would not be here today. The only thing that has kept me from killing myself is my child. I just remind myself everytime that this kid needs me. It's starting to not be enough, this is getting worse. I cannot talk to people in my life about it, they all just tell me to stop, they don't wanna hear me talk like that. I'm trying to explain a real problem and they just focus on how hard it is to hear. 
I truly have a deep desire to die and it comes out often. I have caught myself swerving my car toward on coming semi trucks, unconsciously, forgetting realizing later I was repressing taking my meds nearly overdosing twice, and ever woken up choking myself with the sheets. I feel like I have a damn demon in my head forcing the issue. It's not constant or overt, it's very subtle and builds over days, until I give in and spiral downward in depression or catch myself unconsciously trying to make it happen.
This is a real problem recently as much of my life has fallen appart. I lost my job, my girlfriend, my home, my car, and my health insurance over the last six months. In the last two years I had a marriage collapse, was massively demoted, almost lost my child to Dss because of my ex's bad parenting, and been diagnosed with another potentially deadly disease. I don't really know were to turn for real help, therapy doesn't do it. I'm extremely social phobic to where more than 2 close friends at a time is too much. I have family but they are far less helpful than friends. I'm not sure what I'm looking for but I know if I don't change something I will eventually give in or accidentally give in.
