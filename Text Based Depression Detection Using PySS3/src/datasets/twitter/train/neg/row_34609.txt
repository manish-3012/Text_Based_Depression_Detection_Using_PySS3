Can't take it anymoreI'm a female, 25 years old. I have aspergers syndrome and have suffered with depression my since I was a kid. Most people would consider me lucky. I have everyting i want. A loving family, hobbies, cats...
But i have always been suffering and tonight i have hit my limit and i dont think i can keep going.
I have an addiction to escapism. I love video games and anime the most and get so involved in those worlds that i dont want to leave. I have all the games and anime i could want and they are tearing me apart. I want to live in those worlds so badly that i watch and play all day and night and spend all of my money on these things.
My mother is my carer and i love her so much but we argue all of the time about the money and my moods. She doesnt get it. No one does. I wish i came with a book explaining 'this is how i feel' but i cant and i feel so alone. I have no friend and no girlfriend. I came out to my mum years ago too and she never seemed to accept it or get it. Its like she doesnt believe me.
Tonight i had a massive fight with her about my games and how i always want more. They make me happy and i know i cant buy them but i need them. She stormed out. Its never happened before and now i feel so hopeless.
I've always been a loser without a life. I havent been sleeping well because of nightmares. I need this to end. I cant see another way. Im sick of feeling terrible and tight in my chest all of the time.
I love you mum. Please know that.
