Intrusive ThoughtsI'm not depressed, I have a comfortable life, close friends and satisfaction at work.

What I do have is Intrusive Thoughts, or L'appel du vide as the french put it.

This usually manifests itself when at train stations or on balconies.

I've now taken to ensuring that I book into lower levels of hotels (I'm a smoker, so no balcony rooms don't work,) after an episode at a hotel on the 22nd floor left me shaking for over an hour.

None of my friends that I've spoken to can relate and I thought someone here might have some experience with the phenomena or be aware of the types of treatment (if any) are out there.

I've googled previously and most of the Intrusive Thought management techniques are in relation to PTSD, OCD and Post Natal.
