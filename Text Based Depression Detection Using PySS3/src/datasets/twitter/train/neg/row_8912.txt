I want the impossible...I want a place that's safe, one where you can offer up your tormented thoughts and not have to worry about law force involvement. I don't want to be treated like a baby that no one knows how to hold. I just want someone to sit with me and say "I understand" 

Tonight, it came with no warning, tonight my heart sank, my mind went blank and I realized something that I've known for a while. I don't want to wake up anymore. I've turned to friends I've turned to family but it doesnt get better. I've been to the doctor, I've been on antidepressants and I've tried counseling. I've tried to change my thought process, I look at think and I appreciate them but still, still I don't want to be here anymore. 

I wont call a hotline, I wont call the cops, I don't know if this will pass tonight or not but what I do know is I appreciate the time anyone has taken to read this. If I never wake again, if I never lurk again I'm okay with it. It just feels good to put this into public words, I feel like I can rest easy by doing so. Thank you mods and creator of this subreddit for giving me the only place that comes close to what I want.
