Please read, Iâ€™d appreciate the adviceIâ€™ve been having suicidal thoughts usually every night, whilst Iâ€™m trying to sleep, itâ€™s always around that time, I ignored it for ages and have tried getting on with life like nothing was happening. But I was sold some diazepam last night at the bar,I know theyâ€™re good as had them before so I bought a pack! I left the pub absolutely wasted, barely able to walk straight, Got home, tried to sleep and had the same thoughts again, it felt like it was worse this time, because I turned into a complete mess, maybe because I was drunk but I lost my head, for in my opinion no reason at all. Anyway, I seen my diazepams and said fuck it, I thought fuck it because I was drunk and believed i would just fall asleep and never wake up, I didnâ€™t want to suffer, I just wanted to go at this point, Quitely and happily. I took around 15/20 at a guess. I led down on my sofa and waited, 5 minutes goes by and my head started spinning (because of the alcohol) lasted about 1 minute and I was projectile vomiting in my bath, assuming most of the tablets came out as Iâ€™m alive.

My question though is that, is that a sign that I should ignore these thoughts I get every night, like is me being sick a sign to say donâ€™t try that again boy?

My other question is do I tell my dad about last night  not too long ago I spoke to him about my thought , but not in depth, I told him I need a break away from
This town and he said he will pay for it for me if it gets bad, itâ€™s got bad, but my dad is not very good at telling someone is bad, like he wonâ€™t think itâ€™s as bad as it is, is there any advice on getting him to understand (if I tell him whatâ€™s happened) I wonâ€™t tell mum, it will break her heart.
