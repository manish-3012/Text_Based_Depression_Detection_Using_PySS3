Everyone I love has given up on meEveryone. My dad, his side of the family. My friends. Anyone I even consider dating. Now my mom, who begged me to move to another state with her, is saying she wants nothing to do with me after I made an honest mistake. I'm just so tired of caring, putting in effort and getting shit in return. I really just want to end it all. Why do I even bother?
