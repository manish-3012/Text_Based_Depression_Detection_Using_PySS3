Resources for helping a suicidal friend who is abroad (in the middle east)A friend of mine has been depressed for a while and recently confided in me that he has suicidal thoughts.  He contemplates suicide regularly, but does not have a concrete suicide plan.  Unfortunately he is living in Qatar right now and I am not sure how to help him.  Can anyone help me find resources to help my friend?  I am willing to buy a ticket and fly out there to help him, but I'm not sure what I would do once I got there.  
  
I've been told that there is a pretty significant stigma around mental health issues in the Middle East, so I am not sure how easy it would be for him to find a psychiatrist.  Would a normal hospital be able to help him?  I have not been able to convince him to come back to the states because he fears easy access to firearms.  
  
So far the advice in the sidebar has been very helpful in talking to him, thank you!
