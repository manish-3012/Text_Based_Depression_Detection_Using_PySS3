Is my father at immediate risk?We had a recent, major family argument about my sister's inability to attend to school due to her anxiety. My father became extremely frustrated, and shouted at the top of his lungs, louder than I've ever heard him.

My gut tells me something was off. Without notice, he drove away with our family car. He is generally a quiet and non-impulsive person. I called him and said not to worry. He doesn't know where he's going and when he's coming back. He says he needs time to himself.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't help but feel something off. Or it could be my anxiety. I hope it is.

&amp;#x200B;

I am deathly worried at the moment, and it has been 4 hours already. It feels like forever. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is there anything I can do? I called up on him asking if he's fine. He said he is, but is not very responsive.

&amp;#x200B;

Any thoughts on what I can do? I am panicking at the moment.

I have called my psychiatrist already.
