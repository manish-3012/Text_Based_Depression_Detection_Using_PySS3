What's the point of living when you suffer all the time?I don't have much going for me in life but I've always had a really strong circle of friends. Recently, these friends abandoned me and told me they want nothing to do with me. I got really drunk and said things I shouldn't have said and they told me it crossed too many lines and is unforgivable.

These people were my rock. I loved them so much and now I have to live with the guilt of knowing I threw away everything by being stupid and that they'll always look back at me in a negative light. I've experienced breakups and other forms of heartbreak in the past but this is incomparable. The people that matter the most to me are gone for good because of my stupidity. I want to write a nice letter to my family explaining why I must go because the thought of fighting anymore is too much to bare. My best friend called me one last time and said indescribable things about what a horrible person they've discovered I am and you know the worst part? They were 100% right. Through all hardships in life, I survived due to these people and my best friend. No matter what BS happened at work, no matter how bad my day or week was, they always had my back. Now I am left with a huge void, intense guilt, intense depression, and I can't handle it.

I haven't decided how I am going to do it yet but will decide by Monday since the idea of a new week terrifies me.
