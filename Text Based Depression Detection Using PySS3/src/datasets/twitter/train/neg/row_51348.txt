Current events make me realize that nobody will ever take me seriously.I live in the United States, where police brutality is the current cause du jure, and some people who I had previously held dear in my life are telling me to stop being so opposed to the police. I then tell them why I'm so opposed to the police: I've been harassed by cops because of my disabilities. So when I watch the Black Lives Matter protests and read accounts of people who have been hassled by police simply for their race, I can't help but believe what they say and what they feel.

Everybody dismisses what I have to say.

They say that I still need to support the police, even though they harassed me. They tell me I need to learn "how to behave around the police" (which, of course, police officers never need to learn how to *not* harm innocent people).

It's been like this my whole life: Bad stuff happens to me and I'm always to blame. I would just rather die. :(
