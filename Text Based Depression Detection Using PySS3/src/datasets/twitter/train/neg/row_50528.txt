Ex boyfriend.I lost my ex boyfriend two years ago. I don't know how to handle this. His mother blames me for his death , even though I was the only one who tried to help him get clean. 
I feel responsible even through I know I'm not. 
He took a drug overdose and his heart just stopped. I feel responsible, because I left him before it happened, and that made him feel miserable. How do I get past this? I am not even allowed to know where he is buried. 
I miss him everyday, he was my best friend. 
I can't talk to his mother, she hates me.
