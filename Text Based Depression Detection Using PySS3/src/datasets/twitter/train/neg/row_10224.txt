Why do I have to grow up? If all I here are stories of how being an adult is a struggle then why do I have to work to get something I'm never going to be happy with? I get no choice and I hate it, I'm only 15, suicidal, depressed and wishing I could go back to primary school. I'd rather die than have to become an adult or live up to what everyone expects me to become. I doubt it gets better.
