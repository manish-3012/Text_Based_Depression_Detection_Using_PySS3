Time with my kids then Iâ€™m outI canâ€™t live without my wife and kids, I fucked up and lost them all. 
Sheâ€™s moved on, my 3 year old talks about his new dad all the time.
Told me he kisses mommy on the lips and sleeps in her room.
I have some
Time this week with the kids, when I meet her
To give them back Iâ€™ll apologize, tell her Iâ€™ll always love her, want her
To be happy and try to hug and hold her one
Last time.
Then Iâ€™ll cross the median at 160 without a seatbelt on and let them collect the insurance.
