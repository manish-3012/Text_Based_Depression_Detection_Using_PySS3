I am tired of being upset all the time.I think a huge source of my depression and low self worth is that I am unable to be open about my inner sadness with people. I am tired of being told â€œyou canâ€™t be sad you smile and laugh all the time!â€ We all act, we all put on that front sometimes. I want to be genuine for once.

I want to make a friend who also needs to relate on that level, to be able to be open about how life can be so disappointing feeling even if things are â€œgoing well.â€ 

I sat here in bed tonight sobbing reading other comments and shares on this subreddit also considering suicide myself, and genuinely believe that if we could all just sit in a room together a lot of the barriers could come down. Through honesty healing can begin, right?

Instead of wallowing I want to try. 

If youâ€™re in the Nashville or Murfreesboro areas of Tennessee I encourage you to reach out, letâ€™s get coffee and be bummed out together. You can also send me a PM to test the waters. Throwing yourself to the emotional gauntlet doesnâ€™t have to be a leap.

Alternatively, if anyone knows of a focus group in this area I am desperate to try anything to feel less terrible.
