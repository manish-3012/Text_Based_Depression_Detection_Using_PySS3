Nothing is going goodI met an amazing man this year and we started dating but it seems it won't work out because my mother sabotage me. We were saving money for my visa and then she took my ID so I can't move with my boyfriend.  I am so sad he is the love of my life. Anyways he told me to leave him alone today and that he is depressed because he isn't with me now. Before like 20 mins he called me honey and babe and I thought things are getting better but then I said something else and he replied ,,kk" and then I send another text and he left me on seen. Right now I am just gonna text him to not be depressed and go to some cafe and restaurant and find some girl that will be perfect for him.
I am so sad honestly and heartbroken . I feel like leaving home and going into the wilderness.  My boyfriend will be better without me even if he said life without me is useless before few days
