I've given up and have decided to live as a parasite until I dieI have no hope of being able to do any form of work or ever feel better so I'm going to life off other until I run out of people to exploit. I know its selfish and its wrong but thats who I am, a pathetic petty person and that's the life that I'm in now, even if I can improve things I'm far too lazy to put in the effort so I'll be a NEET until all my friends leave me, then I'll kill myself
