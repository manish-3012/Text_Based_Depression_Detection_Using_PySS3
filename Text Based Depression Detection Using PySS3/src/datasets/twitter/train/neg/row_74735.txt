I can't anymoreI literally can't even talk to people casually. Everytime I try I just want to disappear. I just can't amount to anything. Everyone around me has got a memo that i seemed to miss. Everyone has got it. Not me and it's fucking disgraceful. I don't deserve love or any other good things adjacent to that. Everyone else had already done the things i'm just starting to discover BECAUSE i spent my teenage years fucking depressed. How fucking pathetic is that huh ?

I just wish i could fucking die already, but i'm even too much of a coward to do THAT. God fucking damn. Why the fuck can't i man up for once in my pathetic life and do something right.

I could go on and on but im not gonna burden you all. Bye ðŸ‘‹
