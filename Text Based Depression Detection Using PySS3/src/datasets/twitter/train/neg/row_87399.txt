I'm getting too tired to deal with this.I've been dealing with suicidal thoughts and depression for over 10 years now. I've been on so many medications, I've been in and out of the mental health ward, I've tried therapy, counsellors, self-harm, medicine, street drugs. 

I'm starting to realize that any advice or help anyone can give me is just trying to buy time. No matter what I'm still going to end up in the same spot, being tortured by my own thoughts.

I had an unsuccessful suicide attempt last year that brought me to the ICU and I really don't want to mess it up again, so I'm planning on doing something more effective.

It just really sucks that I can't be fixed, but I guess that's just how things are.

I'm really really tired of trying to fight this, I have no one to talk to because if I try and talk to someone I know they'll call the police or try to stop me, but I really just want to be able to sit down, talk to someone, hug them and have them understand that this is the way it needs to be...why is that so hard? I don't want to die alone, but that's my only option.
