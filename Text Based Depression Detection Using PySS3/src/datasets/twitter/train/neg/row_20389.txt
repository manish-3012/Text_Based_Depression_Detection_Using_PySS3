I screwed up the only interview I'll get in my city, I have no money, and I'm a burden.I keep thinking that I should just kill myself. I screwed up a job interview for a great position. This wouldn't be so bad if I hadn't been in undergrad for an embarrassingly wrong time and am now considered a flight risk to any employer worth their salt. Over the last few days, the only thing keeping me alive is the money I borrowed for school; if I die before paying that, the debt would likely fall to my parents. However, I'm becoming less convinced by the day that removing myself isn't worth it for them and others. They try to talk to me via phone every few days, but I know they're ashamed of me so I don't come to see them. I don't want to kill myself, but I'm seeing few reasons not to do it.
