Its all a fucking lie. You "theres hope out there" assholes are sadists and evil.Ive listened to you for 20 years, and wish i had ended my life a long,long time ago.

Hope is toxic.

It wont get better. It will only get worse.

I knew then and now:

I will never be loved.

I will never do anything to justify the agony of my existence. 

I will never be happy.


families, love, jobs that arent comperable to serf labor: These are sometimes things. 60% or more of people dont get to have any of them.

yes, suicide was then, and still is, the answer.

these "its never the answer" people are fucking lying. they enjoy watching you suffer.
