I'm so sick and tired of everything.I have never really talked about this to anyone of fear of being ridiculed. I am so sick and tired of being so lonely or feeling like i 
dont belong anywhere, people looking over me like i dont exist. I had my first taste of actually being loved by someone and fucked up everything i could because thats what im good at, being a fuck up and a disappointment to others. This feeling, this emptiness is so unbareable sometimes that i just want to end it right here and now but even that i can not do because im a worthless waste of space. Most of it is also my fault for being stupid and oblivious and before i know it its already too late. It kills me to see other get hurt by me and i myself not realize what the fuck i am doing. I probably deserve all this shit because i do not even have the common knowhow to talk to a human being without somehow fucking everything up in a way. Wish i could just close my eyes and be done with it.
