I dont have will to liveIm 23, currently in medschool my final year but im studying outside my country. I know, i should have known better about this. :( its just that everything is so hard. I have an ugly face full of acne and scars. Ive tried everything for that. I knew that you will say this looks doesnt matter, but, its a lie. Looks is superior to everything. Once my friend said my face looks like a boy. And another one said she feels annoyed just by looking at me. And she said shes not joking. To her, its funny, but not to me. She doesnt know how much it hurts inside. Every words sink in deep down my heart. I cant imagine my mothers feeling if she heard this. Mom, im sorry for being the ugly one. :( im not clever too. I struggled everyday. I dont know how long i can last. :( i hate my life. My attitude is kind of diva, but im still kind. Its just a covered up for my sadness and depression. They hates me. Even if i did sth kind, they will just ignore it. But if did one thing wrong, everyone will isolate me. I have feelings too. It hurtss. I hate everyone:( i feel lonely. Ihave a bf but hes too busy. My family is busy too. I have no one to talk to. Nobody want to hear my scream. Everyday the pain is like eating me from inside. Im struggling, like putting a smiley mask, and go to class. Idk why im still living. Nobody likes me. Even myself, i hate myself too:( i miss the time where i dont have anything to think, and just be happy... i missed it. Is it wrong to be ugly and stupid?!! Why are we so judging of others? You dont know how much pain they are bearing inside!! Please be nice to everyone. I have suicide attempt few years ago. I cut my self. And now it starting again:( i hate myself. I just want to somewhere far from everyone, and hides. :((( it hurtss. Take it away from me. :( im tired of cryingh my eyes out every night and pretend to be strong the next day. Kill mee:(
