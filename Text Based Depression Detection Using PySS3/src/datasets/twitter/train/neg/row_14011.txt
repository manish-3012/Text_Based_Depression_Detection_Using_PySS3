Everybody who I've ever loved, including my parents, have abandoned me. I can't get a job. I can't get diagnosed. I'm about to become homeless.Hey, SW.
I can't afford a phone anymore, and there aren't any 24 hour suicide prevention chats, so hopefully one of you can help.

I'm 24 years old, and I've been thinking about suicide since I was in first grade, when I first told somebody that I wanted to die. My parents didn't believe that depression exists, and I've never had a formal diagnosis.

My parents are dead to me now, and I can't function as a regular person. I fill my time with volunteer work at the same soup kitchens and food pantries that I eat at and depend on. Nobody likes me - the only sort of relationship I have with anybody anymore is that of pity, and I've become increasingly withdrawn as more of my former friends decide that I'm no longer worth their time.

I've also participated in a couple of studies on trauma, basically just to have food to eat, but in my interviews I realized that I may have something seriously wrong with me. I think that I've been depressed my whole life because of how my parents fought &amp; involved me with their fighting when I was a child. When I was 20, my girlfriend was raped, and I never got over it. Last year, I was bludgeoned in the head by a stranger and woke up in a hospital covered in blood. I've never had the comfort of counseling for any of this, because nobody has ever cared.

My current lease is up at the end of the month, and I think I want to kill myself before that. I am unemployed, and I don't want to be homeless. I need someone to talk to.
