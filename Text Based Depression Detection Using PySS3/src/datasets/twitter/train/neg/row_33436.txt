The fear of living forever has ruined the serenity of deathThinking about suicide used to be a comfort for me. The only thing that got me by. Then last night the realization that after Iâ€™m dead I might still exist forever came to me. I started thinking about how there might not be an end to this. Ever. THAT is my worst nightmare. Now the one thing I had left to turn to terrifies me...I feel so trapped and thereâ€™s nothing that can end it..

Iâ€™m going to go fucking insane
