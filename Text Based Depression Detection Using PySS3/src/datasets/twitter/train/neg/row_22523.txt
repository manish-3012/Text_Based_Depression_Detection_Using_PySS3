Can anyone direct me to an appropriate hotline for this situationSo, I have been having suicidal thoughts for a long time. I wake up every morning and fantasize about killing myself (my plan is, to take sleeping pills, vodka, and fall off a high rise. Or go for a swim). 

I've tried to find an appropriate hotline. The problem is: I live in Vietnam. I can't find any good hotlines for this country, and I cannot afford to call another one.

Does anyone have a way to contact a Suicide hotline by whatsapp? Or another strategy for me getting help? 

I don't have a family, I cannot have a romantic relationship, and I am not really able to leave the country at this point.
