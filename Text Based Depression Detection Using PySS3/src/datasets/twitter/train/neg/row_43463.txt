Useless loserDonâ€™t know how to start this. I hate myself so much. I wish I could restart life. I wasted so much time doing nothing. Any little thing gives me anxiety. I want to kill myself but I donâ€™t want to hurt anybody because I know how much my family cares about me. Iâ€™m the biggest failure. I hate the stupid gap in my teeth. I feel like everythingâ€™s a waste because everyone just works a boring job until they die. I have no talents. I wish everyday I was never born. I donâ€™t know what else to say. I want to take a bunch of pills and end it all but I donâ€™t know whenâ€™s the right time. Every since I could remember I always felt I would end it all eventually. Never thought I would even make it this far. Always been depressed but lately Iâ€™ve been at my lowest point. I just wish I was made like everybody else. I donâ€™t enjoy anything and life just seems like a waste no matter how I look at it.

I never really posted anything on here before or shared this with anyone but just needed to say this.
