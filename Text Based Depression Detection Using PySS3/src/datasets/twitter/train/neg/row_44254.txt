she's killing me, my friends deserted me, i am so alone right now. i need some wisdom guysShe (6 years younger)
had just got out of a horrible relationship. she said it'd been 4 months but she had bruises when i first talked to her. i didn't let myself fall for her. we had fun. she wanted a relationship. i wasn't sure, and acted unsure throughout the relationship. started pushing her away. eventually she had enough and started acting weird and shady so i broke up with her cause it seemed to be what she wanted (to not feel guilty about seeing her ex) i was fine until i found out she had been hanging out with her ex through a friend. i want her back now. i now realize how much she means to me (or maybe it's something else?) she refuses to tell me whats going on (maybe cause i'll be like, conformation. peace!) also, why is she keeping me around? tell me she wants to see me and fakes on me. sees me and cuddles and then makes an excuse to go see him. she's with him now.

my friends,
they don't want to see me cause they know im a wreak. i annoy them. i don't want to keep letting them see me like this. i can't even think about anything else no matter what im doing. what's  even worse is i have finals and i can't get myself to get up and do them.


why do i always push the girls that care and like me away. why have i never been able to just end it with someone without feeling like death. why do i realize after that i like them.


i've given myself 3 days to think it over. this keeps happening, i used drugs to cope. now i refuse. but now i see myself getting rope instead.
