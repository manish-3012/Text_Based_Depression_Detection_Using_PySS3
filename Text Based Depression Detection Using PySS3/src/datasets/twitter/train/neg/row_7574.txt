Bye?The past year has been really horrible for me. I lost all focus toward life. I feel like I have to put on a mask to be around other people. Everybody is fake, empty and cold. Lately, I've hurt a lot of people and feel guilty for all that I have done. I have a full bottle of prescription cough syrup and the urge to down it with a few shots of vodka. Fuck detox. Fuck my friends and family. I'm torn apart inside. I don't want to leave but I can't stay.
