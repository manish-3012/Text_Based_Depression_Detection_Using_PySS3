Donâ€™t See The Point AnymoreIâ€™m a 28yo male who has fucked my life up to a point beyond repair. Drowning in auto, student loan and payday loan debt that I can barely keep up with at this pointe, hate my job and am extremely lonely. The last time I got laid was back in April and that was only from a $100 prostitute. Iâ€™ve prayed so much but itâ€™s like I canâ€™t control my impulses that put me in these situations. Please give me some help if youâ€™ve been in and experienced a similar situation
