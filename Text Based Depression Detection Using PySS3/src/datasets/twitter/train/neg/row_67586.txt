Would 1900mg of DPH kill me if I took them all at once?There was this one time, when I used to abuse benadryl, where I took the most I ever took in one sitting, 250mg, and it knocked me out cold for 5 minutes straight. The second they were in my stomach, suddenly I was waking up in my bed 5 minutes later, with no memory of having taken them. An hour later, their usual effects hit me.

And now I'm thinking about then. If I took all 76 pills I have left, it would probably be similar. It would probably knock me out instantly, right? And for longer? Just like that first time?

All the documented cases I've read about of suicides with DPH were around a gram of the stuff. And any documentation I can find about fatal doses says that a gram is only fatal for someone lightweight or sensitive to it, but that doses closer to 2 grams are nearly assured to kill anybody. Well, I'm lightweight and sensitive to it, so I'd think that this dose of nearly 2 grams would assuredly kill me, yes?

I don't want there to be a chance of me waking up in the morning with a killer headache, or waking up in the hospital a week, or weeks, later, with possible brain damage, or worse.

I want this to kill me. Can someone please tell me if this is a good method? I'm pretty sure it'll be painless, what with the idea that it'll knock me unconscious and leave me that way the whole time I'm dying. Right?
