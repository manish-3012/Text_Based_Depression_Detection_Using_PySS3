I'll just be forgottenI just turned 16. I thought all my problems were over. I'm finally doing well in school, I'm working on my license, and I even got a job. I was finally over my dad's death a few years ago, I thought bullying was done. I stopped caring about my  weight. Then I realized I was a monster. I'm abusive. I verbally abuse my mother and brother, and sometimes even physically abuse him. I am quick to anger. I get beaten up and called horrible names by my mom a lot. I don't have friends, and no one wants to hang out with me. My mom doesn't let me leave the house. I go to school, come home, and get beaten up. I want to die. I want to put a noose around my neck and sleep forever. I tried slitting my wrists, and tried to hang my self, but I'm too much of a coward. But this time, I'm ready. I wrote my note. I'm home alone tomorrow. I have a perfect spot in my basement, I looked up how to tie a noose online. I read online that you should think of how people will miss you if you die. My mom and brother would be better off without a monster like me. People at school would mention me a few times but people would forget in a few weeks. I have nothing to live for, and I don't want to live. Maybe I'll finally be at rest.
