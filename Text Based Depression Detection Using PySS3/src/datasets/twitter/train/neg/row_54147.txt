Advice on wills and documents of the suchI am trying to figure out what all I need besides a will, do I also need to change anything with my bank, I have a joint account. I am done. Husband had hid the gun so I wouldn't but I am just going to go buy a new one, I live in Texas so it is easy as hell to get a gun. I am just now trying to figure out what all I need to do first to make sure there are no loose ends and everyone can resume normally after my death. Do I need to change my car out of my name of is just putting things in a will and having it notarized good enough?
