Life through suffering or doesn't exist at all?Sometimes i think, if only, if only, if only there's a choice, beetwen living in suffering or doesn't exist at all, i prefer doesn't exist at all, we are going to die anyway in the end, and God, there's still afterlife and judgment.

i even think that grass or tree is more lucky than us.

I just want a peaceful life

Anyone else feel the same? 

Edit:just don't do suicide okay
