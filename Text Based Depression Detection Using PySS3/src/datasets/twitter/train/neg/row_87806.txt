Too Young To DieThis post will probably go unnoticed. 

So uh. I'm just going to vent because venting helps when people are sad, right? I've had depression and anxiety for almost 5 years now and it's really starting to show.  I literally cannot look at myself in the mirror without wanting to throw up over how disgusting I am. I feel so dead inside because I rarely ever go outside and when I do, I'm so anxious I can barely enjoy it. I don't have any friends because I'm homeschooled and I just want to end it all. My mom was just put on unemployment so times are tough for us and I feel that if I died, I could help her financially. And she wouldn't have to put up with such a disgusting human being anymore. I've told her how I felt and I'm finally getting a therapist again, it's been months. But I feel like it just won't help. Like I'm too far gone. I'm really young, and I've tried killing myself twice in the past, but recently the urge has been so strong. And I've been trying extremely hard to not go into my moms room and get a razor, but I might just do it one of these days. I really miss the feeling. I'm so lost right now and I don't know what to do anymore. I just need help before it's too late.
