I'm so losti feel so shit and guilty about everything, and I feel like suicide is the only thing that would 'solve' it, like all would be forgiven? And I don't know, I'm so angry and upset at myself, And writing about it right now, is the first time I've thought about it and opened up a little, and it really really hurts to open up? Idk I've always figured I'd die from killing myself sooner or later.
