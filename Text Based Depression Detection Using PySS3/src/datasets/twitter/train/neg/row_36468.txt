Iâ€™m 21 and I plan on dying soon.hmm this is weird to write about. im 21 and plan to take my own life before the year ends. why? well i just donâ€™t wanna live anymore! iv dealt with bad mental health for years now and itâ€™s recently gotten, i would say, the worst itâ€™s ever been! i feel like every two minutes im thinking of killing myself, it just never stops! why do i plan to take my life in a few months and not now? i want to do a few things! sadly no traveling bc of this whole covid thing but thatâ€™s okay, maybe in my next life ill travel the world?!?! i also want to mention that i quit my job of almost six years bc well i hated it there and i had a feeling id be dead soon anyway. also i have a cat, heâ€™s the cutest, most annoying this ever but i love him soooooo much!! (heâ€™s currently sleeping on my chest as we speak! well type) also my best friends birthday is in a month! i want that night be amazing! i want to buy her a gift sheâ€™ll love and just make our last memories good ones!! iv already planned in my head how ill do it. im already as some people would say, â€œbeing selfishâ€ so i will do all i can to not have my parents or someone directly in my life find me! itâ€™s the least i can do. i plan to go to the city and rent a hotel room for one night. im either gonna take a bunch of pills or hang myself. i also want to mention that i knew i was gonna die young! i always had a feeling Iâ€™d be 22 or 27 when i died. i guess i was wrong. anyway, youâ€™re more than welcome to leave comments asking questions or whatever. thanks :)
