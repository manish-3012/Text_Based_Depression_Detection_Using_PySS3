Iâ€™m on the verge of killing myself because of my race (white)Pretty much 80% of the reason Iâ€™m so suicidal right now is because of my race.  I spent another night on a news website (Vice) reading the horrible things they say about white people.

And if you try to be not white, which is the only thing that would make me want to live, people just hate you harder and harder.  I read a Vice article saying Ariana Grande needs a â€œpainful reminderâ€ sheâ€™s white by a Madame Tusaudâ€™s figure and that no amount of tanning can change her â€œ23 and me test.â€  How exactly does imagining youâ€™re causing someone pain (I doubt Ariana gives a shit) advancing the cause of social justice at all?  People literally think of race as so biologically and genetically cogent and real someoneâ€™s race can be defined by a genetic test.  I just read a comment saying transracialism is just â€œnasty white women.â€  Like I am a disgusting and repugnant human being like rotten food or vomit for existing and having the audacity to be confused about who I am and Body Dysmorphic, abused by my mom, and mentally ill.  The idea of someone wanting to change their race is apparently abhorrent.

I cannot win.  I feel like the only way to find relief would be to take a DNA test and come out even 0.1 percent non-white.  Thatâ€™s the only thing that could make me want to go on living at this point.
