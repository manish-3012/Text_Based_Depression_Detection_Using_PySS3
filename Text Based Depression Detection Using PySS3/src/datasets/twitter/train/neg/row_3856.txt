Looking for insight.Why is it that anything pertaining to my ex sends me into a suicidal spiral? 
 It has been almost 10 months since we broke up and about a month since our last contact I have gone so far as to delete all social media platforms to avoid even seeing his face.  I avoid all triggers that remind me of him in trying to avoid this awful feeling and move on.  I am a genuinely afraid that 1 day I am going to go through with it I'm throw away everything over someone who has seemed to trap me in their own person hell.
