I am so fucking done with myselfI have everything, everything someone like me could ask for, a happy family, great and supportive friends, good education, and yet, my life is plain, boring, meaningless. And so am I actually, all I am is useless and unwanted. I donâ€™t even know why the hell would I feel that way, I donâ€™t really know anything at this point. I just feel empty, but there is yet something in emptiness, something that wants to fuck everything and simply enjoy life, but hell nah, of course I wonâ€™t let it happen, of course I donâ€™t want to feel better, of course I would rather just cry myself to sleep than just cheer myself up for once, of course I would rather die and leave it all behind than deal with all the problems I have,and realising that you being the mess you are is completely your fault is just too much for a weak pussy like me. I am absolutely destroyed by this fact. I donâ€™t deserve living, I should just stop being the embarrassment to the human race I am, I should just stop everything, stop exiting.
