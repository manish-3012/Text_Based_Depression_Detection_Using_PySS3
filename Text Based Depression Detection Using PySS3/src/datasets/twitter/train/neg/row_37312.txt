Increasingly thinking more of suicideI haven't genuinely wanted to kill myself since I was a young buck, mid or late teens, and I'm in my early 30s now. I do, however, still think about it in flashes, like little still images of shooting myself in the head (that one followed me for at least a decade) popping up at unexpected times, and fading away just as fast. It wasn't a desire, just the idea, and I'm sure that isn't all too uncommon. 

I'm a bit too proud to believe I can't handle my own problems, but I am somewhat concerned over how things have started to change. The thought of jumping off a bridge has seemed to get added to my suicide reel, and the idea is a but more animated. I've twice now had moments where I couldn't remember what my personality truly is, I guess some sort of identity crisis, and the words of "I should kill myself" seem to find their way into my head quite often, like an internal autocomplete any time I leave a sentence hanging. Again, it isn't a desire, and I know I won't do it, but combined with the identity stuff, I am a bit worried, and would love to hear if there are any people with similar experiences. 

In addition, I plan on trying meds at some point in the future, but knowing that suicide is often a side effect clearly has me off put. That and lowered sex drive. Are there any meds these days without those effects? Thank you for any advice.
