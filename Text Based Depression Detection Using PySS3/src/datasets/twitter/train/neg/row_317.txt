Looking for Group Therapy EnvironmentI know about EA and haven't necessarily ruled that out as an option, I just wanted to know if there were any non-"Let go and let God" alternatives to comparable group therapy, just people talking. It's not even entirely for my sake or some overwhelming desire to share my story and experiences. Sometimes I like to just listen to other people rant, and there's no better feeling in the world, to me, than when I get to help them. EA's probably the only non-structured option, but any advice would be appreciated. In the Hartford, CT area, by the way.
