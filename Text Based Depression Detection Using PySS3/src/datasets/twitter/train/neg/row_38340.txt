StuckI donâ€™t want to die because itâ€™s scary but I donâ€™t want to be alive in this world and when all I do is hurt people. I just want to be a good person who doesnâ€™t hurt others but no matter how hard I try I never am, and I never will be. I just want to hold my cat and fall asleep forever, knowing that I did my best.
