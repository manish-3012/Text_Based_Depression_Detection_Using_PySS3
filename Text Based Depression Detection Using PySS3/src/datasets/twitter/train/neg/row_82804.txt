15 years old, donâ€™t know what to doSlowly failing school, distancing myself from family and friends, closeted trans and bisexual, my only friend is my girlfriend of over a year and she would leave me if I came out as trans to her. Repressing who I am and constant stress and bullying at school for being a feminine guy back me into a corner and suicide keeps calling my name. Iâ€™ve almost done it so many times and but I really would rather get my life together but I donâ€™t know how and Iâ€™m getting worse each day. Please help
