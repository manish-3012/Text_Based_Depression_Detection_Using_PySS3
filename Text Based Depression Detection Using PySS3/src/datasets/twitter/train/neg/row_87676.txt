Just took a risky mix. Again. I'm sorry if I dont wake up.This sub has always been kind to me. For about a year you beautiful people have helped me through a lot of things and tough nights. I've deleted all my previous posts but you guys are amazing. And to my family. And my friend. Dont blame yourselves. Celebrate my life. I'm choosing for it to be over but I'm ready. Remember the good times. Dont remember the mean nasty drug addiction peice of shit I am now. Please. Remember me when I was a kid. When I had life in my eyes and I was excited for the future. When I was still. Good. I'm only 19 but I've done so much crazy shit. Theres plenty more crazy out there to see, but I think I've seen quite enough. Goodnight everyone. Zoning out bad. I fucking love all of you. Anyone who has anything negative to say or any judgements can fuck off and meet me in hell. Alright this is it. Gonna finish my cantaloupe and I'm dozing away with no worries. For tonight, I can finally relax.
