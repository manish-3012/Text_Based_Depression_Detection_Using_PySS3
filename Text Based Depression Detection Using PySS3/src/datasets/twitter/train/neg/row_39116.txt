I might not be here tomorrowHey everyone, throwaway here, I don't know what to do, my dad is abusive, I hate everything around me, my best friend is dying of cancer, leukemia to be exact.
I have a knife, vodka, and pills.
Edit: tried calling a suicide hotline earlier, they said to "accept god and everything will be okay" I told them I'm an atheist, and they said "well.... You're on your own."
