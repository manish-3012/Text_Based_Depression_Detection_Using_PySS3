I feel selfishI have friends, I'm not poor anymore, I have people that love me,I'm not in foster care anymore,all the court stuff is done. So why do I still want to die? I've already tried to kill myself around 5 times (gets a little blurry because of trauma based memory problems). I can't see a future where I'm not either dead or locked up. My friend at school asked if I was more depressed than usual and I convinced her I wasn't. I have all the means to end it, I'm just waiting for the right time.
