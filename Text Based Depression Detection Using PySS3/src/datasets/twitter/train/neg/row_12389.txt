How do you handle relapses??i can be hopeful one day and another day all hope seems to be meaningless... It gets really tiring... I feel like... i don't even want to be hopeful anymore. There's nothing to be hopeful for...nothing to live for. I don't want a family, money, friends... What's entertaining? I just turn on the television and forget what i watched the moment it ends. Just to pass time. How much longer can i last like this?

I'm only hoping for someone to help me out of this permanently.
