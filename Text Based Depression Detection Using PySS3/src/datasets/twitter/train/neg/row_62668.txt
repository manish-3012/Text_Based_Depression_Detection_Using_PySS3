I don't think I deserve to liveI'll keep this brief. When I was younger, from ages 14-17, I used to look at child pornography online. I justified it at the time, telling myself I was only looking for people my own age. I knew it was wrong, and wanted to stop, but continued anyway.

A few years later, I had stopped looking at it and had pretty much forgot about it. I got into a relationship with this amazing girl and things were going right for me. I was happier than I'd ever been. After dating for about a year I decided to tell her what I had done. I thought it was the right thing to do.

I hurt her a lot. She stuck with me for a while, but it got to be too much for her. I don't blame her for leaving, but now when I see her I get into this jealous rage. I want her back, and I keep hurting her and bothering her: late night phone calls, texts, even after four months I can't leave her alone. I don't want to keep bothering her all the time. At the same time I keep hating myself for what I have done to her and to myself.

I can't forgive myself for my past, and I don't think I should. I'm terrible. I feel like my situation is so unique, that there is no solution in my case. I'm thinking of ending it all today after four months of  beating myself up. Been thinking about it for a while. I've already written letters and have made preparations. I've emailed one support group my whole story and didn't get a very thoughtful response. So I don't know if this will help, or even if I want to be helped at this point. Because I just don't think I deserve to be alive after all I've done.
