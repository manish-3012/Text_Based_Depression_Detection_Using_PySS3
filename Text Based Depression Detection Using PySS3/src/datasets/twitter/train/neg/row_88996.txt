Why I think about Suicide a loti never had "friends" I did have some but they were friends because I was alone and I always was different from them. This also men I had to do more work in group projects sometimes but I still like them for helping me at least. I went from standing in the corner to sitting on a chair in the canteen. 

I have Social Anxiety, I believe so. I get really nervous in social situations, it's disastrous
 
I feel lonely and depressed/sad

I am not social

I just have some specific things I can't stand and are wrong with me :(( when I was a kid I thought I would be different as a teen but I'm already 16 and nothing's happened. I never got liked by ANYONE. Girls or Boys except my 2 friends, who were rather popular and helped me, but they both failed class so I am spending this year and last year alone. There are so many stories I want to talk about to someone.
