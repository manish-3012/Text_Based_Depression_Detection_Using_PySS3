Goodluck to everyone in 2019I'm just tired of all the insane bullshit from everyone, men to women to black to white to straight to gay and all in between. I've been working on myself through therapy for the past 14 years and it doesn't seem to be helping me. In fact, I feel like I'm getting worse. I've been trying every dating app under the sun (tinder, bumble, okcupid, PoF, coffe.meets.bagel, bbw meet, black people meet, match.com, bi singles, etc.) And yet here I am still single through all of it with not even a simple kiss to show for it. I constantly work out and exercise and still no attention. 

People are severely unkind and I'm so ugly apparently that even when I have a mental breakdown, no one seems to notice or maybe they just don't care. People on here keep saying to cut out all toxic people from your life to be mentally sound. 

Of course that sounds logical and great but then I found myself all alone. Everyone seemed to be incredibly toxic: family members with their lack of knowledge on mental health issues, friends and co workers with their degrading comments and gossiping towards people who aren't like them (like seriously one guy complained because this woman eas taking off from work weeks at a time....for chemotherapy. Who bitches about that). It's all so toxic I constantly feel like I am still in high school despite being around people close or in their 30s. 

I'm just tired of it all and this will be my last time on here. I just wanted to say, to this sub in particular, thank you. I hope all you women have good, blessed, and happy lives in the new year. 

My 30th is in a week so if you want you can also wish me a happy 30th b-day. I honestly won't last that much longer.

Thank you
