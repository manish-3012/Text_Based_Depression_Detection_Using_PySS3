What hope is there for 300lb 27M with no job, no skills, no car, no savings and no self confidence?So yeah i fucked up. I went to school for music of all the fucking things. Now here i am 5 years later with mountains of debt and self loathing. Call me entitled all you want but i absolutely refuse to go work for mcdonalds or any more of the aweful soul sucking retail bullshit, id rather be dead. And honestly someone like me with thoughts like this is copletely useless to society and should be killed. Im so sure that life outside of this reality, outside of time is so much better, a dream world. Whatever its like, even if it isnt existence at all, must be better than what we do to ourselves here on earth. It is completely absurd to me that any of you want to live, and further why you would want all the useless broken peope to stay too. As if to fullfill some sadistic urge in your head that if you have to suffer by being alive so does everyone else. You all make me sick.

I dont expect any miracle answer, or any answers at all. There is no magic here, only suffering. I hope this will wake some of you up, stop replying in this subreddit, let these people including me kill myself, then there will be so many fewer peope to have to worry about and feed and to suck up resources. You only cause pain by convincing people to live.
