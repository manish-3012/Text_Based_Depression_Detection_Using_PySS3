I think I'm ready to goThis is not an act of cowardice. This is not the easy way out. Taking one's own life requires a lot of courage and pain, unbearable pain. There's no way of explaining in words what I live through daily, so I won't elaborate on that. I've been dead from the inside for 2 years now, I'm too tired of sitting alone in the corner of my room and crying for hours on end, just a shadow no one talks to, no one will ever care for, no one will ever be kind to.  I just want to make it clear that my depression and suicidal tendencies are not inherent,this is not an existential crisis, I haven't decided to commit suicide because I inexplicably feel empty or sad, it is forced upon me by years of mental torture by real situations and people, which is still ongoing,  this decision was made because I can't continue to live the way currently being imposed on me, it is too hurtful, it would be for anyone, this is not due to some unexplained depression or mental health issue. Why I am making this distinction is very important, to me atleast, it just means that several people are naturally depressed or suicidal, their mind is their own worst enemy, while others are forced to kill themselves because of real life situations which make life too difficult. Unlike the former, I could have gone on with my life without never thinking of suicide, if I had a normal or an average or even a bad life and much of that bad life stems from cruelty by others. So this is my final cry (not for myself, I'm too far gone for that), just be kind to others, please be kind to people, this is my last request to anyone who reads this, just be kind, (even if you are a cruel person inherently, be kind to someone, if only just once a day), you never know who's life you'd be saving or making it better by even a tiny kind gesture. Even if one person reads this and becomes a bit more kinder, my first and last post on reddit wouldn't go to waste. Goodbye everyone. Be kind. Be kind. Be kind.
