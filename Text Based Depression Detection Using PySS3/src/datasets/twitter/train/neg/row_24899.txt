Nobody gives a crap about me.Iâ€™ve lost all my friends over the past year. Got dumped by me gf last year. Nobody checks up on me. Girls donâ€™t even wanna talk to me. Iâ€™m so lonely. I donâ€™t think I can take it much longer. Iâ€™m tired of praying. I donâ€™t believe in god anymore. Every time I pray it brings nothing. Everyday that passes makes me realize how worthless my life is. I just donâ€™t know what to do anymore.
