I'm doneI don't understand anymore. I've been struggling with depression for the longest fucking time. I talked to lots and lots of people. After a year of taking people's advice, to help me find a relationship. They told me to groom myself, and I did. They told me to get in shape, I fucking did that, running 8 miles everyday, benching 200. They told me to get a good job, and I fucking did that. I've taken every single persons advice and I'm still fucking single, I guess it's just me, so you know what I gotta do. I don't know what to do anymore, I don't know what girls want. Fuck this shit man. I give up. I did everything right. I'm done.
