Just one reason.Well...this is the first time I've posted here and I can't even be bothered to use a throwaway. So...I've been, I don't even want to say it...depressed, for around five-ish years now. Just recently, I've picked up self-harm, maybe a month or two ago. They've started getting deep, and some have gotten as long as three inches. And...yeah. I've been considering suicide for as long as I can remember. While I have a few friends I associate with...I'm utterly alone. I've lost everyone I could confide in, and I feel as if I could disappear and no one would notice, not even my family, where I live. And in all honesty, I feel the day coming where I will at least attempt...and it's coming soon. I don't know where else to turn. I don't even need a reason to do it anymore. I need a reason not to.

EDIT: I just want to thank the amazing people on this subreddit for their kindness. It's good to know that there actually are some good people out there.
