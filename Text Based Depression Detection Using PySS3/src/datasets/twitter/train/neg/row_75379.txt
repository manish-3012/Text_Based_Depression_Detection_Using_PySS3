My feelings, and trust your gut (meta)I suppose I should introduce myself. I'm /u/mercurial_illusion and I've been through and helped people with a couple of life shattering suicides in the past year. The one that has affected me the most was my father back in September. I look back at these and wonder if there was something I missed or if there was something I could have done and the answer in reality, as hard as it is to accept is "Not really". Sure there were hints (there almost always are) but those hints come from people who aren't struggling with these problems as well. The only reason I've made it through is the old adage "Fake it 'till you make it" and I've been faking it hardcore. I'm not okay but I will be one day.

I've had a few friends that have done things that make me worry about them. I've finally gathered the courage to talk to them and most have talked me down (which I'm not opposed to) but one has hit me up saying he talked to the suicide hotline and thanked me for my involvement. 1 out of 6. That's below the Mendoza line (baseball reference, if you don't get it it's not important) but even if it were 1/1000 I'd be happy.

I guess my message is if you know somebody who you think is having problems then talk to them. The worst that can happen is they tell you they're fine but they WILL know you care about them. Help is so easy to give because all it takes is time and if you're not equipped there are plenty of people are are that are just a phone call away. We all lose hope from time to time but we can all help even if it's just letting somebody know we care. That fact alone is enough to change the course of somebody's life and it takes nothing. 

I guess this is enough rambling from an arthritic old man. I guess my point is that you can help and anything you can do, no matter how insignificant it feels to you, can be the difference between a drastic choice and giving something a shot. Never give up.
