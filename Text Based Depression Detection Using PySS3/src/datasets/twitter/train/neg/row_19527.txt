Im scaredIm scared of living. 

Way more than i am of dying. Life terrifies me. Its too much emotions and feelings and i just feel to much. I feel like i cant take it. Like my heart literally cannot cope with another thing breaking it. 

Im dissapointed in myself, cause at 21 i always thought i would be a completely different person than i actually am. And yes im young, but i have lost the hope for life already - there is no getting that back. 

I really hope i find it in me to end this sometime soon. I really hope so. I dont ser life bringing me anything but misery, and i cant take any more. Im torn apart, and ive let everything that has happened to me affect my life to the fullest. No job - no education - no friends - isolated from family. 

I need to end this somehow - but how? How can i get out easier than i think?
