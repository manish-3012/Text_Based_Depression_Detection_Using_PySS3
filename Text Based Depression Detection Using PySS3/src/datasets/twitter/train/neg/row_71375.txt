Not Urgent.I think about killing myself almost daily. Sometimes when I'm not even upset about anything. But, when I am upset, these thoughts are uncontrollable. I've cut myself many times, almost wreaked my car and once drank down NyQuil just so I could sleep. 

I've tried very hard to live a normal, happy life. I'm pretty popular, I have many close friends and I'm involved in greek life and other school groups. I keep good grades and I'm involved in a lot of different hobbies. In fact, most people are shocked if they do find out I'm depressed. 

I don't feel comfortable going to a doctor. Not to mention, I refuse to let my family know about my depression. 

Is there any small things I can do to help?
