I'm still here. And I'm back to recommend Zoloft + Clonazepam and help others* Last year I was beyond the brink. 
* Family ended up taking me psychiatrist.
* I got prescribed Zoloft and Clonazepam.


... 3 months later ...

* Happy and loving myself 
* Enjoying work
* Close to getting my first girlfriend
* I'm more social and realize I do have good friends

I still don't like reading and typing but I plan on sticking around here to offer help to you wonderful people
