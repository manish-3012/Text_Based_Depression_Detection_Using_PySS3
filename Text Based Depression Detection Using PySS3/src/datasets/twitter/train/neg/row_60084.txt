Can I save myself?Why canâ€™t I be in between. Why does everything have to be too much.

I just canâ€™t be happy, I am euphoric 
I just canâ€™t be sad, I am depressed
I just canâ€™t love, I love too much
I just canâ€™t dislike, I will hate
Be sad, because I am sad
I am hurt, you need to be hurt too

My body and my mind suffer, they are suffering now. I am overwhelmed and I donâ€™t know how to handle that. 


I still remember the day my life took a turn, I met him. I decided to be who I was, to embrace this mess. But I still hate him a lot and love him in a way where words canâ€™t comprehend how I feel.

I canâ€™t get into this cycle of being alone again, my heart hurts so much. In fact, today all parts of my body hurt. 

I wish I could do something, somehow tell my head it is ok. But I canâ€™t seem to fathom how. 


Note -I had a massive trigger just a while back... (happen to depersonalise)... 
With the world looking so unreal, I made this mistake of trying to cook and ended up burning myself, the food and creating an ugly mess in the kitchen.
