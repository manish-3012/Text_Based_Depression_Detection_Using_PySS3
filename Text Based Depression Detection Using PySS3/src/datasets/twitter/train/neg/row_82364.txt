I'm tired of being suicidal and so is everyone in my lifeIt's just never ending. Even when everything is okay, I still feel like killing myself. I'm tired. And my best friend is tired of it, I can tell. I asked him to come over tonight because I was afraid I'd actually do it, and he's too tired. My husband stayed home with me instead of going out, which means he's going to resent me even more than he already does. And he's no good when I get like this. He doesn't know what to do. I'm just weary. I feel like the kindest thing to do would be to get it over with so everyone else can go on with their lives. Sure, they'd be sad, but they'd get over it eventually. I worry about how my kids would take it, they're the only reason I haven't already done it, but do they really need a crazy, suicidal mother? I'm bipolar type 2, I have Asperger's, I have chronic pain, and I'm just tired of fighting. I'm ready to go. I used to be scared when I got like this, but this time I'm not.
