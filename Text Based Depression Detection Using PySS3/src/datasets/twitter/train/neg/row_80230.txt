I hate Social Anxiety...I cannot bear myself when im around even one random person. Every moment i just wanna be vaporized.. The anxious feelings inside me make me sick haha... Why am I like this why can't be just others  maybe there's no treatment for this  
Anyone who's having social anxiety...? If yes, how can i deal with this...
