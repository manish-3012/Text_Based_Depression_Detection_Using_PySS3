Fuck love, and everything else.I don't know if this fits here but.


I have been talking with this one girl for months, we were hitting it off pretty well everything. 
But then.. it all goes to shit.

(Note: I have a mild disability and I'm really insecure about it. This is important for this story to make sense)

But to the point where it gets fucked up.
Yesterday I got off school when I see this girl walking holding hands with my schools "player"

And I heard he told the girl some made up shit about me..
This shit fucked me up really bad.

Im fucking ready to just OD shit.
This shit is the last fucking trigger.

Fuck everyone, fuck everything, fuck this world, fuck this universe. 

But regardless any support is appreciated.
