Tomorrow night I shall no longer exist.I have everything planned out and now I'm just waiting for the right time to do it. It's not going to be a pretty sight and I'm afraid of what I'll leave behind for my family but I've made my decision. No longer do I wish to go on and tomorrow I find peace in a world where I never could.
