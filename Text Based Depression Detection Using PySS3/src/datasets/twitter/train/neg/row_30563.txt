this is how my family is and has always beeniâ€™m so close to my breaking point its not even funny. iâ€™ve been pretty much isolated from anyone other than my family and store employees for the past 8 months. my nephew is staying with us because his mom obviously doesnâ€™t want him. the thing is, he has extremely bad and untreated behavioral issues and lies constantly. he messes things up, pees on the floor, pees in vents, etc, and my mom literally does the bare minimum whenever it happens because shes just so happy she finally has the â€œsonâ€ she wanted. but anyway she doesnâ€™t try to sit and talk to him, she lets him tell me about how i should kill myself, calling me all kinds of names and blaming things on me constantly and im so over it. ive expressed to her multiple times that i canâ€™t stay here with him and yet she doesnâ€™t want him to leave. im really close to either killing my fucking self or running away because i have no idea what to do, my mental health has been at an all time low for too long and all of this is just making things worse.
