Feeling inadequetteLife long depression sufferer and guilt from childhood abuse makes me really shy.

So when I finally get past wanting perfection and take a chance by submitting my work to the world it gets downvoted and given zero constructive criticism. 

It's the wrong way to look at it but it makes me feel like everyone is saying "go away kid your bothering me" and that my presence is a blight.

Why aren't talent-less people allowed to kill themselves?
