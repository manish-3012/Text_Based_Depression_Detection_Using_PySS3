iâ€™m a fucking cowardiâ€™m scared to swallow a bottle of pills, in case iâ€™m still alive. 

im scared to inhale carbon monoxide, in case iâ€™m still alive. 

im scared to jump of a high building, in case iâ€™m alive with broken bones.

im a fucking coward, does anyone else feel like they want to so desperately, but they canâ€™t ? 

religion also forbids this, ive been feeling this way ever since i was 7. 

life is meaningless and it wonâ€™t change with words, or just anything else, for those that canâ€™t commit suicide due to religion, well just have to live and persevere. 

i wish i did it when i was younger.
