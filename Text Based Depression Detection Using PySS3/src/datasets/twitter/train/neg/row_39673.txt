Today was my first therspy session in a few weeks where my therapist seemed really concerned about my suicidal ideation.I was telling her about how I feel like there's no real reason to do anything, so why do I even bother living, and she squints at me and says "so how IS your suicidal ideation lately?" I started to panic internally that I might be institutionalized.
