Does anyone know an international suicide prevention lifeline that is available to text?I live in an southeast Asian country, so suicide prevention lines are hard to reach- and even so Iâ€™m not comfortable with having to talk on the phone. Iâ€™ve tried to text my countryâ€™s lifeline, but they donâ€™t respond. Is there any international lifeline that can text?
