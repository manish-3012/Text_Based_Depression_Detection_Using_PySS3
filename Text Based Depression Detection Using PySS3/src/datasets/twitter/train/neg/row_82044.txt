Should I be worried?I've been thinking of suicide on and off for the last few years, and the closest I came to killing myself was hanging myself on a door knob before backing out because of the pain. I'm guessing I don't really want to kill myself because I stopped myself but I don't know if I should find help. I've heard that occasional suicidal thoughts are normal.
