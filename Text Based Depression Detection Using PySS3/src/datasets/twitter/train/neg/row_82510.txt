Nowhere else to turnI just want to start out by saying that I'm sorry if this sounds ridiculous and if it sounds like I'm being whiny and over dramatic , but I'm hurting right now and really need to let it out. 
53 days ago, my boyfriend moved across the country to be with me. We thought we had a job and a place to live lined up and my mom was going to let us use her car until we could get one, but the job didn't end up happening. So we stayed with my mother. My mom is great, but she lives about an hour from anything, so it's difficult to get everyone to and from work. My boyfriend got a job, so we ended up staying with my grandma who lived down the street from his new job. Now, one thing my grandma is great at is making me feel like the worst person ever. Like when I was about 3 or 4, I had my first eye surgery and she came to visit and I had asked her to go home to which she replied, "that really hurt my feelings! You're being so rude!". Made me cry and made my eye hurt. Anyway, so today we got into an argument before she took my boyfriend to work. Not as bad as the arguments we used to have, but still. So my mom said we could stay with her again, but that would be a burden on her because we only have one car. My boyfriend and I are working on getting a car  so hopefully that won't be the problem soon. I'm just stressed out because we barely have enough money to get by if we move out since my doctor said I can't work right now and he barely makes enough money for the both of us. I feel like I'm the biggest burden in the world at this point. My mom and my boyfriend are seriously the sweetest people ever and I'm glad they're there to help me, but I just feel so worthless and down at this point. I don't know when I'll be able to work again and it's driving me insane. I'm trying to keep it together right now, and I know there are people with way worse problems that mine, but I just feel like everyone would feel a lot better without me around.
