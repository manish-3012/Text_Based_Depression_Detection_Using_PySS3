In-laws making me suicidalRelated to marriage but also life in general:
I'm done with life. I dont want to live anymore. I have been contemplating ending it all but I'm too scared to do anything like that. My husband does not listen to anything I say. He only listens to his parents who want nothing but money. I come from a conservative family where divorce absolutely cannot happen. Covid has also made other parts of my life messed up. My exams are delayed bc if it so I'm in limbo where I cant work or study . My life sucks. Its come to point where I'm praying for his parents to die off so all my problems would magically end. Either that or I end my life. I'm so done with this life I cant take it.
