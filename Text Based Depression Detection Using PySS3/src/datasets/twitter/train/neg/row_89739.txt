I just want to write it out of my headI just feel like a total shit. I'm 18 and i just have no fucking reason to live honestly. I have a few friends but i just feel lonely even when we hung out and i just feel like an asshole. In my school im like a ghost if i dont go in some classes the class and my teachers dont even realize that i was not there.
i tried my best to fit in somehow but it didnt work
i never really had a girlfriend and when i fall in love i usually getting rejected or the girl choose someone over me. Most of the times i feel like they dont even think im a human.
Im planning to kill myself on my 20th birthday if this goes on. I feel like im just falling down to an endless void and im starting to get bored to get out of there the hard way, i just had enough at home, in my elementary school and my current school. 
I hope i will find some reason to live for before my birthday.

No need to comment to my post, i just wanted to get it all out from my head, to tell someone how i feel.
THANKS for reading this.
