fears about deathwhen people ask me what has stopped me from dying this time there is only one answer: what if it doesn't work and people know? what if i get fired from my job for not turning up to a shift? what if i miss something important at university that makes me fail in the end? what if my friends and family start treating me differently for my decisions? what if everything that i've tried to build up goes away because i fail in taking my own life? im so scared of the outcome, but im so desperate to end it
