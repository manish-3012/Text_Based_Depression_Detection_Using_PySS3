Shit sucksGot sexually assaulted by a classmate days ago, and my bodyâ€™s been struggling to keep me afloat physically (lingering affects of childhood anorexia &amp; past overdoses). My professors refuse to be accommodating with my situation &amp; i honestly feel like shit. Iâ€™ve done nothing productive in the past few days other than rewatch bojack horseman &amp; make myself feel worse. When i was in high school i had problems with drug abuse &amp; the only reason why iâ€™m still alive is because an ex friend called for an ambulance when i passed out from an od at 16. Theres no point to this post other than i just need to yell into the void.
