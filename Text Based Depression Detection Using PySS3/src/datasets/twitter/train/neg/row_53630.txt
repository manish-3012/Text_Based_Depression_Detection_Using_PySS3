Why doesn't God just kill meI'm tired of waking up in the morning depressed and dealing with the same bullshit everyday. I'm tired of praying to God with no answer back. I'm tired if going to college everyday feeling like I don't belokng there( which I dont). I'm tired up crying myself to sleeping every single night. I'm just tired of living. What's the point? I mean we're going to die anyways. Why not just make it happen earlier.
