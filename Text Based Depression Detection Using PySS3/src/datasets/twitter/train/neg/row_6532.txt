I decided not to jump earlier, and i regret it.For some background information, I am a 16 year old girl who has been serverely bullied all my life, it has been at it's worst for last two years. My life is extremely stressful (I'm doing a levels) and I'm struggling to cope with that on top of being extremely lonely because of having no friends, and getting no support off people. When I have found people I trust enough to tell about what's going on, they just avoid discussing my mental health, some of which haven't messaged me since (two + months ago) I decided I was going to jump off a bridge as soon as I could leave school earlier today, but I decided not to, but since I got home my sister has been being really nasty and made me break down into tears in my kitchen. I can't even leave because she's in the room next door and I don't want her to see. It's actually heartbreaking that I feel like this because it's like no one gives a shit about what's going on in my head and no one takes me seriously
