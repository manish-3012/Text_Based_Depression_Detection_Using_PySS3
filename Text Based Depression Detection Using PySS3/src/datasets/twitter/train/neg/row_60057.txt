I live a life many want, but I canâ€™t help myself anymoreI have been browsing this reddit for a while. I just want many of you that are upset with what you have in life to realize that the things you think are missing, ultimately does not lead to happiness. 

I unfortunately canâ€™t say who I am.. but I would say a lot of ppl would kill to have my job. A lot of people drive themselves crazy for a bigger social media presence as well. I try my best to bite my tongue because it really is a toxic environment.

But i hate it. Iâ€™ve never felt so empty and reckless in my life. Iâ€™ve attempted suicide before and unfortunately failed. Had to live with the repercussions for a while and the embarrassment with everyone knowing. 

I hate when people say things like .. â€œwhat about the people around you? Theyâ€™ll be sadâ€. What nobody seems to realize is Iâ€™M the person struggling to wake up every single day. Constant thoughts of methods I can partake to make my next attempt my final one. 

I feel alone. I feel like a bother. And I quite simply just donâ€™t want to be here anymore. Why is it illegal to do so if itâ€™s my own life? 

Yes, I know people will be sad but itâ€™s temporary for them. I am struggling with this for tormenting years and just want it to stop. I would give up everything I have just to reset. 

I just donâ€™t want to be here anymore. I donâ€™t know what to do. Iâ€™m sorry if this was annoying to read. I would trade my life easily if I could. I hate myself and I want to puke every single time someone mentions my fame or income.
