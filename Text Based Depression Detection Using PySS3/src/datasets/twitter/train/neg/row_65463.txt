Almost killed myself at 4 a.m. Have been up all night due to itI had my head in the noose I made out of my belt. I let myself drop and could feel the pressure, and started fading out. Something overcame me and I managed to get out of it, almost passed out right as I came out of the belt. I almost succeeded, idk what made me stand up, I didnt even know that I did it. Afterwards I drove around for an hour trying to calm down and not do it again. Now I've been up all night and have classes in 2 hours. Fuckin hell
