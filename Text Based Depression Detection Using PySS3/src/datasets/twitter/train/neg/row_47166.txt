Can't control my emotionsRecently single. Partner [24 F] left me [26 M]. We fell apart after deciding to have an abortion. we're from a west coast Canadian city. 

I've been heavily drinking this last week and have missed a lot of school. I can't stop crying and feel rather silly and don't know how to open up to my family. 

Every time I get overly suicidal, I decide to write it down in a journal to try and expel my negative thoughts. I've struggled with depression and abandonment issues since childhood. I've been making progress these last few months, but this break up has sent me spiraling down. 

Looking for encouragement or advice for moving forward, anything really.
