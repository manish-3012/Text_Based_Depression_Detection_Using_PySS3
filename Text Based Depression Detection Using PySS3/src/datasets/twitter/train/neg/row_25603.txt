Help: I'm currently in Lima, PerÃº for holiday, and a fellow female traveller started insulting and threatening me out of the blue, just just like when I was bullied for years. I had a fit of rage, and feel like I'm entering a very serious depressive episode after years of being relatively well.Before you folks bash me, I did not lay a finger on her as for the life of me I'd never lay a finger on a lady, but I did explicitly and publicly say that she's a massive piece of shit, among other platitudes, after she started saying - literally out of the blue - everything that she saw wrong in me, that I'm a lunatic and that she can see that I'm mentally ill (she apparently overheard me speak to a friend about my depression and anxiety medications). 

Then I asked one of the owners about what's wrong with her while she was in the toilet, she overheard me, and threatened to punch me in the face. Then she kept on insulting. What the fuck.

So that's when I saw red, lost my shit, and told her that her father took her son away from her for a reason (Peruvian child protection gave the father her son's custody as she's insane) and that she's a massive piece of human garbage.

This woman is a butch from Uruguay who can't stop praising herself and who constantly tries to belittle others. I have one more night left in this hostel and I'm considering leaving regardless due to the heavy vibe that was created, but I'm also friends with both owners, so I'd be really sad to leave. They helped calmed me down as well.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. What she did was remind me of all the years of bullying that I went through throughout my life, and I can't get myself to completely calm down. My first thoughts now - and I'm embarrassed to say it - are to hang myself. There's a rope right outside my room.
