I'm empty.I'm empty. 

I always do worse when I'm here at university. I've come to accept that.

I just have no will to do anything at all anymore. It dissapeared suddenly and I don't know where it went. I don't want to go to sleep. I don't want to wake up, and do things. I don't want to exist anymore, and if it were less difficult for my empty, empty self right now, I would already have done something about it. 

It feels pointless. Living. Dying. Both are inconvenient. 

i just...I don't feel like putting in any effort into this life thing anymore. The only reason I'm still alive right now is because it's inconvenient not to be. Like, i cant put the effort in. i'm too tired, too empty to put effort into feeling anything even. 

I wish I understood why this was happening.

I think I hate myself. 

it would be nice if I didn't.
