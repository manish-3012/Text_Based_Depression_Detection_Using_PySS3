Taking my NCLEX in a few daysSo a few weeks ago I posted on this sub about how I was going to kill myself if I failed my exam. I was so frustrated and scared that my practice scores were subpar and that everything looked hopeless like it usually does. But since then, Iâ€™ve been studying like mad and I feel ready. I really do. Scores have improved and Iâ€™m just ready to get this thing over with. I really hope I pass and I can move forward with my life. 

But if I donâ€™t I still am afraid of what Iâ€™m going to do to myself. Iâ€™m trying not to focus on the negatives but thatâ€™s ironic because Iâ€™m posting on this sub again. If I donâ€™t pass then the job I have waiting for me is over and the money Iâ€™ve sunk into an apartment is lost. A lot of my classmates have passed already and I donâ€™t want to be left behind. Iâ€™ll feel like an absolutely failure who shouldnâ€™t have even tried nursing school in the first place. 

But I can take it again a few months later and try again. Apply for a job at a different hospital. Apartment search someplace else and try not and focus on the money Iâ€™ve already lost. Thereâ€™s other options then putting a gun in my mouth.

Truth be told I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m posting on here in the first place. Suicide came back to my mind when I shared my thoughts with a friend from school. That was a mistake and now sheâ€™s not talking to me anymore. Fucked that one up. Thought they wouldnâ€™t judge me and just hear me out. 

Idk. I guess that for whoever reads this, if youâ€™re in a dark place right now, if you work hard at trying to fix your situation (if thereâ€™s something you can do to change it) sometimes it feels better and thereâ€™s hope. Just be careful who you talk to.
