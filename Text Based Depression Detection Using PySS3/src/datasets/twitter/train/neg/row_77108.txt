not sure what to doI have no idea what to do anymore. I cannot focus on anything. I have dropped out of college twice and I am still living with my parents. I get angry at very little thiggs. All my friends have moved away and we don't keep on touch. A girl I would drive 3 hours to visit got tired of me and is now dating someone else. She blocked me on everything so I can't contact her. I spend most of my time sleeping and working. I have always thought about suicide. It's a nagging feeling every day. I don't know what to do and I'm afraid to hurt my parents even though I'm sure they're tired of me living with them.
