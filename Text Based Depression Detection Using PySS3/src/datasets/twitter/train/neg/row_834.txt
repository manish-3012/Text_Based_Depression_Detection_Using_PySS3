Cry for help (lengthy)My first post on Reddit; donâ€™t really use reddit that much but I might now. This post is basically asking for any advice I can get on curing depression and wanting to end my life. As a child I was happy and was happy until the beginning of High school, itâ€™s been a year since I graduated high school and it has only gotten worse through the years. I have only 1 friend that truly cares about me and the rest couldnâ€™t care less had I died, Iâ€™m poor, Iâ€™m ugly, Iâ€™ve never been wanted by women after elementary school, I like to think that Iâ€™m smart but deep down I know Iâ€™m below average in intelligence and like to play it off as laziness for not getting good grades in high school. I canâ€™t seem to keep a job, I feel anxious 24/7 and itâ€™s only getting worse. I donâ€™t know what my purpose is in life and I want to find out. I want to be a musician but I donâ€™t have a single ounce of talent in my bones for anything. I just want to somehow eternally sleep forever without actually committing suicide because of how much a pussy I am. Only thing that keeps me alive is the recently slain rapper XXXTentacion, X for short. Now idk if heâ€™s also despised in this area of the internet but his music gave me life especially the song â€œHeart Eaterâ€ if you were ever interested. I have a boring personality and just a dull person to be around with, with 0 charisma. I cry myself to sleep atleast twice a month wishing I donâ€™t wake up the next morning. I just want to end it all before I reach the age of 20 but Iâ€™m too scared. If youâ€™re still reading this; thank you and Iâ€™m sorry if you feel like this also. I wouldnâ€™t wish this pain on my worst enemy but itâ€™s the way it occurred in life.
