No one will ever want me.I don't want to get into all the details, but someone I was friends with for years and had strong feelings for asked me out on a date, then rejected me the next day.

He made me feel so wonderful... He held me. Kissed me. Made love to me. Told me I was beautiful. He was perfect. And now he's "not ready," he's "overwhelmed," he "doesn't want to hurt me..." I'm so fucking angry and hurt. If he wasn't ready, why did he lead me on? Why did he let me fall in love? 

Every time I've loved someone, they've thrown me away. I guess I shouldn't be surprised. But this... This is just beyond heartwrenching. He knew I loved him. And he broke my heart. I want to cry so badly. But I can't. I just can't. I'm so numb, so emotionally scarred.

I've lost hope in finding a life partner. I know I don't need one. But dammit it hurts knowing that no one wants to spend their life with me. This hurt is so overwhelming, all-consuming. I can't eat. I can't sleep. I'm nauseous all the time. I want to celebrate a year clean from self-harm, but I can't. I'm in too much pain to be in a celebratory mood. I'm in agony unlike anything I've ever experienced.

I do not want to hurt those around me. But I just can't take it. It hurts too much. The anxiety, the uncertainty, is all just too much. I wish I had marijuana, opiates, something to kill the pain, at least for a moment. Something to keep me from ending my existence...
