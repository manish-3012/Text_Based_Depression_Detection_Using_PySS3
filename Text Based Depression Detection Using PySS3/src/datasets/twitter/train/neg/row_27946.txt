How do I get my parents to understand?Iâ€™ve tried killing myself before and recently I slit my wrists. My parents just get mad at me and yell at me saying why am I doing this to them. Iâ€™ve tried to talk to them about it but they just change the topic, they try to ignore the fact that I am mentally unstable. I donâ€™t know what to do, I want to go to hospital as I canâ€™t keep myself safe, but I know my parents would say I donâ€™t need it (Iâ€™m under 18, so I canâ€™t go in myself)
