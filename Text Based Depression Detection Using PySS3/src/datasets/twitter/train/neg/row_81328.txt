Late FiancÃ© and Current Best Friend...............and me.my FiancÃ© passed one year and 1 yr and 7 months ago. My only rope to sanity and life is my Best Friend. 

Heâ€™s.... amazing. Heâ€™s so great


And He doesnâ€™t know how to talk to me

We donâ€™t talk. Weâ€™re roommates and i just want a conversation like we used to have.

i just want a full conversation but He just canâ€™t anymore.

i get it. im different. im not funnny. im not interesting. im not anything special.. im not fishing. im just not. i miss Him. i miss talking. i miss everything pre Ricardo leaving. I know itâ€™s bullshit but everything is different. Nothing matters and i donâ€™t matter. i just canâ€™t tell anyone else. Not even my Best Friend. i love Him but it isnâ€™t the same. And its because of me. im so fuckin sorry Dude. i just canâ€™t tell you without You saying itâ€™s okay.
