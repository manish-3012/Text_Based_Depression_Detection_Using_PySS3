I'm so tired"Fight and keep fighting"-content displaying derivations of this Idea has been always a common part of Internet. Yet, no one talks about how hard it is to do that. it's easy to say how you can "build yourself up from ruin" but no one talks about the process, the path to reconstruction.


Every new day has become a new battle. I try so hard to fight and stand but it's so useless. Every day I try to build myself up again but every day there's a new shock, a new pain to ruin me. it's becoming so hard to build myself up. I've already lost every shred of my own identity, I'm nothing but a skeleton wearing my previous self as a costume.


I've started to feel like I just can't do this anymore. Again and again and again and again I am being broken. I am getting tired, so tired. I've lost the ability to smile.I can only cry and cry.

 i'm so tired. I just want to rest for once.
