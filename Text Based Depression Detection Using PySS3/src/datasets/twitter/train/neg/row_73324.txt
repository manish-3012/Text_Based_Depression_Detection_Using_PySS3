I was offered a new job todaySomeone offered me a new job today.

I don't know if I would take it. I don't know enough details yet. But all I can think about is the guilt that I might take it and not be around long enough to make me worth hiring.

I don't need it. I have a good job, for all that it matters. The me that thinks I should keep trying wants to give it a chance. The rest of me says "don't do it, you already have a plan"

Why do I do this? I'm not happy. I'm not doing anything to fix it. I don't want to be excited about a change when I'm just going to end up in the same place. I'm just going to disappoint myself. Am I going to live my whole life hoping it will get better, while I spend every day trying to destroy myself?

Maybe I'll take the job. It won't matter who I disappoint when I'm gone.

I don't want it. What good is a job and money if everyone just wants to take it from you? Or expects you to do something good with it? I would have been happy when I was poor if I didn't have to be alone. Now I'm not poor and my only goal is the end.

I just want to throw it all away. Give someone else a chance. Spend it all so that the people who don't care will leave me alone because I have nothing left. But I won't. Because without the good job and the nice house, I'm nothing. Less than nothing.

I'm sorry. Sorry for who I've been. For for who I can't be. Sorry for being entitled and lazy and so unhappy with everything. I don't deserve this and so many people that deserve better get nothing.

I don't know what I'm going to do anymore. I should get rid of all my crap so I don't leave a chore for someone else when I'm gone. But even that seems to be more effort than I can manage. A burden either way.
