Got a new job!it's a really boring factory job, but it is stable. Now I just have to get rid of the whole "I wish I was dead" tape that seems to be stuck on loop in my head.

Seriously, will NOTHING shut off that god damned tape?! Even when deep down I'm feeling much better, not hollow, not entirely empty, not actively wanting suicide. Yet that fucking thought just doesn't stop!

Sorry for venting. I needed to get it off my chest in a safe place. If I said this to anyone else they wouldn't get it.
