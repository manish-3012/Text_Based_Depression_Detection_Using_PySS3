My life is too hard and I'm sick of it.  No reward to look forward to, except death.F 49, professional, husband threatens to leave all teh time.  3 kids all under 13, 2 with special needs.  I work full time, try to keep my kids on track-- get their school work done, arrange for them to do sports, play with their friends, etc.  They love to complain, though.  Son refused to get our of bed for school this am.  He's 8.  Come home from work and my nanny, of all people, tells me my husband is going to be in Colorado all week, "to comfort an old friend who's feeling down."  Husband is unemployed.  Doesn't have the balls to tell me himself he's taking off for the week, leaving me with 100% of the childcare duties, my fulltime job, and a nanny who goes to court next week for her drunk driving charge.  Can anyone tell me what I have to look forward to?
