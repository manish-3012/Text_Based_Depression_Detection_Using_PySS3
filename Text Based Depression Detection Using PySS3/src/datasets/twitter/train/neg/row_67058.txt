I spend every day trying to build up the courage to kill myself.No friends, no family, no education, no car. I'm honestly surprised that I find the strength to walk to work and back week after week. I sleep as often and for as long as I can because it's the only escape I have. I feel like I'm already dead. This could easily be some kind of limbo. Nothing ever changes. Nobody cares. Nobody will ever save me. I just want it to be over.
