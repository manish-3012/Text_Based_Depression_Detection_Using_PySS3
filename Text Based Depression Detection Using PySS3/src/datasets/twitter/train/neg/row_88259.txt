I canâ€™t have the life I want and so I donâ€™t have a desire to livewell itâ€™s pretty straight forward

this post will probably be destroyed by randoms but whatever Iâ€™m an unpassing trans person and because of that I can never have the life I want (which is literally just to live a life where Iâ€™m not made fun of or given weird stares or judged on a daily basis). it is crushing to know that regardless of what I do I canâ€™t even â€œpassâ€, and getting surgeries to try and assist it are impossible for the far foreseeable future due to just no fucking money ever and living in poverty since being kicked out over this. I feel lost and empty and I donâ€™t see how transition even helped me because all I see is still my birth gender in the mirror and it crushes me daily.

is there any reason to keep living when Iâ€™ll always be a fucking hon freak? why should I bother trying when the only advice this fucking world ever gives is â€œfind new friendsâ€ or â€œignore them and be youâ€ like that doesnâ€™t fucking help when children look at you in fear and everyone men and women alike make comments and stare and treat you like shit. how is this a fair life? do you think I chose this shit? I just canâ€™t find a point to go on because I will die alone and I have nothing left to give this world so yeah 


thatâ€™s it I guess
