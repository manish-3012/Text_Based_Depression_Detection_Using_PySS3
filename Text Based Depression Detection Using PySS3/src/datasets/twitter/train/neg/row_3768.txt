I changed my mindNo two years ago I swallowed a fist-full of pills and sat there for a solid ten minutes. I changed my mind and called myself an ambulance. I felt like shit for stupid reasons, just the straw that broke the camels back. 

And they came for me and the paramedic was so rude, he yelled at me for doing something stupid. They made me okay later with activated charcoal and I have shit black for three days.

I changed my mind last minute, I didnt have enough pills to actually kill me. I was stupid.

Dont try it. You will change your mind. As soon as the end is near, you will see every single solution to every last problem. And you might not be as lucky as me. DO NOT DO IT.
