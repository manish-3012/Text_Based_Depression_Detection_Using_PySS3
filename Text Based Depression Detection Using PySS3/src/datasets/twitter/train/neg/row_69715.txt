Need helpI haven't been here for a while. I came just to ask you for advices.

My friend is in a very bad state of mind right now and I am worried for her. We are friends for a very long time and we went through a lot. She was always helping me when I was depressed and suicidal and it meant and still means a lot.

I got better in last few months, don't really want to die and I am looking forward to whats next to happen in my life. But the problem is that i still make suicidal jokes and depression statements and its very funny to me even if its sick. And when I try to help someone I often joke about it and they start following my jokes and I get scared for them but I dont know how to stop them when I was the one who started it.

Its like that with my friend. We were talking once about her depressed state and I understand her but I don't know how to help even if I've went through that same situation. Sometimes I try to start up conversation with some bad joke of mine or trash meme and its just dies so fast, it seems that she doesn't want to talk. And again I understand that, I've experienced that but I still want to help her and I don't know how.

If u have any advices, please type them down everything is appreciated.
