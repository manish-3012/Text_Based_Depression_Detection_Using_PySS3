Iâ€™m Going to Attempt Soon.Iâ€™m going to attempt again. I know I will. It may be once school starts up again. I donâ€™t know. All I know is that itâ€™s coming. Everything is getting worse and worse and worse. I hate struggling through everyday. Iâ€™m tired of knowing Iâ€™m going to kill myself, but not when. 

I can think of a million reasons to kill myself. I can think of a few to stay, but theyâ€™re really nothing in the grand scheme of things. I guess I know some will miss me, but do I care? I donâ€™t think so. I want to be selfish for once. Everyday I live is going against my own wishes &amp; giving more time to those I love. But it isnâ€™t enough to keep me around. It never will be. Iâ€™m tired of this isolating loneliness. Iâ€™m tired of making myself sick every time I think of the idea of living. Iâ€™m tired of hating myself, of hating everything that makes me ME. I hate everything about me. There are times where I just want to tear myself apart. I fantasize of blowing my head off, of splattering all the things I hate about myself against the wall. It calms me. 

I donâ€™t even want to speak anymore. I wish I could go mute. I hate the words that come out of my mouth. Iâ€™m so fucking stupid. I sound stupid. If I never talked again I would be happier. 

Waking up every morning throws me into a depression. I have no one to talk to. No one that cares enough to help. I just feel empty and tired. Life is tedious &amp; itâ€™s driving me crazy. Iâ€™m crazy. Iâ€™m never going to be able to live this way. Iâ€™ll never be normal. 

Iâ€™m thinking October. That seems like a good month. Iâ€™m not sure how Iâ€™ll pull it off, but Iâ€™m gonna fucking try. This time around I wont tell anyone. No one. Maybe a few goodbye messages after I do what needs to be done, but not till last minute. 

Iâ€™m sorry this is so long. I needed a place to voice my feelings tonight. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll sleep tonight, but goodnight, guys.
