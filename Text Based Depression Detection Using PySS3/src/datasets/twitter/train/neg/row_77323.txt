Depressed/Getting My Life off my Chest Rant/Thinking of SuicideHello my name is Miss PandaPotamus,

&amp;#x200B;

I don't really know where to start but I feel like I'm at the end, in some way I feel like 'checking out early' is the only route for me. I suppose it's selfish, but this is after years of being selfless; and nothing has come of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I mean nothing I mean. I'm just an aging woman, alone with her fantasies to keep me sane.

&amp;#x200B;

This post is just to get my 'life' off my chest, romantically, family, career.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Let me start off by, I'm 32 years 'young'.

&amp;#x200B;

Growing up wasn't easy, I grew up 200 miles either direction from 'civilization', one of those out in the boonies sort of towns. One gas-station, one restaurant, the rest was down to blue-collar work.

&amp;#x200B;

My father worked in the industry there, as well as my grandfather you could say that if you were born in the town, you'd end up working at the place too when you grew up. Unfortunately my father had an abusive childhood which lead him to have: Paranoid-Schizophrenia. He may have had it his whole life but wasn't 'triggered' until the 1980's during a STRIKE. My older sister, and a new baby on the way must've sent him over the edge, Dr's don't know back then no one even breathed or thought of mental-illness.

&amp;#x200B;

So I grew up, the daughter of the crazy man. Mental-illness back in those days was super hush hush. Nothing compared to now, people walk down the street and wear their illnesses like its a badge of honor. I don't understand it because of how I grew up I just know I am happy they aren't some families dirty little secret like my father was.

&amp;#x200B;

This meant I couldn't have friends. Not because I didn't WANT them or because my family didnt want me to have any just who would let their kid be friends with the crazy man of the town?

&amp;#x200B;

My closest friend other than my imagination was a girl who lived a few minutes out of town. It was my only 'normal' I had until her father blew his head off. She and her family moved. That was the last friend I had. (really I lack social skills to make them...friends...face to face)

&amp;#x200B;

Things were tough simply being that my father wasn't abusive in anyway; but my mother who totally did the house-wife thing back then was now dedicated to taking care of my father. The TV was my baby-sitter. I had my grandmother/grandfather but my grandmother favored and still favors  my well-to-do cousins (even though they never call or visit her yet I'm the one who brought her with me to the new house I just bought!!!). 

&amp;#x200B;

Before my grandfather passed he'd always tell me I was "I was going to be the most beautiful girl ever."

&amp;#x200B;

I'm still waiting for that to happen 3 decades later.

&amp;#x200B;

Things progressed with my fathers' illness, and SS/disability for a family of 4 went enough of a way to keep food on the table, the electric on and well since this was the middle of nowhere the house we lived in was one my grandfather made way back in the day. So growing up I had ALL the necessities and my family wasn't abusive like others have had to deal with.

&amp;#x200B;

My family would however fight frequently and you NEVER KNEW WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN, I remember I was in 3rd grade and my mother was brushing my hair for school, my father was pacing back and forth. She told him to STOP and SIT DOWN, he eventually JUMPED OUT the living room  window. He'd had a seizure, that's what the Dr's said. From there it went to him sneaking in my room at night and standing over me in the dark, calling me Satan/the Devil. To him sleeping with knives under his pillow until my graduation night.

&amp;#x200B;

The day of my graduation my father had made a cryptic phone-call to my mother who had come to pick me up from school. We got home and all the doors were locked, he'd shoved a chair against the door knob. I had to break into my own home, through the kitchen window only to crawl down over the sink onto the cement floor which was covered in blood. He'd slit his wrists and smeared the blood all over the floor.

&amp;#x200B;

For those that don't know..Blood is symbolic to majority of schizophrenics.

&amp;#x200B;

So off we go to the hospital, hours later for my graduation night I got to scrub my father's crusty blood off the floor. I don't do well in conversations returning to when I was younger, I never really had a child-hood. Like I said it all went to caring for my father in a small minded community, and I was constantly bullied.

&amp;#x200B;

I think I grew up with some fractured idea of what I should be physically,mentally and I've never recovered from that. I was picked on for anything I did, from my voice to my hair. I wanted to not exist since my grandfather passed, I only had him 6yrs, my personal cheer-leader who let me be a kid. Let me be ME was gone...after 6yrs. 

&amp;#x200B;

He let me dream, let me try my art: I used to love painting and drawing. I gave it  up eventually, my family was never interested in it, my mother never had the time and I remember vividly there was this art-gallery I'd been accepted into with my work on display, however my cousin had a spelling bee, one of many he'd done. My mother dropped me off at my art-gallery while she took herself and my grandmother to his spelling bee. I don't think they know how much that hurt.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway...Graduation day came and went. Years of not being able to sleep, a lack in myself and lack of interest from my family there I was: Graduated. No hopes, no dreams, no ideas for who or what I wanted to be when I got to this point: Everyone had laughed at anything I wanted to do. I'd say...I want to be a veterinarian and my family would laugh, my cousins with their non-crazy father who had a job and my aunt who worked, with their 3 bedroom/2 bath house could say they wanted to walk on the moon and my family would eat it up and tell them they could do/be anything!

&amp;#x200B;

Since I was NOTHING I just got hired on at the industry. Mindless blue-collar work. The pay was good of course you could 'die' any time of course they'd HAVE TO pay well (thanks unions). It let me do what young people my age couldnt: I could AFFORD to get my poverty stricken family things they never had: Good food, good clothes, vacations I'd never been on a vacation before!

&amp;#x200B;

We finally got..wait for it: THE INTERNET in my area and I think the internet has both saved my life and ruined it.

&amp;#x200B;

It started out with me going to self-esteem conventions mostly in LAS VEGAS, where I met another rather lonely girl/woman. There she introduced me to the social world of gaming: Second Life.

&amp;#x200B;

This is where it all went down the tubes, as someone who grew up with little to no people skills this was the best way to just get to KNOW someone. I worked so much and had no time that I could only manage to get on my computer and talk with perfect strangers before heading back to my boring life of work work work! (By this time I had made enough money to PRIVATELY have my father admitted to assisted living psychiatric facilities because I couldnt do it anymore nor my mother).

&amp;#x200B;

Talking to these internet people let me have...humor, they let me say things I could never say to my family, to my class-mates. 3-4 months in, I met this wonderful guy who was from Canada and we hit it off. I think for the first time I was in love, I know that sounds silly and stupid but I was. Not with pixels but to the voice/idea/thought/sight \*pictures\* of him when I came home, to someone who genuinely seemed to want to hear about my day, to know I was ok, to SPEND TIME WITH ME. I was living my fairy-tale I read about and watched romantic Princess Bride movies about.

&amp;#x200B;

He was my Wesley and I was his Buttercup and his EX and REALITY were Humperdink. 

&amp;#x200B;

You see he eventually, 6 months in asked me to come see him and a 21 yr old me said yes! I got everything set to go, but shady things had started happening because for those that dont know Second-Life. It's like a horrible SIM game with no regulations. It's a cesspit of Hell but once you're in its hard to get out.Anyway people have a tenancy to make ALTERNATE accounts, red-flags this guys EX was messaging me, telling me not to trust him (I'm sure it was him looking back) but LOVE CONQUERS ALL!

&amp;#x200B;

2,000 miles later August of 09 I was there in Canada, shacked up at some Best Western close to where he lived. I was excited I was going to MEET MY PRINCE CHARMING, my granfather was right I was the most beautiful girl ever, and I was going to make a family with this person. He ignored my phone-calls for 2 days, he answered on the third telling me: 

"I dont want to see you, go away, go back home" 

&amp;#x200B;

I'd taken 2 weeks off work, I cried for a day but couldnt stay in Canada another moment I wanted to come HOME but...how could I come home just so my family could laugh at my predicament?

&amp;#x200B;

I rented a car and just drove down the east coast, Canada to Florida, hit the I-10 and took it all the way back home. 

&amp;#x200B;

SL Guy did eventually contact me, he said he had aids. I don't know a decade later if I should believe him or not.

&amp;#x200B;

After him, I became extremely cynical and I just never said NO to a relationship because they'd all become a joke to me. Real life I can touch your hand relationships were a joke, any Secondlife relationships that followed were a joke, this was my life for nearly 7 years. I knew in some way none of these men loved me like they claimed, wanted to conquer heaven and earth to be with me.....That was a fantasy I HAD to let it go!

&amp;#x200B;

Then I bought a fancy house in a city, and took my family with me, I had HIGH SPEED internet, a new gaming PC I just got and was  introduced to H1Z1. I met a group of guys that were super cool, one I totally had a crush on. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward 2yrs later H1Z1 Crush and I hit it off. My heart let go of SL Guy and let me embrace this new one, the problem was I never knew why the other had left me, what was so horribly wrong with me? Was I ugly? Maybe I am, I know I'm not something to write home about. What was it about me that made me so unbeautiful to a dude that supposedly had aids?

&amp;#x200B;

Now here I was with H1Z1 Guy, he wasn't HOT by any means, totally a 6ft Leprechaun but I'm not superficial about ANYONE ELSE other than myself. So there I am working out, dieting, trying to find any way to physically be the most beautiful trophy girl-friend for this average Joe.

&amp;#x200B;

Then suddenly - I lost my amazing job. BOOM. DONE. GONE. 

&amp;#x200B;

H1Z1 Guy still lived at home, mommy and daddy paid for everything (I encouraged him to get a job despite his 'anxiety') but there were months that...I had only $0.99 in my account when I found a new job that paid 3/4 LESS than my previous job. This guy couldnt understand why I couldnt get a plane ticket to go see him, saving money was a struggle.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway...fast-forward 2yrs since saying YES to a new Internet LDR I'd finally saved enough money to go see him, and put some job applications in the city near him so we could try to make US a reality. Mind-you this guy he'd lied to me several times like ie. he was home playing video games but had told me he wasnt home he was at work, instead of just saying "hey just got home want to play with the guys for a bit xoxo love u" , he was very controlling, jealous, never opened up to me, but I BELIEVED I could make this work even though I cried myself to sleep for almost a year and half because of this guy.

&amp;#x200B;

I went to meet him, 900 miles and he's sitting there treating the waitress like garbage at the restaurant we went to. He'd GHOSTED me for 2 weeks prior (he'd found himself a new e-bitch who knows how long he'd been cheating) and he WOULD NOT put down his phone. It hurt so much seeing that, after he'd ghosted me, ignored every single phone call, every text, every email but there he was not paying me the time of day. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then the DOOZIE  came, we'd gone to the movies, he was trying to get in my panties but I stopped him. I couldn't get intimate with someone who'd treated me like that, there were Egyptians building pyramids in my coochie when he was touching my thigh. Just. He didn't respect me enough to even seem to give two shits I was there and then he looked me in the eyes as I was bawling my eyes out as he was telling me he didnt want to be with me-  he said:

"You're not even a real person to me."

&amp;#x200B;

That killed something inside me, I'm not sure what anymore. I know SL GUY took a chunk out of it when that happened 7yrs ago thats why it took me 7yrs to even try with H1Z1 GUY. Whatever was left was gone, in an instant. Not only had my 2yrs of struggle to make certain my family was set to come see this guy had been nothing to him, I was NOT A REAL PERSON.

&amp;#x200B;

It's been a year since then. I have met someone between then and now he is a younger guy and he's super into me but I dont believe a word. It's like he's me  when I was young and in love, full of life/vibrance/HOPE and I'm the shit-lords I gave my all to and I told him my past and this new guy is adamant I'm where he wants to try and throw his life away into.

&amp;#x200B;

What he doesn't know is: I want to kill myself.

&amp;#x200B;

I lay in bed at night since H1Z1 GUY and I want to die, I want to not wake up. I don't want to see the sun, I don't want to be me anymore. I've considered going to a shrink but lets face it thats $130-$200 a pop for an hour session to say everything that I have stated here, and maybe get a prescription of: Don't be psycho 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The feeling that I have wasted my life, career wise, love wise, everything is whats catching me; and it hurts. Loving in this society is so painful I can't be fucked to try anymore, this disposable upgrade-only society! I want this new guy to find himself a woman that can give him everything he wants/dreams supports him when he's down. Because I was her, 1yr ago but now I'm just this bitch that barely manages to deal with basic life-functions.

&amp;#x200B;

Being unqualified to diagnose but I really do feel and WebMD feels I am suffering from depression. 

&amp;#x200B;

I look in my mirror everyday and I hate who I see, I close my eyes in a quiet empty room and I hate the person I am left with: Myself.

&amp;#x200B;

As I said I think of killing myself constantly but I wont/cant because my aging mother who dedicated her life to taking care of my father and having nothing for herself. Depends on me. My grandmother who never worked a day in her life other than full-time house-wife (which is technically a job) also depends on me. My father depends on me.

&amp;#x200B;

So I can't die, at least not yet but I just lay in bed and dream of dying, I dream of it this fantasy world that when I die there is another life and that one will be better. But what if this is the only shot I have and its already half over?

&amp;#x200B;

I work in a new career field where life and death are a constant; and I know certainly my life isnt at all that hard in comparison to others however I'm not trying to win a 'My life was shittier than yours" contest. My life simply up to this point has been hard enough FOR ME and now I can't seem to shake that feeling of...this world is better off with one less waste of time/space as myself.

&amp;#x200B;

Oh well we'll see.....

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for reading Reddit just had to get my life off my chest.

&amp;#x200B;

Sincerely,

&amp;#x200B;
