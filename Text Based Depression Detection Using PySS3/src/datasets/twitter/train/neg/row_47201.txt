Might lose my job tomorrow.Im 18. 7th grade dropout. No friends. No future. All i had going for me was a measly job at walmart. I fucked up the other day. Some type of safety violation. Almost guranteed to be let go tomorrow. Idk if i can face it. Im crying my eyes out. I been losing weight, drinking water, eating healthier. Been working out. Was even looking into therapy a bit. Girl at work i have a crush on been thinking about maybe actually saying fuck it and trying to talk to her. Felt like ive been growing a little lately as a man. But without this job what am i? What value do i have. I have no one. No one. God im such a fuck up. Thinking about buying a rope, putting on some nice music to go out to. And hanging myself from one of the beams in the basement i live in. What is there to fight for? That girl could never understand me. Nothing but a disappointment to my family. I have a dog. Pretty shitty dog owner too. He deserves better. Way better. 

Idk if i can go anymore man. Just want to leave this here in case i fade into oblivion

Currently crying to this beautiful song if anyone wants to listen.
