I feel like I've lost all the reasons that kept me holding onI have a history of clinical depression that I've learned to manage pretty well. In 2010 I had a REALLY bad low and the only reasons I held on were my dog and my mom. My dog has since died (old age) and I've moved out of my mom's house and she does fine without me. After that I got back on track and was doing really wonderfully until about a month ago. I've just completely sunk and haven't been able to cope due to stress and other factors. I'm in a relationship that's usually great, but now I just feel alone in it. He can go out and have a great time when I'm at home completely falling apart, so I can't help but think he'd be better off without me. I don't have a lot of other friends, the ones I do have aren't very close. I always end up isolating myself because of this. I've fallen so behind with school because I've been so incredibly depressed this week and I have one more day to do a ludicrous amount of work. I don't think I really want to kill myself, but I just need a reason to hang on and for someone to listen to me, even if it's just reading this post. It hurts so badly to know how isolated I am and how I'll be like this for the rest of my life. I'm scared to go back on medication because I won't be able to afford healthcare when I lose my coverage soon. Things just really suck and I feel so alone. Is anyone out there?
