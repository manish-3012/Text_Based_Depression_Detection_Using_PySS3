Grey areaSo I feel like thereâ€™s a lot of grey areas with being suicidal. I overdosed a couple weeks ago, I was suicidal but I donâ€™t think my intention was to die. But I overdosed when I did want to die so itâ€™s like between a suicide attempt and not??? 

I donâ€™t know whether to count it? I wanted to die but I didnâ€™t overdose enough, it was small, I stopped myself from making it big. So it didnâ€™t matter. Does it even count??
