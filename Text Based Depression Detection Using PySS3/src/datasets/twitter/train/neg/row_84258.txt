.I'm tired of living and trying to act like I'm not suicidal. The only person who was keeping me alive has just left me as of two hours ago, she just hates herself and me and just left me so I don't know what happened, so I have no reason to live anymore. I have many ways to end it Should i do it or should I wait for something to kill me?
