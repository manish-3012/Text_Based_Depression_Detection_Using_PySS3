St pattys weekendTo keep this extremely short i had a relationship end several months ago and still am not over it. The last couple months ive had suicidal thoughts and have had these thoughts each time when all 3 of my relationships ended. Idk why but when a woman leaves me im destroyed for months on end. The one previous to this one took me 8 months to get over. I called in sick to work this week bc i just didnt want to deal with it. But the thoughts come in waves, some days im ok and go to the gym and eat right and then others i wanna stay in bed all day and avoid any obligations. I was supposed to take my first guitar lesson last night but blew it off bc i was like you wont keep up with it. I signed up for 2 classes for my bachelors degree and have already missed the first assignments, i paid 1200$ for it and could care less. Anyways, i set up a trip to go
To chicago for st pattys next week bc last year on st pattys it was our second time out together. I just domt want to have to see her out with the new guy and know that was me a year ago. So finally to my point...ive thought about trying to find some xanax up there and hope its laced with fentanyl and take a bunch my next to last day there so my body will be found soon. But i figure go out and get drunk then come back to the room and lay in bed and take them and drift off.
