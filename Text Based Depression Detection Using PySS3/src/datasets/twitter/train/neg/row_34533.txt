My last daysI don't plan on living past the weekend it'll just be too hard. My life is over my world is over. The person I love no longer loves me at all and I can't deal. I haven't been going to work and I've been trying to figure out ways to do it but I keep stopping myself in fear of death but he'll or high water before Monday I'm gonna do it no excuses even if I have to do it in an unpleasant way like jumping off a highway. I'm just tired and I can't cope
