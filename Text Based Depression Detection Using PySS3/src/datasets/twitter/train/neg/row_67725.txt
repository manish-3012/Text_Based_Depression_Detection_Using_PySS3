StrugglingHi all,

Iâ€™ve been struggling a lot recently. A lot of stress and anxiety, and Iâ€™ve been struggling to sleep properly. 

I havenâ€™t been able to sleep tonight. I guess my mind is just too busy. I hate that feeling. 

Anyway, Iâ€™ve been trying not to overdo it with the alcohol. Iâ€™ve been using fairly often recently to help with the anxiety and such, and it can help me sleep. 

I just had a bit to drink and itâ€™s hit me pretty hard. A bit harder than I was expecting. Itâ€™s not too bad, I just... I wish I didnâ€™t have to resort to these things to function properly. I took one of my Diazepam aswell. 

Iâ€™m not sure why Iâ€™m writing this. Itâ€™s possible Iâ€™ll forget that Iâ€™ve done so. 

The last time I got drunk, I ended up throwing up everything and feeling really sick. I ended up spending the night at my parents. I should be okay now though. Itâ€™s not that bad. Itâ€™s just... I donâ€™t know. 

I donâ€™t like not being able to sleep. I donâ€™t like the restlessness. 

Iâ€™ve had a lot of stressed lately. I donâ€™t like how alcohol has become a coping mechanism for me, but it has. Hopefully I will be able to get to sleep without the stomach pains and the vomiting that often results from my drinking. 

I donâ€™t know why sometimes it doesnâ€™t affect me much, but other times itâ€™s overwhelming. I really didnâ€™t have that much. Oh well...
