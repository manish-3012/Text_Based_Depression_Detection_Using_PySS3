Aging/lifeI wouldn't say im on suicide watch right now, but boy am i feeling down right now. I am currently 24, almost 25, and I dont even feel like it. From about the age of 20 or 21, I have already started to dread growing up, and I feel that my youth is already slipping away. Its like my brain cannot keep up with my body, and that its still stuck in the teen years. And another thing (hypothetically) , I could go to the moon and mars and back, or sit on my butt for the rest of my life. The end result is the same, lying on my death bed waiting to pass. Some of my thoughts lately have been "is it even worth it" "why work hard, it wont buy me any time"


this is just a summarization of what ive been thinking lately. Just looking for any thoughts from anyone.
