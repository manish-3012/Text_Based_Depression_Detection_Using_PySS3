I can't because people care about me, but I want to.For someone who can't develop and change their habits in 10+ years, I'm becoming extremely tired of trying and failing, even when I think I'm doing well. It's difficult to realize that I'm acting out of habit, being irrational out of habit, lying out of habit, trying to defend when I'm wrong out of habit. I try to defend when I'm wrong because when I'm wrong, it's also habitual. I can't stop and think, and I can't bring myself to stop procrastinating. There has been almost no change in terms of bullshit, repetitive argument cycles that start thanks to me. I don't realize they start until they're rolling. I can't stay on one subject when I'm arguing, I go in circles around and around until my head is spinning and I'm kneeling on the floor, crying.

What's the point of living if you're not progressing? I've tried progress and that hasn't worked. It's been about half of my lifetime since I've started trying. A lot of the times I just stumble earlier then I ever have, maybe I'm receding backwards. 

The only reason I'm still here is because I know I will ruin a few people if I go. I can't hurt others this much. I hurt them right now with my stupidity, but I just can't do something this malicious. But honestly, life is really lacking color and joy. It has it's good moments, when I'm with friends or when I'm not messing up. But at it's core, when I'm alone on a week day, there is absolutely nothing that I want anymore except out.

Funny how it works.
