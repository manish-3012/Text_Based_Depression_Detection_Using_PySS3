UpdateUpdate on my life

Sorry for the bad grammar Iâ€™m writing on my phone and I have tears in my eyes
Spiraling downwards 
That manipulative bitch that is my mother stopped giving me rides
So now when I have to go somewhere I have to go on foot
â€œ because all of the guys your age have the driving licenseâ€
â€œYou donâ€™t need the new generation phone (Wich I work withâ€ because your iPhone 6 works perfectly 
While let me change my xs to an 11 because I need it to play candy crushâ€

She takes away half of my salary because â€œshe grew me upâ€
And then she complains if I cannot reach the end of the month 
I think that if I die she will never notice 
You have to take out the trash and take upstairs all the luggages because I have to take my bag
Come and take everything from the shopping out of my car
But if you ask her a favor all heâ€™ll breaks loose

Iâ€™VE GREW YOU UP FOR 21 YEARS IM DOING EVERYTHING IN THE HOUSE YOU ARE NOT DOING ANYTHING YOU NEVER DID ANYTHING HELPFUL YOU ARE USELESS IN THIS HOUSE
