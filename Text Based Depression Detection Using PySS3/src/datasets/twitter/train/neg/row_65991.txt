HiYo. Stopped taking my meds because they make me emotionally numb and i wanted to feel something, even if that something is pain. I donâ€™t know if i want to die, but i certainly donâ€™t enjoy living.

I think my problem is: im scared to die. Who isnâ€™t, i know. But i havenâ€™t been exposed to loss yet. Im one of the lucky few who have made it to my 18th birthday while only losing a few distant relatives along the way. I donâ€™t know what real grief feels like. I think that, once someone who is close to me passes away, this barrier that sits between keeping up life or succumbing to my depression will kinda fade. Like ripping off a bandaid almost. Just gotta expose myself to death before i bring it upon myself, Yanno?

Anyways, im not sure where i stand with this. Im an ambitious girl; im young, i am good at a few things, im pretty good at socializingâ€”things that should keep me afloat. 

They donâ€™t, though. I have no passion to do the things people say im good at. Not even socializing. If i had the option to live in a cave my entire life (and be financially taken care of, ofc) i would do it in a heartbeat. Nothing makes me happy. Im going to school for writing (one of the things people say im good at) but i have absolutely no motivation to do it.  

So, hi. This is just a rant. Im tired of being tired.
