I don't see how it is possible for broken children to not become broken adults...
I've been lost in thought lately. 

As someone who never really had the chance to be "okay".  Do broken children always grow into broken adults? Everyone feels sad and wants to help abused children but man i feel like if the system fails you while you are a child you're pretty much screwed.

How does one function? I feel like im watching someone else try and solve an impossible math equation. Back and forth and back and forth. Love someone but hating them but loving them and they were loving too but they were horrible and some things are unforgivable but they don't remember it I would never do that as they burst into tears.

Almost feel like it would be easier had they been like the other one, pure evil 100% of the time. At least if something bad happens to them I don't care. I don't feel anything for that one. 


Is it suicide if you don't seek medical help for an infection after minor surgery? I mean to anyone in the family it is a tragic accident and doesn't leave the same feelings of why or what could I have done that blowing your brains out leaves.

I canceled my dr appt tonight and rescheduled for end of next week. I have the worst headache and have taken narcotic pain killers and gotten baked out of my fucking mind and still it is damned near blinding.

As someone who was raised on some fucked up version of Christianity mostly threats of hell and death. I'm wondering what thoughts are if that would count as suicide and eternal damnation. 

On the plus side I could end up not being sick and live happily ever after. Yay! I hate how the room spins if I close my eyes my eyes my heart races.
