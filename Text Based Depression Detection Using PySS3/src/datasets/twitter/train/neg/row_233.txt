I donâ€™t want to live anymoreI just want to die Iâ€™m so tired. I try hard and I try my best but I fail every time. Iâ€™m just too tired. Everyday another failure. Nothing ever works. Iâ€™ve never felt real love or happiness. I donâ€™t know what it feels like. I donâ€™t feel good ever and everyday I just keep trying still despite that and I get nothing from it. I donâ€™t see a way Iâ€™ll ever be ok if itâ€™s been like this for almost 8 years now. Iâ€™ll just wait till I get the courage to end it
