.i really donâ€™t know how iâ€™m gonna do this anymore. itâ€™s always something, i canâ€™t go a day without someone starting something with me. and most of the people that start these arguments are loved by the school so i have no one. even my small amount of friends donâ€™t have my back. they still talk to the people who treat me like shit everyday. i just wanna leave this place and even after school i donâ€™t think iâ€™ll be able to live because i have nothing i wanna do.
