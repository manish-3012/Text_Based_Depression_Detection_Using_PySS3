Autistic, trapped, and hopelessHey everyone. 
Iâ€™m 22 years old and ever since I was 9 my father has been sexually abusing me. He also verbally berates me and physically abuses me. Iâ€™ve never been able to get evidence of his crimes documented. My mother is so brainwashed she no longer protects me. I finally called the police because I was so sick of the abuse and now Iâ€™m afraid that I may have fucked up. I have no money and due to my autism and physical disabilityâ€™s I canâ€™t work. I feel stuck and for the first time in years I legitimately want to end my life. I see no way out. I was foolish to believe anyone would help me. 
I donâ€™t know what to do.
