Reasons for why I think it would be justified to kill myselfSo here are the reasons I want to be gone:

1. I am a 20 year old asocial creep who makes others awkward/uncomfortable when talking with them. I literally drove off all my old friends and they've even said I act 'weird' and 'alien'. I come off as a total creep at my workplace.

2. My whole bottom lip and chin is permanently numb due to a botched surgery on my lower jaw.

3. I went from being an attractive kid to an ugly freak. I am ugly from head to toe. I lack any muscle or manly features and have a very long fat ugly babyface with a terribly broken nose that offsets my whole face.

4. My dad passed away unexpectedly last year, the only one who truly understood me and my best friend (despite the emotional trauma he put me through my whole childhood)

5. I have suffered depression since 12-13 years old.

6. I am extremely lonely and have no motivation to make friends since I can't even connect with anyone anyways.

7. I am extremely depersonalized and lack any sense of ego, I simply feel like a meaningless organism that has no purpose.

8. My true personality is very childish and toxic, and my emotion is very sporadic and rollercoasters up and down throughout the day. I am always looking for acceptance from people.

9. I have screwed up all educational opportunities by dropping out of college 2 times and now I work part time in a grocery store. Basically I'm doomed.

Are there any reasons I SHOULD live? I feel like I'm at a dead. There are other private reasons that I have left out, but the list can go on.
