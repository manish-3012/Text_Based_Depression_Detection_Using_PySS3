I was going to wait but Iâ€™m not sure I can...Hi,

So Iâ€™m a 33 year old mum of 2 from the north of England. I had a pretty shitty few years and my abusive ex told me I would never amount to anything. So I went out and I did. I got the career, the money. Technically I have it all. But to do it I have to work away while my kids live at home with my other ex (none abusive). He cheated on me a couple of years ago and I tried to stay and make it work but I left in January and we stayed friends.

Iâ€™ve been asking to get back with him for months but he says he got over me. Doesnâ€™t love me. Heâ€™s the father of my children. He was always my biggest supporter.

Iâ€™ve been suicidal on an off for years. We were meant to be going as a family to Jamaica in October. The kids still think Iâ€™m going but I told him last night I canâ€™t handle it.

My plan was to give them the holiday and one last Christmas then kill myself in February.

Iâ€™ve been working so hard recently that I can leave them enough money to keep them comfortable.

I canâ€™t stay alive to watch them move on. He doesnâ€™t know it when I say that if he moves on with another woman it will be over my dead body that I mean it.

I canâ€™t do it. I canâ€™t watch it. Itâ€™s been 9 months and Iâ€™m not coping.

Anyway Iâ€™ve been trying to take it a day at a time and Iâ€™m done.

Iâ€™ve been trying to hang on to give the kids their holiday and their Christmas but Iâ€™m in so much pain it physically hurts.

I just want my family back. Iâ€™m the girl who seems to have everything but I have nothing. Iâ€™m so empty.

I just know my mum and the kids will be so upset but I canâ€™t go on like this. I donâ€™t want to be here. Nobody understands.
