I am kinda unhappy person. I always feeling unhappiness in my veins but 6 months ago... oh dat month... I've met my meaning of life. Love of my life. We have been together about 3 months and I feel happiness guys. I was the happiest and strongest person.. After that she left me..

&amp;#x200B;

Before her all I see is black but I can live with it. After her, black clouds came again and they seemed darker. My school life was going great but not anymore. I always focus on negative things, I am looking bottle's empty side. Anyways..

**WHAT I'VE DID FOR SURVIVING**

I did lots of thing for survive from this fucked up situation. I saw doctorsss, threapists, take lots of pills. People who suffering emotional breakdown can fix this by doing physical things such as Sex they say. I went to hookers and it didnt fix my emotions. My parents always asked me how i feel but thats it. They are angry because their son is fucked up. They are not helping. My friends asked me how I feel but they are not listening.

&amp;#x200B;

**WHAT NOW?**

I feel very lonely now. I dont care the people they are talking bullshit. I've lost my faith on God. I believe there is a God but God does not like me. God enjoys how I suffer. I am thinking suicide a lot but I always think my parents... (I cannot do that I guess.) I've lost my faith on future. There is no future for me.

You know what guys, last week I had lots of flashbacks to past and I didnt sleep about a week. These flashbacks are about great times my happy times and about her.

I cannot do it guys. I cannot live. I wish I am dead now and my parents are not sad for this. But there is no way for this wish. My feelings are hate,saddness and suicide. All I do is crying.

&amp;#x200B;

You guys probably dont give a single fuck but I am dying guys I am dying.. I am crying. I dont know what to do.

Thank you anyways..
