Called 911 after girlfriend threatened suicide. I feel terrible about it.Me and my girlfriend are both suicidal, and she's threatened before in the past. But this morning, I woke up to a call from her and--to keep it vague for discretion reasons--she was actively seeking means of suicide during the call, which is further than she's ever gone before. I called her back multiple times, she wouldn't speak much and hung up each time. I texted 911 and gave them all the details because I didn't know what else to do. 

She's at the hospital now, shes uninsured and I feel like I just made things worse. She's not allowed visitors because of the coronavirus. She'll never forgive me for this, and for the debt she'll have because of it. I almost certainly see it as the end of our relationship, and even if she does forgive me I don't know how I can move forward after this. She was my best friend, I loved her. 

I don't what to do. I feel awful.
