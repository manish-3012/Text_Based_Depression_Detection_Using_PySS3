random thoughtsMy friend saw my puffy eyes today and gave me a hug. I really appreciated  that. Bee dealing with so much friend issues ( snakes ) that I really should start isolating myself from everyone. Have you ever had friends that you've been tgt with so many years but just ended up stabbing you in your back. Gosh, I'm such a loser.
