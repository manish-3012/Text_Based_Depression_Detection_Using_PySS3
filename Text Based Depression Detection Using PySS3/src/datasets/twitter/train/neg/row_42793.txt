Planning to attempt suicide again.Is there any other way to end the pain? 
Thoughts of suicide are just dominating my mind now... I'm so tired of fighting every day. 
Someone told me if I really wanted to die, I would've made sure my attempt succeeded. And I realized I didn't do enough last time. 

I want to keep fighting but I really can't anymore. I can't fight these thoughts anymore. I don't know what to do anymore. 

I need help... Please...
