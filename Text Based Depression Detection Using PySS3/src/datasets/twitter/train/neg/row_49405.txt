anyway why bother with a title who caresThere's nothing useful I can say. I won't recount my Tragic Backstory here; it's too long and no one gives a fraction of a fuck anyway. I am just so tired. I've tried and failed an absurd amount of times. 

Perhaps quantum suicide is a real thing--the theory in quantum mechanics that supposes a sort of 'quantum immortality'--that, in short, if you were to hold a gun to your head and you know you have a 50% chance of it killing you when you pull the trigger and a 50% of it not, then when you pull the trigger the universe will split into two parallel universes: one in which you die, and one in which you survive. As you continue to pull the trigger, the splits continue to occur, but your consciousness, as the 'observer', will always follow to the parallel universe in which you survive. Well, only if the Copenhagen interpretation of qmech doesn't hold true (bc then, the wave function collapses). 

Sorry. I studied physics in college. Thought I'd be some bigshot astrophysicist. Someone invoked Murphy's Law on my life. Everything that could conceivably go wrong, has indeed done so. At this point I wouldn't even care if I got a job with NASA or ESA or CERN or some observatory or anything... I am crushed by my own loneliness and unbearable isolation from any meaningful, deep, or trusting relationship with a fellow human. Would it be too much to ask, to be loved? Apparently so. I am a lost cause. Not worth the effort. Nothing I do is good enough. Never good enough. 

I will die as I always feared: alone, in pain, and unloved.
