I'm constantly sad and feeling bad and no one around me cares.I try to tell them that I'm not doing good but they don't take it seriously. I don't know, I don't even have much more energy to write more but it's basically this, I'm felling worse and worse everyday and I got no one to help me. I just think there is only one way, it really is a solution  but I don't know I just want to disappear without no one noticing although suicide would get more attention
But guess what, they can finally pay for what they did to me, feel my pain.
