Nothing leftI give up. I can't make my girlfriend happy anymore. I can't stay on top of things at work. I can't find any reason to keep going. Things aren't getting any better. I've tried so many different kinds of medications but nothing works. I just want to drink and take a handful of pain meds and not wake up tomorrow. There is nothing left to live for. I don't feel like trying anymore. I give up. I just want to fall asleep and not wake up. I hate to put my family through that but I'm 26 and have never really learned how to live life. I feel so behind on everything--learning how to be independent, be responsible, take care of myself. I just don't see much point in going on if I can't make sense of anything. I just want to die.
