Confession - I have destructive tendenciesI am depressed for many years and I feel like I should destroy myself completely, or I 'll end hurting everyone around me. It's like I never get a thing done right, I'm always getting in the same circle of bad circumstances. I practiced self harm 10 years, in the high school I used to get drunk every day because I used to think that I'll die earlier, I ran away from home because my abusive father, and years later mom died and I had to let the house, without any belongings. I can't be happy without being afraid that I'm gonna pay for the simple feeling of happiness. I always get attached to people and I always end up disappointed, let down. It's like everyone decided to throw me away. I'm in the same boat with these suicidal thoughts for many years, I didn't had them in a while, last year I was getting better, started to communicate, started to take care of myself. Now, during the circumstances I feel trapped again, I feel the need to destroy myself and to die. I feel like most of my loved ones are being judgemental upon this battle of mine with depression, every little thing they do, it hurts me. I guard myself, I'm always overprotective, I isolate myself and I can't function properly. Part of me wishes to stay, but it's a bigger part of me that can't bare all these issues. I can't have a normal relationship without being belittled, and the last one I had, he told me that I'm crazy and creepy and that I feel way too much. He made me believe that maybe it's true, it's no way out of this. It's so easy for someone to hurt me, it's like I'm not even a person anymore.
