froyostawberry or chocolate, the flavours mere tourists to my tastebuds. last thing i felt since the bulimia vomit that shot out my throat. an abyss expelling void. your brain only half human your demons lie through their teeth. teeth. my froyo covered teeth rot creating negative space. y'know my science teacher didnt believe negative space existed till i sat in her class my broken elongated presence eating at the happiness of others. happiness, my local froyo shop mascot is an elf, a happy elf that jumps from abyss to abyss drinking the blood from my mothers fresh veins leaving the heroin. the elf that guides the light- no the reflection of a razor to the shadow of my wrist. your demons squeezing my ribs reminding me how many calories ive eaten today. reminding me of the sleeping pills filling my lungs, the doctors injecting me with air. air from outer space, the air from the black hole we call social media. they look into the black hole laughing at me, my teeth fall away into my skin. i fast, i fast, i fast. in the end i choose strawberry it comes back up easier than vanilla.
