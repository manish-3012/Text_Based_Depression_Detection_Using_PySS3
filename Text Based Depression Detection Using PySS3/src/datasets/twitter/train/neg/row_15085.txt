When someone is your everything, and they leave, you have nothingHow do I get attached so fucking quickly? I don't get it. We were just friends. 4 months, 4 months of fun and confusion. It was a rollercoaster of emotion. And now its crashed into a ditch. And now i feel shattered, like ive been shot 10 times. I was at a really low point in my life before i met her. and she pulled me out.   


How did this begin? I messaged her 4 months ago, we started talking, and hungout a few times. We got so close so quickly. We called everyday for hours. And then the confusion and guilt starts. We decide to take a break indefinitely. It only lasts a day. We start talking again, for a week. Then we decide another break for 2 weeks. I only last a few days. The suicidal and insecure side of me messages her and asks "would you care if i died?" and she says of course. then she feels guilty for talking and says talking again would make her feel really guilty. From that point on i new this friendship or whatever the fuck you want to call it. Was doomed. I was right. This morning she asks if we could block eachother for a while. and now i'm here, in my bed trying to hold back tears. She was my everything. and now she's gone. And i hate myself, for letting myself think i should open up. That was what fucked everything. I swear to god i love her. But i don't know. I have never felt like this in my life. I feel torn and broken. One side of me knows its best for her. The other side is crying and wanting her back. I never wanted it to end. I kept a little bit of hope thinking it would work out. I would give anything to talk to her again. I need to let go. But i fucking can't. I hate myself for being like this. I haven't felt this low in years.  I'm gonna delete this in a day or 2 so she doesn't see this.
