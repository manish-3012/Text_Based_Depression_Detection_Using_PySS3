Is there a way to kill yourself from the world without actually killing yourself?I don't know where I should start, or if venting and getting these thoughts out is a good idea in general, but I guess I'll give it a shot. 

I don't know who I am anymore. I genuinely don't. I don't find joy in the things that not once, not twice, but have *always* have made a happier, outgoing girl. My friends, if I can even call them that, share stories with me, boast all over several networking platforms, so on, and at one point, admittedly I would be jealous. But I'm not. Things that once made me want to wake up, that feeling of staring at the clock for hours and hours, counting down for whatever purpose and/or activity I was excited for, or in general, over all hyperness. 

I don't find joy, or peace for that matter, in anything anymore. I can't sleep without suffering from horrendous night terrors. I can't shower without thoughts of drowning myself. In fact, I've only showered once in two weeks. I can't eat, I don't think I deserve too. There are literally thousands of women, **mothers with kids**, families, hard working men, and animals who starve on a daily basis, who actually need food, who actually fight for their life. I never have an appetite. I've all but dehydrated myself at this point. There are days where I'll go without drinking even a single glass of water, or anything else for that matter. All I do is sit in my room. I'm sleeping in 1-2 hour intervals a few times throughout the day. I sit in the same chair, doing the same thing, hurting more and more. I don't even take my medicine anymore, the idea of swallowing all of them is too tempting. 

I can't focus on anything around me, I can't think to save my life. My thoughts are completely scatterbrained most days, and my mind is foggy nearly all day, every day. I try to just "go with the flow." but even then, I find myself growing more distant and struggling just to grasp onto one small focal point in general. I find myself forgetting things easily, more often than I'd like. I find myself doing activities I don't even remember starting, most of the time it's something like getting into bed, changing clothes, and other small, measly tasks, but still, I'm usually doing it without realizing it. Sort of like I'm daydreaming while doing it. Its not a bad thing, I don't think, but it's still bothersome to me.

I don't know why I am that way that I am. I have a lot of problems with me, sure. But is that really a reason to feel such dark, depraved and intense thoughts to take my own life? To follow down a path of severe and violent self destruction...?

A little insight on that, I have an arachnoid cyst on my brain, that sits behind my right retina. I've had 9 brain surgeries, 9 operations in just a decade of my life that has already planned however long I have left. I'm young, I'm 22. And I can't even enjoy most activities that anyone else my age can. I can't jar my head, I can't over exert my body and pull at the shunt inside me, and I can't handle much damage to myself. So, I'll never get to enjoy roller coasters, concerts, amusements parks in general, or anything else pertaining to loud sounds and/or vibrations. Because of this health issue, I also can't control my bladder well, if at all, which has limited me to, yes, being fully diaper dependant all my life. I have a weight limit of what I can lift/carry, being 5-10 pounds. My vision is terrible, seeing as the cyst sits on my right retina as well, and the hearing in my right ear is awful. I can't drive, which also leads to feelings of insecurity, and lonliness. Just another thing I can't do.

I also have autism, aspergers, to be clear. I can't communicate or openly express my emotions in a timely, healthy manner. Sometimes at all. This post alone has taken about 2 1/2 hours to think out, and a lot of speech to text was involved. My thought process is slowed, drastically, and people often find frustration or irritation when having to repeat themselves to me, or explaining in a simpler way. I Google alot of words, and ask how to correctly use things in a sentence. 

I have a handful of people who I would say **might**, big key word there, care if I was to off myself. Sure, I get the same lecture every day, fine after time, "it gets better." "you'll find someone." "don't give up." but will I? Maybe one day it *will* get better, but in almost 23 years, (my birthday is less than a month away) I've not accomplished anything at all. And I don't think I will. I build unhealthy and unwanted attachments to people because all I do is sit and stare at my phone all day, and I become clingy, I respond too fast, usually just looking stupid because I can't properly communicate, and end up chasing people away. So I guess, is life really worth it? Can I *truly* disappear, without leaving behind the pain of my suicide to those "loved" ones? 

It's funny, by the way...they never, *never*, **never** care until I'm right on the edge of pulling the trigger. I don't want pity of empathy...

I want to sleep. Forever.
