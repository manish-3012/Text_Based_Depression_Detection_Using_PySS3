Chronic pain from my kyphoscoliosis is making me want to kill myselfHello I have issues with my spine, kyphoscoliosis and neck lordosis, I have constant pain in my arms and the from the stress I seem to have developed thyroid issues also, I have a myriad of other health issues also, so I am asking myself if there is little chance my health is going to get better and the only thing would be that I can numb myself with pills, then why live, I can't and won't live if I can't be healthy.
