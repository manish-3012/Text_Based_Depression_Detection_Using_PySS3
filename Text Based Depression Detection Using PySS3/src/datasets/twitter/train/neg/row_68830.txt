Self hatred is driving me insane*Vent*
I canâ€™t do it anymore, why canâ€™t I just give up on life? Iâ€™ll never have and never will be able to create a genuine relationship and its cuz I keep isolating myself from people and hate myself for it. Idk why I cant let people in but I just cant. Everytime I think of myself I just want to rip myself apart or wish I can just get a gun and be done with it. I dont have a reason to live i dont know how to experience that feeling to truly care for someone. I always wonder why I was born in the first place...I never asked to be born i just know this life isnt for me. Even if you knew me I wont even be worth your time cuz Im pretty quiet and uninteresting to most. Even my family would consider that.
