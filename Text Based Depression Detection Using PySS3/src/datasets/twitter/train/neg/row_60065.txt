im so depressed. cant stop thinking about dyingtried to kill myself on feb 20. my wife has temporary custody of the kids and i cant go to my house. im living at my moms apartment and it sucks. my wife doesnt want me back until i am better. she wont even tell me for certain if sheâ€™ll even take me back when or if i do. im paralyzed by fear. i really want to die. i keep looking at tall buildings or thinking about jumping off the bay bridge. i think when i refill my seroquel prescription im just going to take the whole bottle. i just dont think im going to get better.
