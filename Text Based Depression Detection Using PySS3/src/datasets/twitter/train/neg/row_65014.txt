There's no fucking point anymoreI'm so fucking done. I can't deal with this fucking feeling of knowing that my friends don't even want me around. And it doesn't fucking help that the devs of this stupid game they like only allow for 4 players in an online session and I'm ALWAYS the one who gets told "sorry we're full". I'm never the fucking choice to hang out with. No one ever wants me to be around. Im just a fucking tumor. Im a mistake. Im toxic and cant stop. Im a goddamn cancer and i need to be destroyed.

There's no hope for me anymore
