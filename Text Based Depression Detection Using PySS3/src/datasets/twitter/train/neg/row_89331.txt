Frightened of what people might thinkDo a lot of people recognize this? Somehow, although I know it's not true, all the time there is this part of my brain really trying to convince me people hate me, makes me almost obsessively relive embarrassing situations etc. It's always revolves around social situations and makes me dread leaving the house because, you know, suppose it's true that people hate me. I have a history of getting bullied a lot and my father was an aggressive alcoholic so a lot of my depression stems from people behaving badly and I still perceive them as threats. It doesn't help that I'm a schizoid. I'm at this stage that I'm not ready to kill myself but would like to just got to sleep and not wake up. I'm 40, things should really start to look better.
