Can't take anymoreI'm alone. 
I have no one.
This 'husband' I have despises me and thinks I just need to grow up and snap out of it.

I called a crisis line and they sent child services 
Now my 'husband' hates me more and is super pissed at me

Because I'm so depressed and sick of myself that I want to kill myself
But for my kids sake I call a crisis line and don't go through with it.
So they ruin my life by making him hate me more

I'm gonna do it.

Started by deleting history, pictures, everything online I can delete, every bit of me. Burning 25 years of journals filled with nothing but self hate.

Even therapists hate me.
I don't want to help myself.
No one can help me.

No one can tolerate me.

I can't be alone anymore.

I cut and cut and its never enough.
Nothing I do is ever enough. 

I have to make it stop.

Has to be a way out. Can't keep living as this person. I look in the mirror and I see a monster. She's a cunt and she deserves to be dead.

I don't know why I'm bothering here. I guess maybe part of me hopes someone is either nice or pushes me over the edge.
Sorry
