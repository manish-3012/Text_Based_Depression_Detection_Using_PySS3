Too Ugly For LoveThere are ugly people, and then there are people who canâ€™t lead a normal life because of their visage. I fall under the latter. Everything about me spells normal college student; I have friends, I do college things, I can carry conversations okay. But the difference is my face. I have bad skin post-acne, and this disgusting bump on my nose. The contours of my jaw lines are rather pudgy, so it makes matters worse. People canâ€™t look at me, or rather they love to stare at me when they assume I am not looking. Today this gregarious fellow I met couldnâ€™t stop starring at me beneath his fingers, and every time he realized I noticed him, he shook his head in disgust. People do this to me all the time. People always look away. The worst part is, I am really ugly, but not enough to be considered a freak or physically impaired, so people have to keep their repulsion to theirselves around me. 

This girl I was love with, I love to talk to. But if the lighting is bad (florescent, natural overcast day) she canâ€™t even face me. My relationships with people is entirely contigent on how well the lighting is for me.

This girl broke my heart, as have others before her. But I really liked this one, and there is nothing more heart-wrenching then to know that the obstacle between our relationshipâ€™s intimacy depends on something that is both out of our control, and something that could never be fixed. To know I can never spend the rest of my life with her, because of this face, not because of attitude change, makes me find no point in living the rest of this life under that realization.
