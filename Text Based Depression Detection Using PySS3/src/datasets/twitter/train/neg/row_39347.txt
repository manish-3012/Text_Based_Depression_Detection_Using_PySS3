Suicidal without a reason.I was in  4th grade when I first thought about suicide. 

In 9th grade I did a mental marathon of two cases, if I die what would be the lives of my family be like and if my whole family dies then how would I feel, I cried that whole night.

After that night I knew I would never do it but thought of doing it is/was always their. 
I have done mental marathons of how to cut every friend, family and then do it but being an Indian I know my parents will make me get married in few years, after that kids and my simulation breaks here, I'm 22 right now. 

I got into cutting myself when I was in 11th grade, had stop because scars raised many questions, then I switched to punching on walls broke some knucles,then to exercise, these days I'm into cold shower, it's the best way to reset my mind ( cold showers recommended for people who uses physical pain as a way to cut off the mind) 

Over the years I've realized a pattern of my suicidal thoughts, so I've been playing with them but Corona has changed everything, now my mind favouring suicide gives some good arguments. 

I'm never gonna go it, as my aware brain knows these thoughts will go away but sometimes I get worried what if they doesn't. 
I feel like I'm walking on tight rope... 

PS - I'm treating myself with cold showers and some breathing methods.
