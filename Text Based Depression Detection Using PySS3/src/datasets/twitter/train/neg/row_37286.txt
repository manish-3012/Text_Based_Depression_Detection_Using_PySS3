Iâ€™m a stupid, worthless piece of shit whose existence does more bad than goodIâ€™m so freaking tired of it all. Iâ€™m a burden. I just want to find a way to end my life quickly and without anyone finding my body. Iâ€™d be truly wiped from everyoneâ€™s memories, and theyâ€™d be free of me. Theyâ€™d be happy. 

Why am I such a coward. Why canâ€™t I follow through. Iâ€™ve been wanting to die for years now, so why havenâ€™t I killed myself. Maybe Iâ€™m not suicidal and Iâ€™m just an attention seeking bastard who has no friends and no purpose in life. But I really do want to kill myself. Iâ€™m tired of failing and being a blight on everyoneâ€™s existence. Maybe I should buy the materials tonight and do it this weekend before I can think twice about it, I donâ€™t know
