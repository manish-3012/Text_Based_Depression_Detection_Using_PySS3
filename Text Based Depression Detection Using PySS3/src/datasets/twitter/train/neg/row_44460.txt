Feeling severely depressed, and would like some guidance.I have been struggling with depression for over 6 months now, I have been trying to deal with it on my own, but I fear it's starting to get worse. It is difficult for me to get out of bed. I have times where I start to break out in tears even though there is no direct trigger at that time. There are times though, where I would get sad about my current situation. I'm living in a small town and have very few friends here. It is hard to meet people for dating and friends, and even though I do know people here, I feel extremely lonely. It is about 1-2 hours away from a bigger city, and there are times where I feel like I'm in a isolated bubble. I'm sure when reading this, the first thing in people's mind is "just move!", but there is a catch. I've thought about moving, several times. I just got finished with school and training, and I wanted to stay in the town I'm living at now to get at least 1 year of experience before I move out to the bigger cities. However, now I'm fearing that it might be a big mistake, seeing as I am feeling worse and worse. I feel embarrassed to go out to eat because I don't feel as hungry, and don't want to offend my friends. There are no psychiatrists in town, and was debating about taking a 2 hour drive to see one, but that might be hard to handle for a weekday appointment, so I have been trying to handle all of this solo. But, it's eventually taking a toll on me. I dunno what else to do, and hoping that one day, it does get better. I try to look on the bright side, and thankful that there are days where I can get out of bed, and thankful that I have a job and a roof on my head :)
