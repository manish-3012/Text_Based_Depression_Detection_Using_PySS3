I'm sitting in the bathroom with the door locked and a knife to my throatI don't want my life. If I could've chosen to be erased from the world and everyone's memory and have it be like I never existed at all, I'd choose that. People who actually enjoy living are delusional and annoying. Living a full life is stupid and not worth it. I understand people not wanting to hurt their loved ones, but I don't really care at all. I don't care that I will impose something horrible on someone, I couldn't care less because if I end up dying then it's all worth it in the end. There is nothing in this world that I enjoy doing enough to stay alive.
