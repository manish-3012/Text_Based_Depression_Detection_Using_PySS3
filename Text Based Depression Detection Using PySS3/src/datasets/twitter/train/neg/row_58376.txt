My Ex put me in debt and I have nothing left. This is goodbyeI had a terrible, psychotic ex I broke up with in February. He admitted to me in the end of the relationship he was an incel. When he thought I was cheating on him, he slammed my head against a desk and took my phone. When we was blackout drunk, he peed on me while I was asleep. I have so much trauma. When I broke up with him, he blackmailed me with some videos and I had to pay him for what he called â€œreparationsâ€

Iâ€™m a student who commutes and has no time for a job. I think Iâ€™m going to end it. I havenâ€™t eaten in days and no one will help me. Goodbye
