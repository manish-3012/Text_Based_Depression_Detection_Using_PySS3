I feel like I'm doomed to always be lonely and miserable no matter what.My whole life has been one shit show to another with no break. My mom was extremely abusive. Then my partners. Anytime I ended up making friends, investing emotionally, and growing attached, they ended up being shitty and using me. No one truly cares about me. I'm convinced that no one truly loves anyone. That people just fake empathy. I've always been on the outside looking in. I love my dog but the depression is so unbearable, its hard to be there for her. 

I don't know why I've always been an outcast that everyone hates and looks down upon. No one will ever truly love me or respect me. I hate everything about myself. I hate most people. I'm tired of the loneliness consuming me. I waited over and over again for things to get better. They just get worse. This must be a sign from the universe to put myself out of my misery. Maybe, just maybe tonight, I'll take too many pills and drink too much by "accident". I already failed five suicide attempts so I'm incompetent in that regard too. I wish I felt worthy enough to exist. Capable enough to live instead of just rotting and getting by. This is the consequence for being such a pathetic peice of shit.
