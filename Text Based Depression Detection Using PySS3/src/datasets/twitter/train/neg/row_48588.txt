I want to stop existingNon-existence feels the same as never being born. I cannot see anything wrong with this.

I do not want to be aware anymore. I do not want to think any more. I do not want to be able to perceive ***anything***. I want to die. I want to be free from the burden of awareness.

The psychiatrists cannot do shit for me. They won't give me therapy because they say my depression is not irrational. I have tried every medication and they all failed.

I am 20 yr male in excellent shape, and all i can do is watch my life pass by. I am on disability income. I am unable to ever get a girl friend because my depression makes me too dysfunctional. All I can do is go for walks and sometimes read. When i am 25, i will be doing the same thing. when i am 30 I am doing the same thing. Nothing makes me more frustrated than knowing that my life will not change. I will be stuck like this forever. 

That future is not worth the crap i have to constantly go though.
