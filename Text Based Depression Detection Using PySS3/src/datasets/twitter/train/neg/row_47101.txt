I might kill myself soon.I do think I might kill myself one day because I hate my life. I never liked my mother because she is disrespectful and rude, threatened to kill me and much more. She only likes my brother and only has a problem with me when he does the same shit I could be doing .  Sheâ€™s silent when itâ€™s him, and I donâ€™t see why she likes him more because he really is lazy and careless . I donâ€™t care that she likes him more it just pisses me off that she ignores what heâ€™s doing when I argue with him and only comes after me .If she died I really wouldnâ€™t go to her funeral I donâ€™t care about her anymore . She thinks she has the right to take my life just because she gave birth to me . I donâ€™t remember asking her to do that. She says she couldâ€™ve aborted me and I wish she did considering how she treated me all my life .I had to deal with this all my life and I get called disrespectful because I defend myself.i always think itâ€™s strange when I see people have a good relationship with their mother, I donâ€™t wish my mother was a normal mother , I wish I had a different mother in general. I just got jumped by my mother and brother. She made my confidence go down ever since I was little. Now I have anxiety. Even as a kid (Iâ€™m 20 now) she was Always disrespecting me and pointing out everything that was wrong with me and thatâ€™s why I always never wanna be in the same room as her . Ever since I was 9 years old whenever she comes in the room I leave. And she wonders why. I just donâ€™t like her. I donâ€™t feel comfortable being in the same room as her , I donâ€™t tell her that I love her , she doesnâ€™t tell me that she loves me and I never heard her say it before. Not only do I hate her I also hate my father. He is never in my life and lied my whole life knowing him. He doesnâ€™t know shit about me so I donâ€™t really care for him. He made my life hell by letting my mother be a mother so I hate him a lot for that. I see him every 5 years ( estimation) and he only lives a few hours away. I donâ€™t even love him . You canâ€™t love someone you donâ€™t know  . I donâ€™t have much to say about him. I donâ€™t have anyone close in my life. All my friends from school lost contact with me so I only have internet friends. I donâ€™t have a favorite cousin and I donâ€™t have a favorite aunt. One of my aunts  loves to talk shit about me to her kids and ask me for money when I really never have any. I really had to fight everyone I know. I used to cry when I was younger in the middle of the night thinking about how everyone i know is gonna die one day but now I just donâ€™t care . I donâ€™t know where to go I just know I need to get out of here. I only love my grandma and Iâ€™m only mean to her out of frustration with dealing with her and being the only one to deal with her all the time. I hate my life and everyone in it. She told my grandma to have me but I really donâ€™t care because I see my grandmother as my mother. Iâ€™m gonna run away or kill myself probably because I canâ€™t take living here .  I had to fight all my life and Iâ€™m done. I think Iâ€™m just gonna end it all here and kill myself. Every cousin I have had to be fought. I had to fight my mother and I had to fight my aunt , I had to fight my cousin I even had to fight my father (but he didnâ€™t fight back ) Idk why Iâ€™m on here I just needed somewhere to empty my feelings because I have no one to talk to.
