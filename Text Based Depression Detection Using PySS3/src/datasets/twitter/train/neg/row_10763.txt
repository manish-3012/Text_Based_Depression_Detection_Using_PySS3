sometimes I wonder if killing myself is the only way I can find peaceI'm 17 years old, I'm working a job I hate, and my anxiety about this pandemic has gotten me spiraling out of control 

I think I'm poisoning myself with what I'm doing to keep myself from getting sick. I cant drink out of cans or bottles and I cant even eat sweets or chips without spraying it with lysol or using disinfecting wipes on them. I'm so scared of getting sick its unreal. I think I'm subsequently making myself sick in the process. my dads trying to get me to go on medication, but I dont think itll help. 

I know I'm more lucky than others, i have a boyfriend that loves me and a family that tries to help but everytime i start to spiral it feels like they cant help me. hell, I tried to vent to my mom on the phone and she just started to cry saying she cant help me and to just give up if I'm not gonna accept her "help". I'm in my last year of school doing it all online and I cant do anything. I'm in lower classes bc my act score was shit, and everyone around me just makes me feel like a failure in comparison. 

I don't know why I'm posting this, maybe I just want attention? idk. but I'm tired of waking up everyday at 2pm getting ready to go to a job that makes me feel miserable. the only thing that's given me any joy is engaging in any kind of sexual act(s) with my bf. I feel like a piece of shit. I feel sick. I just want this all to be over. 

I thought moving to my dads house would make everything better, but it didnt. everything feels the same way. it just makes me think maybe the only way I'll ever truly find peace is when I go to heaven, if I'm even able to go with all the sinful things I've done to make myself feel any kind of emotion. 

I feel bad for even posting this bc I know I'm more well off than others, but I'm truly just sick of living the way I do. it feels like theres no way out.
