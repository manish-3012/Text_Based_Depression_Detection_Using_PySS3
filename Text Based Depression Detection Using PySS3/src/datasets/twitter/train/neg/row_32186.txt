Does anyone else feel like suicide is simply the best of whatever options that are available?So aside from being alone for a really long time(which is probably the main cause of my depression) my life up to this point hasnâ€™t been as bad as others that I have talked to. 

Although my home life is less than ideal itâ€™s nowhere near as bad as what iv read about. 

But now Iâ€™m 22 and have basically no future that I would consider happy combine that with being alone emotional iv basically decided that suicide is simply the best course of action.
