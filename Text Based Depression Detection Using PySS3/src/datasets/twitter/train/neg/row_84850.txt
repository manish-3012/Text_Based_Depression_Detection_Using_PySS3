I feel ashamed to be even posting here. Feels like karma whoring.Anyway, i wanted this year to be my best year. Every year for the past 5 years have went with me being like,"my life sucks, nothing good can ever happen with me".
It did sucked, i had my good moments but it really did suck. I really can't even make it better if i go back.
Well this year, i thought i'll be positive unlike before. I wanted to be a positive person.
I didn't want to always cry about stuff and just wanted to deal with it. But each day of this month just got worse.
Even if i killed myself, all the things i went through in the last 5 years would be of waste. It would have been better if i had killed myself before in this scenario. Especially surviving last 2 years.

At this point, i am not sure, life is unfair i get it. 
I wonder how much worse it can get and i am not ready for it. I can't take this stuff anymore.
I am only 17, and probably you people have much more worse problems then me. But i can't handle this stuff...
