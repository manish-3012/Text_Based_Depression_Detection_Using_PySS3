I really want to try again, but I donâ€™t want to hurt the ones I love again.Itâ€™s so fucking hard. I canâ€™t stand being in this world. I hate living and everything that comes with it. 

I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m gonna make it much longer. Iâ€™m trying to hold on for the sake of others, but I just donâ€™t see how itâ€™s worth it in the end. 

Iâ€™m really sorry to all the ones I will inevitably hurt in the end
