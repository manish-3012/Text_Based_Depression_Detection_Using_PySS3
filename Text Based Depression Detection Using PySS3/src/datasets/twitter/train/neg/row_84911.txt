Would 50 stories do it?My head is totally fucked up. Medications and meditation and therapy aren't working. Psych ward has been done. No will to live or protect my health. Loss of passion and visual thinking with last mental collapse. Too passive to push myself and persevere in anything anymore. Sociopathic levels of procrastination and avoidance issues. Anxiety to the point of madness through my whole body. Not able to relax, breathing is just a physical process. Don't feel anything for things I used to. Dangerous lack of common sense. I need out.

Will I die on impact or would I be in agony for several seconds/minutes?
