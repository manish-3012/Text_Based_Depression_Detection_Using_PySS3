ThoughtsThey keep flooding in, no sign of stopping. Negative thoughts, hurtful thoughts, painful thoughts. I opened up to someone recently about my past abuse (which I have posted before), to which they replied â€œif I were you I would have already killed my self.â€ I canâ€™t stop replaying that sentence over and over again. They donâ€™t know that Iâ€™ve been thinking about suicide but as soon as they said that sentence I had to go immediately to the bathroom and I broke down crying like a baby. Maybe I should have done it sooner... I donâ€™t have any family thatâ€™ll miss me anyways and I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s stopping me.
