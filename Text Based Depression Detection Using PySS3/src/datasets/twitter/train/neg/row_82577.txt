Im falling apart.I really need someone. No one truly knows me, and it's tearing me apart. I'm past the soul-crushing sadness part of this, now Im emotionally numb. Im self destructive. I just want someone to tell my story to, all of it. If some stranger out there cares enough to listen, please tell me.
