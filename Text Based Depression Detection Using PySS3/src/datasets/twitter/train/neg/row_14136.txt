Relaxing musicI've been browsing here for awhile... I don't feel like I'm ready to share my problems just yet, but I would like to ask what type of music some of you listen to when you're feeling very down. I feel music lets me temporarily escape the feeling and I don't have very much relaxing music. So what kind of music do you listen to (if any) when you're feeling down?
