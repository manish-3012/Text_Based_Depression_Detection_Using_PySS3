No Longer CopingFor a while now (between 1 and 10 years, don't want to give exact time in case I ever end up talking to someone irl about it) I've randomly felt really terrible about everything. It comes and goes, sometimes I'm fine, sometimes not (fine much more often than not). In the last 2 weeks though I've been feeling terrible for no good reason, but unlike every other time I'm not exactly coping with it. I'm eating noticebly less, have way less energy (my cycling commute is taking about twice as long), I've been holding back tears in day to day life rather than being able to hide it all well. I can't focus any more, what should have been a 2 hours college assignment has taken about 5 so far with so signs of being completed any time soon. It feels a little better just typing this, but I'm dtill totally lost.

EDIT: To add if it wasn't clear, I've felt simiar before but only now have I been unable to hide it and stop it affecting every day life. That's why I'm getting a bit scared.
