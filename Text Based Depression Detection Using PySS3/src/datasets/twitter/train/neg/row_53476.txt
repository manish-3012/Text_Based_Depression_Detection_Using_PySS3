Here I am againI already posted here before. Saying how I can't find happiness and I don't know what it is. I can't seem to find a reason to be here. At the end of the day, people get over it. Nobody really truly cares and the world goes round and round and round even without me. I'm 22 and completely and utterly worthless. 


Get a job, get a job, get a job. 
You're so lazy.
 You should have a job. 
Do something for yourself, you can't rely on your husband forever.
Aren't you tired of doing nothing all day?
Why don't you go back to school and go 20 thousand dollars in debt to get a better job?
You just leech off your husband's money.
I want you to accomplish something this year.
Lose weight and get a job. You need to do both this year.
But why don't you have a job it would give you purpose.


What purpose? What fulfillment? What accomplishment? What goals? I have none. I don't want to do anything. I just want to die. That is my goal. Nothing is enjoyable. Nothing makes me happy. No job or child or good house or good life could ever make me not want to die. I want to be at peace. No job seems enjoyable or even tolerable for me. I hate everything I do. I hate waking up, going to to bathroom, having to brush my teeth, cooking, eating, watching TV, talking to people. I hate it all. Nothing is okay and nothing makes me want to stay. Why can't I just leave? I'm so so so tired...
