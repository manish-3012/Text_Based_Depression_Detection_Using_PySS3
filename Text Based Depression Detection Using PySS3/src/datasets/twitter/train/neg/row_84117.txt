I'd feel guilty for killing myself because my parents just paid for me to remove my wisdom teethI'm 21 and unemployed. I've had many job interviews this year but have yet to be hired. I think I'm pretty socially awkward which is probably why I haven't been able to land a job or make any real friends. 

Anyhoo, I had a couple wisdom teeth removed today and had my parents pay for it because I couldn't afford it (It was ideal to have them removed as they were becoming a problem). I've also been feeling like I've hit the lowest point of my life recently and really want it to end. I had the dentist appointment booked month ago and I was too scared to kill myself before the appointment; I feel the urge continue to grow exponentially over time : ) 

I think I'd feel crumby about necking myself immediately after having my parents pay for the appointment but also if I'm dead I'll stop caring because I'll be dead (ha,ha). Going on a bit of a tangent but when I was in the third grade a teacher pulled me aside to tell me she thought I had a problem with my self esteem. I'm sharing this with you to provide context and let you know that I'm no stranger to self loathing. Holy SMOKES, if seven-year-old me thought he hated himself, he oughta meet his future self. I didn't think I could reach this level of self loathing. It's bothersome. I know it's unreasonable and any encouraging words have no effect even if i know they're true. 

In conclusion, I hate myself and I want to die. Thank you for reading my essay
