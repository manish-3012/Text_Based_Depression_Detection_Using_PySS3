Not looking for helpSo uh idk how this usually works but I guess il start out by stating my issue I'm 26 and broke and that's because of my crippling social anxiety. I go to these job interviews get the job but usually on the first day my anxiety is so bad that I usually leave. This has been going on since I was 20 and honestly is so tiring I'm not lazy I like to work but this feeling I get everytime makes me want to blow my head off I never felt this way when I was in high school idk how it happened. I seen a therapist but talking only goes so far, idk what to do anymore. I feel myself getting closer to the edge I dont leave my house anymore I haven't eat in 4 days I've cut everyone off in my life. I wish someone would just kill me I don't want to be another suicide by cops cus I'm not a bad guy but I'm out of options
