Life insurance is keeping me alive, today.Suicidal thoughts are common in my head.  Iâ€™m sure thatâ€™s not â€œnormalâ€ per se, but it is normal for me.    My thoughts get bad at work?  I work graveyard audit.  The lack of sleep wears on me.
I know I have â€œa lot to live for.â€  But tonight,  it is realizing that I just got new life ins &amp; it wonâ€™t pay if I let myself die.
