I need advice. I'm too scared. Can someone just do it for meHello. My life has been terrible. For as long as I can remember Ive been treated like shit by everyone I know. Ive been beaten, raped, unloved. I dont remember what its like to have confidence or even leave my room. The last time I even went to the grocery store mustve been a year ago. I don't want to live anymore. I dont care what anyone has to say. I dont care what "help" you have to offer. Ive been to mental hospitals, therapists. I dont remember what its like not feeling tired all day or my entire body aching to the point i can hardly eat or leave my bed. I feel like ive lived past 100 but i havent even reached my 17th birthday yet.

Everyone around me is happy. Everyone who's ever betrayed me is thriving.

Its time to end it. But i cant bring myself to do it.

How do i come to terms with it enough to do it myself ? Or can someone else do it for me?
