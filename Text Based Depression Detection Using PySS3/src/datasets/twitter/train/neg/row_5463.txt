RE: I can't do this anymoreMy last post here detailed some things that I was going through, and I wanted to touch up on that.

I'm actually feeling better with my psychologist. I feel like she realized she was pushing the electronics thing too hard, and i'm glad that I can finally open up to her about what i'm going through.

School, however, is a different story. I feel like I'm failing. My dad is pushing me harder than before, and I feel like I can't be happy anymore. I just wish that I could do the things I want to do while getting good grades, while having a good social life. I can't have all of them. I'd have to give up one.

In our state we have things called SOLs, where we take a test at the end of the year to see how we are doing. On top of that, we also have midterms. Not only that, but I have to deal with 2 different projects, and some stupid review bullshit that I have to keep up with or my teacher will make me stay after school to get help. I can't really deal with all of this. I wish I could do something to remove all of this stress. But no, it's the time.

I've also been self-harming more lately. My form of self-harm is banging my head on objects. If I keep this up for another year or two, I'd probably die of brain damage.

Just kill me already.
