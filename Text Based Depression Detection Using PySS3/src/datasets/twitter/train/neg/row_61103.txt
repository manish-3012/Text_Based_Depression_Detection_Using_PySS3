I've already written the noteI'm sorry, I wrote the note already I just need to do it now. I just need to. When I get older I am just going to be a disappointment to my family so might as well leave while I'm loved right? I just can't live to be a disappointment I'm sorry.  It's not their fault, they want what's best for me I just can't and I can't i'm sorry and i didn't cry in the truck because you don't know and i'm only holding on by so little there are only 4 people i'm holding on to mom dad, i am going to disappoint you and i don't want to do that you are going to kick me out of the house so i'm doing it i'll never see you again....people like me have accepted their sins and go to hell remember and you guys are good you'll be fine. I love you and well goodbye
