FML.Fuck it all.  Fuck me.  Fuck my parents.  Fuck my life.  Fuck therapy.  Fuck my cat.  Fuck money.  Fuck love.  Fuck me having a new job.  Fuck me missing my husband.  Fuck anything that I've ever done over the past 25 years of my life.  Fuck everything that's kept me alive this long.

Because I'm not moving out of my parents' house at the pleading of my husband (they're emotionally and verbally abusive all the time), even though I had the opportunity to leave this weekend, it's all over.  My phone might get cut off.  I might not see a psychiatrist.  I might not have money to pay for my medications if I do get a script.  I might just end up walking out into the cold, into the middle of a field to curl up and just pray that I'll never wake up.

All I've ever been is cold, hostile, manipulative, lying, slutty, overly attached, lazy and childish.  I'm a cunt, slut, bitch and a home-wrecker.  I don't deserve love from anyone that's ever given it to me because all I've done is throw it in their faces, shit on them and then beg for forgiveness like I think it's owed to me.
