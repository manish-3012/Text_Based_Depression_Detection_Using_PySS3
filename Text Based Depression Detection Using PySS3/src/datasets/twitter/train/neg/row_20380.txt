Update: One more failed suicide to add to the list...Yeah. I think this makes 18 now. 

It took an hour for my wrist to stop bleeding, yet somehow, miraculously, I managed to miss veins, tendons, and the artery I tried so hard to hit. I need a sharper knife, or some marijuana so I can get high and have the guts to press harder?

I feel like shit. I have some people on Reddit to talk to, and I don't know, I guess it feels nice to be heard and not have to worry about people leaving when they hear about the shit you've done... 

I made countless cuts last night. I feel if I had made one more, I would finally be dead. But my brother came upstairs to ask my mom where I was.

"Mommy, where's Ethan? I have green candy for him because green's his favorite color."

He was standing right outside the bathroom door, and I couldn't do it with him being there... I don't know why... but I said "In here.", grabbed a wad of toilet paper and pressed it to my arm trying to mop up some blood, taped it down, pulled my sleeve over it and opened the door.

The first thing this four year old kid did was hug me so tight I couldn't breathe.

I cried afterwards. I cried because I failed and I cried because I felt terrible for almost leaving him. I feel terrible no matter what I do. I can't stop crying....

I'm glad I have people to talk to on here... It's somewhat comforting. Even if nobody likes me in life... I have fellow redditors who listen... And right now that and this painstakingly adorable small child that I call my brother is all I have in this shitty world.
