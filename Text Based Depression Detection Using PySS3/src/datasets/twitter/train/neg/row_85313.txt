Issues with NHSAnyone here from the UK can you help me out real quick, attempted suicide on December 12th 2018 and *still* trying to get legitimate help. Was referred to 42nd street and healthy minds and stuff but never heard anything back was sent to 3 different evaluations and was never told anything afterwards my gp says he won't prescribe anti depressants because I'm under 18 even though I know for a fact I can be prescribed them and my gp was supposed to bring me in for regular check ups afterwards which I haven't been asked to do once. I'm fucking desperate for help and all I've got is counselling which in my opinion is a very dead end service because I keep talking about the same thoughts and scenarios every week sometimes repeating myself word for word and nothings changed. I have been getting dangerously depressed again to the point where I've been regularly walking into the road hoping to be hit by a car and no matter how many times I phone a&amp;e about self harm or talk to my counsellor about this nothing ever comes of it and I don't know if it's just me thats the problem or just my area (one of my friends went through something similar, albeit she was younger than I am, and also complains that the nhs was pretty shit) or the nhs as a whole.
