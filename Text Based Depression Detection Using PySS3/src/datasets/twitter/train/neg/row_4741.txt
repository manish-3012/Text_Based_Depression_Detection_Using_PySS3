I can't do it.Everyone in my town see' s me as an easy target. My nanny is dying and honestly she's the person I love most in the entire word, she's a demon, a cracker. 

My boyfriend's friend is also dying and a girl they're all close with started on me tonight. Like I was easy pickings. I looked to my boyfriend for support and he left me there. He didn't say a word. I just need someone to talk to I honestly would end it all tonightexcept for my child,  not just over that but a lot that's too much to put into text. I just can't take it anymore.
