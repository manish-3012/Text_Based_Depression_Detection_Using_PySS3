I think i want to kill myself todayEveryday for a month i've thought about ending it and it's getting harder to find reasons not to. Life isnt unfair, didnt have a tough upbringing, Most of my problems stem from me, i'm just a shitty person who pushes people away. Lately the only thing that's been keeping me around is my relationship and all we do is either fight, or dont talk at all anymore and it's slowly killing me inside. I used to go to councelling and take anti depressants but it never did much for me, iused to be so full of life and love and excitement and now i'm just a pit of despair. The light inside of me has died and i honestly feel that everyone would be better off without me. But the only other thing that stops me is i love my family and friends and s/o too much to hurt them like that. I think about running away but im broke. I think about reaching out to the people i love but my pride wont let me. The fact that i even have to go on reddit for this is killing me and i just dont know what else to do. I really want to turn all of this around but its like im sinking and i cant get myself out and i'm afraid to reach for help. I bottle everything up and its all hurting me. I know im weak and i know this is pathetic i just dont know what to do anymore without driving myself insane
