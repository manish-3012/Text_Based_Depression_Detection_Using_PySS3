do i have to fucking die to get better?!there's nothing left for me in life now - every opportunity i've tried taking to get better closed or got cancelled, or failed. it seems the older i get the more life just becomes worse. bad things keep happening, people bullying me saying this bad threats, sometimes and honestly i usually ignore them but now i'm starting to wonder, would it be better to just be dead (wherever that goes) instead because i honestly am starting to feel faced with no alternative. i'm not kidding you EVERY DAY when i wake up i get this instant hit of mental pain like "my god it's still there i have all those problems in my life!!! &gt;:(" i haven't been eating anymore i havent been taking care of myself so again do i have to fucking die to not feel like shit all the tiem?!!!!!
