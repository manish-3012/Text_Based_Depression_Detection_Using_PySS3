Cant live for myself, can someone talk to me?Please. I just feel awful and alone. I thought I had someone but now I dont and everything sucks and hurts now. Im on campus rn, unable to move. Dont care to study. Dont care about my future. These thoughts are just a part of me and Im really tired and just want to end it.
