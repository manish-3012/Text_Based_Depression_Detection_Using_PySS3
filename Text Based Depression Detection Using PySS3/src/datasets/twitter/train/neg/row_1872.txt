I lost a friend/drinking some poison.She said it would be easier for both of us if we didnâ€™t bother pursuing friendship anymore. We were never that close to begin with, but there was something about her that made me really want to keep her as a friend. And now sheâ€™s out of my life forever. Iâ€™m drinking the closest thing I can find with a toxicity label as soon as I post this.
