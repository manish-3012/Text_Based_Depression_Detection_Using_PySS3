I made a mistake and I want to dieI fucked up at work. I don't want to go into detail but just know someone could have been seriously hurt and it was all my fault. This is really effecting my general anxiety and has substantially increased suicidal ideation (never attempted but it's always been a lingering idea). I texted the hot line while at work, didn't really help. Talked to pyciatrist, antidepressants have been increased. Is there anything else I can do?
