I'm a despicable person, a terrible parent, I despise BEING a parent, and I can see no way out except deathPlease tell me how fucking awful of a person I am for not wanting to be a mother. I have autism and so does my kid, why the fuck did I think I could do this? I'm vile, selfish, wretched and literally good for nothing. I hate my life and just existing is too painful. Do you have any idea what it's like to hate who you are? To want to destroy everything around you?

I've been hitting my body, arm's, legs and face as hard as I can but that pain only dulls the agony of self-loathing for moments. I'm such a pathetic, worthless pile of garbage, and I'm too cowardly to hang from this belt I've been fondling. 

I wish I had a gun. I wish I could blow my fucking brains out all over my desk and let my husband deal with that scene. Fucking hell I'm truly despicable, but I don't even care if my 3 year old never sees his mom again, he'd be better off without me.

No, I'm just going to continue to be a pathetic, self-loathing and self-pitying loathsome cunt and fall asleep and wake up and do it all over again. Hopefully I'll die before I wake up, wish me luck.
