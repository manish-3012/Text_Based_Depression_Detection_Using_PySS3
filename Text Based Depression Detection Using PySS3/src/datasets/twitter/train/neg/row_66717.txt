all I see ahead of me...is endless schoolwork and then an endless job. I can't bear all this work. All life is is pain and more pain. There's no joy in life. Every night I'm in my jail cell of a dorm room wishing I was dead. The walls of the dorm are so imprisoning that you'd think they were meant to hold Hitler. Nobody's willing to acknowledge any of my problems because they've never been depressed and therefore can't relate. Since I destroyed my phone, I worry what else I'll destroy. It's been so long since I've felt happy. My parents would probably be happier without me.
