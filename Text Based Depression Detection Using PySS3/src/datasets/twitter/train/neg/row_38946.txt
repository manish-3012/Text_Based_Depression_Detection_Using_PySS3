I don't even know anymoreHello, it's my first time posting here and I really just need an outlet for my thoughts. I've been really down lately, and I don't feel I can go on any longer. Everything hurts and lately it's become unbearable. I just really want to feel happy but somehow things keep screwing up, school, relationships, friends, everything, nothing goes and i jist feel like giving up, makes me question if it's really okay for me to just disappear.
