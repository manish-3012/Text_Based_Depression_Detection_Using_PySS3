Anti-nausea meds down.  Now waiting to take the rest.So I just knocked back a few dramamine in anticipation of chowing down a bunch of meds that I have that cause CNS depression.  I *know* it's a lethal combo, because last time I did it, I quit breathing twice.  Sadly I was at the hospital by then, since my roommate noticed.  But now I'm holed up alone.

It's weird, I've got a great job, a girl, and a safe place to live, and family and friends that love and support me.  I've been to hospitals that were DBT and cbt specialized and they taught me all these skills, skills that now seem to be worth bupkiss. Distract yourself, journal, make a list of pros and cons, deep breathing, talk to a friend.  To that, I say ha! None have worked.

It's just been a slow slide back into suicidal ideation these last few weeks, and at this point if I welcome death.  No person should have to live this way, and never should it happen over and over, over years and years.  I must break the cycle for real this time, and yea, killing myself is a lame way out, but dammit.  That cycle will be all fucking broken. 

You win bad stuff.  I throw in the towel.
30 more minutes and those meds are in me.
After that, a nice peaceful sleep.
