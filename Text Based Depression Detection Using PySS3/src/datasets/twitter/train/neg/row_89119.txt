26MI wish I would just fall asleep and not wake up. I've felt this way for so long now that it really feels normal. Killing myself is an option but I don't want my immediate family to suffer. The only reason I'm still here is because I don't want to hurt them, it's no way to live.

I'm in group therapy for addiction, live in a sober house... I've been doing this for two years now. My life hasn't gotten any better. Everyday I'd rather just drink, burn everything in my life down, and disappear into nothing. 

At least when I was drunk in college I had friends and fun times. Now I just see everyone moving on with their lives and me just stuck with nothing and no energy or patience to move forward.
