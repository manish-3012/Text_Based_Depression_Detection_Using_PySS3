Really wondering why shouldn't I?I went to a massage parlor where I'm pretty sure an unprotected act has led to me contracting HIV. I was in denial when I got flu like symptoms thinking it was the flu. In the interim I did not have sex with my partner but I think she's come down with it too. Why the fuck should I not end it right now? There is no coming back from this
