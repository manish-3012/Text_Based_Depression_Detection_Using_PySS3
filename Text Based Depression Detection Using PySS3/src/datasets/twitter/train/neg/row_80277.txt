ScaredMy brain can't stop saying this word. Over and over again "Scared scared scared scared scared". There are no good outcomes. This cannot be fixed, even if it can be fixed, there is no point in fixing it, life is meaningless, especially if you don't enjoy it. Too scared to do anything. Too scared to be on my good computer because of fungus that most likely doesn't exist, too scared to use a blanket to sleep because spiders are hiding in it, too scared to go outside because bugs will kill me, can't get help because people will laugh at me, can't get help because parents will be sad, which will make me sad, which will make them sad. Infinite loop of sad. Scared. I'm sweating despite the fact I'm freezing. I used to be smart I used to know things. All of that is gone. I can't stop hurting myself. Takes the edge off of these thoughts. People are noticing. And by people I mean parents because I don't fucking go outside and see people other than those two. I hate one of them. The other one is dumb. Can't get happy. Happiness isn't possible. People think I'm mean but I'm just dumb. Don't mean to be. Want to exercise but can't because I'm bad. I just sit here. Months on end. Feel dumb when I exercise because it's pointless. I can't get fit. Too scared to get help. Want someone to find my bruises and force me away, but they are too nice, they won't do anything. I'm so dumb. I fail at everything. I'm dumb. I want to get into a sport, to shy to even say it here because it's so disjointed with what I actually am. Kill me. This all spawned from looking at a mirror, worse things happen from smaller things, but I can't vocalize them. Takes too long. Keep seeing things on ceiling, turns out to be my long hair which I fucking hate. Haven't had extensive human contact, including barbers. My cat turns into a giant spider when in the corner of my eye. I wish someone would read these. No one does, I'm sorry for turning this into what is basically a journal.
