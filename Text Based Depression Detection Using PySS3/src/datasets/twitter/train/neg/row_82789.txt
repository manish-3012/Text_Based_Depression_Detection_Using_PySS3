I can't fix myself, so I'm done.My whole life I wanted to belong and to be a normal person. I never was though and always had issues. I hate myself a lot of the time and feel like I'm going crazy a lot of the time. I obsess over stupid things like my appearance to the point of having massive anxiety about it and I self harm to cope with all of the anxiety I have. I've been having anxiety attacks so often lately that I feel miserable when I wake up. I also have a problem being social, I am awkward and don't talk a lot, this makes me an outcast. The only time I go out of my house is to go to work, it's a small job and all of my co-workers hang out with each other but I do not because I can't talk well to people and feel left out. Especially since it's a small group and they all know each other but I am simply an employee. I am a 29/f and have been like this all my life, I have really tried to improve and feel like I'm old enough now to make a decision to not be here.
