I just want it to endI dont get it

Why am i blessed, but cursed

Why do i have spirit, but no drive

Why do i care with nothing to care about

I am torn in every aspect
Physically
Mentally
Psycologically

I have the potential, but no motovation

I think that i could be smart, but i am hampered by my secret depression, and brash outbursts

I think about myself. I am useless
I am a dick to those around me
I push them down
I have no purpose other than to cause hatred

I hate my family, friends, teachers

They burden me in more ways than they could ever know

I seek the moment at all times

I wish i could always be in a high, escaping the crumbling life around me

I will amount to nothing

I fake joy so easily, i trick myself.
Its so easy to trick your so-callled loved ones
They have no reason to notice

I dont want to live,
Is that all to much to ask for?

What could the words of someone i will never know do?
Theres no way to prove anyone cares for me

I want to end it all, nothing bad can come of it.
