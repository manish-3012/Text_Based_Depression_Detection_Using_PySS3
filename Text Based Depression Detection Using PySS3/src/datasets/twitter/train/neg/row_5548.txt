I am feeling suicidal and I need some help.For the past 2 years I've felt like I want to kill myself for various reasons I do not want to explain. I have not committed suicide because of 2 main reasons, how upset/sad my family would be and the question what if this feeling goes away and this would a mistake? Either way after 2 years now I feel like I've gone insane by waiting for my feelings to change and hiding the fact that I feel depressed to my friends and family. I  wanted to keep it a secret this entire time because if I wanted to do something I would have full control and have no friends or family standing in the way but there is a drawback and that is that I can't ask anyone any questions on suicide or anything alike because it would reveal/cause suspicion that I'm suicidal.

About a week ago I decided that I had enough and wanted to finally commit suicide because a lot my problems in life are getting much bigger and my feelings doesnt seem to be changing anytime soon and I don't want to wait in what feels like hell any longer. After searching up online with a vpn on ways to kill myself, I learned there are no ways to kill myself with a 100% guaranteed to die or anything with a really high percentage that would be available to me.

I couldn't do any overdose on pills on something and learned that there is a high percentage of people who survive and I would be likely to have some sorta brain damage if I did. I couldn't hang myself because I dont have anything to hang myself from or anything to suspend me except a belt. I couldn't shoot myself in the head because I don't have a gun and I'm a high schooler so I couldn't get one anyway. I couldn't cut myself in anyway because after research I learned that that is the highest suicide attempt that most people survive from and plus it would be a lot of pain before you die. I couldn't do the old toaster in the bathtub because outlets in modern homes have something to stop higher amounts of electricity or something because of that way of attempt and also because bathrooms are really moist. I couldn't that thing were you get a lot of co2 in the car and pass out because that would require my parents to be home from work. I couldn't order and helium tank or gas because obviously I'd be questioned on why I'd be doing that. I couldn't jump from a building because I live in the suburbs where there aren't any tall enough buildings for me to jump from without a huge chance of me surviving the fall and being disabled in some way after that physically or brain damage. I couldnt use chemical products because their are no certain ways I know it would work and I don't want to endanger any family members or oets with any make shift gas or something from products that would linger.

For the last paragraph I want to ask anyone is believes that people should have the right to take their own life. What way do you thing would be possible to kill myself? I've been considering jumping in front of the metro but I have the feeling I wouldn't be able to get through with that. Please I need an answer because I've now become mad knowing I might not even be able to commit suicide. To anyone that wants to convince to me to live or something, right now Im not really open minded and I don't really want to find a reason to live. I've already tried for the past 2 years so anything you might say I probably had a similar thought already and examined it.

Thank you to anyone that can help me.
