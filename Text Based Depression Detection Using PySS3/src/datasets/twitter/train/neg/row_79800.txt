Thinking about ending it allI'm honestly thinking about ending it all. I can't take it anymore. I have no friends, no passions or interests, a worthless college degree and no job, credit card debt, and still living with my Mom. I'm 24. I always did what I was supposed to do and followed the rules, and it's gotten me no where. I feel like there's nothing to look forward to and no reason to live anymore. I just give up.
