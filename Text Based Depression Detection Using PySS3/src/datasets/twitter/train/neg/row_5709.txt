Not using a throwaway cause fuck itWhatâ€™s up nerds, Iâ€™m your friendly neighborhood edgy thirteen year old child that wants to kill themselves despite constantly asking people not to on this very sub. 

Why? 

I donâ€™t fuckin know. I guess I think Iâ€™m a dick. Cause I am. Iâ€™ve gone around this sub a couple times on throwaway accounts, and sometimes I left comments trying to help people. This is the first time Iâ€™ve commented on so many posts. But I donâ€™t really do the things I ask people to do. I told some dude that theyâ€™re young so they should keep going to see if they could find someone, but Iâ€™m way younger than them. Iâ€™m hypocritical. Naive. Just flat out fucking retarded. Thereâ€™s another thing I guess but Iâ€™m not gonna say that. Pm me or something if you wanna know the other reason so fucking badly.

I havenâ€™t even finished writing a song yet, why canâ€™t I wait till I do that. I havenâ€™t payed my loan in animal crossing, do that first before you kill yourself. I wonâ€™t listen to my own sound advice, itâ€™s like I want to suffer or something, why canâ€™t it fucking stop.

Why canâ€™t it just be silent. 

Why am I such a dick.
