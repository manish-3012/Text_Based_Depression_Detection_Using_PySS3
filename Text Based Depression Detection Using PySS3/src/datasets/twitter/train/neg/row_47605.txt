My final goodbyeI have posted a lot of these, idk quite how many but all of them have been about me saying goodbye, I've always come back though this time I won't. For anyone thinking of suicide, please talk to someone first, that is all I ask. For all the people who try and help people every day, thank you so much for what you do. To anyone trying to help me, it's not going to happen, I just lost my best friend, there isn't any coming back from this, I wish you all the best of luck and I hope you all make it through your troubles
