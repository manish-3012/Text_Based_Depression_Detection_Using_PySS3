A poem I wrote (suicidal influences, but many open meanings)Hello, I've never had much of an interest in poetry, in fact I think it's one of the lowest forms of literature expression. Events of recent past have lead me to writing this, it's the first poem I've ever written out of my own free will. If you like it, I'd like to know, if not, I'd still like to know. If it is counter-productive for suicidal individuals, I will delete the post with little to no argument. I call it "You need me!"

You need me!
You need me!
I hear her cry
I wonder how this ever came to be
As I attempt to wave it all goodbye

I put the barrel to my temple
And begin to wish I could just overdose
Close,
Close.
You need me.

I open my eyes
Mesmerized
By a million lies
All by me.

I surface at the top
And scream for it to stop
I open my eyes
I meant my goodbyes!
I stand up high
Way up in the sky
And finally, finally, goodbye.

Falling.
Flailing.
Failing.
Close,
Close.
You need me.

I open my eyes
Lying in my bed
Why can't I just be dead?

I join up with the rest of the cattle
To hell with my internal battle
I paint on a smile
And begin the daily mile

But when it's time for bed
The beautiful lie rings in my head
You need me.
