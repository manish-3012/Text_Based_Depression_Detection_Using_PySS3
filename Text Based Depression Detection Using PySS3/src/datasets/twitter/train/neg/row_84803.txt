Life was bad and Iâ€™m bad at lifeDad was a paranoid schizophrenic and alcoholic. Mom was poor and I grew up poor with extremely crooked teeth I didnâ€™t get fixed til I was 25 but I let destroy my self-esteem before that and it held me back. Just a total jack-o-lantern smile. I tried college but failed out twice due to panic attacks the first time, and depression the second time, mostly just from the pressure of being behind my peers and intense financial constraints. After failure #2, my Mom lost her house and had to move in with me which really didnâ€™t help my dating or social life. At that point I think I started giving up. Got into drinking to escape feeling trapped which temporarily really worked, but of course only made things much worse. Somehow had a pretty awesome ex-girlfriend come back to me last year who I hoped to join in NYC but was too broke to make the move at the time. Got too stressed about money and freaked out about it, so she ditched me which I canâ€™t blame her for. The worst thing is she said she felt guilty. She went from in love with me to guilt over abandoning me. Ended up making the most Iâ€™d ever had by far a few months later, and if Iâ€™d just chilled maybe Iâ€™d be there with her now. She ended up marrying a rich kid in the meantime.

I got depressed and anxious months ago about this and about my failures and mistakes in life. Had a nervous breakdown and ditched the job. Realized recently I just made things so much worse by not pushing further but honestly, I just felt done. Now I am totally done. Iâ€™m just so done with this. Iâ€™m bad at life. It was fucking bad to me. I didnâ€™t ask to be born into this.
