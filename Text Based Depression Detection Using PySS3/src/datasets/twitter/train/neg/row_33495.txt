I can't keep living like this anymoreI know I'm not tipped enough over the edge yet to end myself, but I'm hanging on it just enough to drink/smoke myself into numbness. 

I tried xanax once or twice before and it was the calmest I ever felt, like sleeping in a really warm blanket. I miss that feeling and I've been having extreme urges to take it again. I know I'll probably get addicted at this point in my life. It feels like watching a car crash and being unable to do anything about it. I'm using every ounce of self control by consciously avoiding people/places I know can get me some xanax.

I'm diagnised bipolar with mixed features, but my biggest issue is this fucking constant anxiety, every fucking day. I don't feel like myself. I've never felt like myself. I've been depressed since I was 13. Had my first hypomanic episode at 16. Basically drank to the point of being taken to an ER. I remember being drunk and repeating to my disappointed parents "I need to be numb I need to be numb, mom, I need to be numb". I've never seen them like that before. I'm 22 now and this nightmare has lasted for way to fucking long.

On the outside I'm a smart, successful, moderately attractive woman, but I've witnessed physical and emotional abuse as a child. I've been raped. I've moved to a completely different country all by myself at 18, barely speaking the language. I've built myself from the ground completely, I've tried to be strong for so, so, long...
But I'm getting tired. I'm really fucking tired. I know I wont take an active action to kill myself, but I know for sure if I start with xanax again, that will one day kill me. 

I'm really tired
