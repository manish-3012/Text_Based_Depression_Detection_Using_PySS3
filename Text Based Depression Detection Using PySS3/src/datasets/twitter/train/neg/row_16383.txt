I keep looking up the most painless and easy way to end my life...Iâ€™ve struggled with depression since I was a kid. Although before it was manageable, the past 5 years itâ€™s been significantly worse. The older I get (30 now) the more I wonder what the point is... it seems like an endless cycle of wanting to be happy and finding temporary relief through activities, friends, or a girlfriend but I always end up back in the dumps. I donâ€™t have any specific reason to be depressed so it makes me feel even worse about it. I had a pretty rough childhood which has had an affect on me as an adult but from the outside I have a good life. My depression has made it difficult to feel connected to things and people and lately at night I find myself looking up ways to end it. I keep thinking I wonâ€™t actually do anything but lately Iâ€™m not sure anymore. I want to find meaning in something... anything... I want a reason to live but I just canâ€™t feel empty inside anymore.
