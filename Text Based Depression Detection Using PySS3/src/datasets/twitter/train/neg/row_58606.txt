GoodbyeIâ€™m done, I canâ€™t do this shit anymore. Itâ€™s no longer worth it. Thereâ€™s nothing left for me here other than more pointless suffering. This has already been set in motion for over a year now, the only reason I decided not to just end it all last year was because I was pregnant. But I lost the baby so itâ€™s not like it matters anymore, my only reason for living is gone. I donâ€™t care how sad or hurt other people will be like this, theyâ€™ll move on and Iâ€™m done always putting others first. Iâ€™m done with the constant panic attacks at school. Iâ€™m done with just sitting in class thinking of ways to kill myself, Iâ€™m actually going to do it now. Iâ€™m done. Iâ€™m fucking done. I donâ€™t fucking care anymore, people can say Iâ€™m selfish for doing this all they want. Iâ€™m just fucking done. Iâ€™ll be with you soon Evalee
