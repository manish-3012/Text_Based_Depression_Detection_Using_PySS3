I don't know how to explain what I'm feeling and what I've been through.
I have been through significant amounts of trauma and i was thrown away by "loved ones" many times. For some reason I could never scream out to the people around me that I'm not alright, I don't understand what this is? I just couldn't say what was going on with me.
The bullying and racism at school, the abuse at home.
The loneliness and isolation. Developing BPD due to years of daily trauma. Feeling so emotionaly disconnected that noone can understand what I'm feeling. God made me to suffer so much it doesn't make any sense. I get that life has its trials but damn...not a single person would smile in my face when they see me, I was just a kid. My mom telling me she's ashamed of me and tells me I'm ugly because I'm overweight as a fucking 7 years old, my first time thinking of suicide at the age of 7. 
My sister abusing me. Nobody ever gave a fuck, I had some kind of faith in some god and I prayed but to no avail. I fucking hate my miserable mistake of a life.
I don't get it why am I alive? Why didn't I kill myself or scream for help or fight back or do anything. Why didn't I have any choice in any of this hell? Why does none of it have any fucking meaning? Why am I alone? Why was I so powerless in everything that had happened to me?
Why was I born? Why is my life so painful constantly and so draining without any breaks?
