Iâ€™m so tired of tryingThe past 10 years of my life has been really hard. And considering Iâ€™m in my early 20â€™s... yikes. First my family went bankrupt. Then came emotional abuse. Then came drug abuse. Then came sexual assault. And finally, a glimmer of hope in getting married. 

Weâ€™ve been together for a couple years now, and it hasnâ€™t been easy because our pasts are complicated. I thought everything was gonna be okay, because weâ€™ve been so happy together so far.  But the past month he keeps casually mentioning that maybe our relationship isnâ€™t gonna work out. Today we had a fight and I think this time heâ€™s done. And I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m going to do. But my life has been so full of pain and trauma that I really donâ€™t see a point in it continuing if it doesnâ€™t work out. I donâ€™t want to say that to him because it would be unhealthy and manipulative to tell him â€œif you leave me Iâ€™m going to kill myselfâ€ but I honestly think thatâ€™s what will happen. Iâ€™m just so tired of trying to make my life work. Iâ€™m so fucking tired.
