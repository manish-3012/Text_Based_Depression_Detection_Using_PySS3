I think I might actually do it...This year has been an absolute horrible, painful and cruel period. I turned 18 this year. I got pregnant with my pedo stepdads kid. I caught COVID-19. I lost a pregnancy that was going to show that the abuse I'd been told to believe is fake was true. My mom got sick, and there was a huge blow up when I insisted she go to the hospital. Huge fight breaks out from when they came home to 3 days later. The police were called 4 times, my bedroom door was broken down, they took my phone.... yeah, I had to leave immediately. I went to a youth homeless shelter and stayed for 6 months. It was full of drama and stress that made me constantly sick. There are people there that I cant be around anymore. I was on nd hathe streets for a month, that was awful and made me want to die every single day. I tried to get a restraining order against stepdad where him and my mom tried to use my own medical records to show my mental diagnosese made me lie (which it doesn't). Then I stayed with my friend, which has been nice but I need to leave soon...

I'm neurodivergent, severely trauatized and I just cant get up on my own two feet alone. And no one will help me. I am constantly exhausted but unable to sleep, in very intense pain, dissociated and confused. So maybe I'm just better off dead.

So so so much has happened to me. I
 getting tired of remembering I just want the memories to die.

And it feels like I'm already dead.

Its getting really hard to stop those thoughts about how I'm gonna kill myself. Ive found myself being submissive towards it. I really think I might do it this time. 

I feel like I should be scared but I'm honestly happy. I want this all to be over alreadly...
