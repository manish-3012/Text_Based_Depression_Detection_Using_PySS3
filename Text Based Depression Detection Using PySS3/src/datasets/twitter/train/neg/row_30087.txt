It's the second-ish week of school and I already want to kill myself.every single year school gets worse and worse. i'm so stressed. and i feel tired. but like exhausted. physically, mentally, and emotionally exhausted.

but guess what? nobody cares because "i'm just a kid" and "this is just teenage angst" and "i'm just exaggerating" and "i'm too young to be sad." 

as we all know, the voice of anybody younger than you means nothing and you should immediately disregard them. 

i hate my life, and i should honestly just kill myself already. maybe I'll do it tomorrow. fuck everything.
