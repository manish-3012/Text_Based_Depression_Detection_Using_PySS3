I'm still struggling, I'm not sure how to get out of my headI'm still struggling, I know I'm depressed. I have met a few great women already and I can put up that front, but I'm just a hollow person. They deserve better and I can't let her and our child go.

I'm trying to move on but I'm not sure I ever truly will. I feel like the only reason to continue is practical reasons and that life is just gone from me. Sometimes it's better to just ease the pain.
