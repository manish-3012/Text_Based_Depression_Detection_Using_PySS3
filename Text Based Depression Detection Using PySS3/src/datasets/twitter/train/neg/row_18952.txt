I was close today but I just want to talk with someone right nowWhenever Iâ€™d get down Iâ€™d always find myself contemplating suicide and I feel like each time I do I get closer n closer to doing it that I feel like I really almost committed today. I always feel like telling a friend but I hate the idea that they would shun me for it or really just see me different than they do. I feel like theyâ€™d see me as a ticking time bomb or something and I donâ€™t want that. To try n get rid of this in between of wanting to talk but feeling like I canâ€™t, anyone kind enough to help?
