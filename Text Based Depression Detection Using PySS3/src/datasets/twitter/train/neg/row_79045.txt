Being home makes me want to yeet myself into trafficMy mom's a schizo addict who used to guilt trip us into keeping her from committing, and my stepmom's an alcoholic control freak; thanks for the great taste in women, Dad.

I was really suicidal for most of my teens, starting around 13-14 when I lived with my Mom post-divorce and she abused my siblings and myself. She overdosed and went into a coma for a week or so, and I still find myself thinking back to those days but at least they ended because of it. I tried therapy a couple times, but never clicked with a therapist and gave up. I graduated, went to college, and things got better; still suicidal, still have the depressive spells and the cyclic mood, but much more manageable. To the point where I could enjoy life sometimes. 

Being back home, I bend over backwards to not be rude, have to be overly submissive and polite, and get absolutely 0 recognition or thanks for it. Not even a "thanks" or "you're welcome." Any bit of rudeness causes a flip out. And I feel myself slipping back into old depressive habits. It feels like the old days, when I'd just lay in my bed all afternoon and think about killing myself, except now I can't even go on drives to get out of the house or scream in a parking lot 'cause some fucker ate a bat. 

Whenever I've brought this kind of thing up in the past, I get half-assed support with a focus on the "things that matter." Keep getting straight As, forget about wanting to kill yourself. Yeah things suck, but you're doing so well. When things don't go well because I lose the motivation to do anything and when I try to do things I feel lost in a fucking mental fog, the problem isn't my mental health, it's the impact my mental health has on measurable metrics of success. I can only compartmentalize for so fucking long before something rips through too many compartments and the boat fucking sinks.
