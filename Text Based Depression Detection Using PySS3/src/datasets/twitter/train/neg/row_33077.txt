Iâ€™ve hated myself all my lifeM 16 I want to die. I feel like Iâ€™ve never been good enough. I feel like Iâ€™ve wasted my life. I was on here months ago in a different acc. I started feeling a bit better after being sent to the psychiatric hospital in October. Bullied low confidence anxiety and depression. Never dated and every single time I try just doesnâ€™t ever go well. Started working on my self but itâ€™s hard to continue sometimes when life depression wants u dead. I feel like such a loser Iâ€™ve e hated myself for as long as I can remember. Picked up hobbies like going to the gym and skating but ever since we got quarantined itâ€™s not as easy doing that stuff. Just feels like life is pointless and my existence means nothing
