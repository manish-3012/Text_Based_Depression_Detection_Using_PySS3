What's the point?What's the point if no one will speak to you?

What's the point if every girl tries her best to stay away from you because you're ugly?

What's the point if you can't experience the best things in this world?

What's the point if everyone else is living a normal life?

What's the point if you have always suffered?

What's the point if you will never find love?

What's the point if you can't live?

What's the point...

There is no point... Why are we still here?
