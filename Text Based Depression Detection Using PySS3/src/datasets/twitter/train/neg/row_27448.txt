I donâ€™t know about this anymoreAs I took my walk tonight I reflexed on my past I have been struggling with some depression recently so iv been stuck in my head I have found life hard to live with out purpose 

Iâ€™m a 26M iv been in two serious relationships and I always seem to push them away with my insecurities all I wanted in life was a family but I feel it was not meant for me 

I canâ€™t take it any longer I unfortunately own a few guns and I spend most nights staring at them drinking until I pass out I feel itâ€™s only a matter of time till I man up and do something about it Iâ€™m hundreds of miles from any friends or family and Iâ€™m alone all I have is this sad music and my guns I just want to be loved wanted anyways bye
