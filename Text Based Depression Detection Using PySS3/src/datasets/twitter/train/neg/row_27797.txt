An attempt was made...Two days ago I was in a major depressive state. I was crying for no reason for hours. At some point I just took a deep breath, walked to where I keep my medicines, and proceeded to empty them all into my stomach. I passed out about 30 minutes after woke up several hours later with diarrhea and a killer headache but still here.

I dont know what to do anymore. Theres no reason for me to feel this way but I do. The ideation is turning into actions. Therapy isn't helping. The medications arent helping. 

I think it is just a matter of time.
