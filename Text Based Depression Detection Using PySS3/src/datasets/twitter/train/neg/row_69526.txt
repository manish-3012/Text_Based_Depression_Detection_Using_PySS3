Sick of knowing that I want to die but being unable to.Had a recent lame suicide attempt in which I tried to OD on benzos (which I'm addicted to and have to buy online) and alcohol which only resulted in me going crazy and making an ass of myself.

Saw a doctor today and can't stand the the thought of trying Counselling again, with them pointlessly trying to tell me that I shouldn't try and kill myself. My suicidal thoughts are perfectly logical.

I'm 28, I've already fucked up my life beyond all recognition and things just keep getting worse and worse. My social anxiety and social isolation have reached a point where getting a job and being a functioning member of society seems completely unrealistic.

I just envy people who live in America that can just buy a handgun and shoot themselves in the head.
