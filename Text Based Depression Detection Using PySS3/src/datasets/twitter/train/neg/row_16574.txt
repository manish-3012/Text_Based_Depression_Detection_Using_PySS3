Dear Society, please accept that we are broken and want to die.I just wish suicide isn't seen as bad. I think it's perfectly fine to decide yourself if you no longer want to live anymore. For who do we have to keep suffering? For who do we have to keep working? Nobody. 

Just grant us a peaceful death. Give us a pill that we can take and we get a guaranteed death. 
It's the worst when suicidal people attempt and fail. I don't want to fail..
