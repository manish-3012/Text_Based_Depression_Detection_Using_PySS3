Eureka?After struggling with vague but profound and completely treatment-resistant depression for the last ten years, I  think I've finally gotten to the bottom of it: I'm depressed because there's never been the slightest shred of genuine hardship in my life. I'm not rich or anything (hell, I don't even think I'm middle-class) but I've had no life-threatening illnesses, no car accidents, no bar fights, no psycho ex girlfriends, no identity theft, no legal trouble.

This is why my psychiatrist told me five years ago that "you always like to look like you're struggling." This is why whenever something terrible happens to one of my friends, I always feel a subtle twinge of jealousy. (And then I rush in and help them out. But that's another story.) This is why all my daydreams involve me getting into some sort of trouble.

My life is BORING. If there were any genuine hardship in my life, then, by dealing with it, I'd finally be able to find out what kind of person I really am.

My question is: how do I attract trouble to myself?
