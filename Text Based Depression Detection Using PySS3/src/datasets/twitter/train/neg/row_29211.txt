itâ€™s only the little things keeping me alive rnlike i donâ€™t want to live because of my family or whatever. my room looks like flaming garbage, and i donâ€™t want people going through that when i die. i also need to finish a certain show, and slowly destroy evidence that i existed in the first place. once those things are done then i can finally be done. i donâ€™t care about growing up or â€œhearing my soulmates laughâ€ or anything like that. i just donâ€™t want to be remembered
