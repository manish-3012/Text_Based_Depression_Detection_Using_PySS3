I want to die but Iâ€™m too scaredIâ€™m a doctor. In Ireland. Training to be a GP. Working in Emergency Department. Iâ€™m useless at my job. Only got into medicine because I had a good memory and no social life as a teen hence nothing better to do. Got through medical school by small miracle. Now Iâ€™m fucking fed up with this shit .stupid fat girl life will never get better for me. Drinking is only thing that lifts me out of this for a time. Stupid stupid stupid. I know I could get some amitryptyline benzodiazepines from the ED , have a nice few beers for myself beforehand, enjoy them and then take them all so as I wouldnâ€™t have to keep pushing through this inevitable unhappiness despair and suffering for the rest of my life. I wish my boyfriend didnâ€™t love me and then I would have no one to hurt and I could just do it
