Iâ€™m in so much pain and just want to rant into the wind to people who know what itâ€™s like in a wayThe anxiety makes me always on edge, the depression is always second guessing itself and the ADHD just makes me as good as a potato is a lighting lightbulbs; sure it can work but itâ€™s really inefficient and ineffective so thereâ€™s no point of trying. Iâ€™ve recently dropped out of hs, Iâ€™m on lexapro, Iâ€™m a fucking failure with anger issues and a hand thatâ€™s more than likely been broke for a week with a mom that refuses to take me to the hospital because thereâ€™s nothing the doctor can do. At least I can pour my waste of energy into work and Minecraft, who am I kidding? Iâ€™m too fucking lazy and unmotivated to get out of bed in the morning. I wish I had the motivation to od on all the meds that donâ€™t work. I might take a few vyvanse as a pick me up tomorrow bc heart rate increases are fun and work stresses my already paranoid ass out
