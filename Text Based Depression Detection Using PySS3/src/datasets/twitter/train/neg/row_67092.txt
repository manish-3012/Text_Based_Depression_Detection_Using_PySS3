IS THIS FAIR? Pls put your opinion! About being excludedBasically my schools grad was cancelled cus of covid but now the lockdown measures have decreased and parties are allowed. So all the cool and popular kids formed a party for grad and invited around half the year. But the other half wasnâ€™t invited even tho they had been in this school since FOREVER and now theyâ€™re leaving. And no party or appreciation for them. Is this fair?!??

Ps. I didnâ€™t get invited and I asked someone why and they said chill just wait and get popular and people will invite you. Quite bummed out about this
