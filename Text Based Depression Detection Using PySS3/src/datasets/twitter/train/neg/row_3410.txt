i can tell i'm going to do it soon 19fman

it hurts so much thinking about everything i've fucked up. 19, rape victim, ex drug addict, depressed, working a miserable job, attending college online. i had so much fucking potential. i know they say that to all of us but i almost felt it too. i remember winning poetry awards and getting published then i moved after high school and disappeared.

 i feel like i'm holding my boyfriend back from his full potential or even being happy. i'm so sick all the time and he has to pick up my slack. he would never say this but i know i'm wearing him down. arent i saving him more pain in the long run? today he did something adorable and right when he left the room i started crying because i thought about how many moments i'll miss like that. i'm going to miss you.

to my family that has no idea who i am, i don't know how you'll react. i hope you never find out i'm bisexual, non-christian, pot-smoking, living with my boyfriend, etc. i hope i'm strong enough to do this before any damning information comes to light and i disappoint you. 

i feel calm, like the same feeling you get when you find out a suffering loved one has died. just acceptance. i'm going to end my life by suicide, it's just now a game of how much i can take before i do
