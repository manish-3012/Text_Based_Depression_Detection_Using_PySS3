I Don't know what to doI had betrayed my parent's trust (i don't feel too comfortable going into the details). they have been furious with me (rightfully so) but then settled down. I genuinely don't know what provoked them recently but they really came down on me today. They told me that I should have never been born and that they should have gotten an abortion, they said they didn't care if I died on the streets and that they didn't care about me at all. The guilt of what I had done has been eating away at me for the past few weeks and now I just feel hopeless, I sincerely hate myself and feel as though I should just end it all. there's no one in my life who really supports me now, everyone who did just avoids me and glares at me with disgust. I can't take feeling alone anymore. I just want the pain to go away
