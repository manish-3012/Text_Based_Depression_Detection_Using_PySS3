iâ€™m better but i canâ€™t stop thinking about it, why?iâ€™ve been better for a little while, iâ€™m doing things again and i have energy but man do i still have the thoughts
itâ€™s not that bad, like when i think really hard into it i donâ€™t know if i want to die, whereas at most other times it was obvious that it was the better option, i just kept  myself from it
i still need to do that, i know for a goddamn fact i canâ€™t let go but then why am i still thinking like this? i donâ€™t want it, i donâ€™t need it, i donâ€™t understand it. i just wanna forget itâ€™s an option but i donâ€™t know how to, has anyone here actually stopped being suicidal and how do you do that?
