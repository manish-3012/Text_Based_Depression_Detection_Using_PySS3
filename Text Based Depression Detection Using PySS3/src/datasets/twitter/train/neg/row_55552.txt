HelloI'm a bit nervous to post here, because normally I hate drawing attention to myself. But maybe it will help if I type this for other people to see. 

I have a group of friends that I care about and a family that loves me very much, as I love them. Yet I still get these feelings that hurt me inside. Things will be going great and I won't have a care in the world. Then the smallest thing will set me off, and give me all of these bad thoughts. 

I'm sure they stem from my own insecurities, but my brain makes up these scenarios that nobody really likes me, that they're pretending. That they probably find me annoying or obnoxious because of how I cling to the few people that I think care about me in my life. That they would probably prefer it if it was just them hanging out without me. 

When these thoughts come to my mind, it gives my anxiety. I get worried over nothing, I start overthinking everything, and my chest starts hurting. After that subsides, I just get really sad and I get suicidal thoughts. Like maybe they would all be better off not having someone with this much emotional baggage in their life. 

I know that I have people in my life who would be terribly sad if I died, which I'm sure is one of the biggest reasons that I haven't done anything too crazy. But the thoughts in my head keep coming back, and it's driving me a bit crazy. 

I apologize if this is not the sub I should be posting this in. Thank you for reading.
