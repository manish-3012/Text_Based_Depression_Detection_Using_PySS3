How do people hang themselves sitting/laying down ?I tried earlier. Tied a simple noose knot, tied it to a wooden thing above my bed, put it round by neck and tried to pull away. I had some pressure in my head and hoped Iâ€™d pass out But I didnâ€™t, it obviously wasnâ€™t tight enough, 

I so badly wanted it to happen today but it didnâ€™t work. I donâ€™t wanna do it from a tree, I just wanna be able to do it in my bedroom laying down 

Someone help with how you do this correctly
