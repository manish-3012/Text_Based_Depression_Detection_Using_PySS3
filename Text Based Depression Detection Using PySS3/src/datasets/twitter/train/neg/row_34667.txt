The only thing holding me backThe only reason i haven't committed suicide yet is how my dad would respond, hes my only friend but i hardly get to see him and the best days of my life were spent with him. Hes what puts a smile on my face seeing him happy. I have to primarily live with my mother because of a divorce but in a few monthes im legally allowed to choose who i wish to live with and maybe that will change my mind. But for now im not positive what i am doing.
