I'm going to hang myself tomorrow morningBecause I'm lonely, I've never had someone who I felt I could tell anything I want to in person.  The only thing I know so far that would keep me from hanging myself is if I had a deep emotional connection to someone like a true best friend.  I've tried, really I've tried, but the pain of being alone is too much for me to handle.  I have no hope for myself.  I'm willing to talk to people though which is why I've made this post, I like people.  I wish the best for everyone, really.
