Suicide seems like a pretty easy and logical answer to all my problems, and it scares me.Recently im in college, working as a waiter and going to the gym. When anything gets rough,  even small things like failing a quiz, i think to myself "i could just kill myself and it would be over." "I wont have to worry about this if i just kill myself" i thought everyone thought this way until i was vocal about it to my friend and he told me its not normal. Im a fairly friendly and nice guy, i like making people happy and making my family proud. My life isnt rough and i live in a nice place. But whenever i feel bad, i think about just killing myself, and its not a hypothetical in my head, its something i could easily see myself doing, i just haven't yet. I dont know what to do about all this, i really feel like dying is easier than living life which is such a weird feeling, i have a lot to live for, but none of it seems worth it, or becomes less worth it as time goes by. Life isnt as nice as i thought, even as i get older it just gets worse and worse. I dunno what im feeling but it's weird. 

Im also a 21 male if that means anything.
