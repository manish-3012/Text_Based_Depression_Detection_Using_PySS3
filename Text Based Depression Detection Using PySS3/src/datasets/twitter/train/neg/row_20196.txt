Does anyone else have a deadline?If so, what made you pick that one? what are you expecting to do during that time? Is there something that could make you change your mind?

Mine is somwhere at 24 or before. Sometimes I think that if I have a son I won't do it, a part of me would love to take care of him but... my problems would still be existing, it won't be good. It's sad to know that I'll miss that but I guess things just happened to be this way.
