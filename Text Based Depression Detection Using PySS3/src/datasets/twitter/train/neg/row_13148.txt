DownSomeone just told me that my time was valuable to someone in my life and in that moment I was so ready to blurt out then why does everybody want me to leave them alone? My best friends stopped talking to me, my crush who I've known for a year now won't talk to me and my parents only speak if spoken to. So when will my time become valuable, bc rn it's only value is waiting for everyone else to deem me worthy of one fucking minute.
