I posted here a week ago and now I'm doing much better!I just really want to thank everyone on this sub. I came here originally to help myself and hopefully others along the way.

I eventually broke down and posted here myself. I was close to using my bfs gun and shooting myself in the head. I was so convinced that I couldn't be depressed because I could still laugh sometimes, though some days I felt like this. It felt hopeless and lonely and awful and I just wanted it to stop. I couldn't do it anymore, it was too much. So I asked for help.

I'm not trying to promote any specific class of therapy or treatment but I received some for myself. I went to the emergency room and they took care of the rest. I'm now on some medication and feeling fairly better. 

I've struggled with suicidal thoughts since I was 8 years old. That calls for a chemical imbalance in the brain that I needed to accept help for to continue on. 

The best thing I could have done was ask for help and I'm so glad for every person on this sub and for what they're doing. For the people posting and the people commenting. It takes a lot of strength to ask for help and we're on the front lines all the time. 

I just really wanted to thank the person who commented on my post and suggested that I ask for help. Without that suggestion I'm not sure I would still be alive today
