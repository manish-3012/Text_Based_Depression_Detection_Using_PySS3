See you at the bus stop.Several years ago I was part of an IRC channel dedicated to support for suicide and depression. It disappeared because the original OP and site runner became too busy.  

I've been feeling pretty crappy so I'm going to attempt to man the site as often as I can.

It will be on the freenode.net irc network. you can get there with a free web client from here: http://webchat.freenode.net/
join the channel #alt.suicide.bus.stop

You may not see anyone there, and even when I'm there I may not respond. But please persevere, I'm hoping eventually we will reach critical mass and eventually about a dozen people will be on channel continuously.

See you at the bus stop.


EDIT: 
Rules: you cannot discuss methods. That is, you can't tell people how to kill themselves. The channel is for moral support.

EDIT 2:
I guess there is already a channel for this: #suicidewatch. 
If this channel ever passes critical mass, I'll go back to manning #alt.suicide.bus.stop, but for now, I'll abandon it.
