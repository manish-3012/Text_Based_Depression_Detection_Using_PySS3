The time has finally come.I'm finally ready to end it all. After 25 years of a sickening life, i'm ready to end it all. I should have done it earlier, but my life was all about coping. I'll die with depression and as an involutary celibate (thought of resorting to sex work before death, but I have no motivation for that). I'll die in the city (The Invicta) I love the most, and where I was born. The bridge is 75 meters tall, so it should be enough to kill me if I fall on concrete. Goodbye meaningless world.
