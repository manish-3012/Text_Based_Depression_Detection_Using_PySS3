some thoughtsiâ€™m not good with words and i also donâ€™t know how to start this, so iâ€™ll just jump right into it. im socially awkward and most people see me as strange and an inconvenience. i only have one friend but at least she hasnâ€™t left yet. nobody talks to me on a daily basis but i donâ€™t really mind being alone at this point, iâ€™ve adapted to isolation and alienation. i think about suicide every day pretty much, but iâ€™ve decided to do it only when the pain becomes unbearable and when iâ€™ve thought and tried every possible solution. i can tolerate a lot on my own, but i assume that having someone to support you occasionally might be nice. i try to be strong for my friend and family whenever they need me, but when iâ€™m struggling with existence i canâ€™t rely on them like they rely on me. in the end, i do believe that my life will be cut short by my own hands. i cannot foresee myself living to an old age. i continue to search for reasons to live, but i currently have found none. i just started college and i already wish to drop out. i have lost all interests in my hobbies and i have no drive to have a career or to even leave my room. there is no purpose on this earth for me as far as i know and even if someone does care about me i wouldnâ€™t be sure why they did. the world seems dim and everything will fade with time. nothing is permanent, so why should i bother staying when i will experience nothing but disappointment and sadness. at least not having expectations helps to lessen the pain of them being unmet. (if anyone does reply for some reason, iâ€™d rather keep religion out of the conversation)
