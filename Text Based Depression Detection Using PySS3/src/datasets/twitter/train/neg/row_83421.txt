My depression and misery is internalItâ€™s not because of the environment Iâ€™m in. Itâ€™s not because of one specific problem I have. Issues and obstacles make it worse, but the sadness and grief comes from within. I am the problem. I beat myself up and make myself out to be a failure. I am the one with the irrational what if scenarios and negative self talk. Everyday is a struggle and itâ€™s not even because anything in my life is particularly hard. My own neurotic brain makes most of my problems for me, and makes the other problems that I canâ€™t control harder to tolerate. 
I think something is fundamentally different with the way I think. I donâ€™t view life as inherently meaningful and good. It is struggle and turmoil and suffering. The worst part is that Iâ€™m technically one of the lucky ones. I have food, water, friends, family, I am not chronically ill. And yet I am aware that at any moment all these things could be ripped away and Iâ€™d be left alone and in pain. I am consumed with depression, anxiety, and intrusive thoughts. I have no motivation. The future is terrifying and the past makes me feel guilty. I am trying to be strong but it is hard. The only thing that makes me feel somewhat useful is helping out those around me, like my friends, who also struggle with mental health. The world seems more fucked up by the day.
