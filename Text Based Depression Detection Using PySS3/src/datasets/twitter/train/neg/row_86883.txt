I feel lovedI've been stressed and cripplingly depressed for a bit now. Finals are coming up, it's the holiday season, family stuff, and all that. 

But today I went into my school's cafeteria for a change for breakfast instead of going to class immediately or staying in my car. I sat by a senior student acquaintance I have and he had a really concerned look on his face. He said something to me along the lines of "Are you ok? I haven't seen you around in like a month. Do you need a hug?" and put his hand on my shoulder. 

I have a tendency to distance myself from people, especially really touchy/loud people, so I've kinda parted from sitting with him and his table at lunch for a month or two now? I don't know, I felt like I wasn't fitting in so I sit by myself now.

Anyways I was like "What yeah I'm fine haha I just like sitting by myself I've been here all this time" and gave him a weird look so he'd stop feeling bad for me. He stopped, which was nice, but after he turned away I felt like I almost wanted to cry right there. It felt SO NICE that someone who I dont even really consider much of a friend was just. worried about me? Like, a stranger practically is concerned for my wellbeing. Wow. I've been so miserable lately and seriously contemplating a lot of things (might do it in 2020) but he really lit me up today. School was still shit, but that was a nice way to start the day.
