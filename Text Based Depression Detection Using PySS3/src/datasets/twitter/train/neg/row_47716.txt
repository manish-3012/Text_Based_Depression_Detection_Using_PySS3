Fuck this20 years old. No job. No interest of getting a job. No girlfriend. No money. No motivation. Can someone give me one reason to carry on living? I fail to see any reason at all. Maybe if I were a millionaire and I could relax on a beach somewhere. But like most my life will consist of scraping by, living pay check to pay check, stuck in the rat race while feeling fully satisfied. So I ask again, can anyone give me one point in carrying on living?
