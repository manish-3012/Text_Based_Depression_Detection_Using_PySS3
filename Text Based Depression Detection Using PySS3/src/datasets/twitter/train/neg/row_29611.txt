Broke. 2 Kids. Facing Divorce. Can't Provide.My wife hates me. We've been married nine years. I don't hate her. I work insane hours to try and provide, she stays home with the kids. I do not begrudge her. But she hates me. She says I don't do enough to try and help. That isn't true, but it can understandably look that way from her point of view. I try to explain, she doesn't listen. She's made up her mind about me and won't listen to anything I say. She thinks I sit around after work drinking with my colleagues and talking shit about her. Not a single part of that is true.

We have two kids that I love more than anything on this planet. I would do anything for them but only get to see them a little bit in the morning before work and on the weekends since they're asleep by the time I get home.

We recently bought a house that's far away from where I work but close to her parents' house. If we get a divorce we'll have to sell it. We're barely getting by as things are now, but if we get divorced there's no way on earth I can afford a place for myself to live and child support.

I have insurance policies that pay out even in the case of suicide. Leaving that money for my kids would be better for them than anything I could provide alive, since if we divorce she'll get the kids and I'll see them even less than I do now. At least they'll have some money.

If I don't kill myself, I'll have the depression of not being able to see my kids, stressing out about paying child support and bills, and a job I don't like with insane hours. And no friends.

This doesn't seem like a difficult choice.
