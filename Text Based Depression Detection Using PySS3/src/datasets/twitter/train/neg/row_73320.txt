im not sure why i feel like this ????idk. i should be happy? i did just get out if a really abusive relationship a few months ago but im happy now. my birthday is tomorrow, they increased my testosterone dose, im doing okay in school. so im not sure why i feel like this. the only thing i can think of is they switched from the hybrid schedule at school to everyone in the building which means i have ti face my abuser. thats all i can think of?
idk. im struggling. i havent showered since Thursday, i have missing assignments, i havent done laundry in awhile either. im fucking tired. its so hard to get out of bed. 
im not sure why my freetime is taken up by thiights of dying. my friend sent me a picture of them in a hospital bed asleep cause they burnt their hand pretty bad and all i could think of is how others would react or what they would think if that was me?
i truly wonder what others would think/do if i killed myself. i see whats happened with a couple others when they've killed themselves, but they had reason to. they were being bullied or had bad home lives. my mom isnt like super bad or anything and im not being bullied. im just fucking tired. what would my abuser think? hed probably make it about himself. i dont know. i dont fucking know.
