Hey.You know is there a meaning to life? Or death. I have not found it. All I see is that my existent  is useless. I wish those assisted suicide machines were already legal. Iâ€™d sign up ASAP. I donâ€™t need to be here but I canâ€™t cut my arms anymore. Itâ€™s too hard. I need a gun. I need to die. 
Fuck my life. Fuck me. Fuck. I need to die.
