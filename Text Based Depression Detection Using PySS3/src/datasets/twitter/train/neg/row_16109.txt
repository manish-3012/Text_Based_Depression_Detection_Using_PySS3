Compulsive urges to hurt selfI feel pretty inadequate and less than other people, I think my self esteem may lead in part to these thoughts. I'm also above average height. I constantly want to, or not want to but I vision myself hitting my head and it feels good. It was easy to ignore and first but the thoughts are escalating and when I was eating dinner I had a compulsion to stick my fork in my eye, even though I know it would be excruciating. I have never self harmed in my life, never physically and never had the urge to cut. It's really frightening, anyone dealt with something similar?
