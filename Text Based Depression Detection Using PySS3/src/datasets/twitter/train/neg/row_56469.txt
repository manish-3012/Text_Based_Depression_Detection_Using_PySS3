I'm done. Tonight.I've been down before and needed help, but never like this. I barely even get out of bed. I'm indifferent about the people around me. No, in fact I'm not indifferent, I actively dislike a lot of the people around me. I suppose I'm envious of their happiness and direction in life. I wake up and see no point. I'm the unhappiest I've ever been and I just want to die. Is that so wrong?

The only reason I'm still here is because I'm scared of the stigma attached to suicide. I didn't want to hurt people, but now I'm beyond even that. I go to sleep every night wishing that tomorrow I get hit by a car, or have a heart attack so that I don't have to be here anymore, but I know it won't happen, so I'm going to take action.

I don't really know why I'm posting here... I suppose because I want to at least have a few people give a shit before my insignificant and ant-like life is brought to a closure, and thank fuck when it is.
