I know something is wrong. But I canâ€™t tell what it is.For the last month Iâ€™ve been in an alternating state of panic and then switching myself to being â€œonâ€ for other people. Iâ€™m just so tired and sick of all of the charades.

I think I need to go to the hospital. But I canâ€™t do that again, itâ€™s too damn expensive in the US. Plus I need to work tomorrow and look after a friends cat.
