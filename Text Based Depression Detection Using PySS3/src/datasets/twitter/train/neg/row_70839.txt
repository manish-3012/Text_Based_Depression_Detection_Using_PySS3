I just feel like I'm worthless now.For the past while, a lot of stuff has gone done with my brother. To make a long story short, he got arrested, was in mental care, and threatened to kill our mother the next time he had a sharp object. He is not living with us for the moment, and every time I see him it just doesn't feel the same. And my brother is my everything. I've been extremely stressful in school because I have this stupid dream to do what my mom wants me to do, not what I want to. I'm in a very very hard school, and it just tears me apart. And then with my brother, it's almost too much. I'm falling in school, because I can't stop thinking about it. And every time I have suicidal thoughts, the only thing that holds me back is how torn everyone I care about would be. It just hurts.
