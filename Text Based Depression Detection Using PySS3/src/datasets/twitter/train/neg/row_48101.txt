ParentsHey. So I match all but one of the symptoms of depression, and match better the symptoms of teen depression. I have told my parents of this. Several times. Crying. Screaming. Normal voice. Driving to school. Going to bed. When I don't wan't to do a chore. But the problem is, their responce is always to: "Stop using the computer." So then I tell them the truth, which is that the only reason I use the computer so much is because it helps distract me from the thoughts in my head. But they're just like, go to bed. Or laugh and not respond. Not respond at all. Repeat that I should just stop using the computer. It's NOT HELPFUL. I want to figure out how to make them listen. (My sister listens, but she's a broke colledge student so she can't help, and I have no friends close enough to spill my heart out to so basically i'm stuck with nothing but my laptop and my schoolwork) [Suicide and running away cross my mind every night, and i am curious about death, but I still have enough brain left to see that my mother would probably die if i died b/c her parents are dead, her brother-in-law is dead, and her sister is dying of cancer, and she wants to divorce my dad, so im not hopeless enough to stoop that low yet. But im worried. and i dont know how to help myself.]
