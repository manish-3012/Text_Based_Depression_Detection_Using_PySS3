I'm so numbI can't do this, my Girlfriend of 5 years left me, I had to move across the country to be with family. She was my only friend and now everything hurts I'm going to end it, once she forgets about me and I move out. I really wanted to change for you Tin, I'm sorry I wasn't strong enough and I can't keep our pinky promises.
