I think this is it.So to start off I've been in a relationship for nearly 2 years now, it has had its really great moments and it's really down moments as all relationships have. But now I think it has to a point where it won't come back. Just small things overtime building up to a point where she feels like it's not worth it? I'm not sure. Overall I feel like I've been given up on. I think that over the course of the relationship that I've been given unreasonable expectations. Probably because  for the longest time, I would do everything I could, give it all I had to make it work. It might of just become an expectation now that I would always go to the enth degree to make it work. Like any person I've made many mistakes before, some big some small, always working through it, but it's different now. Now I think that no matter what I try, not matter what I do it wouldn't change anything and that makes me sick to my stomach. Overall I can't say that I've been unhappy with my effort in this, I think I gave it everything I had. 

I've tried to end my life twice before this, the second nearly infront of my partner, but I was pulled from the tracks and somehow we were still together after that. I promised never to do it again but I guess I just suck. After I realised that I probably can't fix it everything just clicked. I know what I want to do. I know that if I was to keep on going I would always live with so many 'what-ifs', so much guilt, dread and pain. That's not what I want.

I don't blame my partner for this, this line of thinking is definitely not her fault. The plan I have is what I want to do. I don't want pain, I don't want to look back at what was a great person and think to myself that I wasn't good enough or that I blew it. I just want out, to tap out, to stop. It's what I want.
