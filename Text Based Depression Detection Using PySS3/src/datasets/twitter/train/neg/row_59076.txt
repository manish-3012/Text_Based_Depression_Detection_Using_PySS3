Fuck this degrading and aging body, fuck lifeBeing in the perpetual feedback from life, my body and surroundings, I need to give myself nothingness. 

Life for me is a negative sum, the asymmetry of pain and pleasure has been present my whole life. I as a kid thought that I will escape the clutches of my country, family and my bad memories. But I only continue to build on the bad.

Born with autoimmune disorders, I have tested positive for the HLA-B27. I also have cystic acne, Raynaud's, digestive problems, brain fog, hand tremors, dyscalculia, dyspraxia, depression, kyphoscoliosis, weak connective tissue, back pain, neck pain, bad teeth, weak bones (low mineralization) and I am only fucking 25. I am not waiting to see what the other years have in store for me. 
For anyone who thinks God, society, family has the right to deny me an exit, well you know what can you do with yourself.
