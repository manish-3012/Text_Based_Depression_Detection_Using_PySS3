I don't know what I'm doing with my life.I've become a complete mess, I'm going into the senior part of highschool. I'm depressed, I selfharm. I've got scars.

School is becoming hard to the point I try to do work, I feel uncomfortable and squirm so I just can't do it. 

Three weeks ago I let my mother know I cut myself and I'm suicidal and she thought I just got over it by her talking to me. She doesn't really see if I'm okay and doesn't do anything to help. My parents think I'm just going through a phase or just think I'm depressed although I've been diagnosed also with severe anxiety. She still won't let me take any medication and she's put things before me so I haven't seen my counselor in two months.

I have mental breakdowns once a week.

I've got no friends anymore to talk to online.

I feel like dying, I'm confused, scared and alone.

More indepth detail edit:
So, while I wrote this I was having a breakdown. Currently still depressed as ever, my mother doesn't exactly help me. Teachers and siblings around me aren't a help. I don't leave my room alot because of my extreme anxiety. I dedicate my life to gaming it's the only thing making me happy currently. I listen to music and play games which is all I can get through.

I know my parents care in ways but they think my mental health is not a big deal. They think of it as something that if they reassure me it'll be all okay. Because of my anxiety, I cannot speak to my parents. Even with my counselor before my mother put things she needs to do before me I wasn't able to talk to her.

I don't see a point to life, my mother is shit. My dad is okay, but he can't make time for me all the time because he works alot. I don't exactly know what to do. It's really shit, school is literally stressing me out and I feel like I need to go to the bottom class because I just can't cope or understand things anymore because of all this overthinking and stress.
I barely have people to speak to online even for help.
