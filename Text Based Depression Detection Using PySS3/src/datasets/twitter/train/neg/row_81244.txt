I just wanna share my storyIâ€™ve never been normal, I have problems I also grew up with a lot of abuse. I never can let anything go and my mind goes crazy. At one point I was so depressed that I truly thought about suicide. I suffer from UC so not only was it emotional but physical. I started being afraid of death and even feeling like there was no point. My depression got really bad, I donâ€™t know wha caused it but it was intense. I began planning to kill myself I wrote a suicide note and threw it out. I was going to make letters for each of my family, I planned to leave late at night and overdose in the apartment parking lot near me. I planned to text my husband as I did it, I became so upset that I was excited for death, I felt bad cause of my kid. I was thinking to myself the pain is so bad and death canâ€™t be any worse. Well I started suffering from panic attacks I felt like I was in danger all the time. Finally I gave in and I got on medication. It has helped me a great deal and I wish I would have done it sooner. What stopped me also was one day I just thought to myself â€œI want to be happy.â€ Despite not knowing what happens after and the pain I endure I realized only I could stop it. Now Iâ€™m not saying itâ€™s everyoneâ€™s fault that basically itâ€™s your decision. No itâ€™s hard please get help donâ€™t do it alone, I suffered years and because of meds I pulled through. I never want to feel the way I felt than...it was intense.
