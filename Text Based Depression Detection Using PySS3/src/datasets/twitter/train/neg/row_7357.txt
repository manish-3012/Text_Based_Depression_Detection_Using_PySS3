Coming CleanIt's easy to fear nothing when you don't have anything left to lose.

The past few weeks have been numbing. Blow after blow, after all the tragedies that happened and are happening in my life, it felt like I am on auto-pilot. It felt like I'm underwater and all I could hear are murmurs from above. The silence inside of me is defeaning, but the low rumbles of comfort from the thought of the end filled my lungs. 

I did things that I'd never done before and didn't feel anything about it. Things that should make me angry didn't bother me anymore, and even my former inhibitions didn't matter now too. 

I've sent my nudes to multiple men when they asked.I remembered I was called a prude before but now it didn't matter. I've given my belongings to people who want them. People who are tying to help me received the most pessimistic and toxic responses from me until they leave me. It's better that way. I've already arranged things in order and just waiting for my salary so that my sister won't have problems with my funeral.I won't be able to see my parents. It's been a while since I visited them in prison. I wish they can get out to see me and get to enjoy the day before they get back to the facility. 


For the people who will hold my phone after I'm gone.

Thank you to anyone who tried to help me and are worried about me. None of this is your fault. This is what I think is the only way to escape from my life. I've been struggling from this since I was 16 and after 11 years, I've decided it is time to rest. 

Do not feel bad or feel any regret about not saving me. I don't want to be helped anymore, because I am beyond saving.

Know that I have loved each and every one of you with every fiber of my being at one point in my life and know that I carried that memory with me until the moment I did it. 

I'm sorry for causing all this trouble and I hope you could forgive me.
