Can't stop thinking about itMy life's out of control... Everything's spiralling out of control. 

I have a new daughter Im not allowed to meet because I'm apparently dangerous because I admitted myself. My son's been taken away because I admitted myself because of all this. CFS makes threats about taking my son because I sought help. 

I don't get to see my kids, my family's been taken away. On the verge of loosing my mcjob because I can't cope with day to day life. I've been evicted because I couldn't make rent because I spent most of December in hospital. I still haven't had my Christmas with my son, no clue if I'll ever get to meet my daughter. 

Had to flush pills last night, swallowed a handful of hydromorphone, made myself throw them up. Flushed everything else dangerous - but the thoughts are still racing through my head. 

The fuckiest part is if I get help I'm even more screwed on seeing my kids again. What the fuck am I supposed to do?
