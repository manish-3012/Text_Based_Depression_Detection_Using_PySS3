I finally tried telling someone that Iâ€™m depressed...And her answer was is it because Iâ€™m on my period.
I just didnâ€™t reply and changed the subject. 
I go to bed every night wishing I was dead and feel so empty inside but in front other people I act normal and hate trying to ask for help so no one really knows how I feel, not even my parents.
One time two years ago when I was depressed as a side effect from medication it got so bad that I overdosed on Panadol (donâ€™t laugh) I didnâ€™t die but I was so sick, throwing up, couldnâ€™t leave my bed for days and even then I couldnâ€™t tell anyone. And since then I canâ€™t stomach alcohol because my liver is all messed up from it. 
Iâ€™m not like that yet but Iâ€™m worried that I will be and donâ€™t know what to do.
