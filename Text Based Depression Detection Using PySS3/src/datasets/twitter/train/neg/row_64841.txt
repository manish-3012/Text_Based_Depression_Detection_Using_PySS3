anyone else wants to suicide because of no friends/girlfriend? or just me?Im 26 never had a gf, first kiss, never had friends, tried to fit in high school, failed, tried to fit in college, failed, now i started my new job, and... you guessed it

I think its the end of the road for me, thats pretty much it, this was my last shot, nothing else i can do or try.
