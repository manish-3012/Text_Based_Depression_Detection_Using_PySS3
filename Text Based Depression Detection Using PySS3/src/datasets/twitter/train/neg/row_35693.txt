i need this confusion to stopiâ€™m 15 and a severe alcoholic iâ€™ve been drinking since i was 11 (in moderation) now itâ€™s out of control , itâ€™s been a week since iâ€™ve tried stopping i get the shakes waking up in cold sweats , iâ€™ve been in bed for the past three days iâ€™ve been thinking how much better death would be compared to this shit i canâ€™t go longer than a few days without getting fucked up on anything and now iâ€™m on travacalm just to feel something iâ€™ve decided to change but itâ€™s so hard everytime i fuck up my life everyone around me is affected so killing myself doesnâ€™t help so i lie in bed a sad waste of an alcohol , love life right
