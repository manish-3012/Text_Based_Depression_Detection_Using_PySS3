I have no phone or transportation. Tonight is not going well. I need company.I am in Columbus, Ohio. I have no phone or transportation. I am at odds with the people who own the place I am staying. The only thing that has stopped me from killing myself over the last ~year has been the trouble of dealing with my belongings/debts/responsibilities for my loved ones. But I have lost care for that. Tomorrow will be bad. What do I do.
