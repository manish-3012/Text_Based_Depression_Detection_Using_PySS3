I don't even know what to say.I remember a time when I had no idea what it must feel like to be depressed. Forgive me for not knowing exactly how to phrase this, but for the past few months I have been in a complete and utter funk. I'm graduating late from college, and my self worth and happiness has gone down the drain since I realized this was going to be the case. I live with my parents - my father works very hard and attempts to tell me he is "proud" of me but every single day when he comes home a fight breaks out. If I work an hour less than 40 a week he rips me a new one. If I am not pretending to be "in a good mood" then I get ripped a new one. My mother is a recent cancer survivor which is a good thing, but it has been two years since she went into remission and she has yet to gain any of her life back. Most days she sleeps from dawn to dusk, sneaking cigarettes and fighting with anyone who catches her in her lies.

My grandfather, who also lives with us, just recently suffered from his second stroke. I've just had it. I don't know where to turn or what to do. I just can't shake the feeling that all of my problems would go away if I just killed myself and was done with it.

Sorry for bitching. I only made this post after I attempted self harm by hitting my head against a wall stud. Something has got to change.
