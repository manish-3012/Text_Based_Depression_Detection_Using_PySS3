If mental illness should be treated same as physical why is it thatpeople with cancer can choose to not fight their illness with chemo n stuff because they would rather just let the illness take its course than prolong/worsen their suffering and make family members witness them struggle through treatment... and that is acceptable, why wouldnt choosing to not fight depression/suicide because you dont want to keep suffering through it, or have to keep subjecting loved ones to watching you suffer... be acceptable?
