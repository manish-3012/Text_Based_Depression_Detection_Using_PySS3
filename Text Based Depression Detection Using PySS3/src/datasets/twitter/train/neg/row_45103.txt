whatâ€™s the fucking point anymorei used to stay alive for my friends but now all my friends have left me. my body is a cage and suicide is the key. i understand why they left me; im just an ugly, fat, and boring loser while they all have lives to live. i know theyâ€™re laughing at me right now, i wonder if theyâ€™ll laugh when they find my body.
