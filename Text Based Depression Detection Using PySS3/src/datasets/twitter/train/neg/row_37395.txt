The worst thing about not wanting to live is to lack the courage to take my lifeJust like that... I offten have to clarify that don't wanting to live doesn't mean I'm gonna suicide, I don't know why Im even posting here, I stared at the screen for like half an hour deciding to post or not, I don't want to bother anyone and I know that there are people with way more problems, everyone tells me that life is worth living that there are so much things to live for, that I'm too young, but that really doesn't help at all, If you go to my profile most of my post are angry post about games or something like that, I might seem someone just normal but that is the worst part, I don't know if its normal getting angry so easilly, or not being able to sleep a lot, or having a lot of nightmares at night when I can sleep, or sleeping a lot when I'm able to sleep, I don't even know why I'm I writting this, I maybe just want someone to read me... sorry if this doesn't belong here... but I don't know any other place to post it... If you read this just thanks
