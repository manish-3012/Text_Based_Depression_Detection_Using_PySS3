Whats the point anymore?I was going to end my life tonight but I feel asleep with the thought of suicide. I don't want to fall asleep tonight. I want to sleep forever. I just wanted to say goodbye. Goodbye to anyone and everyone who helped me through this time but its too depressing for me to handle. If I live another day it will just be for to get yelled at and bring so many thoughts and tears to my eyes. I am so depressed I can't even cry at this point. It is my time to face death.
