I feel like shit and it's all my faultI fucking hate myself. My situation is probably not as bad as everyone else in this sub because the only thing keeping me away from happinesses is myself. 

My life was great, I was really happy as a kid and never lacked anything in my childhood. My parents were amazing, my friends were incredible and life was so much fun. It took me a while to get things working with girls but that was goos because I was able to enjoy being a goofy kid for longer. But then I turned 14

I know it probably sounds stupid, but I have done things that haunt me to this day, almost three years later. I didn't kill or rape someone if this is what your thinking, it was much lighter than that but still horrible. The problem is I never suffered any consequences to my actions, life has always been great. But I don't deserve a great life.

I feel terribly guilty every damn day and even if most of friends know the things that I did and have forgiven me, I can't help but think that I don't deserve any of them. And then there is my girlfriend, which is the absolute best human being in this world, who knows about the things that I've done and doesn't let it affect in any way how she feels about me. I just simply can't look at her face and not feel like I don't deserve her. She has forgiven me, but that only makes things worse, because I know that I don't deserve forgiveness.

I think about how happy I was when I was a kid every day and I basically live in the past. I can't spend a whole day without letting destructive thoughts flood my mind. I don't know what to do. I don't want to break with my gf but at the same time I do not deserve her at all. I have fucked my life, I am a piece of shit. Living feels like a burden.
