I'm feeling so aloneI feel so desperate I need someone to talk to. I just went on a really long walk around my town drinking and I know that's pathetic. I am about to finish my degree... and I'm going to get lower grades than anyone expects. With the job market as it is in the UK and I've never had a real job I don't think anyone will ever employ me and I know I'm not special enough to impress at interview. In less than a month I won't have anywhere to live, all my friends are leaving the town (end of uni) and I just feel so so so hopeless. My housemate is making my life a living hell and I just can't cope anymore. 
Is there anyone out there willing just to chat?
I really don't see the point in my existence anymore. I'm not normally a dramatic person. Actually I'm the type to keep it all bottled in and maybe that's what's got me to this stage. I really need help reddit and I don't know where else to turn to.
Sorry if this is the wrong place for this or I sound pathetic. 

EDIT: I'd just like to add I have been a long time contributor to this community and this is a throwaway account. Reddit has probably saved my life quite a few times in the last year but it's got to that point where I don't see a point anymore. I see success all around me and I am just a failure.
