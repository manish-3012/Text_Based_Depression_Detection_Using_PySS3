Is there any way to make it easier on the family?Hypothetically, is there anything in a suicide note that would make it easier on the family?  For example:  less detail/more detail/telling them its not their fault/ etc.  

Or maybe if it was an car accident with no note.  Are there any studies done on what would be the least traumatizing to family?  Anyone that have anyone close kill themselves have any input?  I'm just curious, thanks
