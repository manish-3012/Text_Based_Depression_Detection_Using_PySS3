HiHello, I'm new to this place, to put it shortly, I'm falling into nothing, my laughs are starting to get emptier, my cries almost the same unless it is a small existential crisis, I want to feel, and I want to help my friend who is also going through a tough (if not worse) time than I am. Please help.
