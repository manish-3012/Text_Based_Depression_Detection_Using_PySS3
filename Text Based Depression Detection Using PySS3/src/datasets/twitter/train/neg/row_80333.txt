It's getting worseI don't know how much longer I can keep going.  I woke up this morning feeling miserable as always, but since I woke up, I've thought about nothing but how much I hate myself, hate my life, and all the different ways I could kill myself right now.  I've stopped eating and I feel awful and I don't even know why.

I never thought it'd get this bad this quick.  I'm just going to go drown my mind out with Xbox like I always do.
