"reach out to family or friends" is bsyou know how they say that, for when you're suicidal? but then it's like... i'm not going to be a burden on my friends. and what are they supposed to do, anyways? say something "comforting" and then stress over me? how are they supposed to deal with that? the most i can get is apologies or hopes i'll get better and that's. not enough

i can't actually kill myself but i feel stuck between rock and a hard place, and just need to tell at least someone that i feel like OD'ing or something because being alive right now is just too much
