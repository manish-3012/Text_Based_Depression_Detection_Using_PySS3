The cuts on my legs give me peace from the life I leadI live in Venezuela, I think everyone knows how bad it is here, now add to that living in quarantine, with a dad diagnosed with metastatic bone cancer. I study a career that I don't even know that I like, I have a 100% scholarship because of my grades, maybe that's the only good thing, however, with all this, the family economy is going to hell, at least like three times a day, but I don't know how much more it will be like this, I am useless, I don't know how to do anything that can give money on the internet, at least by cutting my arms and veins I manage to calm down a little the idea that very soon I will end my life, although I know that when I do it will be the best for everyone.
