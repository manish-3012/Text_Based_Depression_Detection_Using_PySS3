Thinking about it for the first time. I'm 25, and married the love of my life 2 months ago. Because of some shit with the wedding, my family has pretty much disowned me.
 
I'm 90% sure my wife is cheating on me. 

I haven't slept more than an hour in 3 days. 

Feel like I'm at the end of my rope, and I don't know where else to turn.
