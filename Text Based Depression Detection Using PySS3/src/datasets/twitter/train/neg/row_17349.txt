I just donâ€™t like livingIâ€™ve never had any attachment to my life, itâ€™s never been something of value to me. Things that are fun to other people arenâ€™t enjoyable at all to me. Next to nothing is enjoyable at all to me. Any positive emotions I have are hollow and fleeting. If I had access to some kind of assisted suicide I would take that opportunity in a heartbeat, all I want is a dignified death. But I guess I canâ€™t have that. So I have to drag on my life for no reason for who knows how long.
