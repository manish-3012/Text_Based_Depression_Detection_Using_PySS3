I cut more than ever last nightAnd woke up with lots of pain. I just wish I died in my sleep last night. I was disappointed the moment I woke up. I feel so ugly cutting on my thigh, I can't believe just a few months ago I would wear short dresses and look at my thighs normally. Now my thigh is full of cuts. I just make myself uglier on the outside so that it can match how ugly, worthless, replaceable and unlovable I am on the inside.
