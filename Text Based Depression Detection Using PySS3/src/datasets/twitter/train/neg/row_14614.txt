I hate myself. Biggest fan of my own hate club.I typically wouldnâ€™t even bother posting here, but my lifeâ€™s such a mess. Most of it is my fault. I canâ€™t seem to keep healthy friendships/relationships afloat. Theyâ€™re so emotionally draining. I canâ€™t be what people need or want me to be and for that I hate myself. It has left me almost completely alone and outcast from people Iâ€™ve known for 7+ years. They donâ€™t even ask me how Iâ€™m doing, itâ€™s always me that has to reach out and even when I do theyâ€™re distant. Iâ€™m so tired of everything being so one sided. Iâ€™m always the one who gets hurt, I always care too much. I just wish I could forget everyone I have ever met and start fresh. I really really think sometimes everyone would be so much better without me around. This pain I feel and go through every single day, Iâ€™m not sure if or how it can get better.
