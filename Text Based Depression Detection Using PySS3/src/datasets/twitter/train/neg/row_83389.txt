41 M I'm here to give my advice from my life experienceI see alot of young people posting and I see myself in yous when I was your age.  Wish I could go back and make the right choices so my life didnt become what it is today.   Seeing alot of yous post I was where yous are now and I'd like to help steer you away from making your life worse and just nipping it in the bud where you are now.   It can and will only get worse if you dont start making the correct decisions now. Alot of your stories I see you feel like your life is over and yes u may be in pain but where I'm standing you are sitting pretty good and I'd like to help you see that if I can. I'm at a place where I'm fucked for life and I dont want you ending up like me.   It's all I can really do to make a difference anymore before I die.
