Everything is falling apartWell... today I went to my therapist and told her how suÃ¯cidal and selfharming I am. I told her the way I want to commit suÃ¯cide and I told her that I nearly tried to commit suÃ¯cide this week. She asked me what keeps me from comitting suÃ¯cide and all I could say was: "our appointments, I put my last bit of hope in our conversations." She had to speak to my psychiatrist to decide wether or not it was safe to let me go home. I don't think it was, but they let me go home. And here I am, more depressed than ever before, failing school and dissapointing my family. If the proffesional help won't work out, I can't promise to survive this year...
