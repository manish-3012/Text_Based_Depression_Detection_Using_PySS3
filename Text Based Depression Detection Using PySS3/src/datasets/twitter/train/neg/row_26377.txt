I just don't know what to do anymoreI don't know if lengthy posts are okay or not but I just need to get this out somewhere instead of bottling it up. I keep banging my head against a wall and I'm so sick and tired all the time.

Growing up I had physically/emotionally abusive parents who made me the mother of all my younger siblings and have stolen over $15k from me in credit cards and cash when they said it was for my siblings and school but in reality it was for gambling, drinking, or luxury BS that boosted their egos. I'm out of a job cause of the pandemic, might be homeless soon, my cat has been extremely sick, I don't have any health insurance, and can't afford to pay for my next semester of undergrad since I can't get my parents info for the stupid fafsa. 

I feel like a worthless good for nothing burden. I can't do the simplest of tasks correctly, I struggle to remember the day of the week, and while I know what I need to do in order to fix stuff, it just seems too daunting and I get overwhelmed. Everyone always tells me to ask for help but the moment I do I get slammed and called stupid or worse. 

I'm just so tired. I have no energy, everything feels foggy, and I feel like everyone says they care but then gets angry when I ask for them to just listen or give me an hour of their time. Honestly I think that I wouldn't really be missed in the grand scheme. I'm not particularly good at anything and I just feel disgusting overall. 

I just wish it could all be over. I want it to all be over.
