I want to slit my throatI have nowhere to die, as I live in a dorm room. Iâ€™ve struggled with mental illness since I was a kid, Iâ€™m 19 now. And Iâ€™m just sick of it. This type of life isnâ€™t worth living. Iâ€™m sick and just a burden on everyone. But I know if I killed myself Iâ€™d  hurt a lot of people. I think at least.  Iâ€™ll never be a normal functioning adult. Iâ€™m too crazy. Maybe no one does care? I wish I knew that no one cared. How selfish. Trying to off myself to end my pain. Iâ€™m just an ugly, selfish, dirty piece of shit that doesnâ€™t deserve life.
