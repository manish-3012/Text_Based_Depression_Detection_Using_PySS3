I don't know if I can manage the next timeIt's always the long way to the top, and a second-long fall back in the ashes. I know people talk about the three-days rule, when thinking about suicide you're monitoring the next three days and try to see at least one good thing in them, which should make you want to keep up. But I know it will become better, it will be that I won't care about anything which made me feel down earlier. Like a nice sleep where you solve all of your problems or they fade. But when it's back, I don't only suffer from what's affecting me right now, no. Everything comes back, the realization that it has never gotten better and definitely will not. And with each time I become more and more afraid I will not manage the next come. I never attempted seriously, but I was at the very edge once, and everytime it's here, I feel that day like it's here, along with all the other terrible days.
