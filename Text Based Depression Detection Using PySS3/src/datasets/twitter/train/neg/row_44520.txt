Limbo: I neither enjoy life nor fear death.This post is, firstly, for others in my situation.  I have to believe it's chemical.  On some paper I'm a very successful guy.  I was finalist for the Rhodes scholarship, and in two weeks I'm interviewing at Harvard Medical School.  A lot of this "success" comes from being dirt poor as a kid--organizations love diversity.  But most of my life I have been severely depressed, and while I should be riding a wave of happiness right now I often think about sticking a knife in my carotid arteries ie heart.  Is there anyone out there that has found happiness and can they describe how?

I think Kant had it right when he claimed one needs something to love, something to do, and something to look forward to.  I have only the latter of those three and I may very well kill myself.  I'm such a coward it makes me sick.  Goodbye.
