Ready to die.Everything I say is wrong. Everything I do is wrong. Iâ€™m always fucking up and someone is always mad at me. Iâ€™m on the verge of tears because I fucking hate life. I hate it, I hate it, I hate it. I see no point in living. Iâ€™m already a waste of time and space. My family and the entire world would be so much better without me always fucking everything up. Why was I even born? Just why? Iâ€™ve already been abused, so Iâ€™m filthy, damaged goods. Iâ€™ve been told that all of it was my fault. Iâ€™m a liar, this and that. My life is just one complete joke. Iâ€™m a complete failure and the only way out of this shitty life I didnâ€™t ask for is death.
