Hit a wall (again), this might be itI'm 27 and lost my will and strength to continue. Life started to become rough ten years ago when I finished school. My then gf lost her life in an car accident and despite acting like it, I never recovered from that. Been alone most the time and developed an addiction to online games for years to come. The virtual worlds and friends didn't help much, but it was a good distraction. 

During that time I racked up a good amount of debt due to me not doing my taxes properly. I'm talking 5 digit deep. So I was contemplating and managed to snap out of my misery last year. I quit mmorpg's completely, got a stable job and made plans to pay off my debt. Life was on track again, somewhat.

Fast forward to march this year, covid-19 is happening everywhere. Hotels and restaurants are closing and I lost my job. Poof, just like that. I'm still waiting for last months loan, can't pay my bills nor my monthly debt. 

Haven't slept for the last 60 hours and I kinda feel like just letting go. I'm too tired to keep going..
