I won't live to see 2021.I've been thinking about killing myself sometime this year. I'm in a bad situation and I've struggled to find a job. I don't have much money left and I don't know how I'm gonna pay the rent. I've been depressed and anxious since middle school. I don't want to be miserable anymore.
