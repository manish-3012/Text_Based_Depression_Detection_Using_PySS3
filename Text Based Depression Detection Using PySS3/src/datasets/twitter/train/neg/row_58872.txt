Heart so heavy...Okay, so this is my first post here. I would like to get this off my chest.. Here goes.. 

I've been thinking about committing suicide for quite some time now and over the last month my feelings of suicide have got pretty intense (more so than usual). So intense that I've even gone as far as to research methods and writing draft letters to family and my 2 only friends. My life is no longer worth living anymore and that the world will be better off without me. I cause everyone around me hurt as a result of my actions. I have nothing to live for. I just want to end it all. Worse thing is the feelings keep getting worse and something inside tells me the only way to rid myself of these feelings is by ending it once and for all. 

Thank you for reading
