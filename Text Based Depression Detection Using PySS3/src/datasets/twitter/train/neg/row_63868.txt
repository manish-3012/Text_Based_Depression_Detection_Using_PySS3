I just give upHey I am in highschool and I self harm because everything feels so empty. Itâ€™s not that I have a bad life I just donâ€™t like waking up and everyday is the same. I have friends and I get good grades my parents try to be good parents but nothing is good enough for me. I am having to do multiple assignments at school which are stressing me out. I have to do good in all of the 4 assignments I have to do in 2 weeks because if I donâ€™t my parents will be so disappointed in me. I hate myself for not being grateful and enjoying the life I have. But everything is this tiring endless loop and I canâ€™t be bothered to make an effort to wake up and simply live. Itâ€™s too much for me. I just want to talk to someone about my problems because I canâ€™t talk about this to my friends because they always turn me down. I only have one friend who listens to me but she hasnâ€™t replied to me in days and I donâ€™t know if she wants to still talk to me or not and I just feel lonely even tho I have friends. I feel sad even if I should be happy. I hate myself so much for not being happy. I really want to die 

Sorry if I repeated myself I was just ranting about how much I want to die. No one will probably read this and reply to me.
