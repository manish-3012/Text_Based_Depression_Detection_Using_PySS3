It's been on my mind so much lately 18(f)I just need a place to get this out. I just feel like I can't talk to anyone about how I'm feeling because nobody understands. I have extreme moods, and they've been getting worse lately. I feel so lonely and useless, and the thought of actually killing myself has been in my head about three times this week. I've never thought about it before... I just want to get a bunch of painkillers and die.

I've had terrible headaches lately and I just can't find a reason to get out of bed. I don't have a future backed up like everyone around me and I just feel like the easiest thing I could do right now is die... I don't know what to do and my thoughts are really scaring me.
