Happy birthdayI just turned 24 ... I made a birthday wish or goal, I told myself Im finally going to do it. On my 27th birthday Iâ€™m going to end it all if I have nothing going on for me.  Idk now, how long Iâ€™ve been depressed I canâ€™t remember the last time I felt home or safe.... Everything in my life feels like it was meant for someone else I donâ€™t deserve it or fit into it... I donâ€™t think I have the strength to make it to my 27th birthday. If youâ€™re reading this please for my birthday check up your loved ones. Please make sure they feel something .. Anything.... Be there for them please I canâ€™t imagine anyone else having to endure this pain alone..
