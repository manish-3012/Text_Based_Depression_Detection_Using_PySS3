I'm frightened of a community (a game community) hating me just for things I've said...I'm losing my mind over this and well It's about a game community, I had first went to a livestream and said something, I got banned and consistantly insulted every time I went back, but now the streamer had started and I felt like I had nothing,  I've got a problem where I'm in fear of being hated by this person... I'm thinking about suicide and I just don't know what to do anymore...
