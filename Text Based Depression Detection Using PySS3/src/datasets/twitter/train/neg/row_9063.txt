Is it time?My wife has told me she loves me but is not in love with me anymore. She now constantly texts her best friend, who used to be my friend and is still a coworker (like sits next to me). They tell each other how much they love each other.

She says they are just friends and that she loves her best friend.

I don't see any other option and I don't think I am strong enough to handle a divorce.

.......

Whatever. I don't know how to explain myself. 

I really just... whatever.
