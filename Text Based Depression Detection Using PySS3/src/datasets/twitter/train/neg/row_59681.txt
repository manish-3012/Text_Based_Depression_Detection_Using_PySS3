I want to break up without killing myselfMy boyfriend and I are together for 3 years, he is my first.

He cheats, lies, gives me massive anxiety every single day. He is never true about his whereabouts. It kills me inside. Nearly every night I cry myself to sleep because I know his hands have been on another woman and then he comes home and says he loves me.

I'm a fragile person and never been through a breakup before. I can handle losses of people very badly. I was in love with a teacher in high school and after I graduaded I got into deep depression for 3 years because I missed her so much - and we did not even have a relationship.

I have no friends and no feeling to get those. Also no close family. I have literally no idea how to walk out of that door and keep standing on my feet, and keep breathing. Can someone please give me advice? I'm crying while writing this. My life is falling apart.

TL;DR I don't know how to break up with my cheating boyfriend. I have never been through a break up before. I don't have friends to distract me. I don't have much money so I can't do much fun things by myself. I have suicidal tendendies.
