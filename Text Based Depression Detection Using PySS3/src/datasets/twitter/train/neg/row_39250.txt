Being GhostedLove of my life is ghosting me and it hurts. He said he would be online today to talk and then just never showed up. Nothing. Not to apologize. Not to let me know he can't talk and needs to reschedule. Literally radio silence. I feel like a piece of trash, overlooked. I feel lied to and unwanted. I've begged him to not do this, but it keeps happening over and over.

Maybe it's a hint that I should be one? If I don't exist while I'm alive, might as well be dead, amirite?
