finding solaceI'm going to make plans to kill myself and pray that reincarnation is not real. Yes, I do feel guilty. I feel selfish, weak, and ashamed. I'm sorry. I have reached my limit. I can't continue this life. I can't continue living in this world of fearful hatred. There is no promise of love. I can't keep up this false hope. I'm spent. This cycle is exhausting and not at all worth it. If suicide is not a valid means of dying, then why does it exist? If there is any spiritual meaning to life, there must be a reason for suicide. If not, then there is really no point in worrying about who kills themselves or what goes on. It's just a shit show.
