Maybe I'm the monsterSo many things dragging me down.

I've always held on by trying to remember that it wasn't me, it was my abusers. 

Telling myself that it's okay to feel like I can't do this, because it's not my fault. 

But what if it is. 

I wonder if I was just all my fault for giving so much

It's not like I ever asked for anything in return

Maybe I should have asked 

It's unfair for me to expect things I never asked for 

At the same time I feel as though some things should go without saying

Are these people the manipulative monsters I see them as? Or were they simply not the right person for me? 

Was it a difference in love languages? 
Was I just expecting too much? Was it unfair to expect more than they could give? 

Did I make it all up in my head? 
Did they not actually hurt me and I was just hurt because it wasn't what I needed?
