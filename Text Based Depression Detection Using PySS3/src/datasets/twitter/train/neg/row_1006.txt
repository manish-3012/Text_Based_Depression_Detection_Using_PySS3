I'm sitting here with pills and alcohol. I need help.I need some help. I don't know what kind of help I need. I'm 22 years old and live at home. I quit my job and I don't have another job lined up. I used to have so many goals and aspirations. But last year when I tried to kill myself, all my goals went away. And now I don't know what I'm doing with my life. I have no drive to keep going. I don't know what to do.
