I'm so lonely, I can't take it anymore.I have two friends. One just moved out of the country, one works 3 jobs and never has time to see me. My whole life I've never had more than a few friends and I never really felt like I fit in with most people; not in high school or college or life in general. 

I moved out of my parents' house to a new city 2 months ago. A big part of my reason for moving was to hopefully meet more people and develop a social life. But that hasn't happened. When I'm not working, I'm home alone, and if I do go out, it's by myself, and I never have any luck meeting people. 

Last night it got really bad. I was sitting at home alone, thinking about how I haven't had a real conversation with someone in such a long time. I haven't felt connected to another person in ages. I've never been in a relationship, and although it shouldn't, it makes me feel like there is something fundamentally wrong with and unlikeable about me. Not having friends just adds to that. Last night I seriously considered suicide.

The only thing that stops me is not wanting to hurt my family. But even though I won't actually do it, I can't stop wishing I would die.
