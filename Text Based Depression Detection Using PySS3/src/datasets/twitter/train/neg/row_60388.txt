I think about it every dayI'm 18, and ever since I've been a kid, ive wanted to kill myself. I was bullied really badly from the age of 7/8 all the way until I was 16. This is when I moved school. I socialise quite a bit, but when I'm with my "friends" I just feel like they dont really care about me and get the feeling that if I just stopped talking to them, they really wouldn't care.

Also, I have aspergers syndrome. If you're unfamiliar with it, it's a type of autism that affects your senses (noise especially) and makes being around proper very awkward essentially.

A couple years ago, I turned to drugs to kinda ease the pain. Name a drug, I've most probably done it, because, as sad as it sounds, the only time I dont feel like killing myself is when I'm on some sort of hardcore drugs. I'm man enough to say that now, I am addicted and cant see myself getting off of them

I wouldnt say I'm super ugly, but I'm definitely not what people would class as good looking. A lot of my "friends" are girls and they never see me as any more than a friend (not just my friends but every girl I meet). I've been with girls at parties etc but never had a girlfriend.

I'm not close with my family either. I dont spend time with them because when I do, they say things that will deliberately annoy me and my dad has even said he does it to get a reaction because my "autism makes it funnier".

I just feel like theres no hope for me anymore. No family, pretty much no true friends, substance abuse, no career prospects. Just absolutely nothing positive with my life so what is the point in putting myself through another 60 odd years of pain when I could just stop it whenever i want. 

Sorry that this is so long, but I just have no one to talk to and needed it off my chest. Maybe this could be my suicide note
