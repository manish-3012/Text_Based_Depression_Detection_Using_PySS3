No guardian angelI met my partner back in 2012. I was suicidal and self-harmed. They pulled me out of the hellhole and I hadnâ€™t cut for 6 years... until tonight.
They recently â€œrealisedâ€ they were trans and I have no idea how to deal with it. The new them is just too different and I cannot seek comfort in them anymore. I try to be supportive and encouraging, but itâ€™s just too hard, too many uncertainties, too much fear. Itâ€™s taking a toll on our relationship.
We had an argument because Iâ€™d mentioned a characteristic that makes them harder to â€œpassâ€ a few too many times I guess, and we went to sleep in silence and not in an embrace as is normal. 
Please someone tell me this is just a bad dream. Please tell me that the last 7 years with the love of my life havenâ€™t been a lie.
