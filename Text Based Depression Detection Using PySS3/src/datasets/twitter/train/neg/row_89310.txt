Almost (kind of) accidentally killed myselfI was about to start cutting today. I never thought I would, but my mind has been deteriorating quickly. I was just looking stuff up to make sure I didnâ€™t get infected or something. I stumbled upon a post that said to not cut in the inner thighs, right where I was going to cut. I could have killed myself. I almost died. I stopped myself, but what if the next time I donâ€™t? I donâ€™t think I will cut (at least for a while) now, since Iâ€™m a little shocked.
