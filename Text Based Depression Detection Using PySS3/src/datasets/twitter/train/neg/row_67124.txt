I'm going to do it to tonightWell its Saturday. My "friends" won't invite me to their parties and I'm alone. I'm in college. I lost all my friends. I've been virtually kicked out of everything I tried to get into for the past week including today. I lost all my friends because I stole a rum bottle while drunk from a party and word spread fast. I repaid my debts and gave back the bottle not long after. I'm a bit drunk right now because its the only way i can express everything. I cut myself in the wrist earlier and its starting to bleed. I'm just fucking sad right now. I lost my friends and they know they can't trust me. I'm a bit of a loner and I can't express how much I feel like shit. I just want to fucking die and get life over with.
