Strangely detachedWhen I consider suicide, I think of it in a very detached way. I think of how to do it, how it will affect the people around me, and so on, but I don't feel particularly distraught about it or anything. I feel like I'm planning someone else's death. 

I've never felt at home in my body, in more ways than one. I was left at an orphanage soon after my birth, and it was almost like my mother placed a horrible, ugly mask on my face that would never come off. People around me see me as that thing, even though I deny it being me. But there isn't a beautiful self underneath, either. Anything that was there has just faded to nothing by now. It's like I'm transparent. It feels like a curse.

Even though I think of myself as horrifically ugly, which I know is not true, I have an almost obsessive desire to be beautiful. I equate being beautiful with being wanted, and being wanted means that I won't be abandoned again. I myself have no problems with abandoning others, but as long as it's not me being hurt, it'll be all right. But I know that beauty doesn't last forever, and what's the point in living if I can't be beautiful OR form meaningful relationships?

All of what I just wrote sounds so ridiculous and hurtful. I don't want to live like that.

Part of me wishes it was possible to just start over. Maybe be reborn as something else, like a pretty boy. I've never been spiritual in my entire life, otherwise. I know it's probably not actually the case, and even if it is I'll have no memories of this life. But still. It's cool to think about. 

The only thing that's keeping me around is wanting to see this one guy in a live concert.
