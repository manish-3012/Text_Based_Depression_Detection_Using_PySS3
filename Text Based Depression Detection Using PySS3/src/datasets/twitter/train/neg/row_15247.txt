Would blow my brains out but don't have a gunI was never meant to live past 18. I'm now almost 20. I know I'm different, probably a sociopath or autistic or something. I tried to change and move down with my best friend but because her family is having issues, it's my fault they yelled at her because she failed to tell them I was coming. I made the mistake of trusting professionals, they had a field day and locked me up in a mental hospital, then refused to release me without my parents involved. We think it's because I go to a really good school, so they thought we were rich. Subsequently, I'm on a leave of absence and can't reenroll or join the military unless I see a doctor again. Moving was my only other option besides suicide. I need change, not things to be "better." Saying things get "better" is to deny change occurs. I'm done being let down by everyone around me after I let myself down. I've lost faith in the human race. I don't believe in structure or plans, and I never have. The other day I imagined the feeling of a gun to my temple, and it felt very pleasant. I don't want to see what happens in the future. People know things, yet they are still ignorant to change. I believe I'm different. And I'm tired of following societal rules. On top of all this, I have a lump in my breast. I may or may not get it checked out, but I probably won't seek treatment.
