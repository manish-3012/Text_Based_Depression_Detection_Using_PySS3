I've got the rope, I've done my research but I'm still here and suffering.I have a few questions, primary associated with drop hanging vs short-drop suspension. I have a rope that will sustain about 30 more pounds than I currently weigh. There is a footbridge down main street, just over a river that faces away from the road and is poorly lit enough at night that I believe I could secure the rope to 3 or 4 points then climb over the railing and jump. I've got the hangman's noose tied, though i know it's not the most effective, and I know to achieve the desired neck snapping effect I need to jump so that the length of the rope is at my front, forcing my neck back. Is the rope that I have strong enough to withstand the force of a 160lbs body falling, if secured to iron bars? 
Alternatively I've considered suffocation with a plastic bag, using the noose to secure the bag tightly, though earlier today I experienced the beginning panic caused by inhaling CO2, and was curious what experience some of you might have with Helium? I work retail and can easily get my hands on a helium tank within the next two weeks. My thought is that I will either use an oxygen mask to consume it or run a tube of it up into a sealed plastic bag over my head. 
What are my chances here? I want to achieve the least gruesome death, because as much as I want to die I dont want to scar the person who finds me.
