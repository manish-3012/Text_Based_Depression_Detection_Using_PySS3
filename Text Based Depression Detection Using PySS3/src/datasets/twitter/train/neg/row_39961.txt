killing myself over taxes?I am 21 and trying to get into school but thanks to my fucking parents theyâ€™ve made it nearly impossible for me with FAFSA. itâ€™s really hard to explain and i can barely see right now because of the emotional distress iâ€™m going through and i just want to kill myself. i have a big fucking knife next to me right now. i can barely breathe. the thought is so overpowering. i donâ€™t want to do life anymore. i donâ€™t even want to go to fucking school. my parents are awful people and adults who have never helped me with anything and have only traumatized me. i would be better off dead. i donâ€™t think life is for me but i canâ€™t leave because iâ€™m with the love of my life and i never ever want to hurt him or anybody but i really canâ€™t handle life right now. i want to leave. i need to go. thereâ€™s no one here with me right now to help me and stop me and i donâ€™t know what to do or what iâ€™m going to do. i just need help but i just want to get off this fucking planet. iâ€™m so stupid. i canâ€™t do it anymore.
