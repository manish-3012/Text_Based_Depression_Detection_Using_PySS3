My experience from a couple years ago calling the suicide hotline in desperationI had the balls to ask how long it takes for anybody with a horrible condition as me to bounce back or heal? they never answered my question but fed me the usual "it gets better or hope still exist". Even they know it's over for me

I only called 4 times in my life and I am diagnosed Schiozo. bi polar and depression
