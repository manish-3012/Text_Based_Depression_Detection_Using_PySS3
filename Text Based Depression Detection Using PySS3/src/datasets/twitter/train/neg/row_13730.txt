Why am I like thisI'm basically ruining my entire life rn by putting no work into any of my classes, but I can barely get up the motivation to get out of bed most mornings, let alone read, write papers, etc. I'm already dropping out of the honors program at my school (which was the main reason I even chose to go here) at the end of this year bc I'm not getting the grades i need to stay in it, and really the only way I can see to get out of this is suicide. Idk what I think I'm gonna solve getting on here, I guess I'm just stuck in a rut and I'm angry and disappointed and afraid.
