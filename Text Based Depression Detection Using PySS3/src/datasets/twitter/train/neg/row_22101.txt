I don't know if this counts. But I need help.I don't know how to look for help. I feel as if I try to ask for help its over bearing. I've been through two emotionally abusive relationships. They both lasted over 4 years. Now I found a woman that I really like but she is in an emotionally abusive relationship. I know how it goes. I tell her all the time that once he's gone things will get better. She has a genuine interest in me as well. But every time I tell her that "I can't wait to cuddle" she says "maybe." And that hurts a lot. I also have this overwhelming feeling of dread like some thing fucked up is going to happen. I'm setting my self up for failure once again. My life is no where near on track but I'm so tired of being alone. Every day I think about it. Before I fall asleep I get this big demanding thoughts saying why haven't you done it yet. I'm irresponsible, I'm not very smart, I have nothing going for me. I have so much debt its not even funny. I have a shitty job that I don't get paid enough for. I really want this relationship to happen but there is nothing more I can do. I don't know what to do. I don't want to invest a whole lot just to lose her, but I don't want to give up. But once again... Overwhelming feeling that it's not going to happen because of her controlling "boyfriend"... Every step I take away from the edge feels like it only brings me two steps closer.
