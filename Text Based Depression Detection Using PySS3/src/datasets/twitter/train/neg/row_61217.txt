Traveling for work [x-post r/depression]My best friend recently offered me the option of traveling out of town for double the work hours and a slight pay increase for a few weeks (he'd be my manager at the new job site) but my mind's been in the gutter lately. For the past several months I've been plotting my demise, thinking about the quickest way to go with my available resources, and I think I've got a few things lining up. I don't want to take this job offer with my mind like this, I'm overwhelmed as it is and self doubt has been eating me alive. I want so badly to off myself, and I feel like I'm getting really *really* close. I told him I don't feel safe taking my car that far because of a ground wire issue, he countered by offering a car pool. I don't want to lie anymore because I feel guilty, but I don't like revealing my mental tensions to people who are close to me because I'd just feel incredibly pitiful, and even more of a sack of shit. Do I lie again? Tell the truth? I already told him I was interested out of pure insecurity of myself, I don't want my only friend thinking I'm lazy and unwilling. But now I realize I just fucked myself in terms of my mental state the next coming weeks.
