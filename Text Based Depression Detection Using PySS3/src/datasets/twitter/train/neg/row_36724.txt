Saving up to kill myself! Canâ€™t wait!Now that i have a job, I have it all planned out. Saving up to buy a sweet  ass revolver to blow my brains out. Will also need a gun permit too. Donâ€™t know how getting that works but Iâ€™ll figure it out. Will drive and park on the side of the highway watching cars go by as I drink and contemplate my life so far. Then Iâ€™ll fucking do it. I donâ€™t know when Iâ€™ll do it but Iâ€™m saving up starting next paycheck. Only time will tell. 

My dreams and ambitions arenâ€™t going as planned and i donâ€™t think they ever will. I miss my dog. He was the only thing that made me happy now heâ€™s dead. I miss being a kid and not giving a shit about who liked me and who didnâ€™t. I missed not having to worry about rejection. I missed not being pressured by family to do things their way instead of mine. I miss my old college. I miss not being depressed after every time i get freaking rejected. I miss not being a complete screw up. I just want it to end. Iâ€™m in pain and I hide it perfectly and Iâ€™ll keep hiding it until i end my life.

I will do it. Just give me time. I donâ€™t know how long. My New Years resolution is to definitely kill my self before next year ends.
