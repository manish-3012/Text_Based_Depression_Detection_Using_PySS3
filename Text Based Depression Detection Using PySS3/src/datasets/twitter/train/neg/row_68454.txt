Life is a funny thingOften times people treat it as a blessing, as if it were the most important thing. But, why is it that so many people suffer? And that so many people decide to turn a blind eye? Humanity's crude morals are abhorrent. I really, really hate this world. Life isn't a blessing, it is the worst thing that's happened to so many of us.  


Today, I thought - Why should I not just go for it? What is stopping me? People have already proven that they don't care, even if I say out right that for years I have detested myself so much that I was willing to permanently end things. They say "Talk to us if you need to" "I'm always here for you" "You're not alone" "Things will get better".  


Surely, most of you must have heard these phrases before. I've come to learn that they are not genuine offers, but rather humble manners to preserve good self image. What I fool I was to trust such words. "You can talk to me if you want", yet I am called an attention seeker by the same person who offered to hear about the feelings I have tried to bottle up for so long.  


Even if my family or friends care - for how long? A month? Maybe two if I am lucky? And then, they will forget about it. I have never been a remarkable person after all.   


The only problem is how exactly to carry it out. I am just a kid, it is not like I could possibly do something like buy cyanide or enough pills for an overdose. Not to mention, I am in England. I cannot just go down to the garage and nab my father's gun to do the job, no.   


I wish it were not my friends that hurt me the most.  
I wish when people asked me what I was doing after graduation, my only reply wouldn't be 'suicide'.  


If there's a god out there, he is most definitely a tyrant.
