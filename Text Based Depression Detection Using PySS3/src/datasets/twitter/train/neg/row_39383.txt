Afraid of EverythingI can't do this anymore and it scares me. College scares me. I wasn't ready for it and now I'm too deep in debt to survive. I won't be able to pull the grades I need because I wasn't mentally prepared for college. And my parents think screaming will fix it.

I've never been a kid who functions well. It just never happened. I can't talk to people without having outbursts of emotion. I'm the type to just say jokes and hope others like me, and I've lied to try and force them to like or care about me.

The fact is that I cant do it. And I don't know any other ways to do it. And it scares me. Money scares me. College scares me. The economy scares me. My fucking country scares me. My parents scare me. My friends scare me. And now I'm tired of being afraid.
