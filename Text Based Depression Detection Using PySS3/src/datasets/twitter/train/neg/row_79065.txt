i donâ€™t know why i feel suicidal, but i donâ€™t even think that matters anymore.today iâ€™ve felt the worst iâ€™ve felt in months. iâ€™ve had suicidal thoughts for months and years but today was one of the worst days since my attempt three years ago. i feel like iâ€™m always fooling myself thinking iâ€™m better now. that iâ€™m happy and that i wonâ€™t ever feel like this again. but that never happens and iâ€™m always back here. back in this never ending loop of wanting to die after thinking iâ€™m okay now. the thing is that these thoughts never left. theyâ€™ve always been here, just in the backseat for a while until its decided iâ€™m too happy. they never truly leave even though iâ€™m always tricked into thinking they do. iâ€™m so stupid. the worst part is, i donâ€™t even know what wrong with me. why am i like this? why canâ€™t i just be normal? i donâ€™t think i have bipolar disorder because i donâ€™t experience periods of prolonged mania. iâ€™m just what i think is the normal me when iâ€™m not depressed and wanting to kill myself. iâ€™ve forgotten the feeling of being normal. of having stable emotions and feeling healthy mentally. sometimes i wonder what iâ€™m like without being mentally ill. for some reason, ever since i was young iâ€™ve thought that iâ€™ll die young. as i got older the feeling only intensified as morphed into thoughts of suicide. i canâ€™t help but think that itâ€™s the inevitable. i feel like i think about suicide as much as i think about normal everyday other things. it should scare me how often i think of suicide after even the slightest bit inconvenience happens to me. but it doesnâ€™t. i think i should tell someone about this but iâ€™m too ashamed and my last therapist may have ruined mental health professionals for me. sorry, this is a bit all over the place, but i wanted to tell someone about this.
