Trying not to hurt my childrenIâ€™ve been having a really difficult time lately. I really donâ€™t think I can hang on much longer so Iâ€™ve begun to make a plan. I have started to collect gifts for my daughters. I ordered them engraved rings, and gifts I know they will be able to keep for a long time. I have collected up all their paperwork that they will eventually need throughout their lives. 

I have told my husband I feel this way on a few occasions, but recently, I have just stopped talking about it. I just tell him I love him and to remember that. 

The last thing that needs to be done is to find a way to kill myself that will appear accidental. I donâ€™t want to hurt my children, but I just canâ€™t do this anymore. It has just been too much of a fight Iâ€™ve had to put up, and I can do it any longer. The only thing that is keeping me hanging on right now is just fixing everything for my children so they can have a good life. I just feel they would be better off without me. They will have more money and more security as they are all legal citizens here and I still am not able to get my citizenship. I am a drain on my family, which at never wanted to be.
