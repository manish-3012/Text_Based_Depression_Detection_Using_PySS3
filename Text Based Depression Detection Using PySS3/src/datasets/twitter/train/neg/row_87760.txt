Two days away from ECT; one day before I see my psychiatrist, but I'm not sure I can wait that long.I feel absurd.  I often care too much about what it would do to the people who care about me were I to kill myself to seriously entertain the idea, but that's wearing off.  Why is my misery less valid to end/prevent than theirs?

I'm diagnosed bipolar 1 and am borderline untreatable; medication has gotten me through the last eight years, but my cocktail stopped working and I've been on virtually everything so that leaves the non-medication options.  ECT has the highest documented "success" rate, but it's absolutely terrifying not knowing how severe the side effects will be for me personally.

I could keep rambling, but why bother.  Sorry.
