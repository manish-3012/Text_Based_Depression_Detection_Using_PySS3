Suicidal thoughts returning after years of being dormant.A little backstory here. When I was 17 I was deep in depression from things that seemed like a big deal at the time, a mentally abusive relationship, and some sexuality issues. I was released from the hospital and broke up with my girlfriend, apologized profusely to my family, and repressed my inner thoughts until I forgot about how strongly they felt. Fast forward to around 20-21 and my girlfriend miscarried. This time I recognized the signs and I went to my therapist and had him take me to the hospital. I got everything under control and I have been leading a decent life. Now on the outside everything is looking up. Promotions at work feel like they are never ending. My girlfriends job pays quite well. Money is no longer an issue. This is where the issues began popping up. The anxiety I get from dealing with finances is terrible and without being broke looming over my head I have been able to dive back into my thoughts and boy is it a wreck in here. I feel as though I dammed up my true self but once I opened the floodgates a crack everything poured in and I am drowning. I am trying my best to keep it together but every night is worse than the other. I recognize the signs that things could get mentally worse again but now I don't know how to address it. If I go to the hospital the praise(and bonuses) at work will surely slow because they won't want a crazy handling the important stuff. I am having a heck of a time finding a therapist and this has really just caught me off guard. All I really want is a little support. Please.
