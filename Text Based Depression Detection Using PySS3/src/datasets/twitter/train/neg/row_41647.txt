This Is What Happy Feels Likeor at least it's supposed to, right?? good job let aw bring mechanic skills, a fiancee I'll marry in may, my medication getting back on track. so god dammit, why arent I happy? why do I keep wanting to go back to bed? I'm so tired if questioning myself and everything around me, im so tired of trying to make myself heard and no one hearing me, im tired of telling people what I need and not getting the help. I'm tired of people constantly saying they're here for me, that they understand me, that they'll always be here when i need them. I'm tired of being lied to. in tired of making choices. I'm tired. I'm so fucking tired. I'm supposed to be happy this is happy this is supposed to be happy so why am I so fucking tired
