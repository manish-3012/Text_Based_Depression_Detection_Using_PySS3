I canâ€™t keep doing this. Every single day Iâ€™m told that I did something else wrong. I walk on eggshells and I try to be a good person. Itâ€™s never enough and Iâ€™m so tired.Every time I ever try to talk to my boyfriend about anything he yells at me for how I feel. But he yells at me when I donâ€™t share my emotions with him. There are things recently that heâ€™s done that really bother me. Iâ€™ve tried to talk to him about it and it gets twisted that itâ€™s my fault or I deserve it. â€œHow else am I supposed to act when I have to be with someone like you?â€ I never beg him to stay. Unfortunately Iâ€™m not strong enough to leave. He threatens me and blackmails me when Iâ€™ve tried in the past. I try to stay neutral and just go along with what he says to avoid a fight. He yells at me for that. When I apologize he doesnâ€™t like how I did it. I do some nice gesture for him to make up for being so awful. He complains about the gift or whatever I did. He came over tonight and he walked right past me. I said hello and for nothing back. I gave it a few minutes and tried to kiss him. Nothing. As I started walking away (didnâ€™t say anything or do anything) he yelled at me saying I was an asshole. He demands I kiss him then. I ask him why he didnâ€™t want to kiss me before? I start to walk up to him and he pushes me away. I have to sleep on the couch while he gets the bed to himself now. Iâ€™m not going to argue but I have work in the morning. Iâ€™m so far past my limit. Thereâ€™s other issues at hand that have nothing to do with him that also contribute to my worthlessness but this is in the forefront right now. Iâ€™m so tired.
