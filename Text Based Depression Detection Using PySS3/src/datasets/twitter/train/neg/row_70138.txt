Question for those that have successfully gotten past being suicidal, what could have possibly worked that fixed you?I'm very curious as to how it's possible to go from being ready to end your life, sick of everything, not interested in living anymore, to the complete opposite of that. Being happy, looking past everything, thinking that you did the right thing in surviving.

Is that how it usually is, or is there still a lingering feeling at the back of your head? I'm just very curious at how it's possible to change someone's perception of their life. Thanks.
