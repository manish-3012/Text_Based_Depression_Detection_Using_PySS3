I'm just so tiredI'm just gonna cut to the chase, I've thought of killing myself, twice. I did something stupid and then I got something taken away from me. I just feel like I can never do anything right. If I wasnt so worried about what my brother would do without me i would've done it back in March. I love my family, and they're very supportive but I still struggle to feel happy. I almost did go through with it once, but I chose not to for the reason I labelled above. I just dont know what's wrong with me.
