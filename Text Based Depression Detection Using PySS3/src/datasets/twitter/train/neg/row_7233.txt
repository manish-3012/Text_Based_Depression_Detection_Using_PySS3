I want the human race to diePeople are a fucking plaque this Earth. All we're doing is slowly destroying Mother Earth with pollution, climate change and a WHOLE bunch of other shit. I fucking hate people and I want to fucking kill myself because of them. Fuck them all. Fuck 99% of the human race. All humans do is breed, complain, eat and lack intelligence. I don't even see myself as a human anymore because I seriously cannot believe I'm apart of this. 

Don't get me started on the animal cruelty. Fair enough that the disgusting human race has to kill them for meat, but Jesus fuck, DO IT PAINLESSLY. I'm sick of it. This is what triggered my hatred for this world. I seriously would love to see a bunch of useless humans be locked up in cages for their skin, for breeding and for food, and then slaughtered. It would be fun. 

As a lesbian, I'm especially exposed to constant homophobia from my family to the rest of society. I'm sick of fucking retarded heterosexuals, and other shitty LGBT members be fucking stupid and shitty. Stop asking stupid questions like "how do lesbians have sex?" For example. I'm sick of their stupid asses saying "lesbians are virgins if they haven't slept with a dude" or some other dumb shit. Mind your own business. When heterosexuals complain"stop rubbing LGBT shit in our face" I want to skin them alive. I had NO representation growing up until I fucking discovered glee when I was 13. It sucked and I was always confused, and I felt like killing myself (still do) when I realised. Fuck off. 

I hate humans. Yes, I can have connections to other humans, but there's still going to be a part of me that hates them because they're human garbage. Must also explain why I hate my ugly ass too. 

I hope this whole race gets killed slowly and painfully.
