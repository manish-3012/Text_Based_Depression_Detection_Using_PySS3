Inevitable?I feel like I'm ready to take on a proper job and try to do good, but my only motivation is to secure the ability to acquire an exit bag without prompting suspicion. It's very hard to be subtle about acquiring a fucking tank of helium....

I do feel okay right now, but I forever consider it an inevitability. I can't stop drinking or altering myself, it's the only thing that makes me feel okay, but I feel at near 28 I've lost all means of opportunity... the way my teeth look due to a lack of care, etc. I'm trying to improve now, finally, but it's too late. I can't stand being photographed or being filmed. What good is that for an entertainer?

My caseworker and the mental health team at the drug/alcohol clinic I've been visiting are trying their best but I'm ready to dash them away and sink again. I just don't know.... I haven't hit bottom yet. I shudder to think what it will be. I'm not ready to stop. It's the only thing that makes me feel like a million dollars.

I think, most likely, that I'll end up climbing a mountain and jumping off. But who knows what the future holds. I don't foresee much but hypothetical attempts. Cutting has proved too difficult. I need something assured.

Hopefully I can prove myself wrong.

Be well, please.
