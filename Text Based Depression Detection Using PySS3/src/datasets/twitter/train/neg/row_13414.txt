ending my life seems like an easy way to fix my problemskilling myself seems like a good way to fix all my problems and end all my joys, today has been the hardest day to not kill myself, as i was ready to do it but stopped because someone messaged me on steam, my only joy right now is being on teamspeak w/ people. overall right now i have no reasons to live.

have a good day lads &lt;3
