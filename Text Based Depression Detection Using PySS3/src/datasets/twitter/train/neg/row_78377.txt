Ever cry yourself to sleep on a public bus?I have. And today looks like another one of those days. Trouble literally finds me everywhere. Insomniac yelled at for sleeping on the couch (not "wow you slept, high-five!!"). Three hours of sleep. Don't look good, don't feel good. Have to be customer-ready by eleven. I smell. I hate myself. I already allocated my belongings to family members, so I feel a little better! But not by much - the girl I love is struggling too. And it's just been LDR-hard! I am under so much weight (120lbs cant hold that all up). If I hanged by my emotions alone my neck would snap clean. I am always called a liar. Always out of money. Always nearly homeless.. I just.. I can barely see what im typing through those quiet tears that don't fall but just sting! Be my friend. I feel so small and unloved by most of my immediate world. I'm a guy, i'm 17, and im just fucking sad af. Ttyl until... I mean..until I go at last.
