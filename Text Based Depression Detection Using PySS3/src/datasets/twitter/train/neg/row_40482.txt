My life has been steadily collapsing since 2017. Now? I'm almost over the edge.Earlier today, I received news that I have been removed from a course because of the fact I had missed my deadline by 2 hours. My father paid almost Â£3,000 for this course, and I still haven't had the courage to tell him. Upon hearing this news, I had probably one of the worst panic attacks that I've ever had. This is what's pushing me over the edge. I never particularly enjoyed the course, but I would usually always do the bare minimum. Now that I don't have this, I don't have anything. 

I'm 18, almost 19. I was taken out of high school in my last year because of personal problems, where me and my family moved to Finland, where I've been for the past year. In 2018 I barely passed any of my A-Level mock exams. I pretty much failed them. I wasn't worried about it, and told myself I'd do better for the real thing. This is where everything started to collapse. That summer, I did nothing but spend 18+ hours on my computer, everyday, for 2 months. I'd been suicidal before, for this exact reason. Come November, and I'm told I have to drop everything, and move to Finland. I have nothing here. I have no friends, I have no education, I have no job, I have literally nothing. My parents are on holiday right now, and I'm home alone. I have no one I could call, no one to be with me, if I killed myself, I wouldn't be found for a week or two. I feel incredibly guilty, and that feeling is already worsened by the fact that there are christmas presents under our christmas tree for me. I've felt suicidal before but never as much as I feel now. Everything feels like it'll be solved by just ending it, because I have nothing to live for anymore. I'm sitting here crying into my pillow as I try to type this, I don't know what to do.
