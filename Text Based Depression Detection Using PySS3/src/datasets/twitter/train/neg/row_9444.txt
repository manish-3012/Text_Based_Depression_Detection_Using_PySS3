My crybaby postI don't know. Off work sick. Like as in I'm physically ill.
I just feel like now would be a good time to go ahead with my plan. I mean, I just want to be done with "the whole race, the whole business". Life is stupid for me. I hate my job with a passion. I need to start a decent career but I can't decide what to do. I'm sick of people, I don't like them. I pollute people, and society is polluted already. I can't hand in my means because I'm so used to living on the thin edge of life.
25M, I should probably just grow a pair.
