How can I get help?Sorry if this has been posted before or if this info is in the sidebar, I didn't see it when I looked. 

I have attempted suicide and think I should at least give therapy a try but I am 19 and completely dependent on my parents and I don't want them to know. I probably can't pay for it because I am unemployed while I am in school, and my parent's wouldn't pay for it because they don't "believe" in mental illness or therapy. Are there any resources for this kind of situation or am I on my own? I think the suicide hotline is for more emergency situations and I probably wouldn't do well in some sort of support group because of social anxiety. 

I know I'm asking for a lot but any help is appreciated thanks in advance.
