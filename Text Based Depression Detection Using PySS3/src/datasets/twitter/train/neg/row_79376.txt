Should I tell herI recently met up with this girl I confessed my love for in my senior year of highschool. She always just wanted to be friends but Iâ€™m still pretty sure sheâ€™s my soul mate. I met up with her this summer to hang out as I was hoping for closure but I pretty much got the opposite. And confirmed 4 years later I never stopped loving her. 
We were texting a couple days ago and she asked how I was, Iâ€™m not sure if it was the weed but I decided to answer that question honestly for the first time in my life. And I said â€œnot great Iâ€™m really going through itâ€. She expressed the amount of concern youâ€™d expect from anyone, and I responded explaining the way I feel constantly can only be described as depression. 
Before she could respond I tried to back track somewhat apologising for saying all of that out of nowhere and putting her in a situation where she should be worried, explaining the fact that my mental health is something Iâ€™ve never talked to anyone about. She responded saying â€œeveryone should have someone they can talk to about mental health, And if I feel comfortable enough why donâ€™t I talk to herâ€. 
And here I am now making this post. If Iâ€™m in any way honest with her, and I tell her the truth which is: Iâ€™ve given up mentally and emotionally and purely live right now for the sake of others, and I hate everything about myself. How will she ever see me the same? Iâ€™ve spent the past 4 years wearing a clown mask and pretending on social media. Iâ€™m not sure sheâ€™ll ever see me the same. Or Iâ€™d even have a shot with her. But she seems genuinely curious now. What should I do.... Iâ€™m so hesitant because I know sheâ€™s the cure to my depression. I confirmed it when I met up with her and she took every worry off my mind. And how they all came crashing back when she had to leave. Do I tell her, or continue this charade until I one day have a chance to be the person I think she deserves?
