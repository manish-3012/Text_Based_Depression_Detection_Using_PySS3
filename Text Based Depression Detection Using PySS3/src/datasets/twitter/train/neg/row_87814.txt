I am freaking outI am a person who fears death in any shape or form because i do not/cannot know what comes after it. But lately,as school started; i find myself just thinking about doing it off the bat. I want to hurt myself. The amount of disgust and hate i have for myself makes those thoughts louder and being around people in that state clearly makes it worse. I have had a really rough couple of years but i hate this one, i am taking meds,going to a therapist but honestly i still want to injure myself. I canâ€™t live with myself. I tell myself,theres people who have it worse then me,and there clearly is. But i still cant do it some days to wake up and stare at that disgusting face in the mirror.
I just wanted to share my feelings,i am getting help.
