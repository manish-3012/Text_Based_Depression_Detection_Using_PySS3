May loose full time job and full ride scholarship...Ill try to keep it quick. Basically Im in a very very very good situation right now as a young man. Im in a special program that fully pays for my education while teaching me a trade and pays me 35k a year basically right out of high school, zero debt, living comfortably and independently.

But recently, ive been having a hard time retaining and understanding certain concepts in my trade resulting in a low grade in my evaluation and its 3 points from failing. If I dont get it up next month, I loose everything... im getting tested for ADD to see if that's the problem. Its a very complex trade. 

Anyways, I know for a fact that I'll never get an opportunity like this again and im seriously considering ending it all if I get fired/kicked out of this program. I don't believe in god and I don't think anything supernatural happens after you die. I feel like life truly is pointless and we will never understand our existence so why not just end it all. Also, just seeing how so much evil, violence, and environmental destruction is in the world the just makes me want to not be a part of this reality anymore. 

But if I bring my grade on the job up, graduate and keep the money flowing, I see no reason to give up that life.
