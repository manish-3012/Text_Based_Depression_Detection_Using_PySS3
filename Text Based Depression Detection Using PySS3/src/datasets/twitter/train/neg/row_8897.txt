Anyone willing to help me out? Someone in the Worcester county area in Massachusetts please read below.I've tried seeking all advice, I've been on antidepressants since I was 8, and I'm 24. I have manic treatment resistant depression, severe OCD and anxiety, and have low cognitive function because I was injured many time as a kid and was hit in my head. I barely function, I'm broke, no friends, I'm alone, can't get a job and can't get social security. I can't go to school because of my loans and cant work because of my illness, and can't do both to support myself through school because of the same thing. I also can't go to the army because of past psychiatric hospitalizations which I'd like to do for respect since I have no respect for myself and no one has ever respected me. I can't get disability either because apparently I'm not ill enough. I screwed up all opportunities in my life, push everyone away and am completely dead inside. There really is no hope for me I've tried it all, the only reason I'm still alive is because of my mother, father, and sister (If I killed myself they would be the only ones at my funeral I'm 99% sure of that) I don't want to devastate them. I feel like there's a constant category 5 hurricane in my head 24/7 and the only thing that makes me feel is weed. I can barely tie my fucking shoes so I cant make a noose, I cant get a gun at all in this fucking state thanks to psychos shooting up schools, I'm afraid of heights and live nowhere near a comfortable drop to my death, and overdose/poisoning is a terrible way to go because if you fail you're life is going to be horribly shortened due to serious organ damage. I don't want to paint my bathtub with my blood by slitting/warm bath, and don't want to kill myself in my home because that's even worse devestation. Does anyone.. anyone want to help me die please? Please. I tried it all theres no hope and now I dont even care about devestating anyone, I need this for myself. Please help me.
