This is the closest I have ever gotten.I know I've suffered from either depression or anxiety or some combination for the last few years. After my first year in law school, things just got profoundly worse. I hate where I go to school because I just don't get along with my classmates. All of my friends live me than 1,000 miles from me, and I just have **no one** here. I've tried so hard to be outgoing, polite, friendly, and fun to be around, but law students are some of the most vapid and one-dimensional people you will ever meet in your life--especially the ones at a state university.

Anyway, the most recent turn of events have just sent me over the edge. For the last week, I've been a veritable zombie...I had to put alcohol in my coffee just to be able to feel something in the morning at class. I come home everyday and cry.

I tried transferring over the summer, but my grades just weren't good enough. I was rejected from every school to which I applied for transfer. While that in itself stings, the real baseball bat to the face just happened: it turns out my school made a mistake with my grades. The reason I couldn't transfer wasn't because of my own lack of academic fortitude, it was my professors' inability to do their fucking jobs. That said, it's too late to appeal the decisions, since classes are beginning everywhere on Monday. So, I'm stuck here and I'm absolutely fucking miserable.

I have no idea what to do...I'm just so depressed right now, and I have no one to talk to at all.
