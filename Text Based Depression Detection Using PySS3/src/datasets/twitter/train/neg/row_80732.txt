What next?I feel so scared for the future. I know its totally normal to have doubts and worries, be it about jobs, money, kids etc... but I just don't SEE my future. It is empty. I feel hopeless. I am a burden. Yet despite this, I can see everyone elses future. I can see my parents retiring, my partner doing a masters, my friends son growing up and starting school... but I just aren't in the picture. 

I am starting to feel totally worthless again, and after lots of counselling I hoped that feeling wouldn't return so quickly and I hoped I had the coping skills to deal with it on my own. I was holding my friends baby the other day, looking in his eyes and I just cried.. repeating over and over to him "I am begging you, please, please don't turn out like me.." It was a poignant moment for me as it was when I realised that I aren't doing as well as what people think I am. They just consider the good days and ignore the many bad days.

The truth is that I am unhappy with my life. And I am lonely. I can't cope with my own emotions. And yes I have already done all the textbook things to "cheer myself up".. I've started new hobbies, do volunteering every week, even tried yoga, cut out toxic people and even found an alternative to SH (2 years clean), and yet whenever I am alone... I am vulnerable. The over-thinking, the crying, the not knowing, the insecurity, all these things just suffocating me. I am unable to live in the moment without thinking "everything in your life is going to go away one day, nothing is permanent, change is coming".

I just know in the future it will be better if I wasn't around. One day I will be at peace with myself.. no worries and no stress and no doubts, and that day will be when I am no longer here.

So, what next? Making a plan.
