When I am dead I will no longer have to worry about any of this, and that is the point.I hate living. I hate this world. When I die I won't have to worry about my weight, about HIV/AIDS, about money, about getting old and ugly, about eating unhealthy or healthy food, about violent crime and poverty in American cities and how the suburbs get all the jobs and wealth, about living and working somewhere I don't want to, about being unhappy, which I always am. . .
