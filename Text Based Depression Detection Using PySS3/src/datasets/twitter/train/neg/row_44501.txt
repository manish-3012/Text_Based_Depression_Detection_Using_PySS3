I relapsedI used to be suicidal when I was younger and actually attempted it once(actual attempt that failed, not for attention, nobody knows about that even today) but i somehow managed to pull myself together, reset and actually get a stable life, I've got a stable job, no debt, decent work relationships -- can't really say I've got very close connections with anyone though, and that's what's killing me because it's what I believe to be the most important thing in life.... 


I broke up with my ex 6 months ago because "we didn't really match well" lol, and then 3 months ago I met someone online on a game who I've talked to for 3 months straight about everything, every day, talked about stuff you normally never open up about to anyone and now they've decided to play with others and basically whatever we had is gone, just like that

So that's 2 major failures within 6 months for me, making me realise that I'm easily replaceable and people get bored of me quick.... So how am I supposed live knowing people can dump me just like that? I don't see a purpose in this, I don't open up to people for this exact reason and the 2 times in 7 years I did, both cases went to shit because I'm too fucked up and not likeable I guess 

For the first time in 7 years after my first suicide attempt, after thinking about it thoroughly, I actually want to die because I don't see a point in this anymore....
