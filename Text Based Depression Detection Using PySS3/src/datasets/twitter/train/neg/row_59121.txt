I never get a breakThings always happen to me all my life. Since I was 18 Ive had to deal with my dad almost dying about three times and every time I get to feel grief again. I even had to wipe his ass when he came home and cant do anyting himself and take care of him and really hard because he yells really so much because he angry at his life. I never get peaceful day at all. It doesnt help that I always been such a loner and ugly woman and no one ever bothers with me that I don't have any friends at all in person much less ever had any relationship and im turning 25. I really feel so unlovable and down lately and so alone in this world. I look even more ugly recently because I have horrible rashes on my body and really bad asthma. The stuff dermatologists give me doesnt even work. And I compare myself to my cousins who always had everything and they never have to deal with things ive had to and they have friends and lovers and good health and babies even. Meanwhile I am one the ugliest woman and its really a painful existence to be an ugly woman because no one wants you. I've even had anxiety all my life that i used to not even be able to order my own food.. I already know that no one wants a piece of shit like me. I really feel like its always just a fight for me to keep living and im at wits end
