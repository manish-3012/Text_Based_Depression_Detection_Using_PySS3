Feeling extremely suicidal because of my pastI grew up with a physically and emotionally abusive family. My parents were very controlling and refused to let me out of the house if they suspected I was going to engage in any non-academic related activities. I grew up as a very socially anxious individual and was often bullied by my peers because they saw me as a socially stunted loner.

I'm now 24 and have no close friends. I struggle to form meaningful relationships with people, and I don't think this is going to change. 

I'm so sick and tired of putting on a performance and trying to act happy on an everyday basis. Nobody wants to deal with a depressed person because it's just easier to be around happy people. 

I honestly want to die. I already tried to kill myself by suffocating myself with a plastic bag, but I always ended up tearing the bag off when it got uncomfortable. If anyone has any other suggestions for a painless suicide method, it would be a blessing.
