i dont know what i believe in anymorei used to believe in god and the afterlife. i didnt care that i was probably not going to heaven. i felt ok because i know all the people here who deserved another chance would get one and get to be happy. but now i have the feeling that this is it. this stupid shithole of a planet is all we get. there is no heaven. there is no place where the abused and innocent can be free from the evil people of this god forsaken planet. we will not get a chance to rest when this is over. god will not welcome me home with open arms. it will just be nothingness.

i've wasted my whole life trusting that there was something better waiting if you earned it. what is the point of continuing living if it will all end in blackness all the same
