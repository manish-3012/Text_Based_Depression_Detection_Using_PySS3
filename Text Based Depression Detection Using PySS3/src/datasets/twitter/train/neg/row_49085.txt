I'm done.I can't handle this existence anymore. My cousin just committed suicide, and even though I wasn't very close to her anymore I feel like I should just end it as well. My family isn't very supportive and they don't quite understand my struggle of unemployment due to terrible anxiety and suicidal thoughts. I've already been hospitalized twice this year due to 1 suicide attempt and 1 instance where I simply called the suicide hotline. I'm sick of being a burden on my dad, and I'm sick of just existing in this shit world.
