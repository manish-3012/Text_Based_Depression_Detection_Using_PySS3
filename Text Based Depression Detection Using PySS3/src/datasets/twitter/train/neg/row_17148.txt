I don't know whether to kill myself tonight or notI tried once before as a cry for help, and once before seriously. Mental health services have a been a constant cycle of referrals, nothing has been done since I first requested help a year ago. My family are on holiday, friend is at uni and there is another friend staying at my flat tonight so I can give her a hug goodbye and not really be alone while it happens. I think I'm gonna get really drunk and take pills again and cut my wrist, and it'll hopefully make me pass out again. I'm in the process of deleting my Facebook and bank details and stuff now, but I'm still mulling it over. Should I? I can't get the help I need. It's hopeless. K don't know what to do but this.
