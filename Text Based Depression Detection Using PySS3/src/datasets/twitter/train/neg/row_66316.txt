things my dad has said to me and bonus rantâ€œitâ€™s just hormones, youâ€™ll grow out of itâ€
oh! ok! still wanna fucking kill myself tho

â€œget a hobbyâ€
we donâ€™t have the money and you wouldnâ€™t approve of my hobbies anyway

â€œhonestly why arenâ€™t you in college right now? you have the mind to go to college early.â€
shut the fuck up

â€œstop saying that youâ€™re going to kill yourselfâ€
oh hoh hoh! what do you think youâ€™ll achieve with that? do you want me to shut up so you can go back to two days ago when you had no idea that i wanted to die?

â€œyou need to get off your medication soon.â€
k

â€œyouâ€™re going to do great things.â€
are you sure about that?

â€œi love you.â€
i know.

â€œyouâ€™re the only reason why iâ€™m alive.â€
i know.

â€œstop talking bad about yourself!â€
then stop telling me your unrealistic fantasies about my future.

â€œyouâ€™ll get over it, your brain just needs to work things out.â€
and other hilarious things you can tell yourself

i love my dad but god... he doesnâ€™t understand. he doesnâ€™t understand and i feel so lost in this world. i just want to kill myself so i donâ€™t have to deal with everyoneâ€™s disappointment with the fact that iâ€™m not going to be a fucking senator, lawyer, doctor, or shit like that. i canâ€™t do it. iâ€™m not that person.

i hate this world.
