Honestly F*** LivingThis morning I sucked the nitrous out of two cans of cream, did some cough syrup, Ritalin, and a couple other drugs in preparation for ending it. I put on my favorite Alice in Chains songs and just writhed and cried on the floor for 20 minutes before tying myself a noose out of my Daddyâ€™s elastic bands. As it was, my survival instinct kicked in and as the cartoids were not crushed I got undone, barely. I hate myself for it. 

My bulimia is acting back up. I feel physically weak from it. My bipolar is killing me. The depression is endless. I turned 18 a month ago, I have no job and cannot drive. Nobody loves me. No one ever has. My ex boyfriend raped me. I only dated him to please my mom. My girlfriend killed herself and blamed my addictions. 

Nobody loves me. All i want is to be loved. Ive never known that. Not since my nana died five years ago. All I know are the endless insults and hate that i recieve. I get put down daily. Im the freak. Nobody loves me. I really must be useless.  I have one friend who has little time for me. I doubt she cares. My therapist is paid to care. Mommy is just there to yell; daddy just screams back. I feel so lost. I hate myself. Whats the point. Whats the point. 

I feel like a complete failure in life. I have nothing to offer. The last thing the world needs is another tortured artist.
