I fucked up big time. Trying not to "An Hero" but I feel I'm close to the edge. (M 14)So lets have some background info first. I have a slight stealing problem if you could even say so. I'm struggling with my grades at the moment, because I haven't been doing my homework for  a reason not even I can come up with, I just haven't been doing it. So in return for that, I get my stuff taken away blah blah punishment. Anyways so fast-forward afew days, I end up sneaking some of my stuff back in the middle of the night and use it or take it to school (Mainly my ds). So I get caught within a month or two at the latest, get scolded, sometimes spanked, and told not to do it again. But this time, I really fucked up. I did it again, about the 3rd time I've done it this month, and my mom got so mad she began to cry. I don't mean tears of pure rage, I saw tears of genuine sorrow. It made me feel worthless, like a waste, that I somehow made my mother cry tears of sadness from MY actions. It made me realize what a lost cause I really was, just making me want to end it all. I'm not doing this for attention or something silly like that, but I really need some help. This situation caused my depression to literally rip through my anti-depressant medication I take every day. Someone please help me figure out a way I can just stop without ending it all. I don't want to see my mom cry like that ever again

Edit: What really made me suffer with depression so badly was being sexually assaulted by a male, in my age group, in the locker room of my school last year nearly every other day. Would prefer not to get into too much detail about it.
