i nearly killed myself the other day. i'm glad i didn't.this is painful. i am still in pain, but i am better than i was, and i know i'm going to be okay.

it came about when a years-long emotionally avoidant self-sabotage campaign come to a close. my greatest fear had been realized, all at my own hands: i'd successfully ruined the best thing that ever happened to me. i pushed the woman of my dreams away so much that she'd had enough, and wouldn't be coming back. i manifested my own greatest fear of being rejected and left alone with nobody to blame but myself.

i had a full-blown panic attack. a total meltdown. i wanted to end my life, straight up. i was either going to jump from a bridge, or take a couple valium and cut open my arm and drift away. the pain of knowing i had caused my own demise and the pain of knowing i'd deliberately let such a wonderful person go. all of the misery i had put her through for the last few years was super condensed and returned-to-sender straight to my heart. it was, in a word, unbearable. truly.

it's humbling to know just how powerful your own will can be. i had willed that i would ruin my own life and relationship, and i did just that. but i'm done with that. i'm choosing to will all the goodness and love and happiness i can muster, because for once, i truly believe i deserve it. i've forgiven myself for the pain i've inflicted onto her and onto me. i am ready to be the person i already am. the best version of myself. i'm not sure if it will be her whom i end up sharing that with. i hope it is. but i'm opening myself up for whatever might come next.

i'm glad i didn't hurt myself. i'm sad it got to that point.
