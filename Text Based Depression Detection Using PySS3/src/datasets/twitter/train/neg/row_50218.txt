Ladedadeda~ another suicidal blokeIt's nice to know i'm not alone in my thoughts- my suicidal ones. I've had them on and off since I was 12, they have gotten more diminished in my mind as the years go on but it's still a nagging part of my brain that wedged into the back of my skull. I can't depend on others for my emotional well being; that has been proven to me time and time again... can't open up to my family, or my friends. Can't open up to my family, because I always receive a wrong response which just makes it worse. My friends, hah what friends- supposedly they are my friends, and I do care about them, but they are never here for me... which when we were kids it made sense... they are kids, their concerns should be self-centered (all kids are narcissistic little shits). But we are older now supposedly they are still my friends, and that means little to nothing now. Can't even depend on my animal friends because they are dead.

I know I need to fix myself up myself- there is no other option. And I know I can do it... it'd just hard somedays, like today. Hard to convince myself of my self-worth. I think i'm going to be okay. I'm used to being alone- it can't hurt me anymore. And while I can't stand the thought of the rest of my life being that way, I know I can succeed because I have before; not for long, maybe a few months of happiness at a time... but it gives me hope. If I lose that hope then I really will be in danger.

But for now i'll just have that dark little voice and thoughts swimming around in the back of my head, I don't think they will ever really go away... until I die that is.
