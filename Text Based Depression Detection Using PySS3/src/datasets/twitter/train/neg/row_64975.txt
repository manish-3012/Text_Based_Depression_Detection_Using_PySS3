I feel like i have to "test" it before i goI have a lot to live for, i do realise that. I also have a lot i want to not live for, and those thoughts are taking over. Hence it's really difficult to be 100% certain if it's what i really want. The last few days I've been contemplating putting myself in a life threatening situation with a way to get saved so that i can "test" whether it's the way to go or not. Not sure i why i wanted to post this, just had to get it off my mind somewhere and the suicide hotlines in my country are absolute horseshit
