Struggling w/ depression and suicidal thoughts; not feeling very hopefulI'm really struggling right now. I've been dealing with some pretty hardcore depression for about six years now, and in the past two years it's developed into bouts of extreme suicidal ideation. I've thrown myself into therapy, I've tried every med my psych tosses my way, and I just continually feel as if I'm getting worse. Therapy is becoming really difficult to go to--I go because I hope it will help, but I feel so guilty making my therapist worry, and I can tell that many of the things I voice upset her. She's a great therapist, I just am feeling despondent and difficult during our sessions, and I come home feeling even worse; like I can't express what I want to and they never go how I want them to. 

That kind of ties into how I have felt just generally in decline; my world has gotten so small and I feel very broken. I remember being so much lighter and brighter, and now I've got a brain of rotting mud. I have a lot of trouble concentrating and sometimes it's hard for me to speak clearly or in complete sentences. It's terrifying to feel that I've lost so much of my self. 

I can't imagine the future. I want to be dead, and I spend a lot of time thinking about how to make that happen. I am so very tired, but I would never want to bring more harm or suffering into this world. There are many beautiful things in this world, and many very terrible, I just do not think I am capable of being a part of any of it. When I'm really low, it's all I can think about. Other times, the idea of killing myself is like a low, constant hum. I feel like I'm in a liminal state where I haven't offed myself yet but neither am I actually living. It feels like a very slow death--just an incomplete one. 

I know this is a very rambling post and I'm honestly not altogether sure why I'm posting, I think I am just seeking the comfort of putting these thoughts out there.
