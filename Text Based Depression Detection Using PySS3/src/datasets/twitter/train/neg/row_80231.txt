The walls are closing inI try so hard to get my homework done but I just can't seem to do it even though I know it's important. I know that I'm running out of money but I don't feel like I can handle a job on top of school, but I don't think I can't handle school anyway... I'm just letting it all fall apart. I don't know what I was thinking trying to go back to school for a third time. I'm never going to get my degree. It's going to end the same way it always does, in a huge disaster. I need to email my professors and ask if I can turn in assignments late for partial credit. I need to make an appointment at my University counselling center because I need help. I need to but I just can't. I can't even eat even though I recognize that I'm literally starving to death. Can't eat. Can't sleep. Can't do my homework. Can't do much of anything except stare at the ceiling and drink coffee practically by the gallon and scream at myself inside my head to just. do . something. And I just can't seem to say any of it out loud. I need so badly to say it out loud. I don't want to die but the more I faint and vomit and waste away and refuse to get help, the more I think I'm letting it happen anyway. I'm drowning but I'm so locked inside my head. I always knew I was capable of mistreating myself but I had no idea the downward spiral could go so deep.
