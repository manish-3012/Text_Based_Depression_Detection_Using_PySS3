Sitting on a cliffMy ex went on a spring break with two of her friends. I can't get her with some random dudes out of my mind. I had 2 panic attacks already. I'm in the woods sitting on a cliff above the river. I reached out to my friends about my ex and they just ignore me. I got distant with them during my relationship. I reached out to her too. That made me feel even worse. Rocks and water down there seem so beautifull. It's not so high but if I break my legs, I won't be able to swimm out. I told her what to tell my family when I'm gone. I don't even blame her. It's my fault for letting her play with my feelings for 6 years.
