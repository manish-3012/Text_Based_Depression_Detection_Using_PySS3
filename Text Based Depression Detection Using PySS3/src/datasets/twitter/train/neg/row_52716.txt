Either way im a burdenOn mobile so sorry for the shit formatting in the upcoming wall of text. Killing myself would implode every kind of structure around me. My girlfriend is not mentally stable enough to go on after i kill myself and would probably meet the same fate. My mom would absolutely kill herself if i did (im the only child to a teen mom her world kinda revolves around me). They know im suicidal which only makes it worse bc i feel guilty that my life is "good" by all accounts yet i still dont have a reason to live. I make everyone around me misserable bc they cant help me. Ive never had any goals in life. Ive hated school since i was little and now in my 3rd year of uni its the worst its ever been. My ideal life would be a life where i dont do anything. Literally. If i could be a stay at home dad without a child tp take care of my life would be happy. Or whatever the guy version of a trophy wife/ sugar momma is. Everything ive ever been good at is bc its been easy. Anything i actually enjoy doing im bad at which eventually makes me hate it. The only thing ive ever been good at is videogames and its not like im going to be a pro gamer any time soon or do anything meaningful with that "talent". Even the enjoyment in that is starting to fade. I'm completely hopeless. Im here counting down the days until i stop caring enough about my mom or gf to let them be my only will to live. In the meantime ive stoped giving a fuck about every other facet of my life. I basically just exist and existence is bullshit. The concept of death feels like it would be a blessing. Im certain suicide is the option for me and know ill go through with it one day. Just not yet. until i decide when i want to die i play overwatch on XB1 alot. Its basically the only thing that will make me just kinda numb and focus on that instead of ny shitty existence. If anyone would like to lobby and talk cool. If not thats fine too i dont really expect anyone to give a shit.
