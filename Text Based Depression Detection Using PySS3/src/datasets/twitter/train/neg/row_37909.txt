Holding on by a thread....I am holding on by a thread right now. I miss my son so much.  My heart is aching.  Christmas was his favorite holiday.  There is zero joy now today nor really any day since he made his horrible decision to leave us.   I donâ€™t want to be here but must stay to be there for my husband and other son.  So I keep living for them and try to keep smiling through the depression.  Itâ€™s so hard. I hope all you can find some happiness through this holiday.
