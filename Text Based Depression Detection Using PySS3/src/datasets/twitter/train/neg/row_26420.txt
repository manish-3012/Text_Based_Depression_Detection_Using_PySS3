Why do wish so much violence on myself when I cant stomach it normally?I cant really get into violent, bloody movies. I cant into violent video games. Horror movies and tv shows have never been my thing.

I dont have anything against these forms of media, nor do I have a negative opinion of those who regularly choose to consume. It's just not my cup of tea, and it is for others.


Yet. When envisioning my suicide, I cant stop making it more andam more violent. A simple hanging or gunshot doesnt really suffice. Its gotta be, like, many gun shots and stab wounds... pouring gasoline on myself and lighting a match. 

Even though I want to write notes and the usual stuff, I also want to make myself, like, totally disfigured and unrecognizable. I want to force either a closed-casket funeral or go straight to cremation.

And it's just like, what's wrong with me? Why do I hate myself this goddamn much? Theres not some other soul I want to physically harm even at all, yet, for myself, I want to go out in the most brutal, violent way possible.
