I see no reason to not kill myself.I'm 15 years old and I live in germany. I'm good at school, pretty much the best in my class. My family is friendly and loving. I could do anything a 15 year old would want. I already flew around the world. Most people would say I have a perfect life. But I am suffering severe depression. I already jumped in front of a train, only problem is that the train saw me and stopped in time. After that my mother didn't send me to school for 2 months, so that I couldn't kill myself. But I still don't feel any better. Everything makes me feel bad. I hate how I feel my blood flowing through my body, I hate to feel my hearbeat, I hate to breath, I hate feeling sad all the time and I hate that I have to worry about my future.

The only reason that I have not killed myself yet is that I actually truly don't know any way to kill myself. I cannot get a gun, I don't know how to hang myself, there are no high buildings in my area and I already tried trains.

I am serious. I don't know how other people can be alive without wanting to die. I can't understand why anyone who owns a gun wouldn't shoot himself. I can't understand the notion of wanting to live.
