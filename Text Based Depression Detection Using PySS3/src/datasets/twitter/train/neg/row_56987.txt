25, no friends, no job, no degree, no real will to live; I'm just bad at suicideAs per title. I'm tired of shitty side-effects from medications that seem more-or-less randomly prescribed, and I'm tired of fighting even to make appointments with psychologists/psychiatrists whose hands are tied because they're working in under resourced systems.

I've 'attempted' at least twice, if you can call my shitty attempts at hanging actual attempts. I say at least twice because I've been involuntarily hospitalized twice, one time the police were sent to my door. All the hospitals do here is hold you and pump you full of drugs, there's no therapy, no plan post-release, it's a complete crap-shoot. All they've done is teach me to never talk about suicide with therapists or anyone who knows where I am, which I guess is what they want because that way I'm consuming fewer resources.

I'm just a drain on society that needs to go away.
