Plans If you would like to hear my plans for suicide I have two and they are both flawless.

I am actually proud of this one. So first pour a energy drink into a blender then add 900 mg of Vyvanse + 90mg of paliperidone+ 300mg of Zoloft then blend it all up. After blending this up I put a noose around my neck I drink the cocktail and inject a epipen (epinephrine) into my neck then hop. If you are unfamiliar with these medications basically Vyvanse, caffeine, and epinephrine are all stimulants that will, when taken together in such quantities, will destroy my cardiovascular system. The anti-psychotic and depressant have known adverse reactions.

The second is much simpler. Fill the bath tub with flammable liquids, and maybe some solids to keep it burning. Then submerge and ignite.
