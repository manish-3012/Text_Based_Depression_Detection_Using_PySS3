I want to seek help, but I'll never be able to get a job if I do.I'm currently working on becoming a commercial pilot. I've been suffering with suicidal thoughts for years, and I know that most airlines have no tolerance policy on pilots with mental illness. (I would never do anything to anyone else, don't worry.) My family doesn't know, my friends don't know, and they often give me shit for stuff like sleeping too much, not wanting to do things, and eating too much. I don't want to get help because of the risk of me not getting a job, and the stigma with asking for help. I don't know how much longer I'm gonna last.
