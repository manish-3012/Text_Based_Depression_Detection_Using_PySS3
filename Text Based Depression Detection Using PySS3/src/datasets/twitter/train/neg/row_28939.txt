Sorry for posting here yet again. Just want to vent somewhere safe.I'm a 22 year old and my life is really pathetic. I still live with my parents and work a low-paying job despite having recently graduated from college. I realized a few months ago that I have a lot of issues that need to be worked on, such as anxiety, depression, and trauma. All 3 of these issues have been pervasive for most of my life, but I didn't realize how bad it was until recently. Anyway. Naturally, I began having suicidal thoughts as a kid and it just hasn't stopped.


I feel like people will be better off if I died or simply never existed. All I seem to do is cause issues. I get angry at my parents and we fight. Sure, they say horrible things to me and each other, but I should be able to control myself. I feel like an insolent child. I vent to friends and they get uncomfortable and leave. I've managed to keep two friends for years, and they say I'm a great and supportive friend, but they'll get tired of me and leave too. Seems like 95% of the people in my life that I get close to leave, so why shouldn't they? I wouldn't be too upset, because I deserve to be alone and they don't need me being a burden and holding them back.


I don't really have any goals. I started going to therapy again and think I found a good fit. I'll be going at least once a week if this works out. I'm supposed to come to the next session with goals, but I can't think of any. If I feel like I don't deserve to get better, why am I even wasting my therapists' time and going to therapy?


There's more but I'm just too tired. If you guys read this and have questions I can try to answer. Wouldn't be surprised if this was ignored too though.
