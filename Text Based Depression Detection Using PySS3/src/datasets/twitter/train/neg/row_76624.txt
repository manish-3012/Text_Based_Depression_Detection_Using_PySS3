Youâ€™re not who I thought you wereThe guy Iâ€™ve been seeing (weâ€™re both 20) just confessed to me he dated a 16 y/o in school during the summer, obviously we didnâ€™t know each other so that doesnâ€™t bother me. What bothers me is that he portraits himself as this intelectual morally superior guy, who would never disrespect anyone and I think a 16 year old is way too easy to manipulate. Iâ€™ve had several abusive relationships in the past so I know a lot about that topic. Iâ€™m really scared he approached this girl to use her, since heâ€™s told me he didnâ€™t really like her that much so he ended things quickly. 
Iâ€™m really scared Iâ€™m gonna get used again.
I really wanna end my life because I feel Iâ€™m prone to this and that it is my destiny: being used, being the second choice always, being manipulated, being abused.
I used to think about him as my soulmate and now heâ€™s just another pretentious college student who walks by his old high school trying to impress girls.
Iâ€™m really sad, I really thought I found someone I could trust.
Iâ€™m meant for this
Iâ€™m meant for misery
I canâ€™t take another minute being aware that Iâ€™m easy to trick
I am
I should kill myself
No one will ever love me
No one has ever loved me
Not even my parents
I was a fucking mistake
