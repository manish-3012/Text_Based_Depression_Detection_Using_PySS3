Scared of Corona virus and want to escape my fears at any cost.I made a similar post on a subreddit for depression support and they lead me here, but to sum it up: I'm 20, I just got over my depression got into my dream school and everything is going right. For the first time in my life I feel like I have a home and a future. Or well I did, I have chronic bronchitis and every morning I cough up old blood. I'm scared if I get sick I'll have to be put on a respirator and separated from my boyfriend and my entire support system that got me to this point. I'm so scared. if I'm going to die anyway I want it to be quick. I don't want to slowly choke to death on a respirator. I'm a paranoid mess. I just clean and look at numbers, the more I watch Canada's numbers rise the more I want to die.
