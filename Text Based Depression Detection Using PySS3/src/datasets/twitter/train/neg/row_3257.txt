Lost everything, need help or support or a kind word or something?!I've been crying for hours now, I've lost everything. I don't know what to do. I've never had any suicidal thoughts before in my life, I don't even believe in an afterlife, even I think it's crazy but I can't get the idea that it would be somehow better if I wasn't around to feel this pain.. cowards way out?

I done something terrible and now I've lost everything, my job, my friends, the only girl I've ever loved, lost everyone close to me, I have no one.

I'm lost, I don't know what to do, I'm crying endless tears as I write this out now. I just don't see any hope.

I'm so lonely, so sad, so depressed.

I don't know. I can't stop crying.
