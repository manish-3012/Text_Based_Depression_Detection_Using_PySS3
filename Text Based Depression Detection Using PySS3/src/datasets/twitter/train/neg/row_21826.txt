How do people stay positive?My boyfriend is about to leave me. I hage no where that wants me and my only choice is living in my car or with my abusive mother. I have no idea what to do with my dog. She's my ESA but my mother wont let her come with me. I'm in a lot of debt.... I have no friends... I dont have an escape and I dont enjoy my hobbies anymore. I stopped taking my medication for my autoimmune disease and I just hope everyday that it might actually kill me. I hate being afraid of death. But I'm so sick of suffering. I dont feel like there is a light at the end of the tunnel. I'm a firm believer that some people who are born into this world just dont belong... I'm one of those people. It's just not the right time for me.
