I canâ€™t Iâ€™m so closeFirst my dad dies of a plane crash in 2017. I started to feel a way I never have and thoughts and feelings and overwhelming anxiety all started pushing me into a corner of self doubt. I slowly got better. But then I broke up with my girlfriend. The stress of a relationship is so hard. Then I got better, but then I was falsely accused of asking for nudes of a underaged girl. I never said anything like that. 

I donâ€™t want to do this anymore the trauma and the way that the people on this earth donâ€™t give a single fuck if I were to straight up leave is unbearable .
