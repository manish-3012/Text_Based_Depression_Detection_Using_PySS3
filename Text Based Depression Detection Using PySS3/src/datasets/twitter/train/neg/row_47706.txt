Had my first day returned to work, and man I feel empty, pointless and want to die. Help?I had 2 months off from work for covid. I spent it with family and i was way less suicidal, happier etc. I returned to work today and man, i remember why i felt so bad. I work for peanuts, i feel stupid at my job and it feels long and tiring. I have zero friends, zero future, i hust work and go home. I have no time or energy left at the end of the day for my dog. 

I feel super alone now. I get home late, its hard to cook for one, the house was left a fucking pigstay by family and theres hours of cleaning to do, rotten food etc. 

I have guns and could just do it. Ive been fightung this forever, ive tried it all. Life sucks, its exhausting sad and meaningless. I could any night just die
