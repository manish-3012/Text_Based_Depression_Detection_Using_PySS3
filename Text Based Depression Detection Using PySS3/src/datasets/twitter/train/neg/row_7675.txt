I want it all to be overIâ€™ve been depressed and see no way out, Iâ€™ve gotten therapy and taken medication and have been thinking positive thoughts but thatâ€™s all bs and not helping at all. All I want to do is die Iâ€™ve written my suicide note, ended my friendships, made a will, and distanced myself from my entire family. Iâ€™ve thought long and hard about this and how I should go through with it and Iâ€™ve made peace with it. I forgave everyone whoâ€™s ever hurt me and now Iâ€™m ready to let myself finally be at peace. 

I know what Iâ€™m doing is something not a lot of people will understand and struggle with. This in the end is my decision and Iâ€™m so so so tired of fighting against it. Life has worn me down and broken me, so I want to leave while Iâ€™m still happy while Iâ€™m still a person because I fear that my humanity is slipping and that I will fall into a pit of depression worse then the one I am in now.  Goodbye to whoever sees this, I will miss it but I wonâ€™t regret leaving it all behind.
