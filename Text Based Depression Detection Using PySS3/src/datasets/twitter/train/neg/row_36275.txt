After 3 years of pain I've had enough.Not seeking attention. Just putting it out there. Nobody will miss me anyway. I've lost pretty much everything now. Almost 27 years old and I'm pretty much done now. I miss you Haya. I miss you Shir. I miss all my old friends that I eventually lost. I'm sorry to all of you for all the pain my life has caused you. After one failed suicide attempt I've pretty much had enough. My life is a joke and unrecoverable. I hope all those of you out there who need help do try to seek it. It will work for some of you if you really try and have a drive to do it. The world is such a cruel place. I don't know what I did to deserve any of this shit. Enough is enough.
