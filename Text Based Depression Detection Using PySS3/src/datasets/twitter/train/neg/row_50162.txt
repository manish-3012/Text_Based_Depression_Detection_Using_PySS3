Kate SpadeKate Spade was really a final wake up call for me. My mom said, "If she can't be happy, how can anyone? It really goes to show you." MTE. I think it's time for me to leave reddit. I'm planning to leave this life next week (I kind of hate the word "suicide" at this point, I don't want to be associated with what freaks people out, I just want to be free of mental pain, mistakes, trauma, bad home life). Been told in r/Christianity that I would be "murdering" myself and go to hell, but I think God is more loving that that. I've seen so many condemnations of Kate Spade as "selfish" today. I'm sorry. I don't mean to be selfish. I don't want to be a burden. I want peace. I can't find it here, alive. I don't even feel truly alive. I've raised hundreds of dollars for suicide prevention today and hope that can be beneficial in some way, for someone. I will spend my time relaxing, calming down, mentally preparing, and being happy about seeing all the Disney princesses animated together recently, haha. I've come to think that my mom wouldn't be too surprised\-\-very upset\-\-but I feel like she's worried this is inevitable. And it is.
