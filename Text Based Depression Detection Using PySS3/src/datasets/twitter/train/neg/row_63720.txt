trying to make it through the weekendBackstory:

-29/m.  I've been suffering with severe physical anxiety symptoms (dry heaving, trembling, dry mouth, panic, confusion) for 2 years that affect my performance at my awesome new job, and I'm terrified that they will cause me to fail at the role.  I attribute the symptoms to PTSD from a previous 5-year startup job that I joined right out of college where I was in a codependent dynamic with an eccentric, impossible-to-please CEO who treated me sorta like I was his son.  I know that probably sounds pathetic compared to what soldiers experience in war, but I came out of it with some mental health issues.

-Saw a primary care doctor about a month ago to finally get it addressed.  Was prescribed Celexa (SSRI) and Klonopin (benzo.)

-After 1.5 weeks, the doctor told me to go off Klonopin.  I went off it immediately during a particularly stressful day at work, and had a psychotic break involving self harm afterwards.  Felt seriously suicidal for the first time in my life.

-Spent a week crying for help.  Tried to get a psychiatrist ASAP.

-Posted a SW thread last Friday night.  Detailed my psychotic day and said that I was repeating a mantra that I'd kill myself before 1pm on the following Saturday.  Got good advice to go to an ER, take time off work, etc.

-On the following day, I went to the train tracks at 11:00am and let a speeding train miss me while acting like a maniac.  The cops rolled up, had me sit down in the back of the car, and called an ambulance.  I was transported to a psych ward for 5 hours.

-After getting out of the psych ward, I told my best friend that everything I had said was a lie for laughs (even though it was true) and stopped talking to him for a week.  That took a toll on him and damaged the friendship, so now he needs to protect himself.  I take full accountability for my actions and understand.  I also wasted time making a bunch of additional accounts on Reddit to ruin my suicidewatch thread.  I tried to bait people to tell me to kill myself again.  I tried to bait people to hate me.  I kept taking opportunities to harm my credibility in stupid, pointless, superficial ways.

-Cops were called on me 2 times on the following Sunday by my family because I was acting crazy, dramatic, and suicidal, but I was able to talk my way out of getting transported to the psych ward both times.

-Started seeing a good psychiatrist every day of the week since then.  I've been outlining my problems, but I don't have a solution or a path yet.  We're still working on getting the background laid out.

-My dad flew across the country to spend time with me since I'm normally pretty isolated.  It was great, but he just left to fly back home.  I'm feeling very alone all the sudden.

Why I'm posting:

Everything has been so intense and traumatic lately, and even though I feel rational most of the time, I also feel prone to slipping back into all this insanity.  I want to make it through this weekend without doing stupid things.  I want to moderate my suicidal feelings better.  I feel like I'm on a good track, but I'm not far yet.  I still feel vulnerable.  I just wanted to write about it.
