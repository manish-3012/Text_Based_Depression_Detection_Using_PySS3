What should I do?There is this girl that I knew when I lived in the same state as her. She had beautiful black hair and blue eyes. We were literally soul mates. Iâ€™ve never knew what my purpose here was until then. Then something suddenly came up and I had to move away across the continent. The worst decision Iâ€™ve ever made in my entire life. I need her back. Iâ€™ve developed a deep depression from this. I just donâ€™t know how to reach her. Iâ€™ve already checked and she is no where online. I feel like if I find her and she doesnâ€™t want me than I might as well kill myself because thereâ€™s no point in life anymore. All my friends tell me that I am putting all my eggs in one basket but what else should I do? Forget? I can never forget about her. We were lovers. And not the stupid over used â€œboyfriendâ€ â€œ girlfriendâ€ thing. We were so different. Sometimes I feel like itâ€™s impossible for anybody else in the world to feel as much love for someone. I need her back. What should I do?
