I can't overcome thisMonths have gone by, years as well.

It's easy to say you're going to end your life, but a bit more difficult to go through with it.

I tried before, last April, and will again. But, I'm not even for certain that I want to go. It seems like the final resort, though, the only option left.

Tonight may be my final one, I figure.

Take care.
