People need to stop saying: "you're so young get a grip"...Like literally it's fucking annoying!! Yes I'm only 17 and I'm done and sick of life so what? Yes I cut myself daily to feel better. Just because I'm young doesn't mean you can't be depressed and suicidal. Seriously people who say that can fuck off.
