I wanted to take my life when my parents were asleep3 days ago, I was sobbing in bed at 11:27 pm. The thought of taking my own life was so strong, it still rattles my bones. I don't know what triggered me to think so, only knew how shitty I felt. I'm scared the thought might come back again and unsure whether I can handle it well. I'm scared I won't have enough willpower to fight against it. I don't know what to do and I'm afraid to bring this up with anyone especially to my parents. Naturally, being the coward I am, turn to reddit to vent out my feelings.
