Feeling lostThe last 4 months have been some of the worst of my life. Several events happened to occur around the same time - I lost my almost 14 year old dog, the ex that I almost got engaged to, and almost lost my mother all within a month. It's just been snowballing from there. 

I spend my days lonely and not sure what to do with any free time I have. I go to work, sleepwalk through it, go home and stare at my wall for hours. I got a second job at night to fill some of my time and keep me busy, so instead of staring at the wall for 8 hours a day, I only have a couple of hours. 

I'm switching between apathy and dissociation and bouts of crying uncontrollably. I don't care about conversations I have with coworkers, but I pretend to. I laugh and smile around them, but when I'm alone I just break. I go home and either hurt myself or consider it. 

I'm hurting so badly and I don't know how to dig myself out. This isn't my first major depressive breakdown, but it feels like it's heading toward a break worse than the last, during which I was hospitalized and had to drop out of college. 

I started talking to my ex again when he contacted me a couple months after the break-up. He just wants to stay friends, but I don't, and every day is torture. I wish I had the courage to move on again, but I can't. I relive all the mistakes I made every day. 

I see a therapist every 2 weeks. I get outside a lot since I don't drive, so I commute to work via bike. I don't want to die, but I don't want to live. I can't seem to find a new future that I want after losing the future I was going to have with my ex. I don't know if I'll recover this time, and I'm not sure that I want to. I'm 27, and I've struggled with chronic depression since I was 10. I'm so tired of wanting to die and not doing it.
