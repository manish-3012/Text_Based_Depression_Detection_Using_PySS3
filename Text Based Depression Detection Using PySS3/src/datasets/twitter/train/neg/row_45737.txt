Posting again...I posted this a couple days ago...

I don't even know why I am posting.  I guess it's just I have no one to talk to about this sort of thing.  

It's getting worse, and half my day is filled with thoughts of suicide, how much easier it would be.  I don't even know why my appearance bothers me so much, I mean, if all I have to worry about is looking 15 when I'm 22, then I probably have it pretty good. 

I wish I could say it didn't matter to me, but for some reason it means the world. I don't know what to do, dressing older, and having an "older" haircut can only do so much, gaining weight would help, but I'm so depressed I barely eat as is, and im losing weight atm(5'7, 110 lb)...Every day gets harder.  I'm terrified of not aging.  I weigh (and imo look) the same as I did in the 8th grade....and lets face it, looking like a teenage boy is not very attractive.  It's extremely depressing to not even be able to look at yourself in the mirror, because every time I do I get depressed.

Again I don't even know why I'm posting.  I can't get over it, it's been this way for almost a decade.  It's caused my social anxiety, it's caused pretty much every problem I have...I'm just so tired of being miserable.  I feel/look like a child..I don't even know if anti depressents would help, because I don't even think it's a chemical imbalance...I think it's just my situation.
