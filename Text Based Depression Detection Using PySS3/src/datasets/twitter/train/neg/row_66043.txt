Thinking of myself first.My loved ones are aware how I feel. I've told them ever since I was diagnosed BiPolar and UC that them wanting me to stay around is selfish (after i was told suicode is selfish).  I reached out for help, and its been slow going. Too slow. Im on 5 meds a day, tremble constantly, and thd lithium doesnt even take away the thoughts. 

Im so tired of my overthinking, depression, and colitis pain disabling me. No one can see these thinks on the surface. I cant keep taking away my families right to their emotions. They shouldn't have to handle me with kit gloves. I am a financial burden at best, a mediocre dad, and an unsatisfactory partner. I cant even talk about it because I just sound whiney. I hate myself somuch and have all my life. Idk why I thought reaxhing out would help. 

I'm not going to do anything right now, but I have decided when the time is right I will go out on my own terms. Living is bad and I'm bad at it. It wont get better.
