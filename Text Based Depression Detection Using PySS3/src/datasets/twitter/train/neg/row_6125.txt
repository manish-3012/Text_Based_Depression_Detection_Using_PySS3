I am having a problemA lot of things happened to me this month.. MIL dying in front of me, well, that's really the only big thing. But I'm falling apart. I called a local suicide watch two days ago and they talked me down, then today it came up again so I called and it was the same woman. I felt SO ashamed. I don't want to be thinking this all the time. I used to just cut, it was so simple. Now I want to jump off a building. I don't want to hurt anymore. I know if I can ride this out I'll be better later. How do I get past this?
