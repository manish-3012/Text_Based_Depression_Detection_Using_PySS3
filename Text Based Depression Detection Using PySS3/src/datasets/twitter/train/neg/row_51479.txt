Iâ€™m losing myselfI canâ€™t fucking handle anything. 

I want to throw myself into a wood chipper and regret it after.

I just beat the piss out of my thighs with my hands, theyâ€™ll bruise and itâ€™ll hurt to walk again. I scratched the hell out of my scalp and face. I fucked up my hair. I silently screamed and screeched Godâ€™s name at Him.  I am so pent up I can hardly act.

I canâ€™t say this to anyone because thatâ€™s fucking dramatic. I feel like a lunatic for doing all this and being stuck in my head imagining getting ripped apart and hurting myself over fucking school work that I procrastinated on and itâ€™s all fucking due tomorrow and itâ€™s the end of the term. I want to eat a shotgun shell and paint my wall red with brain. 

All of this while on the phone silently with my girlfriend and I couldnâ€™t bring myself to say a thing despite my raving. All this happened after she hung up to eat dinner and I had been silently stewing for a half hour, even though I had help a few words away. 

I want to beat my legs and grind and crunch them up in a hydraulic press. I want to rip my hair out until my scalp is in pieces. Iâ€™m losing my goddamned mind.

I saw a sticker on a teacherâ€™s door that said â€œGod gave you life because he thought youâ€™d enjoy it.â€

He shouldâ€™ve thought twice. 

End this. End me.
