My host has DID, I'm an alter and my name is Quinn. My host wants to commit suicide.This is 100% serious. My host has been through so much trauma in his life, he just wants to feel better. He thinks overdosing will make him feel better. He wants to take five, ten, fifteen ibuprofen. Not enough to kill him (probably?), but he thinks the act of overdosing even a small amount will make everything bearable. I'm not sure what to do. I can't just keep him from fronting because that's mean and I would be denying him freedom, but I am worried about him. I am his only alter. I don't know what to do to keep him safe. He wants to kill himself but doesn't want to hurt his brothers, so he wants to do this instead.
