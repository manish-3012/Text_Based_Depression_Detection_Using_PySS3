USMLE STEP ONE board exam coming up feeling suicidalLife has left me no choices. Went through medical school with depression. Just finished my second year in a U.S. medical school and now I have to take my first boards licensing exam by June 23rd. I passed my first two years with averages between 85% and 90% but there is such an infinite amount of information that this exam expects us to know all at one time. The irony is that close to half of it is irrelevant when it comes to being a good physician. I keep forgetting everything that I studied and can't keep anything straight in my head. Everyone else in my class seems so well prepared for this thing. This is the most important test in any doctor's career since it can make or break it. You can't just barely pass this exam and expect to get a residency. You have to do significantly above average in order to get programs to look at your application. If you fail no one will give you a residency and your 8 years of suffering in pre-med and medical school go to waste. I don't see anyway out of this trap. I'm already 25, I can't start life over again. My bachelor's degree was in biology so that's useless in terms of finding a job.
