I got accepted to universityI was planning on killing myself cause I don't think I'd get anywhere in life. So I thought if I got into uni then I'd have some reason and will to keep going but nothing has changed, and my parents keep saying how proud they are but I want to be dead in the next couple months I've kept putting it off cause I didn't want to interfere with other people's lives, I don't want to break my parents hearts but I just don't want to be alive any more.
