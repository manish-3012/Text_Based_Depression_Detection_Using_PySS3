My life is crumblingI just want to die. I'm gay. My family hates me. My girlfriend broke up with me and we live together - at least for another 9 months until the lease is over. I got no friends to talk to. I can't go home to my home country cause of this whole virus thing going on and I got laid off from my job. Everything does not makes sense anymore in my life. I just want all the pain and emptiness to end.
