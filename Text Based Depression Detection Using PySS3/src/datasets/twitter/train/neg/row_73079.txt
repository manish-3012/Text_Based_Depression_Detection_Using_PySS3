please give me a reason to stay alive.I dont see the point in being alive anymore. The world is a absolute shit place and its not gonna get better. it never has, and it never will. in world news and through my personal life, everything keeps getting worse and worse every year.  when i was in college before covid, i really thought i was getting happy. turns out, i was just distracted from my thoughts. now, im seriously at rock bottom, the worst i have ever felt in my life. a few nights ago i realized that if my 12 year old self met me, he would be absolutely disappointed in the person i grew up to be. i sobbed for hours after realizing that. all in all, i feel empty, like a fucking zombie. im just going through the motions every day, not really living at all. 

ive been suicidal for a while, but this is the first time ive ever gotten this close to doing it. its not that i want to kill myself, i really wish i could see hope or a future, but i just cant. but if life is pointless and meaningless and nothing will get better for me and for the greater world, why am i even here? why shouldn't i just kill myself?
