Iâ€™m so tired of this. Itâ€™s morning and I want this shit to end.Iâ€™m tired of waking up stressed and broken. I started a therapy, I was there once, and my next appointment is 13th of March and I just handle this shit. I donâ€™t believe it will help me. I donâ€™t believe anything will. Iâ€™m at work, and Iâ€™m ready to explode, Iâ€™m sad Iâ€™m mad. I donâ€™t want anyone to talk to me. I just want to leave. I guess Iâ€™m just venting here, but itâ€™s better than listening to people here, I donâ€™t feel good. I want to leave this shit.
