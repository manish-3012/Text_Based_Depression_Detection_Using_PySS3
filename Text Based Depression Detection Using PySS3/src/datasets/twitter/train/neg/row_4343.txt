Thinking of ways to do itI always would stop and think " oh what about my potential?" whenever I'd think about doing it. Well the potential is definitely dwindling. As it does for everyone, I suppose, the older they get. 

Getting to be that time, I feel. Not a fan of this life. I'd want a decent looking corpse left behind for my family. Especially my mother. Figured hanging would be the best way to go. I know it'd be devastating on my mother. It'd pretty much ruin the rest of her life. Maybe that's an overreach. 

Idk. Something about being in another plane of existence or darkness seems exciting. Certainly better than here. But you all know what that's like.
