Iâ€™m afraid I will kill myself if my mom diesMy mom is my best friend and sheâ€™s going through cancer right now. I spend every moment with her. Iâ€™ve been dealing with depression for over 10 years. In November I had a close call where I almost killed myself. I think about doing it still. If my mom dies I just donâ€™t think I will be able to hang on. I donâ€™t know what to do.
