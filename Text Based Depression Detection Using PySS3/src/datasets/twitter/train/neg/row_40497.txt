I'm turning 24 Next month unfortunatelyIts maybe my finals words.. Why? Because life its too hard for me. I'm an adult, And I never really worked more than 3 months. I dont got any diploma, I can't stand people because I see how happy they are And Its making me jealous. I got no one.. I live with some roommates Who I dont even know. My familly Never really liked me because I didn't finish school and I had trouble with the law. I went to the emergency too many time in life to try to get help.. They give me Pills.. Buts Its not working because there is no one to support me, So I just give up like I always do. Its been soooo long since Someone just said that they loved me. But At the same time Im scared to die, Because What If After I die.. I start a new life and I fail again?


Anyway Thanks to the people who took their time to read me.

I just want to say Even If I Dont know you.. Im sure you're a great person who deserve to be Loved.
