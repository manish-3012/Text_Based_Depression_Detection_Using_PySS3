So sick of talkingIt's hopeless. There's no way out. I've told my story countless times now, it didn't matter if I talked about it online here or with people in the real world. At the end of it, people pretty much agree that my my life is screwed even if they didn't say that explicitly. In the end it's always "well that's how it is". I'm tired. There's no way to solve this. I really am screwed. I want this to end.
