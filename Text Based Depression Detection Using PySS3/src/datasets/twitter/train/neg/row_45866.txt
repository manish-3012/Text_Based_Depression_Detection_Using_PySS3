I want it all to be overI feel like I'm trapped in a glass cage,chained up by guilt,loneliness, sorrow and self hatred. No matter how hard I try to escape I'm trapped. Its my fault my families in this situation. It's my fault I'm alone.I want it all to end.I want this never ending horror movie to end!!
And the thing is I know they all blame me but I don't blame them.if I wasn't such a chav and had a crush on someone I wouldn't be in this situation.


I just want to die.
