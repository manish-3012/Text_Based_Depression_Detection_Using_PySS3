Not even distraught, just tired. Giving myself until my birthday.I'm calm. I'm rational. I'm not overreacting. 

I'm just fucking tired. Just overwhelmed. Just ok with not having to deal with the stress. 

My birthday is in about 6 months, then I'm just going to do it quickly and get it over with. 

It'll be nice not having to deal with the stress anymore, at the very least.
