I don't want to be aloneI'm sick and tired of being alone. I'm fed up with being used and abused by others, and that either people want to change me, want me to change, or simply just treat me as a tool... and these people are my "friends", my "family". And I didn't even talk about all those people who don't even treat me like a human being. All I wanted in this life is to be able to love someone, who doesn't kick me. But I guess it's my fault for being born this way. And I really want to die, because at this point I'm pretty sure I shouldn't ever dream about a relationship or even friends to begin with. And don't tell me "this'll get better soon", because it won't be. It was the same in my entire life.

And whenever I try to meet someone and think things will change, they either won't or I'm getting used once again. Because if it is this hard to find decent people, I'd rather than just die. It'd still be better than living my entire life all alone.
