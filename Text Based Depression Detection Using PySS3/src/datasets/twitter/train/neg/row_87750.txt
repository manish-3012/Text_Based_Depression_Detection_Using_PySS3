Please HelpI have been having these thoughts for so long, I'm on medication but it hasn't helped at all. as soon as i think i find someone that understands and wants to help they leave, i think i get to much for people, or they leave cause i wont give them sex. i thought i was getting better, i could see hope, but now its all gone and i don't know what to do anymore. friends have gone, i don't want to hurt my family by telling them this. i just don't want to deal with all of this any more, its just becoming to much.
