Am i spiraling? Idk but it feels out of controlI havenâ€™t slept in two days and this morning I just did a massive cleanup of my entire room. About eight garbage bags full of useless stuff. It feels like a symptom, but Iâ€™m trying not to overthink it. I really hope Iâ€™m able to fall asleep tonight.
