If my anxiety doesnâ€™t get better soon Iâ€™m gonna do itIâ€™ve been on anti-anxiety meds for over a year now. Itâ€™s always been a low dose, but itâ€™s still a long time. My anxiety is only getting worse though and now Iâ€™m abusing my medication, having panic attacks nearly every day. Iâ€™m gonna talk to my psychiatrist and go to a doctor and try and figure it out. But if I canâ€™t get this under control I donâ€™t know how long I can go on. Itâ€™s truly unbearable. Feeling like youâ€™re constantly gonna die. I didnâ€™t mind the mental anguish of anxiety for years but since itâ€™s become physical itâ€™s just the worst.
