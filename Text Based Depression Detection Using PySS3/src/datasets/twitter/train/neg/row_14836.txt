I feel so aloneI canâ€™t deal with feeling this lonely anymore, and this heartbroken. Really, my life is pathetic. I spend my time working, shopping and eating. I am always alone. When I ask people for help, Iâ€™m always alone. Iâ€™m always left out of things. Even my own family isolated me. 

I couldnâ€™t help someone at work today and itâ€™s killing me inside. I hope I can help them on Monday. Iâ€™ll be praying for them.
