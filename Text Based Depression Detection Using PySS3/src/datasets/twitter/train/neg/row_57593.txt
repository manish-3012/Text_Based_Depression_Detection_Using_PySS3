I don't think I'll make it through today.I can't do this.

I've had depression and anxiety for 20 years (since I was 8) and I thought I had it under control. Decent meds, a few runs in therapy, and good job. 

But something has come up. My dog's health has declined drastically and we made the choice to put him down to spare him further pain. The appointment is in 9 hours. I logically know it's the right thing to do because he can't control his bladder, and his back legs barely support him. But I just can't help but feel like I'm failing him. I don't know how to get through this.

I haven't slept. I haven't eaten. I can't go 5 minutes without crying so hard I hyperventilate and can't breathe. I've had three panic attacks about it in the past twelve hours. I can't stand the idea of a life without him. My heart is fucking broken.

My problem is that whenever something big happens, I spiral into depression hard and fast. My brain jumps to thinking about suicide immediately because hey, if I'm dead I won't have to deal with it. 

So that's where I'm at right now. I have no specific plans for offing myself but I can't imagine living after today. I just want to stop existing so I don't have to face the pain. I've had more than my fair share of it in my life. I can't take any more. I just can't do this. It hurts too much.
