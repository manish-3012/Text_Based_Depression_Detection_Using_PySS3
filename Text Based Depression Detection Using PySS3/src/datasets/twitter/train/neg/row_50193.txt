I canâ€™t anymoreI canâ€™t even make a post online without someone attacking me, reminding me I donâ€™t belong. Well thatâ€™s how people are online, right? The real world isnâ€™t much better. 

Itâ€™s a stupid belief but shouldnâ€™t everyone whoâ€™s born have a purpose? Why the fuck am I here? Do we even have free will? TF am I rambling about? Why am I here if Iâ€™m just suffering? 

I try to make it better, I take my meds, try new things all the fucking time. Listen to upbeat music. Wear makeup and shit. Thereâ€™s just one thing missing. Iâ€™m not autistic, not schizoid, why the fuck canâ€™t I talk to people. 

I keep thinking and my mind always comes back to suicide, I think itâ€™s unavoidable. Damn why am I always suicidal around Christmas time. I feel like I have to do it soon or Iâ€™m just a fucking liar
