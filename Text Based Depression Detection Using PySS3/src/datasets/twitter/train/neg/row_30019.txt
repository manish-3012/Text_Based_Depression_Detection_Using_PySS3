Third time is the charm ?I have tried overdosing a few times. Right now I have enough of a specific medication and enough alcohol to overdose with it. I know it will be painful but I'm tired of this world and this life.  I'm positive I can do it correctly this time. 

I've suffered from Depression since I was a child. I was abused in multiple ways until I was 20. 

I got a degree (I live in the US). I have so much debt and can't even find a job with it. 

My relationships are shit.

I don't contribute to the world. I just take from it. 

No one would really care to know. So I'm telling you since I've been following this sub. Maybe you remember me from my first two attempts. Maybe not. 

I've been to therapy. I've tried medications. 

Nothing gets rid of my constant panic. 

I could leave a note or something. But I think everyone who knows me would know why. 

I feel more of a connection to you. 

After almost three decades of constant pain, sickness, and abuse, I am done. 

I will try again tomorrow.
