just want someone to talk to...i'm having a terrible day today and it's only 10:30 in the morning. i have been called ugly, a racist, an attention whore, and rude by different people all today. i'm just sitting crying in class because i can't stop thinking of suicide. i just need someone to talk to right now. i don't have any friends or family i could talk to
