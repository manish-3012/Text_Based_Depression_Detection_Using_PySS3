Giving up with lifeI've had enough with life. I had a few months where life actually seemed beautiful. No one gives a fuck, no one believes anything I say. I'm not strong enough to sit with something like this on my conscience. It's been eating away at me the past month and I can't do this any more. I've got myself into a state, I wish I didn't have a conscience. Cutting up my arms/legs only does so much to mute the pain. I fuck everything up. I'm sorry to everyone whose had the misfortune to meet me. There is no point going on as I can't forgive myself. This feels like the only way out for me.
