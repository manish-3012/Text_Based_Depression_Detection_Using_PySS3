Do you ever had this?When you have a problem that is really troubling you, and then you get another problem that is bigger (in your head at least) and wish you would get your old problem back and think that wasn't a real problem? So it only can get worse and worse and worse... And as soon as one of them is  "solved" the other one that was small gets big again. 
I know it's complicated but I hope some of you  know what I mean.
Also: Do you ever read a post here and think why can't I have these problems this person got? Because they seem more bearable for you
