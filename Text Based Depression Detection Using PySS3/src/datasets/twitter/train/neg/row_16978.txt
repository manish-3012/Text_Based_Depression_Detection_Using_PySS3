I don't know how to feelA while back I was being abused online. I got fed up to the point where I started annoying people, knowing that no one would take me seriously. Eventually, I went straight to the source of the abuse (not the person abusing, just giving abusers an outlet), and I told him to get out of my life. This person took that as a threat and threatened to call the authorities (no one came and I never got alerted, I honestly think this person was lying). Even though it might have been a lie, the guilt I felt was so immense that I still have thoughts of ending my life even after talking to someone. They aren't frequent but they are still there.
