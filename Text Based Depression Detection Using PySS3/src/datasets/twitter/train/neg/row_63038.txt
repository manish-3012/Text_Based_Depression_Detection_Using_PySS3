I am going to be homlessI just checked my credit. 550. The only thing I have against me is about $2k in medical bills. Even though I pay my cell phone bill on time, and my electric (at my mom's house), it doesn't show that I am making payments. The only payment showing up on there is the small loan of $2k I've been paying on time every month, but that isn't helping.

Once my mom eventually dies (which may be soon cause she's 74), I will be homeless. No one will rent to me. My life is over.
