I can't think of a title. I just want to kill myself$I suffer from several closely-related mental disorders; them being major depression, social anxiety, depersonalization &amp; panic disorder. Also, I think I may have PTSD, seeing as how I often find myself, in a panic-induced state, reliving traumatic memories of my childhood(including, but not limited to, constant rejection &amp; several instances of physical &amp; sexual abuse). I was 11 when I thought about suicide for the first time, and almost 10 years later I haven't stopped. Over the course of four years I've taken numerous medications &amp; gone through counseling/therapy, to no avail. I recently stopped seeking treatment &amp; had plans on killing myself on January 2015 (approx. two years after my last attempt). I'm miserable &amp; in so much pain; I just don't know what else to do.
