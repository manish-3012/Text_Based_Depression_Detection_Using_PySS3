i don't know what to do anymorei don't know of this belongs here. I don't think i actually want my life to end. I just don't know what to do.
yesterday I was filling out my application for my second stint in inpatient dbt therapy for my borderline personality disorder and one of the questions on there was if you ever attempted suicide and if yes when was the last time. I pressed no because I never actually did it, i always stopped right before (like i stood by the street, I saved up pills but i never went through with it). I feel like I need to attempt to validate my pain. I don't want to die, I just want the suicide attempt under my belt but I also don't want to do it for attention which I know it would be.
I'm home for Christmas right now, my dad triggers my eating disorder with his own eating habits, my mom makes me feel guilty for how much pain ive caused them, my brother feels like a stranger to me, I have to go to the church that made me hate who i love, my girlfriend is in psych right now and our relationship is a little rocky and i feel terribly, terribly alone. I have friends who are also in our hometown for Christmas and they make me feel better but I feel so alone. 
I want to go back to my chosen home but I feel alone there too. I have friends dont get me wrong but I feel so alone even in midst of people who care for me. I'm on a 5 months waiting list for therapy and I only see my mental health worker once a month and its never enough time.
I want to try to commit suicide but I don't think I want to die and I don't know what that means for me.
