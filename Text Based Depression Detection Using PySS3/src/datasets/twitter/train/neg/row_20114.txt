TodayI told myself to do it before the day is over. Right this second would be the perfect time, and yet I find myself typing this. Do I see hope in my future? No.

Why do I remain in this hellish existence if there's no hope? Because I'm scared of what's next.

Perhaps we atheists are right, and there's nothing that comes next. Or maybe others were right, and suicide is something that buys you a one-way ticket into an eternity of pain and suffering. Or maybe no one was right, and there is something unimaginably great on the other side. Perhaps another world, far kinder than this one.

Whatever the case, the sweet release that is death terrifies me. I should be dying right now, but instead, I'm here.
