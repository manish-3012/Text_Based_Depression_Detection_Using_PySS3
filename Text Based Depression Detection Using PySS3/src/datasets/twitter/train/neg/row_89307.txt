Help meI just need somebody to talk to me. I'm at an all time low right now, I make about 15 cuts everyday, and all I can think of is how good of an option suicide is sounding right now. I have two friends who know everything, but they always seem to get annoyed whenever I bring anything up in a conversation so they don't exactly help much. I'm probably not going to even get any responses from this, but like I said, I'm at an all time low so this is worth a shot.

Edit: I counted how many cuts I actually made in my last session, and it's actually 25, not 15.
