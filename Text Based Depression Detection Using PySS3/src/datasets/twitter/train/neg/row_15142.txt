Will soon be on my own with very little emotional stability.Hi all.
I am 25 years old.  No degree, no job, live with parents, minimal independence.

I am pathetic.  I let things get this bad and I constantly go back in my head trying to figure out how I got here.
I was diagnosed bipolar and have been trying to work through my problems for a long time through various forms of therapy and medication.
However, I didn't do everything that I could possibly do and now things have just gone on for far too long.  My parents are at the end of their rope and I've completely ruined all of my social relationships.

My parents are in a very bad place financially and I've been looking for work.  I've been telling them that I want to find a place of my own to ease their burden but they say they worry about me.
I know it will be hard because I've never had to do anything for myself and completely fail at being a person, but it's the only solution I see to make sure that I don't burden anyone with my mental issues.

I don't have much money to my name and my parents are offering to pay rent but I feel like that could lead to more issues.

The greatest solution that I can come up with is killing myself since that would solve absolutely every single problem.  My parents would be hurting for a while but they have another son that is much more together than I am so they will be able to completely focus on him.  I won't have to suffer anymore this way and I won't be able to become a burden for anyone else.

I want to believe there is a way for me to be happy without making life hard for other people but the idea of suicide is so enticing...
