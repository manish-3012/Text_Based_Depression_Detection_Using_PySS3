I shouldn't go onThe longer I live the more I know what I terrible person I am. 
I can't seem to stop hurting people I care about. Just being around them is enough to have them spiral out of control.
I don't want to go home after work. I just want to die.
I know it will be better for everyone.  So afterwork I'm going to find a place I can end this joke of a life.
