Depressed Not on PurposeJust sad most days,  I care up to a point. I try but it really has minimal effects on anything. I will myself to keep trying for a job. I have a college degree and a wife and daughter. I'm relatively healthy. My needs are met up to a point. But I just want to quit. I wont obviously but I just crave rest. To have things stop being so damn hard every moment of everyday. I wish things were different. Wishing doesnt solve it but that's the truth.
