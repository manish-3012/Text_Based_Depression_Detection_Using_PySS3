I need helpSo this is concerning my suicide and depression. Iâ€™ve been suicidal and depressed for a long time now, about four years or since I was 9. At first I was just sad more frequently and then it evolved into a serious depression and then self harm and that snowballed into suicidal thoughts. No attempts yet but I also walk the line on that topic. I always feel like Iâ€™m a burden on society and that putting myself down and self harming is a way to repay people who are kind to me because I cannot repay them in other ways. I hate the fact that I think this way but I cannot change it. My parents try and help but I canâ€™t describe how it feels. Itâ€™s so hard and I feel I cannot cry because everyone would ask why and I am not worth their time. My friend who has helped me a lot with this issue told me to post something about this here. I feel like this wonâ€™t be able to fully communicate my feelings though because words canâ€™t always describe emotion. My parents and teachers and other people in my life expect so much of me because for a lot of my younger life, I was athletic and smart and had many friends but now, Iâ€™m so depressed all the time, my grades have gone down, Iâ€™m out of shape, and I only have a few close friends. I always feel like since I canâ€™t get up to expectations that Iâ€™m a worse person than anyone else and that I canâ€™t ask for help since I am just worse than everyone. Iâ€™m trying to change my mindset but itâ€™s so so so hard for me to do this. Please, I need help but I have no idea what to do. Iâ€™m sorry for taking up your time. Good luck and goof lives to you all.
