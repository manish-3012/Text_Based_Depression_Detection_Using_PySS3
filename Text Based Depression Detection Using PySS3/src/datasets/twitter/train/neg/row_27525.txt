For the first time in 10 years, I no longer feel suicidalI come from an extremely abusive family. My biological dad was abusive and so is my stepdad. He has hurt my family so many times including my little siblings. Anytime he start something I always get into it so that he can direct his violence at me so I can protect my mother and siblings. It has led to me being kicked out of the house when I cracked a rib. He made a deal that I would leave the house or he will press charges. And since I couldnâ€™t protect my family from jail I took the deal. It was in self-defense but my family is so terrified of him they would have spoken out against me. I just found out thatMy mother has been filing divorce and restraining orders behind his back and the other day with the county sheriff serve them to him and got him kicked out of the house. Iâ€™ve never felt a sigh relief like I did the other day.  Iâ€™ve always contemplated suicide because I want to escape my problems, but I didnâ€™t want to do it because I didnâ€™t wanna leave my family alone to deal with him. This led to me over eating and developing a large weight problem. After I found all this out for the first time itâ€™s like I instantly did not crave anything sweet. I even went exercising today and I just felt like a huge grind stone has been lifted off my shoulders. This is kind of my way of saying I donâ€™t think I need to be on suicide watch anymore. Iâ€™m just so happy I canâ€™t describe this feeling, I just didnâ€™t think it was possible for me to feel this way. To anyone going through the same situation. My heart goes out to you, Iâ€™m not gonna lie and say it gets better.  The only thought that got me through was that I canâ€™t do anything to help if Iâ€™m not here.
