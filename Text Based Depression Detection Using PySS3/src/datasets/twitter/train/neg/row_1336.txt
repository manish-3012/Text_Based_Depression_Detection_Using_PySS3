I'm ready to end my life today when I get home from school.I've been very goal oriented for a while now. I've always aimed for perfection. I can't reach it, I can't reach my goals and I will never even get close. I've always striven for perfect grades and it is so overwhelming. What is the point? So I can work my ass off and stress so I can get into college so I can work my ass off and stress so I can get a god job to work my ass off and stress, then die? If that is the way it's going to be, I'd rather reach the end now than later. 
I've lost interest in nearly everything. I've pushed away my friends. I've got nothing left to do besides finish this school day. 
I have exhausted my options and I think this is the last thing left to do. 

I've done everything on my bucketlist and I was secretly hoping that it would make me see all the fun things I'll miss. But I just feel worst. 

What bothers me the most is how many people my death will effect. I'm not a popular person, but I know my friends will blame themselves and my family will split and I am going to let so many people down and I am sorry
