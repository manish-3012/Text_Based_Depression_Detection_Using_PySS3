Everyone is Abandoning MeEarlier this week, my friend H said that because of his paranoid anxiety disorder, he couldnâ€™t handle talking to me anymore so he blocked me on all social media. This sent me into a depressive spiral I havenâ€™t gotten out of and I cut myself for the first time in years. I confided in some of my other friends about how I was feeling.

This morning, my friend C sent me a message saying that my constant messages and confiding in him make him uncomfortable and he also blocked me.

I already have paranoia about everyone abandoning me once they realize how toxic I am, and this only makes it worse. Everyone I interact with I hurt, so it would be better for me to die before I hurt anyone else or they abandon me.
