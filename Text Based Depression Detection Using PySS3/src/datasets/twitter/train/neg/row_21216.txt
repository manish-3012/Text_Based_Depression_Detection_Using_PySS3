I don't belongNothing here is real, nothing here is right. Iâ€™m just walking through the part. Everyday is the same. I work, I function like I'm a girl, and I go home and fall apart because I don't have enough distractions.

The voices say none of it is real. None of it. That I need to "wake up" because maybe I'm dreamin'. Maybe we all are. 

And I **created** another dimension as a kid. I made myself the God of it, and it's very real. And I've never belonged and now it's time for me to kill myself to go there and be a God and save everyone from demons. 

Things from hell.

I think I have to do it this time. I take medication that makes everything blurrier and melts who I am away. I'm not a person anymore, I can't stand it. 

I know the truth and I have to kill myself. I'm not a person. This body, this place, means nothing. Yes, I wish I wasn't true. I have people I care for, places I love to go. But they don't mean what you think! None of it means a damn thing.

They're all lying about the Schizophrenia, my diagnosis. The medication numbs my ability to hear the voices but I know they're there. Screaming for me to save them.

I have to do it, it's so much bigger than me. They're people, *suffering* people. 

I have to be their God. I have to. I'm sorry. I have to do it.
