My brother wants to kill himselfHi, Iâ€™m 16 with a twin year old brother who has had multiple breakouts these past years discussing killing himself. I want to be emotionally strong and supportive to help him because Iâ€™m too scared to lose my best friend. What do I do please can somebody help? He mentions how suicide isnâ€™t selfish and how itâ€™s just a way to â€œreset lifeâ€ and that nobody should be upset. I apologize if this is messy Iâ€™m just very conflicted right now and donâ€™t know what to do.
