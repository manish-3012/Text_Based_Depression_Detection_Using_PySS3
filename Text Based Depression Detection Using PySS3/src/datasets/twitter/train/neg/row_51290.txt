i feel so invisiblewhy does it feel like iâ€™m not even here? when iâ€™m around people, why does it seem like they donâ€™t even see me? acknowledge me? 
i feel so invisible to everyone around me, my family included. some days i donâ€™t even like being around my family because of how they make me feel. i was depressed since i was young (iâ€™m 20 now). and every time iâ€™m around them, they say â€œwhy donâ€™t you ever smileâ€ â€œfck youre never happyâ€ â€œyouâ€™re ungratefulâ€ â€œyouâ€™re never satisfiedâ€ and they make jokes like â€œoh sheâ€™s just depressedâ€ â€œsheâ€™s just going to go cryâ€ when iâ€™m having a really bad day. i never have anyone to talk too, i literally have no friends that i can talk too. iâ€™m just happy at the end of the day i have reddit and atleast then my mind will be occupied with all the crazy stories and memes of reddit
