Just need to hear something to helpHonestly just tell me something loving or positive please. Ive made so many impulsive bad decisions that I completely hate myself. I work in healthcare and Im off for a week max with a back injury. Im viewed as a coward in my own department while healthcare workers are heroes right now. I hate myself. I want to drive into a wall and stop thinking. Just the idea of suicide is therapy for me. I cant get any compassion from anyone. Nobody knows Ive struggled with depression and anxiety most of my life. Therapy sucked. Please just tell me Im loved. Its pathetic but it's all I need desperately.
