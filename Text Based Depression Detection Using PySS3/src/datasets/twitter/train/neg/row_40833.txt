I'm not even sure if I want to die, I just feel like such a profound failure and burden to the worldJust found out another old friend blocked me on social media. I literally have no friends anymore. A while ago I was dreaming about going to university but now - what's the point? 

I can't concentrate on anything. I can't see myself studying, working, doing anything useful in life. I'm completely useless, not contributing to anything in society. And when I say that I mean it. I'm a week away from my finals - still haven't studied. No chance of passing or going to uni. Can't get a job. Can't lose weight, can't make friends, can't even stop yelling at my family about useless shit and being a burden. No matter what all the people around me have ended up hurt somehow, to the point that they've had to cut me out of their lives. I don't want to keep hurting people. 

I can't help but think: if someone's so profoundly useless, with no potential whatsoever of becoming a functional part of society, why should they keep living? The only thing that keeps me from attempting is pure fear. I fear death immensely, I would probably never seriously attempt anything. But I do think about it, a lot.
