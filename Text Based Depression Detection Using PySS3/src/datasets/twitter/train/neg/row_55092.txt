A complicated relationship with my motherIâ€™m extremely depressed and suicidal. But sheâ€™ll never truly understand. And sheâ€™s so fucking rude I wanna die. 

Â«You donâ€™t have it that badÂ»
Â«Pull yourself togetherÂ»
Â«Iâ€™m sick if your shit, this whole family is. Youâ€™re like a poison spreading through our veins.Â»
Â«Youâ€™ve been depressed for years, we get it, we know. You need to pull yourself together.Â» 
Â«Iâ€™m happy whenever youâ€™re not here.Â»
Â«Youâ€™re the reason I eatÂ»
Â«If this were a relationship, I would break up with you and never talk to you or see you again.Â»
Â«Jesus christ, youâ€™re such a spoiled brat, youâ€™re sitting there looking like you want to die. Iâ€™m so done.Â» 

I know that even if I end up killing myself sheâ€™ll think I was overreacting, that I shouldâ€™ve just pulled myself together. I am. Constantly. Every single second. I want to destroy everything I own, everything I once loved. I want to scream and cry, I want to kill myself. But I donâ€™t. I pull myself together and instead all of those emotions come out as frustration/sadness.  

Iâ€™ve explained this to her a million times, and she still tells me thereâ€™s something seriously wrong with me, that I should appreciate what I have and pull myself together. I donâ€™t know how to cope with the fact that sheâ€™ll never understand.
