A message to anyone, that is thinking about putting an end to everythingThis won't be another post with content like - I'm sure somebody loves you, I'm sure that you're important to somebody. No, fuck that - I'll say why YOU are important to me. 

I'm only 20 years old, but I truly and deeply understand the desire to just end it. I've been growing up in a really shitty situation, caused by money problems. Ultimately, they've led to alcohol problems. During these times I've been thinking about ending myself more than once, heck, I've had periods where I thought about it multiple times a day. 
I don't want to talk about how I've managed to get trough it - I'm sure most of us is an expert I hiding emotions. 
But what I do want to talk about, is a person, that might be the most important in your road to get out of this shithole called depression. That person is someone who can hear you, who can just listen to your rage. I know, that a lot of people that browse this sub, don't have a person like this - maybe there too scared, maybe they feel like they can't trust someone they know, there are a lot of reasons. 
I'm writing this post for anyone that is in a situation like this. If you feel like you just need to vent to somebody, please, contact me. We don't know each other yet, but you're already important to me.
