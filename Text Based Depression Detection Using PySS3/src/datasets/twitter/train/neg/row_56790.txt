Im at my endI've idealized suicide since I was 14. Im 22 now. Covid put me out of work shortly after getting my first apartment by myself. It ruined my career. My job has opened up but its not even half as good as before. Im dealing with starting probation and fines. I dont have money to pay for food, or rent, or any bills, nor any fines. I haven't been able to get hired at any other places. My anxiety and depression has gotten so bad, that all I want to do is lay in bed and sleep. I dont care anymore. My family is very invalidating of how I feel. Constantly denying that I could feel this way. Or completely ignoring when I say how I feel. Or just ignoring me when I cry. I dont blame them anymore, im a burden to them. I've pushed all friends away. I didn't mean to, and I'm not mad at them, I did that to make this easier. My last option was running and trying to start somewhere new, but I would never be able to come back. I dont know if I even care for that anymore. I've tried cutting, all my knifes are so dull, im afraid to really get the job done it would take time and hurt too much, and im thinking hanging myself is the way to go. I dont know anymore.
