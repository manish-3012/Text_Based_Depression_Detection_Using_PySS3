I think I might kill myself tomorrowI'm sick and tired of being controlled all the time by my dad and his girlfriend. 

They track my phone, go through my stuff and won't let me go out after school with friends.

They pick on me, put me down and make every little thing an inconvenience for me.

They've taught me that the reason I have no friends is that I'm annoying and clingy.

There is no emotional support. If I try to tell them about my suicidal feelings they will tell me that Im going to hell. My dad even threatened to kill my dog if I ever killed myself. I'm really scared that he's actually going to hurt my dog. 
I'm not sure what to do. I'm planning on deleting this account and overdosing on Tylenol and whiskey tonight or tomorrow. I want to give mikey (my dog) away so that he can be safe.

This is just a vent, I don't want any help
