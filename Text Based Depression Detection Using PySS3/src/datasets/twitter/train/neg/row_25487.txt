Keep trying and failing no hope leftI can't really go into things but basically my life is ruined. Everything I've ever worked for in my life (current phd student) is ruined. My family has been supportive of everything I've been going through but I can't take the pain anymore and to see what they're going through because of me. I tried partial suspension with a belt several times times and I always stop as soon as I'm close to blacking out, which makes me feel like a bigger failure. Why can't I just end it!?!
