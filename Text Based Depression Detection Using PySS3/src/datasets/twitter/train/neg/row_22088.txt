I can live like this but I donâ€™t want toI AM SO TIRED OF THIS. Iâ€™ve had depressive episodes since when I was 12, the last yearâ€™s being the worst one. I am 20. Iâ€™m naturally a very positive and strong person with big goals and visions for myself. But once depression hits I just canâ€™t help but be miserable. 

 I used to think depression is highly affected by the way we choose to see our problems and our surroundings. But this time it has proved me completely wrong. 

Iâ€™ve been really working on my mental wellbeing lately and Iâ€™m on the way to developing a very strong and resilient mindset. 
But yesterday I woke up completely anxious. Horrible anxiety the second i opened my eyes. I tried to control it and take my mind off of it but it was impossible. Literally impossible. It was so bad, because I was suppressing it, my eyes were involuntarily crying. I had never experienced such thing before. Anyway i made it to bedtime (without getting anything done really) hoping I will feel better tomorrow. 

So i wake up today still not feeling good and still trying not to let it take over. I held myself until evening when I completely broke down. To make the matters worse have an exam tomorrow and my brain is totally numb.

I donâ€™t wanna do this anymore. Today i was proved that no matter how much i try to save myself, I cant. It can pop out anytime it wants and it can easily destroy my entire life like this. I have no control over it and it makes me feel so powerless. 

Itâ€™s already contributed a lot in leaving me behind in many aspects of life. I canâ€™t go on like this. It is impossible and so hard to explain. Itâ€™s a curse.
