I want to dieI guess I'm writing this because I just want to get it off my chest or something, I honestly don't think anyone will be sympathetic to me or even believe me however; I want to die and its weird. I have a job, a goal to get somewhere in life, a girlfriend, a family who supports me and loves me, and I have a few friends. I have everything in life but day by day it hurts my soul to get out of bed and do normal stuff like getting ready for my job or doing the same shit everyday . I know my job doesn't give a shit about me the only like when I am working to the point I am losing my sanity. I think my family hates me cause I am at home rather than out doing something better with my life. I've gone to therapy. I take antidepressants to slow my descent into madness everytime I walk into work. I just don't know if I can go on anymore. I'm a18-year-old loser with everything yet feels like I got nothing. sorry for wasting your time for my stupid story.
