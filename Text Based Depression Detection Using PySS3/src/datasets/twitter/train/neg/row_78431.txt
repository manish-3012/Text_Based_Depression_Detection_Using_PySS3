Why is suicide such a big deal?The only reason I don't kill myself is because it would make others sad. However, I feel like my whole entire life has been me choosing others' happiness over mine. Why can't they just let me have this one thing? I'm reasonably intelligent, have a good job; there is really nothing wrong with my life. It just all seems so pointless, and I hate myself. Why is it someone else's choice instead of mine whether I live or die?
