My dog my lifelineIm on my phone proof rereading my suicide note. While writing it my dog on his leash gets tangled up in my legs. I chain him to the chair next to me. As I'm about to post it he takes off with the chair attacking another dog being walked. I grab the chair smack his ass and throw him inside. Sit back on my chair on the porch, throw my phone down on the table and start to silent scream cry in my hands.  The guy walking the dog circles back and starts yelling at me. Saying I can't believe you let your dog do that, my dog is old, ok ignore me way to be a bitch.  Keep in thought I just wrote my suicide note... I flip the chair back over that my dog drug, take a deep breath and walk up to the man shake his hand and say hi im (my name) I apologize my dog did that to your dog, I've been trying to fix him of it, it has only been me and him for 3 years. I'm sorry. Is your dog ok? He's up to date on shots. I'm sorry I'm going through something I'm so sorry I wasn't paying attention.
