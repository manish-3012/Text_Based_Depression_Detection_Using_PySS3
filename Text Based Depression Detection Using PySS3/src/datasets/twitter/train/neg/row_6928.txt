I've honestly got no idea what to do anymore.It feels as if everyone was fake, I feel like I'm backtalked and annoying. I can sometimes like hear my brain speaking to me ''hey.. heyy those people are fake dont talk to them''. So far the only thing that helps is music, but thats kinda stopping to work. I have 2 really fucking good friends and I don't deserve them. Nobody needs a suicidal fucktard who can't help you, who just pushes you away. What use am I to anyone? I barely do anything useful with my life. People say ''what about your loved ones?'' well if I've been fucking abused I don't really think that makes a difference except for my father whos actually fine, out of all my family he is the only one I'd feel about for having to suffer. I don't see a point in hanging on anymore. I'll never get better and I dont want to feel guilty by committing suicide. It is very hard for me to get help and I really don't see how I'm gonna get out of this. I feel like I'm just gonna off myself before I'm even 18. I don't want anyone to feel bad for me, I deserve all of this regardless
