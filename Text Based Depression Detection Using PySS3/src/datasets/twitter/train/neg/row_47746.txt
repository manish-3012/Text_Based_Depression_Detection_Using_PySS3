It never gets any betterThey all tell me it will get better. It hasnâ€™t. Life is mundane, and it feels like a complete joke. I stay up all night and sleep most of the day, and most of the time I canâ€™t fall asleep no matter how hard I try, so I just get blasted by smoking weed and drinking booze until I pass out. I feel disassociated with my own family. No one out there really cares, no matter how much they say they do. Theyâ€™d only care if I were gone..but while iâ€™m here everyone is fine seeing me dying inside. Iâ€™m not who I used to be, or who I ever imagined Iâ€™d be. I donâ€™t feel cut out for this fake, unnatural society we have created. Life is shit.
