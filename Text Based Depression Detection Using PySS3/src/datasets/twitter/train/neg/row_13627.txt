I'm not even depressed, I'm just not interestedI (f18) just don't enjoy living. Even with all the "fun" things to do, it all just seems so pointless. Bland. Dead. I'm not a pessimist and I'm really not trying to be edgy. I think it's great that other people like living and I encourage them to keep on their happy way. But, I don't. Every day is a struggle and a headache. Pretending that I want this shit when I really don't. Working to progress and move into the next stage of life when I didn't even want to make it to this one. I constantly hope that someone would just come into my room and kill me. Just end it for me bc I can't find a way to do it myself with guaranteed results (guns are mad expensive and I have $0). I honestly see no point in continuing to do something that I don't enjoy just because some people would be temporarily upset if I ended it. Life isn't for everyone, namely me.
