I need someone to talk to.  Please help.This is not a throw away account.  I don't even care at this point.  I've been contemplating suicide for a couple of weeks now.  I almost went through with it a few minutes ago.  I thought about what I would do, how it would feel...I wanted to, but something stopped me.  I'm in tears, I don't even really know why.  I don't want to go on about some sob story about my life.  I don't want pity.  I need a friend, someone who doesn't know me that can talk to me.  Someone that is willing to listen to my problems, maybe offer advice?  I don't know.  I want to be ok, but something inside me is dying, and wants to be dead.  Someone please help me.  PM if you could, I will give you my email or phone number.  I just need help.
