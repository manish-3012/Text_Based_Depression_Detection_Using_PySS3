When I drink I become 10X more suicidal...I don't drink often, mainly because I have no fucking money, but ever single god damn time I do drink, even I am with friends or having fun the thought of taking my pistol and stop being a fucking bitch to end it all and pull the damn trigger rushes through my head constantly. Part of me wishes I wouldn't have these thoughts, and then a bigger part of me thinks I get drunk so that I feel these thoughts.

Feel the pain that I would put my family through, feel the pain I would put my friends through, and it makes me want to fucking pull the trigger that much more.... yet I can't...
