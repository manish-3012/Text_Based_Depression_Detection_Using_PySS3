I am tiredI'm stuck in a bad marriage with a man that treats me like shit and is emotionally abusive, I'm unhappy and lonely. 

I feel like i have no family as they never make time for me, but always do for my brother.

I am always a second thought to all of my friends, and some even have ghosted me even though I'm mostly happy go lucky.

I'm stuck at home with two young kids everyday, haven't worked because I can't afford childcare and now it's going to take forever to get something that pays enough.

I'm tired of anxiety. I'm tired of all the constant problems popping up. I'm tired of feeling like shit. 

Tonight he told me that no one actually cares about me, only he does and if others do its because I'm not my true self with them. My husband said that to me. All started because I told him his game is much more important than I am these days.

If I didn't have my kids, I'd hang myself. Sick of being beat down by people, mental illness, and pure bad luck.
