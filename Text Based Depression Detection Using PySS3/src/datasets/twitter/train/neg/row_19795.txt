Almost 30 and nothing to show for itIm 30 in a couple of months and feel I have made a mess of my life.
I feel as though I'm stuck in groundhog day while everyones life os constantly changing and adapting. 
I have tried so much to get things on track.
My 20s just trying to sort through mental health. I wish I had done more travelling. 
The thing i have wanted most is a partner after 6 years of trying im exhausted and feel so much rejection and hurt rrom it all. Men just dont find me desirable anymore. 
Been having suicidal thoughts all week.
