I have a sickness inside me, and it's killing me.I'm a so called perfectionist. Failing is not an option. When I see my family, i see a wealthy, perfect family. They do everything perfect. I can't fail. Next month, on the 20th, i will have my driving exam. 4th time. I decided today that I will kill myself may i fail again. There is no place for failing. I already failed 3 times. I do not deserve to live if I fail again. But I was pretty stupid anyway, so it won't matter. There is no place for a person like me in this family. Nobody fails, and I can't fail again. I'm not even sad, it feels like the right thing to do. Suicide might be failure, but at least, it will be my last fail. I failed too much already. I got a beautiful wife, a good job, good income, but it isn't enough. If I fail this again this will be the end.
