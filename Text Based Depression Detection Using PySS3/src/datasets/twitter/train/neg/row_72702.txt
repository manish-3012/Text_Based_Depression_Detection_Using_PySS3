Want to either reverse time or kill myself.I can't stand seeing other's successes.  I've graduated high school, will possibly (ha) be going to college in the fall.  One of my very good friends just got a 35 on the ACT, and I just can't help but hate myself.  Why didn't I attempt the ACT?  Why hadn't I studied harder to get a decent score on the SAT?  Why didn't I try out for honor band when I was in middle school?  Why did I only do honor band in my final year of high school (and get fucking fourth chair out of five saxophones while my friend gets first chair flute out of about twenty other players)?

God I just want to die.  Why the fuck did I even do AP US History and AP English 11 if I was just going to get a fucking 1 on both AP tests and a C in both?  I'm wasting both oxygen and my parents money.  And I feel like I'm disappointing my dad by going to art school, but I can never tell because he's never said anything about.  I can't fucking do anything, seriously, what's the point of doing anything if I suck?  What's the point of being alive for that matter?
