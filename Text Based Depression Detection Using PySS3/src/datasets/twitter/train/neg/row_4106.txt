Nobody Cares to HelpI wanted to kill myself on my 25th birthday in August, but instead, I'll kill myself within the next few days. I can't take it anymore. Everybody rather talk about themselves than listen to me, rather ask for favors, and I'm Mr. Yes man, i do everything for everyone. I can't take it anymore. I'm a college grad with no job, my family is scared of me cause they feel anything will set me off, treat me like a dog. my friends, don't really care, everyone has their own problems. I'm tired of being a problem, I'm tired of being a burden, if i had a gun I would've been dead already, but I'm scared of failed attempts of drinking pills, i don't care anymore, i just want to die, i don't want to be here. i want to leave this earth the same way i came in, with nothing. thank you for listening..
