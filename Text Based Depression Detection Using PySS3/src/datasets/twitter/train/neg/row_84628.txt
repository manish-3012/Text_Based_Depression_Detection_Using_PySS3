I tried to hang myselfI tried to hang myself twice today but I couldnâ€™t do it, I was scared because I started to black out and my face started to hurt. I now have a bit of a headache and a small neck ache. I couldnâ€™t take it anymore, I feel numb and therapy isnâ€™t working for me. My parents are forcing me into their religion, and I tried telling them Iâ€™m atheist but it turned into a huge fight and... my mom almost hit me. I donâ€™t feel emotions as often and Iâ€™m just tired. Nothing anyone says works or helps. â€œPeople love youâ€ I know. I donâ€™t care. â€œThings will get betterâ€ Iâ€™ve been like this for 5 years, it wonâ€™t.
