It is time to goI am writing this here because I had to tell someone. I have everything I need and I will kill myself within the next few weeks.

I really tried to get help but there is no. I even checked myself in and was diagnosed for having heavy depressions and being suicidal. All they make me do there was weaving baskets, painting my feelings etc. There was some talking but they would only ask suggestive questions. 
The most degrading thing was when they showed my group pictures from a children's book and asking us suggestive questions about it. 

After 3 weeks I asked to leave because I couldn't stand being treated like a retard anymore. 

But now I understand and it was foolish of me to question the professionals. This was the only way to treat someone like me. Due to my condition I am a subhuman and have no value for society anymore. I have to accept this truth. 

Also I am a college dropout so even if I become healthy one day (but well I don't see how basked weaving will ever change my condition) there is no future for me. I am destined to be a burden for everyone.
