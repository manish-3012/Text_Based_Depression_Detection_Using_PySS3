Resources checkIf this isnâ€™t the right place for this, please tell me where I should put it! I donâ€™t want to take space from anyone!!!

What are the best resources to send people to? I shoot for free, international suicide help chats. But I havenâ€™t used the international one before. What are the most accessible and effective professional resources to send people to? 

Side note: I was taught not to ask why someone is suicidal. They are contemplating taking their own life, and therefore not thinking clearly. So my reasoning with them may be useful only for buying the time I need to get them professional help.

INSTEAD, I was taught to ask a variation of â€œthatâ€™s pretty serious stuff! ...have you thought about how youâ€™d do it?â€-this tells me whether or not they have a plan. A well developed plan means they are in more danger to themselves. THAT BEING SAID, ALL suicidal people should be taken seriously and given all the resources and help they need. 

If someone has a plan AND A TIME, I know they are taking their attempt forward within a specific time frame and therefore they require IMMEDIATE aid beyond what I can provide as a first responder. So, where should I send people when I feel out of depth?
