What is the point of trying?I'm sick and tired of living right now and am seriously thinking about suicide. I feel so alone. Honestly, the only people that would really care if I died, moved away last night. I've been cutting for a while now, and I seriously am tired of living in a world full of people who hate me. I really am. I can't think of anything to keep me from killing myself. I just want to die.
