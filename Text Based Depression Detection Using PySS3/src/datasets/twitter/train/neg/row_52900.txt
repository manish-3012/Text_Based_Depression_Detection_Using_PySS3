The wait is finally over.I'm just so tired. I can't be arsed to do even a throwaway account, like that would matter.

I had to wait over a month, due to some circumstances. People needed my help. Wanted me to be there for their birthday. Now I've suffered through all that and finally got home.

Tomorrow I will hang myself. Last night of sleep and then it's done. I feel, for once, finally, content. Goodbye.
