The thought of death at lastIt makes me smile. A final, rich, comforting and nourishing meal... a good cigarette... a long cuddle from my beloved... a final hug from my best friend... and dying... to my death theme. The Mercy Of The Living by Bear McCreary. And someone who has known all of my life, telling me about my first everything, holding me while I cry when I hear the bad parts, cuddling me while I hear the good parts, and embracing me when itâ€™s all finished and I say Iâ€™m ready to go. They embrace me, I fall asleep... and itâ€™s over. Itâ€™s finally over. Knowing my daughter will be okay... my beloved will find another that will take care of them, but not quite the same as me, but good enough.. my best friend crying over me, remembering me fondly and speaking well of me... this angel of mercy smiling as I sink into their world.







Maybe one day, I will die. Maybe one day, Iâ€™ll die in my sleep. I donâ€™t have the courage to end it myself, I wish I did. All I want to do is die peacefully in my sleep when I say out loud, â€œIâ€™m ready.â€ Iâ€™m trying to get into counseling and go on medication for the third time. I donâ€™t have a lot of hope and faith in it. Please help me?
