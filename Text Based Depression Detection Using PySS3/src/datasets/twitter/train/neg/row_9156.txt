tired...It's almost 3am where I live and once again I'm thinking about ways to kill myself. I haven't done much research on it but I'm thinking about taking a bunch of sleeping pills and then telling my bf to choke me to death while I'm sleeping. No idea if it would work but I'm sure he would help me do it. I just don't want it to be painful, everything is already painful enough.

I'm just really tired of this constant stress and problems. I'm going to be homeless in 2 months unless I find some ways to make quick money. I can't live on the street with 2 cats. I even thought about growing and selling weed, that's how desperate I am. Everything is slowly turning into shit and I can't find a way out. I have so many fucking debts and I'm not making enough money to pay it all. It would be easier if I was dead. I'm willing to give everything up. I don't hate life but this is not the life I want. Only struggle after struggle.

English is not my first language so I apologize if I'm not making any sense
