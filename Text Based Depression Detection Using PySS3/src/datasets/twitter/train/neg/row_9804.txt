I hurt her and it's all my faultMy girlfriend was doing great healing up from a previous back injury. We got into a very heated arguement. We argued and yelled all the way from her moms house till we got out of the col de sac. She kept saying things like I hope I die and I hope we crash and didn't put her seatbelts on until later. Then when she was fiddling with the a/c the windows fogged up and she exclaimed that they should just fog up the whole windshield... I snapped and slammed on the breaks. In that moment I ruined 3 months of progress on her back healing up.. she's in the worst pain of get life and it's my fault. I want to kill myself so she can collect my insurance and get back to healing up. She deserves better. She didn't have these issues until I came into her life. Everyone I meet ends up hating me.
