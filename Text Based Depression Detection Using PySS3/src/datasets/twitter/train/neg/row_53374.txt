Meh.Just turned in a bunch of assignments for school.  Several of them late. A lot of easy bullshit like sample resumes.  I don't know, it's all self reflection garbage. My life is nothing but mistakes. I hate it, I hate everything I've done. I hate myself. I just dream for the day I finally kill myself.
