â€œIâ€™m not superhuman enough.â€Does anyone else feel m guilty for things that are completely out of their control?

Take the current situation for example. I know itâ€™s a pandemic, and there are so many factors contributing to its immensity. But I feel I should have done something. Like I should have led a campaign to end wet markets in China, created a nonprofit, spoken to the UN. Like itâ€™s my fault for not doing that years ago to have prevented all of this.

I know, thatâ€™s 100% unrealistic. But itâ€™s how I feel, and I take on so much stress and responsibility for not being the worldâ€™s savior, like Nelson Mandela or Malala Yousafzai or Elon Musk (pre-â€œfree Americaâ€). Why am I not a superhero? Maybe Iâ€™m not trying hard enough to save the world.
