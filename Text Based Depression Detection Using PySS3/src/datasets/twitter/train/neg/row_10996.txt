I survived my expiration dateIt's already the 6th of april in Germany. For years full of partly mild, partly heavy depression I thought, I would eventually go on the day Cobain died in the year I'm 27.
Well, that was yesterday. I survived. It's not magically better as before, but it gives me hope. Doesn't matter what has happened, I'm still here.
