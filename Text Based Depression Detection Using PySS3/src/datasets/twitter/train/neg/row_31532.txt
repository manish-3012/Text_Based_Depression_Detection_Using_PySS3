I'm tired of being blamed for everything that goes wrong.Lately I've felt like I am just everybody else's scapegoat for when something goes wrong.At my house I get blamed for things that I didn't do and most of my family hates me and they call me retard and other things and it's just because I have high functioning autism they fucking blame me for everything.and lately I've been contemplating whether or not I should just kill my self and I feel like most of my family wouldn't give two shits if I was dead.and honestly I feel like if they blame me one more time I'll fucking kill my self.
