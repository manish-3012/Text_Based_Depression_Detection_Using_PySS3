The dilemmaThere are some reasons why I should kill myself but at the same time I want to live longer.  If I can't continue with schooling or get a job then...either I get a job I dislike or I kill myself. If I'm poor with no money to buy food, then it's either I die of starvation or suicide. Two roads leading to the same destination, except that one is quicker than the other.
