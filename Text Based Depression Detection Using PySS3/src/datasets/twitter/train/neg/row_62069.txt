I contacted helpline but I feel like it didn't helpIt was a chat thing. I thought talking to an adult would help and they would understand but I feel like it didn't help at all. I feel like they talked to me like I was a 5 year old and didn't take me seriously. I told them about my suicidal thoughts but I think they ignored it. They didn't understand me. Maybe they thought I was being dramatic. I feel like they didn't realise I'm actually thinking about KILLING MYSELF. I really thought they would be able to help me.
