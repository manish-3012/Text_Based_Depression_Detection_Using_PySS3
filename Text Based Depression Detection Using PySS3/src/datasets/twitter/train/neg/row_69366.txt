Today I learned my ex killed himself.I feel so bad because I feel like I'm the one who caused it. I shouldn't have broken up with him over some shitty reason... He never threatened that he'd do it if I leave him. He just nod and smiled so I thought it was okay and now, a few weeks later, I found out he killed himself. Am I evil for causing this? His parents blame me for all of it and now I feel so fucking depressed that I just want to disappear from this world...
