My life is a goddamn messI am experiencing suicidal ideation, I think as an effect of some new anti-psychotic medication to treat bipolar disorder. I think this is â€œnormal,â€ and temporary according to my doctor, but it still sucks and it is difficult to talk about. My relationship is majorly on the rocks and itâ€™s the only real support system I have. 

I donâ€™t realize how I feel or that Iâ€™m even upset until I can see a collection of incidents where Iâ€™ve â€œacted out.â€ Last night was one of them. I got drunk because it felt good at the time. I called in sick to work this morning. Last night I messaged everybody I know because I feel so alone and irrelevant. It doesnâ€™t make me feel better, it makes me feel ashamed. Like Iâ€™m an attention-seeking energy suck. I donâ€™t feel like I have anything to contribute. I kind of have compassion for myself, like wanting to not feel isolated is definitely understandable, but I hate the ways I act out because of it. I sometimes treat people poorly, cross boundaries. Ask for time and attention without being considerate or willing to reciprocate.

I carry all this baggage around with me all the time of all the ways Iâ€™ve mistreated people. Like I canâ€™t feel better or enter into new, healthy relationships without being weighed down. 

The idea of actually following through with suicide is not currently appealing, but Iâ€™m still thinking about it a lot. Iâ€™m concerned with him much Iâ€™ve been thinking about it at this moment in time and overall I think itâ€™s an inevitability. All the progress I make feels like one step forward, two steps back. Iâ€™m tired of fighting so hard and playing without a full deck of cards. Iâ€™m tired of wasting peopleâ€™s time. I feel so alone, and I feel like I deserve it! Because I keep doing things like abusing alcohol and because Iâ€™m not grateful enough for the things that are going right in my life. 

It feels like Iâ€™m just shouting into the void. Nobodyâ€™s there. At the end of the day, itâ€™s just  me alone. When itâ€™s all said and done, Iâ€™m the only one who can take responsibility for my feelings and actions. Me, the one person I hate the most. I donâ€™t feel equipped for the task.

Thank you for listening.
