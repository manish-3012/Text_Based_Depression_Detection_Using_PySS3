AcceptingI am accepting there are some people in the world who have the golden touch. They can go through life without trouble or problems. If they do, they have ample ways to overcome it. 

Iâ€™m not one of them. 

I am accepting some people have struggles. Life feels hard but they have ways to endure. They can get by their problems given enough time and effort. A few may even get ahead and turn their lives around. 

Iâ€™m not one of them. 

I am accepting there are a few people who are nothing. No matter what they do they are just cursed. Nothing will change for them. Suffering is simply their path. Pain is all they will ever know. They are failures forever. 

I am one of them. 

And death seems the best way to deal with the echoing failure.
