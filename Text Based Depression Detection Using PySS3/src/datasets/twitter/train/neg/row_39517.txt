I think I want to kill myselfEverything thatâ€™s happened in the last few months has just really convinced me that nothing is going to get better. Iâ€™m so tired. I canâ€™t keep my composure any longer and Iâ€™m not sure how much more I can handle right now. Iâ€™m currently floating from couch to couch (for the second time this year) because I donâ€™t really have anywhere to go. I donâ€™t even have a car to go other places anymore. Iâ€™m out of money and Iâ€™m withdrawing and I canâ€™t go home because thatâ€™s where I was trying to escape from for so long, but it ended up not working. I canâ€™t even get help. Iâ€™m already in a decent amount of medical debt and my parents donâ€™t have an insurance card for me to give the hospital as proof of insurance. I canâ€™t keep going on any longer and idk what else to do. I canâ€™t go to therapy or get new medication or even figure out what in the fuck is actually wrong with me. Anyway, Iâ€™m posting here to see if there are any other methods I could go about this. Suicide is last resort, but I need to go to some kind of hospital or clinic or something. I canâ€™t take it anymore
