I canâ€™t fucking waitIâ€™m so tired of no one giving a shit. Iâ€™m so fucking done.

I have no friends or acquaintances at all, my family treats me like I donâ€™t exist.

No one has ever fallen in love with me or wanted anything romantic with me, not physical, not emotional, nothing.

Every day Iâ€™m reminded of how other people have friends, family, or even lovers to care about me.

My life and my presence have no significance. I fantasize about hurting myself and killing myself. 

Do they even know how fucking lucky they are? Anyone I personally witness treats this like something normal and commonplace, taking it all for fucking granted.

Having someone who actually gives a shit whether or not they are there? Having someone that gives them hugs and kind words? Do these people know what lengths others would go to to have a singular fucking person actually care about them?

I never asked to be born. I never asked to grow up in a rapidly decaying world. I never asked to go through years and years and years of trauma that is still ongoing and never ending.

â€œIt gets betterâ€â€”eat my fucking shoe.

All I fantasize about is different ways to off myself. My life and presence have no meaning, no purpose, no significance. I would cry if I actually felt anything.
