when will it endi've struggled with anxiety and depression since i was 14. i used to use hard drugs which led me to this after getting mixed up in the wrong crowd, though it's pretty frequent here. my therapist recently let me go at 18, after dropping out of school, saying i was better now which couldn't be further from the truth. i have no friends, literally, i haven't talked to somebody my age since i left school at 16 and i live in the middle of nowhere. my parents have given up trying to get me to do something because my depression makes it hard to think of a future and my anxiety makes me scared of the future. i don't know what to do. i'm numb to how lonely my life is some days but days like today i wake up to it and feel it so intensely that i think that my sadness alone could kill me, and honestly, i wish it would. life just seems to be giving me a lot of hints to just end it and i think at this point i have no other choice.
