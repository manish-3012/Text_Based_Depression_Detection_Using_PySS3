I'm Worried I'm at the End of my Rope.I find myself thinking of suicide more and more lately. Couple months back my fiancee suddenly left to be with someone else. Been taking look at myself and trying to understand my issues and better myself. I see where ive made mistakes and im takes steps to be better. But, i feel alone. Its different to start waking up by myself or going home from work to an empty house again. Sometimes when i pull up in the drive way, I just sit there. play on my phone or maybe take a nap. I dont need to go inside because theres no one waiting on me. I feel grey or kinda bored watching shows or playing video games, I barley eat anymore. I've lost 27lbs since she left. I dont find myself feeling happy anymore. I have a good job, i make good money, im lined up for a promotion at work am going back to college to finish my degree. But everything feels worthless, like whats the point if its just me. I cant sleep most nights, i just feel alone, laying in the space where she would sleep. I'm young, but i have a physical disability that i feel makes it hard for girls to see me as a boyfriend or partner. It doesn't hold me back, but i feel like im seen as less of a man. I dont have alot too keep me going. I just feel like im running on auto, im not here. But I am, so i feel trapped in my own broken body. I feel alone. And it's eating at me.
