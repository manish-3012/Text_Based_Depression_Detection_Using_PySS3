I hate myself and I shouldI am a horrible person. I know I hurt those around me, those who love me. I wish I didnâ€™t say the cruel things plaguing my mind. I donâ€™t deserve to be happy and I definitely donâ€™t deserve to be alive. I feel like a leech, sucking the life out of everything and everyone. I want to end it but I dont know whats stopping me. I wish I was a better person but I donâ€™t know how to fix anything anymore. I just wish someone would hit me with a truck or something.
