How hard is it to get a decent job nowadays?How hard is it nowadays to get a decent job? Especially if you are chronically ill? Or mentally ill? Even with a good education its getting harder to get a good job, or i am wrong? Why should i live when i will end up poor or worse homeless? Because its getting harder to get a decent job, and if you're mentally and chronically ill its even harder. Should i just kill myself if i end up poor or homeless? Or is homelessness or poverty not a reason to kill yourself? And i don't want to end up working in a dead end job with low pay. What should i do to prevent that? Just kill myself?
