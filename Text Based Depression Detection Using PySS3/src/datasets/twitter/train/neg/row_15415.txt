I have given up. Why should I bother anymore?I don't feel welcome on this earth anymore, I am constantly alone, rotting from the inside everyday. Nobody wants to listen. My parents and school-mates make me feel unwanted and treat me as if I'm a burden to them. I am incredibly depressed being away from university and   feel as if I'm just dragging it on with only the solace of my Home Depot job to numb my mental pain. My head feels as if it's turning to mush and losing control. I just want it to end. I have nobody else to talk to and I'm afraid if I speak to a professional, my medical history would put my future career in jeopardy. I'm backed into a corner and so far, I only see one way out.
