I canâ€™t do it anymoreIâ€™m honestly so sick of trying. The only reasons Iâ€™m still here is 1.my boyfriend and 2.i realized itâ€™s not that easy to kill yourself/ Iâ€™m too scared. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. I canâ€™t put my problems on other people. Right now I really just want to die but I canâ€™t do it. It hurts to much and no one can understand or see it. I wish I wanted to be alive but I donâ€™t. Every single day I wake up wanting to go back to sleep. I want to sleep forever. I donâ€™t want to do it anymore and I donâ€™t know what to do. Iâ€™m sorry that Iâ€™m like this.
