I took like at least 30 500mg pills of paracetamol hours ago. I wanna take more but Iâ€™m too scared to because the agony of a liver damage death terrifies me lol. Do you think Iâ€™ll be fine after taking that much or am I gonna get sick eventually?I havenâ€™t experienced anything from the pills and I took them hours ago so Iâ€™m confused if Iâ€™m gonna be fine or not if I were to take no more...
