Tired of everything, dislike myself, no hope.Maybe I'm not meant to even live. I have had social anxiety all my life which has caused depression for the past few years. I hate so many physical things about myself which I don't want to even list. I'm so self-conscious and cowardly. School's overwhelming. And to make things even worse, for the past year I have had a chronic problem with my private parts which has killed my relationship with girls and any confidence I had. I don't even know how to fix it, some recommend visiting a physical therapist but I'm to anxious to even do that. Why would it even matter if I'm dead? Once my heart stops beating, I won't even be consciously aware of anything so it's not like I'll feel guilty of hurting my friends or family. What's the point of living if your unhappy with who you fundamentally are? I wish I could just be someone else
