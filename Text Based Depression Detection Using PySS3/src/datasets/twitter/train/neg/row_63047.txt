its the only rational thing to do.it doesnt matter whether i die at the age of 70 or 18. its the same. i will not achieve anything meaningful in life. theres a higher chance of winning a fortune in gambling than to live a truly meaningful life, for me at least. nobody would really care if i died in summer. its true. there truly is not a single person that needs me on this planet. im nothing. and it will surely stay that way. its a world of clowns anyways. those 52 years would only unnecessarily delay the after life and only bring misery. i just have to accept it and go through with it when the time comes. im destined to die like this. i hope i will learn the reasoning behind my existence, i cant figure it out myself and im interested why im here.
