ConflictedIdk what the point of posting any of this is. Iâ€™m just tired of everything and would love nothing more to end it. Iâ€™ve come close to it but can never push myself to last minute because Iâ€™m scared Iâ€™ll fail. Once I fail my options for my future will just fall apart. But if I succeed itâ€™ll all be worth it.
