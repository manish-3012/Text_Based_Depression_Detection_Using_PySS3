therapist said she isn't able to help meSo I went to see a therapist cause I was close to killing myself and i told her about how my scars were bothering me and she basically told me she can't fix my scars so I guess i'm fucked? Life is fucking miserable living as a monster in the world simply because I have scars that I had no choice over. If a therapist can't help me then I guess I am hopeless and am just going to kill myself now as opposed to waiting to inevitably kill myself in the future anyways. What's the purpose of life when people treat you like shit simply for how you look. Guys make fun of me and girls laugh behind my back. I have never had a girl interested in me and never will. Whenever I go to get my haircut the stylist always tries to get it over with as fast as possible since they do not want to be in my presence. My existence is pain and time to get rid of it. No one is going to read this but I felt the need to write this to someone as I have no one to talk to in real life.
