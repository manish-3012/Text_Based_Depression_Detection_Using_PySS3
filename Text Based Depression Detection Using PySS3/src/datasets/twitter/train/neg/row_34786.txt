What can I do to better my life and fix my problems?I don't know really what to do.
I mean. I try, but most of the time I just piss people off somehow. It makes me feel anuesence. I feel that even when I give my very best that I'll never be good enough. My household spends most of the time yelling and arguing with each other. I'm happiest when I'm at school. It's just... Being away from my family I guess. I'm not the one to approach anybody if I don't get something or need help in thought that I'm just wasting their time. I am becoming a little more social, but in the past. I just stuck to talking with my friends and leaving everyone else alone. How I ever got the friends I have today I don't know. When I am with my family, I feel dead inside. à² _à²  

I have never been in a relationship. I don't know what it is, I think too much... But it might be I'm just picky and afraid of commitment... I don't know. I hate to call myself one of those guys but I probably am.

I don't feel I have a purpose. That I don't have anything to offer anybody and that I'm just taking up space as another addition to our 200+ billion world population.

What can I do to better myself and my situation? I don't know what to do. I feel it'd just be better to remove myself from the world and get out of everybodies hair. :|
