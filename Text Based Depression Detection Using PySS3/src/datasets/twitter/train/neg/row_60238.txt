Iâ€™m doneI want to die so bad, but it seems almost impossible. I donâ€™t have a car or a license. I live in Canada, so it would be almost impossible to get a gun. I live in a small town, so jumping off a building or a bridge doesnâ€™t seem very logical. Iâ€™ve attempted to overdose on pills multiple times, but itâ€™s really hard to actually die from overdosing on pills. Iâ€™ve tried hanging myself, but that didnâ€™t work at all, and thereâ€™s nothing really in my house to use. Iâ€™m tried cutting myself with both razors and knives, but nothing in my house is really sharp enough to do it. Again, Iâ€™ve tried almost everything, but the only option is jumping in front of a vehicle or train. However, Iâ€™d have to leave the house, and since I donâ€™t go out much, my family would probably call 911. Thereâ€™s also no guarantee that it would kill me, and I might be permanently disabled or lose a few limbs. I just want the pain to stop and want everyone to stop treating me like crap, and actually give a shit about me. Iâ€™m fat, ugly, short, dumb, and I know I have no future. I really wish assisted suicide for mentally ill people was a thing in my country, as I feel itâ€™s unfair for a person to be forced to live for selfish reasons. I know people would say â€˜your friends and family would careâ€™. Bullshit, absolute bullshit. My family treat me like crap all the time, and yes they might feel pain for a bit, but they would get over it quickly. I have no real â€˜friendsâ€™, Iâ€™ve basically lost all of them, and they donâ€™t seem to actually give a shit about me. When I text them, they either give one worded replies or they take days to reply or sometimes donâ€™t even reply at all. I have no luck finding a partner, as Iâ€™m fat, ugly, dumb, and short. Even if someone will like me, they probably wonâ€™t be my type and I wonâ€™t be attracted to them (I know Iâ€™m self centred, but I canâ€™t help but have a type). The only â€˜thingsâ€™ that will care if Iâ€™m gone is my cats, and they will forget about me in a few days. I wish I could just hire a hitman/just anybody to kill me, but Iâ€™m pretty sure Iâ€™d go to jail for attempting that. I guess I could try suicide by cop, but that might just end up with my injured or in handcuffs. Iâ€™m really tired of living, and really wish every single day that I would just die. I really donâ€™t know what to do. Also, donâ€™t say â€˜talk to a psychiatrist or therapistâ€™ because I have, and it never helps. No therapist or psychiatrist will fix how others treat me and how I feel mentally and physically.
