Everything is going wrongI went from soaring heights to a new crushing low and now I don't know how to pick up the pieces. 100 million dollars down the drain. My wife is ageing like milk and can barely speak English. My kids are in and out of jail. My parents are disappointed in me and begging me to just quit the race, but for some reason I can't. My dad wont even let me give him a wet kiss. And George, my brother, just sits there all smug and doesnt lift a finger to help me.

I just keep telling myself "No. This cant be happening. I was supposed to be in charge around here". But all my colleagues  are supporting this JERK who bullies me. Everyone keeps calling me a cuck and I can't even put on a hoody or talk football without getting made fun of. Why don't I just blow my brains out right now and save us all some time?
