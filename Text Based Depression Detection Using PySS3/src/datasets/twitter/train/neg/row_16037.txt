I don't think I can keep going onI've been struggling with severe depression for the last six years. It's blighted my life time and time again and every time I have aimed for something and had a goal, its cut me down and stopped me achieving anything. I don't remember being happy and I don't think I will ever be happy again. I've stopped caring about anything or enjoying anything and I'm ruining the lives of everyone around me. The only thing that's been stopping me killing myself for the past few years is my parents and my best friend but I've become such a burden to them that I think it would be easier for them if I did just die. I've hoped I would die accidentally for a long time but I've never been lucky. Now it might be time to do it by my own hand. I'm so scared.
