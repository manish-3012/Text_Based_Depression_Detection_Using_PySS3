Can't keep living like thisIronic that I found this sub today when I'm having one of the lowest days I've had in a while. I wake up every day feeling like I've sunk just a bit further than the day before... feeling like everyone around me would simply be better off if I was just not around anymore. I'm scared to try meds or possible in-patient treatment because I'm afraid it either won't help or I won't be able to live without it. I'm at a point where I don't trust myself alone... &amp; even with a wife &amp; 2 kids I still feel like I'm alone.
