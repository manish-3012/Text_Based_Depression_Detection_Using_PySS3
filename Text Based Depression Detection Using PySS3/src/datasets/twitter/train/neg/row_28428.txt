Well, here we go againMy life has been a series of failures and screw ups. All I'm destined to do is work a dead end retail job for the rest of my life. What's the point of trying anymore. I simply don't understand why I should go on living. Every single time I make an effort to change something positively, something major happens and I screw it up. I just don't see the point in continuing on like this.
