I feel like I've been dead for a whileI don't *feel* like me anymore. I don't like anything anymore. I don't like anyone anymore. I'm helplessly addicted to weed and my severe OCD prevents me from holding an actual job which I desperately want. I do stocks/other stuff to make money but it's just not real job type money and I feel like I'm never going to make it. I'm very mentally ill.
