Look I don't want to do it but really there is no way outIm 19, jobless (I apply everywhere just nobody is hiring me), In college but failing horribly, and I am not happy. I live with my mom since my gf of 3 years left me in January. Im looking for a job but cant find one even tough i put in at least 5 applications a week and call back every week. Im in college but since the break up i have been depressed and had no motivation to do anything. I live with my mom and her fiancÃ© but he is going to kick me out at the end of may if i dont have a job. I have nowhere to go and i have a lot of money to pay back on student loans. I really cant see a way of getting my life together at all. I think the only way to end everything is to kill myself. Thats it but i dont want to do it but it seems like the only way to end this shit
