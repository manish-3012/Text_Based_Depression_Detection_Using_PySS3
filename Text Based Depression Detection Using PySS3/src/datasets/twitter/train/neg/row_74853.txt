I'm sitting outside alone with a bottle of pills. I'm scared of what I'm thinking right now.This is the closest I've ever been and right now I'm so so calm about out. It almost just feels like the right move to make.

Anyway, I'm sitting on concrete outside my dorm with a bottle of ibuprofen and trazodone. I've already taken 500mg if the latter. I don't plan in taking a super dose but 200mg/kg of the ibuprofen should be enough to get me in the hospital. Who knows what'll happen then. Maybe other people seeing me sick is all I want.

They don't care though. I've been alone for so long I don't know who I am. I was on the phone with my mom earlier and as far as she knows I'm fine.

Please help me but I don't know if I want it.
