I became suicidal over something stupidI'm suicidal over something stupid. I don't know what to do anymore. I admit it. I have a receding hairline. It is so gross. (I'm not saying others with receding hairlines are gross, I look gross). I check my hairline every minute. I just want to cry. This is so annoying. The right side of my hairline is far worse than the left. I'm freaking out over something stupid. I just want to die. I know it's so stupid and pathetic, but I can't help it. Others have more serious problems and I freak out over *nothing*. God, why am I so stupid? I sound like a stupid kid.

So here comes the crazy part: I always compare myself to Final Fantasy characters. And what do they have? Hair. Lots of hair. Heck, I'm 18 and so stupid. Why does it have to be like this? It all started when I was 14. Everything was fine back then. I'm not trolling. I tell myself *My hair in Final Fantasy is different. I look different there.*, but this doesn't make anything better. What the hell is wrong with me?

And I hate it when people say *just shave it off, bro. Hit the gym, bro*. No! I would feel like someone else, without hair, like Jason Statham or someone else (Jason Statham is awesome though). This wouldn't be me. A bald me. I can't handle this. 

Again, I know it sounds so pathetic, but this is really killing me. I'm sorry, but this is the way I am...

Sorry again, I'm not really good at writing long texts.
