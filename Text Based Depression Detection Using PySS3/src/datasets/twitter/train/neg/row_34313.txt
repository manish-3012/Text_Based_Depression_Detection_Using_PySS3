I don't want to existI am a high school student who has no ambition to do anything with my life. Not that I could do anything, even if i wanted to. I constantly do poorly in school, i waste my time instead of being productive, and I just become a major source of stress and disappointment to my parents. I dont make an effort to do anything, so I probably wont get a job and end up just being useless. Everytime I look around, everyone around me is doing their hardest to succeed in life. I dont do anything. I just waste time and space. I just want the pain to stop. I hate trying to tell myself that I'll do better next time, becuase I know its bullshit.
