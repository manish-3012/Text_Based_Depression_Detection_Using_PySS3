Please, just please... I miss him so badOne day everyone and everything youâ€™ve ever known, loved, believed in- will just stop. Not as in the end of time, but maybe the end of your time... or the end of someone elseâ€™s. Someone you love more than what you thought was possible. Someone, when gone, youâ€™ll marvel at how the world still spins... how everyone else goes about life like nothing ever happened. You wonder, do they have someone they love? Is it strong, steady, whole soulful love? Youâ€™ll wonder if your love was enough? If it is/was, why does the TV still play? The radio still has all of the same stations, and they still play all the music that reminds you of this person. Has the WHOLE WORLD missed this? Do they understand who they all lost? A wonderful person, whether shown to them or not, someone whose love meant the world to many others. Maybe their name will be read in the newspaper, the obituaries no doubt, some people will say â€œhey I knew him, the world was a better place last week.â€ No matter who you know or who you are: there are people who love you, who need you, who think of you daily... and whose world would stop spinning if you were gone.
