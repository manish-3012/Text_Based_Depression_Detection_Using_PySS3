I feel embarrassed to existthat's it. I'm just an embarrassment. only reason I'm still standing is because I'm a coward who can't go through with. but it'll come. I knew it when I was 10, I knew it at 15, I know it now. dread it, run from it, yadda yadda I know what my inevitable end is idk why I keep running away as if it'll make any difference. I can run as long as I like I'm just gonna die tired (as if I'm not already ha).
