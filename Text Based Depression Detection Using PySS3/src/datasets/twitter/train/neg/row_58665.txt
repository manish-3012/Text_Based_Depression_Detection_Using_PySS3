One last chanceI'm sorry for ranting so randomly, but I'm just laying in my bed looking at the ceiling and this is killing me. 
 
Basically, I've decided to give myself one last chance before letting myself go and finally CTB. 
 
For a good while, people have started following my content and liking what I'm doing. I've gotten a bit of exposure and I'm working on one huge project... 
 
I just want to succeed. I want to live my life knowing I can live thanks to my work, to what I love and work hard for. To be honest, I'm scared. I'm terrified... What if it fails? 
 
To be honest, I think about dying every single day. Somehow, my project and my work are what keep me going. However, if I really end up failing and being unable to live off my passion... I'm ending it. I'm tired of being nothing, when people I know can get whatever they want by snapping their fingers. I'm so tired of this all. 
 
Sorry for the rant.
