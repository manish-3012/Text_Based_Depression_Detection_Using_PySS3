I donâ€™t deserve life. Iâ€™m a terrible person.Throwaway account

I did something horrible and unforgivable... I canâ€™t live with myself anymore. I donâ€™t deserve any of the love anyone gives me. None of them know what a horrible person I really am. 

I want to kill myself and I know I deserve it, but I canâ€™t bring myself to do it. Iâ€™m selfish for wanting to stay in this world. Iâ€™m making the world an even worse place than it already is.
