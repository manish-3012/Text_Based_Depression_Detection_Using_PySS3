i havent done anything useful my entire life.there's no reason for me to be here. i dont enjoy anything. theres no reason TO enjoy anything. i dont have any ambitions, or goals, or friends. i just have endless torture. im ugly inside and out.
so
im going to find a way to end it tonight. im terrible at dealing with pain, and i wish i had a gun.
theres no where tall enough to jump from, so im really left with an OD or hanging. 
i just dont want to survive
please dont let me survive
please dont let me survive please
dont let me survive
