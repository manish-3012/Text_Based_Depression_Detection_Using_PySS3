I'm sorry to the people who PMed me about a post here that I didn't respond tooI come here looking for support. I love that this is a place where people can respond and sympathize with others. The fact that you guys PMed me means a lot, but unfortunately I suck at Reddit and accidentally ignored your chats and don't know where they went. 

Also, I'm really sorry if this is dumb, but I'm  not entirely sure if I would feel comfortable one on one chatting with someone online, that's not at all a reflection on you and I'm sorry if that's offensive.
