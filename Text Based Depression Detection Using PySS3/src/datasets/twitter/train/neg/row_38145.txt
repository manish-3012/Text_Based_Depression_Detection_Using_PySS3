can we ask for easy suicide ways and other suicide aids here?long story short , i kinda made a pretty screwed up life decision on 22 Jan , 2014 out of panic , confusion and possibly sheer insecurity. Its gonna be an year since i f'ed up , and that'll impact my whole career and pretty much my whole life. I won't hide the fact that i'm an only son , born after 2 daughters and after lots of prayers from my family.
i'll be 21 in August. Im going thru psychological pain , lethargy , heartbreak(possibly Stress Cardiomyopathy) , infighting with my very OWN self and depressional pain near my liver.

I'll be straight forward. Im a HUGE coward. i am scared of blood , searing pain and cuts in sensitive areas(like wrists , genital areas etc).
If someone could tell me a way to depart rather peacefully and instantaneously , i'll be rather grateful to them. Something that causes pain for , say , a few seconds or a minute at most and then its over ... FOREVER.

I'll be waiting.
