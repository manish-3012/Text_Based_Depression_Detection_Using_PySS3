No passions, interests, goals, motivation, meaning, etc. What can I do..The only thing I really enjoy in life is playing with my dog and video games. 

I have no interests in anything else, and I can't imagine myself with any job 5 years from now. I can't see myself as a lawyer, or a doctor, or teacher, etc.

What's the point in living if I have no passions, I can't  make a living out of video games (I'm not good or personable enough for YouTube) or playing with my dog so why bother living!!
