I've felt like giving up for a long time now.I don't know if this is the right place to put it and I don't want to go into a rant again because of the many times Ive posted on here and deleted my posts out of paranoia, but I just got kicked out of college which is the only thing my life revolves around and I just don't know what's stopping me from killing myself. Theres so many other things going on and I don't want to go to the hospital again so I'm just at a loss of what to do. I don't even know what's wrong with me after being locked up for 2 weeks and having tons of anti depressants and anti psychotics shoved down my throat. I guess I still don't have a means to die that's not going to affect other people. I've contemplated jumping on train tracks or aggressing police to shoot me but I realized that would affect people so I guess I'm just waiting until I have access to something. I don't  care how long it takes until I can get access to something.
