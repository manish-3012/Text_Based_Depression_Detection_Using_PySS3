Is suicide always a bad thing?A friend of mine who has always had a troubled life, has had an exceptionaly tough few years. 
Both his parents, his uncle and his grandmother died within the span of 2 years.
He has been abusing an crazy amount of drugs (he is clean now but think he might have done damage to the receptors in his brain)

He blew a crazy amount of money he inherented on numbing the pain, lost his job car etc. And doesn't really have a place to live and
Screwed up his relationship with the one person her really loved. 

He has lost most of his friends by only ever contacting them when he needs money or help with something.

He has become suicidal, has attempted suicide and I'm sure he will again. 

I honestly don't know how to help him, we have tried but he needs to help himself somehow.

He needs professional help but in my country that costs about the same per month, as the avarage annual income.

Anyway I know this might sound fucked up, but it's a genuine question I have. 
Won't it be better for him to be gone and without pain, than have to suffer through all this pain for years and years to come?
