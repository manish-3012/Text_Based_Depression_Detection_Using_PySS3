Self hateI feel bad a lot. More recently when I feel bad I get intense thoughts and I cant get them out of my head. It's like hearing someone say die or kill yourself over and over again. I tried once to hang myself but I pussied out and I hate myself so much for it. 

I'm 22 and recently split from my partner of 4 years. I feel that will never find someone else. I had a great girlfriend and I ruined it all. Shes moving out of the country now, because she cant stand being here.

I feel like I can't handle good things,I dont deserve them.
