wanna kill myself but can't bring myself to do itI wake up every day and dread getting out of bed because I hate the thought of being alive. I've made my life out to be a joke so people don't realize that I am honestly on the verge of losing it every fucking day. I go to work and I feel fucking worthless and no matter what I do it never seems like enough. I thought my coworkers liked me but they are consistently leaving me out and making me feel like shit. My other friends have all moved away or work full time opposite me because college is over and life started. My love life is a fucking joke and I sleep with random men double my age because they're the only people that will have anything to do with me because I'm a disgusting fatass piece of shit. I'm 23 and I want to die how fucking pathetic is that? I just wish that for one time my life was not shit and I'm fucking done trying. I'm going to hopefully drink so much tonight I get alcohol poisoning and die. It's been real world.
