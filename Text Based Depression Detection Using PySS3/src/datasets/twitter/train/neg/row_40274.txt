Not help, but tipssuicidal thoughts have been in my head since the age of 12 maybe younger. Almost everyday i get this closer and closer feeling to my end, At one point i know i am gonna eventually snap and inevitably end it all. At this point I feel extremely close to my end, I've written notes on different pages and only feel like it's not enough, what should i do for, and with my loved ones before my times end?
