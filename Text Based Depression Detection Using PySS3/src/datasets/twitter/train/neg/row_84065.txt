I wrote this prose for all of us here struggling to stay aliveSex Sells


Mouthwash spat into a dirty sink. It never washes out the bitter taste of isolation stained upon my tongue. The echo of running water resounds through the empty house. Iâ€™m angry but who is there to blame?

My reflection stares blankly back at me. In the mirror, tired eyes catch the glimmer of a broken razor only an arms reach away.

My skin is nearly flawless and soft to the touch. Will it rip like the silk dress of a little girl whose mother told her never to climb that tree? Or melt off the flesh like brown sugar in a warm bowl of grits on a cold winter morning?

Behind the mirror, a medicine cabinet holds a number of elixirs to remedy the pain. 
The yellow one will help the blood flow freely through my tiny veins. The pink one will help me fall asleep.

An armâ€™s reach away, behind the mirror â€”
Who am I to blame?
Soft fleshâ€”
Brown skin â€”
Ripping on a cold winter morning.
Pink water in a dirty sink.
