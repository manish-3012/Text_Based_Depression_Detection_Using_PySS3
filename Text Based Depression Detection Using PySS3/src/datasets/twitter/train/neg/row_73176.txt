Do you ever just wish you never existed?Dying isn't my one wish, never existing is. Killing myself means no one showing up to my funeral, no one remembering me, or people mocking the memory of me and how I die. Being killed by an accident like a car crash would at least eliminate one of those fears, but never existing means never having to deal with any of this.
