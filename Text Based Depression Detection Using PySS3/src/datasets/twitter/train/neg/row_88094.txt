I just got let go from another jobI failed my 6 month probation.  I loved this job. My boss didnt like me but I loved the job. My dad thinks I'm out applying but I sitting alone in a dead end bar, drowning my sorrows and trying to escape into oblivion. I've been struggling big time recently, suicide has fleeted in my mind more than one occasion but this has hit the final nails into the coffin for me.

My dads disappointed, I'm disappointed and my mum and friends are disappointed. All I ever do is fail and let others down, I try so fucking hard to make everyone including myself happy but to no avail. All I ever wanted was some normality back in my life, some real happiness that I haven't experienced since I was a little boy, I finally felt like I had something great, like I was really living for something and my cunt of a boss who never liked me for personal reasons has pulled that away from under my feet. 

I'm too much of a coward to take the pills, jump of a building or slit my own wrists. I just wish something accident wise would happen to me. I've been in two near death situations, I got pneumonia so bad I turned blue one night and nearly died, only survived because my mum found me just in time, I got hit by a car at 40mph, slammed my head off the curb and all I came away with was a cut on my head and a black eye. 

I took all the force in my leg from this one ton metal beast and yet I didnt even have so much as a bruise on it. The universe is that much of a bitch to me that it wont even let me die in near seemingly impossible to survive situations. I truly feel like I'm not meant for this modern life, like I was born in the wrong century, everyone would truly be better off without me. I contribute nothing but tragedy and disappointment to my parents and friends. Please just let me die. I don't want to hurt anymore.
