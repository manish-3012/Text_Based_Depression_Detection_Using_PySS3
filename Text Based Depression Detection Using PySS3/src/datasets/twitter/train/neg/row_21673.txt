Cursed unlovable garbageI'm just a cursed unlovable garbage no matter how much I bother nobody is capable of loving me or even care about me because I'm a garbage always was. Since birth I'm just cursed with being lesser. I have never known a feeling of being good enough for myself or anyone and I've been fighting suicidal thoughts for 2 years already I just wish I would already end it all. After all I have all I need to kill myself. I don't know what am I waiting for better times will never come. Not to me. God hates me so fucking much after all he just looks at me as if I was just some worthless worm and who am I kidding of course I am. I tried it all becoming better, looking better, dressing better, improving my personality but nobody seems to care at all. And honestly why do I see myself as cursed? Because what else am I I'm not even ugly some call me even good looking  I'm an idiot and never had shitty personality or anything to begin with. And yet I've bettered myself from like a 7 to a 9 but still nobody fucking cares cause I'm cursed worthless and should just die for being a failure I am.
