I tried to be there for and help someone that was struggling and they completely blew me off.I made a thread earlier today, and it became evident that one of the people who replied was suicidal.

I sent them a pm with resources for survival and offering to be there for them if they needed it. I tried to be very kind, gentle, and self aware in this message.

However, I received a response that was harsh towards both me and my message, with an emphasis that they're not changing their mind.

Is there anything that I did wrong? Is there anything else I should try to do?(I'm assuming that I shouldn't bother them anymore, as it might make things worse.)
