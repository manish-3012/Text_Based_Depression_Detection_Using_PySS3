Slowly giving upI have no job, not future planned, no true friends and no energy to make new ones. I've been living with depression for so many years now, I'm just so tired, all I can do is sit and cry. I never wanted to live on past 18, I wish I had the courage and strength to end this nightmare of a life then. I don't really want to exist anymore
