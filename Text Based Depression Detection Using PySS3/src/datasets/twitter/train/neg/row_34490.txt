Shit job. Wife took my kid and moved out of state. Nothing left for me.Have nothing left. I work 2 shitty jobs. I dread working daily. My wife left me and took our child. She moved over 17 hours away with her family. If I fight in court I may get to see my daughter once a year. If I move up there, I have no support, job, money or place to live. 

So tldr
What pills can I take to end it? I read that sleeping pills may not do it, however if I take enough it should work. I want to just sleep and never wake up. My daughter is young enough that she won't really remember this anyway.
