Just here still, still tryingIt's so hard sometimes. I want to change but it's extremely hard. With every small improvement, this severe o.c.d. I have triggers arm bells that I've done something horribly wrong. I spend days obsessing and deprpessed, rehearsing scenarios where I made mistakes. It makes me so depressed, I lose any forward progress. 

So I bottom out again. Pretty regular cycle, every two weeks. After a few days in bed, only getting up to eat cookies and use the toilet, finally a small break comes. It's not the disaster I thought. Maybe I was exaggerating. I get up and start the week again. Sometimes I make a little progress, wash a load from the massive dirty clothes pile in the closet, help my parents around the house. Sometimes I even start feeling like making plans for more change.

But then it starts again.

So I guess I'm here again, starting again from bottoming out. If only feeling GOOD didn't scare me so much. If only something would really improve.
