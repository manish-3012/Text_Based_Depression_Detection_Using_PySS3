Things are getting weirdI've been formally diagnosed with anxiety, but not depression, since the diagnosis was a long time ago and I haven't been able to go to a doctor since (insurance problems). I kind of see my emotions as waves, and notice that the highs don't last as long and the lows are getting more intense. It's like every time I start to feel healthy and motivated, I know in the back of my mind it won't last more than a few days to a week. 

But something weird is happening this time. Ive been feeling very paranoid these last few days, like I'm constantly missing something. I haven't slept right, I've been sleeping for too long but I'm constantly waking up nervous and anxious in the middle of the night. I'm even starting to hear things that aren't there. I don't know how else to describe it. I used to eat emotionally, now I fluctuate between overeating and not eating or drinking for days.

But the paranoia is the worst, like when you have a weird feeling that something bad is about to happen or when you forget something important. It's been lingering constantly for the past few days. Everything's lost meaning. I feel foggy and hopeless. There isn't any point in going to seek help and pay out of pocket, I won't be able to afford it. There isn't any meaning to much of anything these days.
