I need help please.I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s wrong with me. I hate myself I hate my life. I hate everything. But at the same time I donâ€™t. I have an amazing life that anyone would love to have. What the fuck is so wrong with my brain that i hate everything so much sometimes? I hate myself so much and I honestly want to die right now. Please someone remind me how this is a bad idea and I will be okay. Please.
