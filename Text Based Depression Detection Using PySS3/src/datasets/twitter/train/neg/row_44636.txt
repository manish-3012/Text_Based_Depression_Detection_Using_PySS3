The shame of being both privileged and suicidal.I grew up in the lap of luxury.  I have the most loving, generous, amazing family anyone could wish for.  I have circles of good friends I care a lot about and who feel the same for me, when I'm able to be normal and social around them.

But I have suffered from overwhelming, debilitating depression for the latter half of my life (I'm 25).  So many times I have acknowledged to myself that suicide is the way it has to end, sooner or later.  My deepest regret, of the many in my life, is not having done it sooner.  

As it is, I just watch as the trajectory of my life flops down below those of all my friends.  Everyone I knew, including myself, at one time believed I would go on to become a doctor or a vet and do great things.  I could have, too, if I had worked just a little harder.  Instead I took a crappy job out of college, quit it a year later to "follow my dreams," then realized it's too late and those dreams just aren't gonna happen.  Now I'm unemployed, living with my parents, too ashamed to be social, and the desire to die is getting stronger and stronger with each passing day.

There are so many people in the world who have it worse than me but still love life.  It makes me feel like such a worthless, ungrateful piece of shit for wanting to bring such grief to my family.  But it is what it is.
