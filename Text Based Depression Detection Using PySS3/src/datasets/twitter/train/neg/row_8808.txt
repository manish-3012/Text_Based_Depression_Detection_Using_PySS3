why am I so fucking sadim not suicidal or shit but its getting to the point where I think i'm headed that way. I know there are people worse off than I am, and it's not like i have the worst life ever. I cant get any girls and my dad would rather fuck his girlfriend than talk to me. nobody even wants to talk to me except in video games, and it feels like I sit here every fucking day without any real social interactions. i am just so fucking depressed, and i don't know what to do. I take meds and counselling doesnt work for me. I've tried everything, I need something else.
