I think I've lost the will to liveI'm just too lonely. I've never been in a relationship and I have few friends, and I don't understand how to socialize. For I on g time now I've been unable to take any joy in anything, and I've lost the motivation  to do much other than sit at home. I just can't find a reason to live.
