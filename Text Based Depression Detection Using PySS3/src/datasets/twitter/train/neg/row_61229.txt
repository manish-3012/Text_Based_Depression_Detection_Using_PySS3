Happy and wanna dieI'm not sad. I know I have people who care, I know that the world is beautiful and there's much that I could do, I just don't want it. I feel like I've done everything I need to. Death will come anyways. I feel fulfilled, I feel like I've seen and done everything I wanted to do. I just feel ready.
