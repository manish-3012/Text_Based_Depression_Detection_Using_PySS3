I'm trying to help my friend's girlfriend from a country awayMy friend for a university group project has been messaging me that he is concerned for his girlfriend's wellbeing. She has sent him messages saying that she "hates life" and that she "wants him to leave so that she won't hurt him" and my friend is getting more concerned as the day goes on. I messaged him to say that he should remind her that he cares about her and asked if he could check in on her but she lives in another country and we can't reach her any other way that I know of. I'm not sure what, if anything, I can do to help him, or her, and this was one of the places I thought to go to for advice. I'm not sure if I'm overreacting or if she isn't actually suicidal but I need to at least try to help before it might be too late. What can I do to help my friend and what can I do to help his girlfriend?
