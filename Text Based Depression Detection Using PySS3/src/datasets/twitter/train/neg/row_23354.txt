I don't need to be here..I'm sitting here, thinking, crying. I asked 'do you still want me?' you replied 'i think so..' That really hurt..The things that are running through my mind are: He will find someone better; you are a failure; you can't do anything right; why me; how could you say that; he is better off without me... I know you can see all of this. And I want to say I'm sorry. For everything, i wish our fights weren't so bad, because other than that, everything is perfect. I still have strong feelings for you and I don't want you to leave. You are my life, without you I'm lost, and without you I'm nothing. I miss you and you haven't even left. I want you to be happy with me because I am happy with you. I want to be the only girl you love. My depression is ruining our relationship, and know I want to die because its all my fault. I don't know what to say anymore, I'm out of words, but not tears. I'm sorry, for everything. But ill never stop having feelings for you. You are the best.
