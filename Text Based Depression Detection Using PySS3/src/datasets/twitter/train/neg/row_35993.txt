Can someone help me (notice me, the one with the terrible username)I am so tired at trying to cry but being constantly frustrated, sad, angry at all the small things. 

I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m childish but what triggered this thought at first was my crush. I liked her for so long and she decided to choose my friend instead. What the hel? When I talked to her about the misery I felt whenever they ship them in class and asked for her feelings about this and she said â€œI would say Iâ€™d be sad but I be lyingâ€ she didnâ€™t mean it as an insult but it still makes me one to just end my fucking existence on this meaningless world. 

But I think the cause of this is the people in my life constantly leaving me and I canâ€™t do anything about it. I am too weird for them. I find dark humour funny? I think the misery of others are funny. Maybe I deserve to die? Maybe Iâ€™m a sociopath? I have no idea. I just want to beat myself up right now. I canâ€™t do anything at all. I donâ€™t want to die cause maybe my parents my grief but I rlly canâ€™t take it anymore. Someone help me sort things out I beg you
