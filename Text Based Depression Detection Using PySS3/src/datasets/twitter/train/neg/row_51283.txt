Breaking up with suicidal girlfriendI've got a girl that I've been dating for a little over a month. She's 21 and I'm 25. She's told she doesn't plan on living past 23. She says she's doesn't want to feel and that dying will bring her peace. I have a sister who passed from suicide at a young age. I've got a rescuer mentality and want to save her, but I also have the mind to not want to get involved and have to endure the pain of trying to control and change someone's life. I feel like the best decision is to breakup with her. I am scared as I know no break up is easy but I want to be mindful to be honest with her and the reason why I've made this decision but I don't want to cause a huge upset within her. I'm looking for guidance in the best way to go about breaking up with her.
