A little happinessI never thought I would say this but I've finally gotten a drop of hope, about 30 minutes ago I received a letter in the mail turns out it wasn't a letter and was a check from the child support office left by my dad. Apparently what he did pay back when I was like 10 is finally here all 10000 of it. It's gonna be a good week.
