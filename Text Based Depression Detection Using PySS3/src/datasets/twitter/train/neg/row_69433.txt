running out of optionshey, so before i start this is really really my last option.
i suffer from GAD, depression and panic attacks and i've been off work for 2 months as it's been so bad, today i was meant to go back and i just broke down, threw up everything and my attack was so strong i passed out. I couldn't make it to work but i need to to make ends meet or i'm just going to end up more in debt, i cut myself today and went to my GP who referred me to the crisis team who apparently can't see me till morning.
the problem i'm having is it doesn't feel like me when i hurt/try to kill myself, i hear internal voices that wear me down and get so strong i can't think of anything else. I'm scared i won't last the night and end up trying to OD
