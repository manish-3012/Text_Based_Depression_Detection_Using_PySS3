On the verge, want to tell my dad about my past but Iâ€™m scared. I fear I may do something stupid tonight or sometime soon.So Iâ€™ve been dealing with depression/suicidal thoughts for a while now, and me and my father arenâ€™t very close, but I was abused by this girl physically, mentally, and sexually (the whole opinion of guys canâ€™t be sexually abused by woman is false) but Iâ€™m in a pretty unhealthy relationship right now and just want to tell an adult, even tho me and my dad have our issues I just feel like I should confess, but scared of whatâ€™s gonna happen after.  Iâ€™ve already gotten close to harming myself a few times and idk how much longer I can handle this.
