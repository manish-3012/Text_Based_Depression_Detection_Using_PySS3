I nearly did itI had a nuse tied from a bar I had wedged in the attic door and if my nan hadn't knocked on the front door I would probably be dead now

I tried once before by going to the top of a building but I couldn't get over the railings 

At this point I know that if I try again I will definitely die

The thing is I dont want to die I just want this feeling to go away and I think most of it is caused by the fact that I dont talk to anyone 

If anyone is looking for a friend or someone to talk too I'd really like too. Thing is though I'm pretty boring and unfunny. I'm up to talk about anything really though it would really help me out

Also sorry if I dont reply very quickly I'm pretty bad at checking my phone and am quite nervous about this
