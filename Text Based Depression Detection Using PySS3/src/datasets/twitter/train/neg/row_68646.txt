i just need an answeri am nothing but a blimp. until now not one of you knew i existed. i feel like im a monster, my family constantly blame me for the shit in their lives. im in college but i dont see myself going anywhere. i dont see myself living past 23 or so. im 19. all i can see normally, even on my best day i can only see four years. on days like this, four minutes.
