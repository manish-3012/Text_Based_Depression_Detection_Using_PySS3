I'm not okJust wanted to keep it simple; I feel like everything in my life has gone to shit despite my efforts. It gets worse every day and I don't enjoy anything every single day is a walking misery and suffering.

Ive tried everything and can't seem to get rid of the depression.

I need someone to talk to please.
