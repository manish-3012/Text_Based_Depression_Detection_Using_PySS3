I just want to ramble and die alreadyI want to die right now. Iâ€™m depressed and keep repeating the same negative mental thought pattern. Itâ€™s as if being depressed is normal for me. Itâ€™s been one year since my ex broke up with me and I still havenâ€™t moved on. How can I when this person used to be my everything? They were there for me and gave me the gift of happiness. My family mistreats me by calling me stupid, ugly, fat, etc., but my ex has been the only person in my life who made me feel like I had value in this world. 

They are the only person on this planet who knows who I truly am. But ever since they left, my entire life is empty and meanginless. I try to make friends but I canâ€™t seem to connect with anyone. Iâ€™ve only had one true connection ever in my life so far, and thatâ€™s with my ex. My ex wasnâ€™t perfect, but they were perfect to me. Thatâ€™s why I canâ€™t seem to let go already. I know letting them go will help me so much, but I canâ€™t seem to do it yet. Itâ€™s frustrating to know that the answer is simple, but emotions arenâ€™t exactly rational. 

Iâ€™m just tired of living everyday alone and lost. Iâ€™m tired of not being able to break my unhealthy habits of biting the skin off of my fingers out of stress/anxiety. Iâ€™m tired of bearing so much love for someone who doesnâ€™t give a shit about me anymore. Iâ€™m 20 years old and yet Iâ€™m failing to see the light at the end of the tunnel. I just want everything to end. I donâ€™t see happiness in my future. 


I donâ€™t want any more suffering from the breakup... I donâ€™t understand how loving someone and then losing them forever could make one feel so broken. Iâ€™m tired of feeling unfulfilled and unworthy. I thought that this was something that goes away like a scratch, but so far I have not healed at all. I donâ€™t want to live if it means Iâ€™ll be alone without someone who truly loves me. Everything is so dark and cruel.
