I just ordered an x-acto knife on Amazon.I've been constantly thinking about it all week. I tried to go to the store and buy one, but the only one I could build courage up to go to didn't have it

It's all I think about sometimes. I've tried to kill myself with pills before, almost 3 years ago. But I woke up in the hospital. 

I've always felt so hallow, since that first attempt. Like a part of me really did die that day. I still believe maybe, if there is such a thing, that my soul died and I'm just an empty shell. Nothing inside me but a black, empty nothingness. 

I remember feeling that hole fill up. Almost completely. But lately it's stirring, swirling like a vortex and gutting me like a pumpkin.

Yet I maintain a 40 hour a week job. This past two weeks I have been awful to the people I work with, which makes it all worse. 

I hate my job, I hate that I'm still trying to rebuild my life THREE YEARS since the first attempt. I hate that I could have been on a better path where I was successful and not suffering. I hate that I can be happy and forget all about all of this over a weekend  and then return to reality when I go back to my shitty job and hate life again.


I have thought about going back on medication and have attempted to see my original doctor and make a set up and new one. But the waits and waiting lists make me uneasy.  But really though, I am ashamed to be on meds. I am afraid to be on meds. I'm just so tired and have no motivation to do anything. Because it's all in my head. It's all so draining.


I'm just tired. So tired. Physically, mentally and in my chest I feel that I am not meant to be happy. 

So the 24th is the day I expect them to arrive. Will that be a good day or a bad day. I don't know. But I have a plan and it makes me feel less stuck. I have options.
