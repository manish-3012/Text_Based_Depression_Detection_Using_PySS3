i think I just got my sign to kill myselfIâ€™m away from my family, 6 hours away with my girlfriend who takes care of me and feeds me and provides for me while Iâ€™ve gotten fired twice. Iâ€™ve gotten into two car accidents with her car and all I do is cause her trouble. I love her so much and I know she loves me but she canâ€™t handle what a drain I am and I hate seeing myself drag her down. 

For three years sheâ€™s been the only reason I havenâ€™t killed myself. Because I didnâ€™t want her to deal with the consequences. but tonight she talked about all the things that are wrong with me. Yelled at me for getting into anothwe wreck. Spoke about all the things I hate about myself and all the reasons I think Iâ€™m better off dead. 

I know it will hurt her. To find her girlfriend missing or worse, dead. But Iâ€™ve been holding myself together so she wouldnâ€™t be alone and with no money comin in and no passion for life at all, am I really with her the way I should be? She just admitted to wanting to break up with me finally if I donâ€™t get my shit together but I donâ€™t know how guys. I really donâ€™t. 

I really canâ€™t do this anymore. I donâ€™t even know if I try really hard or not at all or... I just donâ€™t want to do this. I hate where I am and who I am and I can move all over thdonâ€™t country but I can never learn to like myself at all. All I do is cause misery for others and Iâ€™m tired of burdening them and watching them pick up after my failures. 

I just hope that in my next life I know how to learn from mistakes and can be better. 

I really really wanna be better. 

Haha, Iâ€™m crying so hard but still so quiet so she wonâ€™t hear me. If you read all of this thank you so much. This is a great board for helping people out of suicide and just it being here makes me happy, objectively. That strangers will help strangers so willingly. 

Iâ€™m gonna try really hard to be better next time.
