I took a razor to my thigh todayIm done with everything. Family expectations of me, zero suport of my partner. I am constantly visibly upset and his answer is 'what do you want me to do about  it, its your problem'
is a fucking hug so hard to give? A fucking 'are you ok babe?' 
got into another argument and i just cant do it anymore, went stright to my room, got a razor and for the first time started cutting myself.  I felt so numb, so disgusted yet satisfied that i was feeling pain.
The only thing stopping me from filling the tub with water, calling a ambulance, and cutting my wrist is my daughter. I look at her and just burst into tears, how could i leave her, but how can i let myself live any more.  Im always out to make sure everyone is ok, is looked after, yet no one does the same for me.
