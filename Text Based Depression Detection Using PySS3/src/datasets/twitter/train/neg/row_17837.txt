Hitting rock bottom right we one of the best things that could of happened to meA incredibly rough break up brought back everything Iâ€™d repressed and Iâ€™ve spent the last 3 month going on an absolute rollercoaster of emotions. After another stab at rock bottom I decided to go for a walk to my favourite secret spot. 

I text a few friends so somebody knew where I was as I had no intention of leaving my phone on whilst I cleared my head. Next thing I know I get an influx of loving and supportive messages. 

These people care about me. These people have been sat there watching me destroy myself and never once turned their back on me. Some of them Iâ€™ve hurt and let down. I got so caught up on who wasnâ€™t in my life and the traumas Iâ€™d been through that I completely forgot about who is there. 

People who love you will never abandon you.
