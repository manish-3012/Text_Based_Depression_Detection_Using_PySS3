I should be sleeping but...instead, I'm trying not to go grab a knife and start cutting. I have to get up in five hours so I can drive to my mother's and go to a credit councilling center with her so we don't lose our house. I know that sounds, but I currently live with my girlfriend, even though the house is in my name. I have had no income for the past 18 months and she and my step-father have been trying to pay the bills. I know I'm not going to like what they say. 

Additionally, Friday is my appointment with IMA who will determine if I get disability or not. The likelihood is that I will not. I know how I will respond to that and I'm afraid. I can't stand not having some sort of income and I will self-harm. I know that, I just don't know how badly. There is a strong part of me that is hoping that I won't see Friday afternoon.

I can't work and that bothers me. I haven't worked since the fourth mental breakdown at my previous employer. I don't trust hospitals because I've had a few very unpleasant experiences. I don't want to bother my friends and family, nor do I want to have to deal with explaining why I don't want to go to the ER. I don't know what to do. If I call a crisis line, I feel like they will just send me to the ER, possibly after telling me to wait for several hours for them to call me back. 

I just can't handle things anymore and just want to be done with them.
