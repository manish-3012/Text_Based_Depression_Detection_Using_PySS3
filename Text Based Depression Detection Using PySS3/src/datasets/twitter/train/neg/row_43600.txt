_____________________________________________________

I know that many people do not care about this and I'm okay with that, I'm just trying to vent out to anyone even if it means venting out to my own self, I live in the middle east just for context.

ever since I was in the 7th grade I had this feeling in my gut that I was different, I liked boys, At first I thought it was just something normal, a boy can like a boy and a boy can like a girl just like that,but I found out that its not how things work, people will hate me for it and people will fight me for it and that thought alone has just stricken sadness through me.

growing older and me wanting to change it in any way possible was the hardest part for sure, when you hate being this way it leads to major depression and major self-hate and suicidal thoughts, I never wanted or attempted suicide but I think about it more than you would imagine, I just want to pause life and have a huge moment with myself, and all of that is due to me being gay,If my friends knew they would all hate me because I know where they stand on this subject,If my mom knew she would disown me or get me to a therapist to "Cure" me,do you have any idea how much it hurts for your own mother to say that ? do you have any idea how much it hurts for you to join in your friends on calling a feminine guy on the street a faggot for them to not think you are gay ?

Seeing those people online all around the world come out to their families makes me so happy for them and it reminds me that people will change their views about this topic every day, but it hits me that my family will NEVER do the same it makes me even more heartbroken.

Mix all of this shit with school being absolutely incredibly harder each year and the pressure going on you from everyone expecting you to get higher grades and to "Climb the ladder" while they don't know that you study so much...they still ask you for more and more which leads to pressure and for you to eventually break down.

All of this led me to be incredibly sad and feeling lonely and numb, I personally have many friends but it always feels lonely, I even had a couple of girlfriends that were beautiful and kind but I always had to break it up because all I did was hurting them while pretending to be straight in hopes that I would "Change" one day.

I'm usually the guy who smiles and laughs at everything,the guy who can get a joke through to people, the guy who is not a jock and who is not a nerd, the guy who gets along with everyone and respects everyone, the type of guy who you would LEAST expect from him to have suicidal thoughts...Whats funny is that I just look "Straight" meaning I'm tall and I have dark hair and I'm not flamboyant and I don't have a "gay lisp" so luckily no one ever guessed I was this way.

I Tried incredibly hard to come to terms with it for the past 2 years but no matter what I do and how hard I try I can never tell myself that its okay, I'm reminded that its not okay by EVERYONE around me and everyone surrounding me, if there was an option to change then I would take that option in a second to save my poor soul from taking this anymore, to save my mom and not give her "Shame", I desperately want to change but I KNOW its not achievable, not with this thing.

I Don't want to wait until I'm 25 (Assuming i get really good grades + graduation + funds to travel)to move to somewhere nice for people like me (Canada/America)...And then spending 3 years or so to find someone and then get married at 30, I Just cannot wait 10 years to start to find someone, I'm already having so many suicidal thoughts that I do not share with ANYONE in my real life so waiting 10 years on top of that would surely just destroy my mentality.

Oh and about talking about it with someone,i wont be ashamed to talk to a therapist and maybe even get some antidepressants but I Cant talk with a therapist due to where I live, I cannot tell him I'm gay which is the root of the problem and that leads to even more depressing nights and crying endlessly and feeling pity over my own soul... I have no one to help me here but my self and I'm already giving up on everything.

I Just really want to change but I cant.
