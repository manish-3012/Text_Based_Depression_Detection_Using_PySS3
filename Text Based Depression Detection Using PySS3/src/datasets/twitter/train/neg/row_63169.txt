HelpI have messaged on here before, and I have tried to look at the positive things in life and not let myself get dragged down by the hurt I constantly feel.
My wife cheated on me, and spent all our savings. I had to move out, leaving our rented home, my wife, and my dog  who I desperately miss. I have been under a doctor for 6 months, on medication, I see a counsellor weekly and also a psychiatrist. I have not been able to work since Christmas, because I just can't handle it emotionally. They have pretty much said I don't have a job anymore.
I am living at my brothers house, I have just enough money to get the divorce done, and that's it. I have 2 close friends who do their best, but they can't be around 24/7. I have been suicidal for about a year now, and I try so hard to tell myself things will get better. MY friends find it hard to understand how I feel, even though I have emailed them both and explained. 
I fell so alone, and I have lost everything I have worked for. I cry constantly and I really don't want to go on anymore. I know how I would end my life and when I think about it, it makes me feel so much more relaxed. 
I am at the point where I just don't even want to try and find a way out, I just want to die. The only thing stopping me right now, is how my sister would be once I am gone. She doesn't know how I have been feeling, but I can't keep putting her feelings above mine. I want to be selfish and do what I want instead of putting other people first. Is that wrong? I don't want to go on with life and all this pain just because it is what someone else wants. If one more person tells me 'it will get better' I swear I will scream. 
What is so wrong in me putting myself first?
