My s. plan involved a bike. I didn't have a bike. Next day, there's a bike by the dumpster.My goal is to die in a way that only has a positive impact on others. That means no public suicide. This means having all the stuff given away and out. This means all borrowed things (including my car) returned. To get to a distant location in a forest,  after returning the car, in order to keep my suicide private, I needed one thing this weekend: a bike. The one thing in my plan I did not have was this bike. Well, I get home from work to find a perfectly working, purple bike by my apartment's dumpster. I don't really put much thought into "signs", but wow.
