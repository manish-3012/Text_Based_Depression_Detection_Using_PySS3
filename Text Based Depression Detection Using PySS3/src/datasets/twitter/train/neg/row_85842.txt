29M, wanting to end it allSo I'm 29, turning 30 next year, and I've done absolutely nothing with my life. I'm autistic, and never had a decent job thanks to a layoff in 2015. I've tried college multiple times with this current iteration making me consider offing myself. I know that if I fail yet again, then there's nothing left -- I'll be doomed to a life of a crappy job, living paycheck to paycheck in some rundown apartment next to drug dealers and loudmouths with a roommate I despise. If there's any glimmer of hope at all, or any bright side, sure is an ugly dark picture right now, despite what everyone says about life.
