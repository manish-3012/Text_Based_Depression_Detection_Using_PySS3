I couldnâ€™t do it I just drank until I passed outIâ€™m 21 and my life is already over I love this girl so much that i literally canâ€™t think of anything else but she hates me and Iâ€™ll never talk to her again Iâ€™ve been trying to get over her but itâ€™s impossible I just wanna kill myself but Iâ€™m too much of a coward to do it and honestly I deserve to die I havenâ€™t done anything good for anyone and I have no future
