I'm killing myself todayAs a 23 year old who's never so much as held hands with the opposite sex, I'm going to use my suicide as a way to shed light on loneliness and my thoughts at this time.

My worth is dictated by three simple numbers that I just didn't meet.

My income.

My amount of sexual partners.

My height.

Nothing else can get my foot in the door. Nobody cares what your job is, only if it pays well. Nobody cares what your degree is in, only if it leads to a good paying job.

Nobody cares about you romantically until you've been initiated in a relationship once, when it's still usually two idiot kids who believe in 'true love' and personality over the shallow stuff. 

Oh well. Not up to snuff I guess. 

I'll be leaving a nice red smear on a wall today along with a novella's worth of my thoughts on how it all came to this.
