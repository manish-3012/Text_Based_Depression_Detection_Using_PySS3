1 year ago tonight I was admitted to a full lock down unit on a psych ward.I got into a relationship with a married woman and she stole my heart and ripped it out and went back to her husband. I tried to OD on my sleeping pills and got taken by my best friend to the hospital. It was the most terrifying thing that has ever happened to me but helped me greatly at the time.

If you feel you want and need help go to a hospital they will take you seriously and you will get help.

on a 2nd note:

Dont fall in love with married women. I let it ruin my life. I lost my job, my car, my PC........basicly every thing and had to return home to the UK from the US after 8 years of making it on my own all because i let myself get consumed by a person and lost sight of my self.

It still eats me every day. Im on anti-depressants and they help but I still have breakdowns. I have to keep my mind busy to keep thoughts of her out of there and I haven't seen or heard from her in 8 months yet I cant get past it.

There are times I wish I could turn my life off like a light switch.
