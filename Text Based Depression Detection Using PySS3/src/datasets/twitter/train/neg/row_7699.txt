FragileI'm at a loss. Two years roughly since my last post. Two years of ups and downs passed by. 

But here I am once more, but this time is different. 

I've fallen apart, I've crumbled, I've broke beyond any visible repair. Every ounce of my body is screaming to just fucking kill myself. But I'm desperately trying to find the strength to not go through with this. 

Yep you read correctly. 

My reason I wanna live? I've been in a relationship with someone, someone so fragile, someone so amazing, they're perfect to me. They don't see their self worth though, they have issues with alcohol, depression, anxiety, self harm, suicide stuff... How could I hurt them further with suicide? Yeah yeah... You shouldn't live for anyone else but yourself. But that's not how it always works. 

For reasons listed above, that's why I can't talk to them about being suicidal. I can't talk to anyone about it until 30th Jan (appointment with my GP). I reached breaking point the other day. I feel like my ability to hold off this dying stuff is fading. 

I'm so lost. I'm so lonely. Every voice in my head is telling me to die. 

I'd really appreciate any company and/or advice.
