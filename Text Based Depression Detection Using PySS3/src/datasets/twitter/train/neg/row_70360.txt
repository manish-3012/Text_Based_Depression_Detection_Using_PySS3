Successful but no love life.Title basically says it. I have money, hobbies, and am (in my opinion) a nice guy. The only real relationship I've had was a year ago and it lasted for a month. Tonight a girl I met on tinder blocked my number right before our first date, even though she said she would go out with me a couple days prior, with no contact since. I'm so lonely it hurts. I don't even feel like a man because I've never had sex or have relationship experience. I'm so lonely I am tired. I want to just end it already and make my sister rich from my life insurance policy.
