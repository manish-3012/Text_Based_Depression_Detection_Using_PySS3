29f trapped. Wanting to die but canâ€™t.Iâ€™m 29, female. I have two cats that are my world. And a boyfriend that needs me too much. Iâ€™m trapped in this relationship. The ONLY thing keeping me alive are my cats. Iâ€™m in therapy. And I have a group session too. Iâ€™m on medication for adhd and depression. I have a career and a decent car. My relationship is holding me back. But Iâ€™m so trapped. I want to die so bad. But I donâ€™t want to leave my cats alone. I just want to be alone. Die alone. Iâ€™m sorry. Iâ€™m sorry for being a burden. Iâ€™m sorry Iâ€™m writing this petty shit. Some of you guys have gone through way more than me and you are still going strong. I hope we all can find peace.
