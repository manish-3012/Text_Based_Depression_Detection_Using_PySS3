I just picked my friend up from the hospital after a 12-hr 5150 psychiatric hold, I think I made a mistake and am not sure what to do next.My friend tried to commit suicide last night, I will refer to this friend as Michelle. Michelle sent me texts saying she that she is dying tonight and called to say goodbye. Another friend of ours, Sabrina, received similar messages and called the cops. Michelle was then admitted to the hospital emergency room. This was around 3am last night.

The hospital called me around 7AM this morning asking me to provide "collateral". Michelle had told the hospital that she wants to be discharged and is okay to leave. She told them that she is chronically suicidal and lied saying that the suicide attempt was an accident. The hospital wanted me to verify her statements before releasing her. I said that it is true she is chronically suicidal and undergoing therapy but it is a fact that she tried to kill herself last night and I am not sure how her mental state is. The hospital said they would have psychiatry talk to Michelle. I offered to pick her up if necessary. The hospital said that would be up to Michelle and if not, they would give her a taxi slip. They also said they have her phone locked up and so she wont be able to contact me directly in the meantime.

I get a call two hours later directly from Michelle asking to pick her up. I assume she was cleared for release. I also assumed that if I didn't pick her up, the hospital would send her home by herself on a taxi.

When I get to the hospital, she is in the lobby and gets into my car.  Michelle then told me that they were not willing to release her unless someone came to get her. Sabrina also reached out to me and told me that Michelle just sent her additional messages saying that "next time I'll \[Michelle\] will be dead" and that "she \[Sabrina\] ruined her life". I told Sabrina that Michelle asked me to pick her up. Sabrina begged me not to do so and that Michelle needs to go under a 72-hr hold. But it was too late, I had already picked her up and left the hospital.

Back at my apartment, Michelle offered to Uber home and I said I was not going to let her do that. She is sleeping right now. But I am flustered and have no idea what to do once she wakes up. Sabrina thinks Michelle is still at risk. to attempt suicide again. The hospital released her under me which I think was a mistake. Do I call the hospital again and ask them to pick her up? Do I wait for Michelle to wake up and try to see how she is feeling? I don't know what to do... all I know is I am scared for my friends life. And I don't want her to be alone because I am afraid she might try again.
