My suicide attemptThis was a long time ago I can't remember what caused the breakdown it was probably something stupid but I was tired of how I was feeling. My mom had surgery years prior and she had a bunch of old pain meds she never took it was about 60 pills. I don't even think she knew she had them I take the pills,fireball whiskey, and soda and go deep into the woods because I didn't want anyone to find me. I drink the alcohol take the pills about 30 minutes later I feel total peace all the pain,worries,anxieties go way and that is the last thing I remember before passing out. I woke up the next day about 16 hours later with vomit all over and my dog laying next to me. I remember this because I chose a weekend when my mom and dad was away. I am not suicidal now but my mental illness is always there. How close did I get to the point of no return?
