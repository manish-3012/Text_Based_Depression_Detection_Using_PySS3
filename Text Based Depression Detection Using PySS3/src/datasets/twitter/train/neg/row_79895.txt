Against a wallIve always tried to appear happy and well adjusted. In reality, I've been tormented by severe anxiety and depression since I was 12. Ive considered this numerous times over and talked myself out of it with the promise that if life gets worse I'll follow through. Shits gotten really bad. I'm being blamed with the death of one of my parents and feel hollow and miserable. Tonight I'm feeling particularly depressed and feel its the only option I have left. Ive done the math and know what it will take.
