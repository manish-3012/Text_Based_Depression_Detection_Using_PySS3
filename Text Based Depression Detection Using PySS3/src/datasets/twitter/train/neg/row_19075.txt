Convince me not to kill myself tonight.The title says it all. Hereâ€™s the final letter that Iâ€™ve got: 




Final Words


Hi. I donâ€™t know what else to really say right since this is something that I thought I wouldn't write again. But if youâ€™re reading this, Iâ€™m sorry. Iâ€™m sorry for the pain that this will surely cause many. Iâ€™m sorry for failing because I wasnâ€™t trying hard enough, even though I was doing everything I could. Iâ€™m sorry to my friends because they always wanted to help me, and yet this is how Iâ€™ve repaid them. Iâ€™m sorry to my parents because I donâ€™t feel like Iâ€™ll ever really amount to anything. I just canâ€™t feel anything. At this point, Iâ€™m just an empty shell, soulless, emotionless, sad. Will this leave a hole in the family? Yes, probably. Will this make everyone who knew me inconsolably sad? Yes, and for this, I am so sorry. The last thing I wanted was to spread the pain that I felt onto others. But Iâ€™m too blind to find any other solution to this pain. Iâ€™ve heard a certain quote many times when talking to others about my feelings: â€Death is a permanent solution to a temporary problem.â€ But for some reason, I canâ€™t convince myself that it's temporary. So, Iâ€™m choosing stick with a quote that I like more: â€Iâ€™m here for a good time, not a long time.â€
