I know there's help â€” but I don't want itI know there are resources out there which can help me, but I don't want them. I want to die â€” *that* is what I want. I'm terrified that if I reach out again, someone will say something and it'll merely convince me to say, thus prolonging the pain I'm experiencing. 

I'm not sure if I want that.

I just want to leave. I'm constantly tired, sad, angry, and anxious. I will never be happy, and for some I suppose that's inevitable. I feel like I was never supposed to be born. There are accidents, and then there are mistakes. I'm the latter. 

I'm nothing but an inconvenience. People would be better off without me.
