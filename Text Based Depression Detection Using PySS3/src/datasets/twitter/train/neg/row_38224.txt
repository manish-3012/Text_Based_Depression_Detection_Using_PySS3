You Don't Have To Read ThisI'm not going to say why I want to kill myself. That leaves me open to help. I don't want help anymore. My friends find it difficult to combat my arguments for suicide now so because of how logical they are. They are my friends and they know me better than anybody but myself so I'm just going to believe that I am correct with my actions. Either way I am leaving this here for family or police or somebody to find. To know what happened to me. Mostly because my method isn't as traditional as most people. I'm grabbing one bottle of water and I'm walking into the woods. I am going to walk until I can no longer physically walk. Then I will sit in the woods and wait until i starve or die of thirst. Because if I truly want to die, I will let myself die. It will be painful but in comparison to the rest of my life, it will be nothing but a flick on the nose. The peaceful embrace should be nice. Afterlife will also be interesting. And to my family, I'm sorry about the one year of grief I will cause but I had to do this.
