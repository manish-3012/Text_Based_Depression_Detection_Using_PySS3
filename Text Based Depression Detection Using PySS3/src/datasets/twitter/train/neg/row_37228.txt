Without Her My Life is Pointless3 years ago I had had my entire life figured out, I was going to go to college and take my life shortly before graduation. I had had a childhood straight from hell full of shit that no person should ever have to go through. So I had decided that I would try to enjoy the last few years and commit suicide before the weight on my mind collapsed my ability tonfunstion entirely. 
But 2.5 years ago everything was fucking ruined by this girl that came out of no where and gave my life purpose. I have no clue why we started talking or why she made me feel so good but the 2.5 years I had her were truly happy. She taught me to love myself and to live her, she helped me cope with my mental demons and helped get rid of some entirely, despite all the times I thought she would leave because of my severe mental illness she didnt and kept encouraging me to fight them, as if my fight with them made me a warrior, made me stronger and better somehow. She promised me the rest of our lives together and I even got an engagement ring to marry her. At talk that i would have done on the eleventh which is when i should have seen her next. She made me want to live.
Just as I always predicted she left me
And replaced me within 2 weeks.
As if I never mattered to her, as if all of our time loving each other was fucking pointlessly a joke.
I attempted suicide, for the first time a few days ago and I am sad to say my body did not co operate with my mind. I just need this non stop pain to stop. For the drowning in my own mind to become easier, for something just one thing to go right or to get better and then maybe I can pull through ago. But without her, I have no reason to keep fighting, at this point I have eaten less than 100 calories a day for over 2 weeks, whether by suicide or not eventually my body will give out, I just hope it happens before my mind does... I need mercy, love, and hope that she provided.
