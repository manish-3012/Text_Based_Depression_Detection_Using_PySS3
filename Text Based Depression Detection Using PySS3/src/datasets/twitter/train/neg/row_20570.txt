i dont know.i'm not in a great position at the moment..things are dim. i know it could always be worse as they say.. that thought doesn't make it any better though.. ive had some really intense bad things happen to me at a time in my life where i was not wanting to continue and reaching out made bad people take advantage...i never thought that could happen or would happen... it put me so much further in a dark place than i ever wanted or thought i could be (and ive been in some really bad places...)  it really fucked me up.. like literally i was drugged... but anyway i just want all this bad shit to stop.. i want to live and be happy but it doesn't seem like the suns coming up anytime soon. i've cut and it frustrates me because i really don't want to hear it from anyone... and i'm not in a great position to be harming myself but i guess it truly doesn't matter so whatever i should go a little deeper next time. i have a plan. no one knows how i'm feeling. no one cares.
