My storyI'm 16 years old, ever since i was 10 i hated my life, i would think about killing myself but not in a serious way, my mom had breakouts in front of me saying that she would kill herself, and throwing shit everywere, screamming at me, i think thats why now i can't show compassion to her, i like her but i just want to get as far away from her as possible, thats why i live with my grandma and my aunt, i know my family loves me, but i can't show love to them, and seem to hate them. My best friend is rhis girl that i really love, and she really loves me but only as friends, we dated about 2 years ago and ever since then i have liked her (she knows that i like her), and for those 2 years she has made out with lots of guys, sometines she would tell me that and i just got miserable, today she told me she had a bet to make out with 10 different guys, and she made out with 5 this month some of them guys that i know, the guy she likes is a real douchebag, and even knows about the bet, i love her, i fell my happiest when i talk to her, and she is just a bitch, i can't stand this, i have liked for 2 years recently i got some hopes that she liked me, just to have them thrown away, i am miserable, i regret almost every single life choice that i made, i don't have any female friends other than that girl, the only sexual encounter that i had since her was with this ugly girl that i lost my virginity with, i regreat that soo much, when i look baxk at my life i see nothing good, i just failure and losses, i am miserable now and i cry every day, the things i loved before are just boring now, the only things that make me happy us talking to that girl and talking to my real friends, i am now addicted to tobacco i started smoking to calm myself and now i can't stop, i keep thinking today is the day i stop, but i just get depressed and end up smoking, sometimes i smoke weed or cheap hash too, my real friends are the string that holds me from ending it all, every time i leave the house i hope i get runned over by a car and everything just ends, i don't want to stop writing this, i don't to go back to miserable life i have, i have nothing to hope for, i'm not a good student, i love exercise and i'm really athletic, but im so depressed i can't even go to the gym or exercise, i don't have the motivation and will probably start crying once i get there, i want to die but i don't have the guts to do it myself, i don't know what to do, i'm scared to tell this to anyone, because i fell like i can't trust anyone, i never thought this would happen, i can't take much more of this, theres is a shotgun that belong to my grandfather before he died, i just need shells and i can end it all, i'm so ashamed of myself for letting things get to this point, i love a total bitch, my life is full of bad decisions and regreats, i hate my family, nothing makes me happy anymore, and the only thing that keeps me away from doing it are my friends who have no idea i'm like this
