Unemployed and socially isolated...againI'm 26M, and I just want the pain to end.

I spent nearly a year after I got out of college being unemployed and isolated. The shame of my situation just led me to be even more isolated, and I couldn't see a way out. Finally I found a job at a gas station and then at an office. I thought I was out of the woods there, but my depression returned. I hated the job to the core with the constant repetition. I felt like I was doing everything I could to stay afloat, but I sunk while trying to learn a new procedure there. They gave me a written warning after I kept getting it wrong. I spent a month stressed out about it every second of the day and was constantly thinking about how to get it right, yet I still managed to make enough small mistakes that they fired me in the end.

I was glad to be out of there at first, but it sunk in what a crappy person I am. I feel like I am completely unemployable now. Every application I submit specifically asks why I was fired, and I've gotten only two interviews in two months. Rejection harms me so badly that I can't bring myself to even submit any more. I've given up, and I'm going to be homeless because of it. I have no friends and I'm alone in the world. I don't see why I shouldn't just end it. I can't go live with my parents again. I couldn't survive a night there with the pain and stagnation that my old bedroom there represents.

I am a complete failure at life. I'm a shell of the person I once was, I feel like I'm always just helplessly observing myself from the outside. I can't go on like this. I need to find a way to end the pain.
