I'm 21 and so hollow and emptyI'm 21, unemployed, no school, dumped from a 3 year relationship last month. I moved to another state with my family a year ago when my dad was relocated for work because I couldn't afford to stay in where I was. My anxiety and depression has already been overwhelming the past few years, but it got to a point I had to quit my stupid job at Subway because I was constantly dissosiating and couldn't stop myself from going to the bathroom to self harm over and over again. It got to a point that my mom wanted me to quit and get help. I'm trying, I've spoken to a few doctors and counselors and tried some medication but nothing helps. Every time I go outside or around people I dissociate and have to claw my skin to stay present. My boyfriend lived in my last state and made no effort to visit me ever even though I visited so often. We were together for 3 years, last month he dumped me because he said he doesn't think he ever loved me. I left him twice because he was rude to me, but he always begged me to stay before this. I've had time to reflect, and realized for 3 years that guy was using me as a person to vent to and an emotional crutch for when other things in his life went bad. I've never had anyone love me. My friends all live in another state. I've lived here for a year and haven't been able to make a single connection because I can't go outside without dissosiating and clawing my arm. I can't hold a job because of this. I can't focus on anything for more than a few seconds, so I can't go to school. I'm so alone, I'm so empty, it feels like I wasn't meant to be alive. I can't live this way, I feel consumed by my anxiety and depression and ADD. I text the crisis hotline and don't feel any help. I vent to my family and online and nothing helps. I've become so pathetic. I'm so fucking empty and hollow. I hate myself for not having the guts to kill myself so far. Its all I want I want my life to end.
