I don't know what to do anymoreI've gotten myself in the worst situation and everything in my life is falling apart. 

My family was foreclosed out of our home in August 2014 and since then my father, brother, and sister moved to a different state, and my mom, special needs brother, and I have been hotel hopping since. I'm a senior in high school that hasn't attended school since October. After the foreclosure it became really hard for me to get up in the morning and get myself to school. I got into a bad habit of ditching and now I am basically accepting the fact that I'm a drop out. I want to transfer to a continuation school but my mom doesn't know how to go about doing that. Since I'm not 18 yet I can't do it myself. Recently my work permit expired so I need to get a new one if I want to continue working at my job, but there's no way in hell my school will sign it off since I haven't attended for months now. 

I feel like I've lost everything I care about. I have no motivation to fix myself. I'm stuck with this shitty life that isn't going to get better. I want out. I don't want to live anymore. But I'm too much of a coward to kill myself. At least right now. I can't stand living like this anymore. I'm constantly fucking up with relationships and in school/work. What do you do with yourself when you are absolutely worthless? 

I'm sorry for the bad formatting. I'm just trying to get this off my chest.
