I need fucking help.If this is the wrong place, please tell me. I don't want to hear transphobic shit and decide to actually kill myself

I am a 14 year old trans girl. (I am awful with explaining shit, so I'll probably be making a lot of references to help explain) 

I fucking hate myself. I'm too afraid to actually be myself. 

I used to self harm, but I was able to stop myself. I'm afraid if this gets too bad and I start again, I wont be able to stop. 


When I actually think of killing myself I feel guilty and hate myself more. It would make me feel like a fucking coward, and my family doesn't deserve to have me kill myself.

Sorry if this is all over the place, I'm just too fucking upset rightnow. Please help.
