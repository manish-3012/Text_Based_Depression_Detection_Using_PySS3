I think this is my last weekI have been struggling in University for two years now after I transferred colleges.  It wasn't my idea, it was my parents. I hate living out here and no matter how hard I try or what I do, I always end up getting like 50% on tests and quizzes, even if I do everything right. I'm tired of wasting money and I'm tired of waking up and doing this shit day in and day out. 

In other news; my (ex) gf fucked some dude over the summer, the only other girl that has ever shown interest in me curved me and won't talk to me anymore, and I just want to kill myself. 

I'm going on vacation with my brother this weekend and after that I'm done and I'm going to end it. Because it's not worth it anymore. Whatever is waiting on the other side is worth more than this.
