Donâ€™t really care because Iâ€™m already dead insideIâ€™m purposely going to change how I normally text since I donâ€™t want anyone knowing who I truly am. Let me just make this perfectly clear. I deserve to die. A horrible death. I deserve all the pain and suffering that ive gone through. Itâ€™s ok. I want to harm myself but I donâ€™t for my parents and friends. I sleep late everyday because itâ€™s just something I canâ€™t control. It seems like my time is running out. As is the case
For everyone else but I feel a weird connection to certain people. I want to make others happy. Even if it hurts me or kills me. I donâ€™t want approval or pity. I just want to do this because it makes me happy. I used to love doing certain things because they made me happy and not hate the world. Would any of you ever just erase all your thoughts and become numb? Not entirely healthy but it did help. Sleeping. Working. Resting. Whatever the case, itâ€™s not ideal to be suicidal and trying to function.
