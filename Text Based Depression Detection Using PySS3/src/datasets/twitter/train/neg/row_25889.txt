assisted suicideHello,

I suffer from paranoid schizophrenia and have been on and off medication, through counseling, and have tried to remedy my situation for the last decade without much improvement. I am seeking advice as to how I would go about traveling to a country with liberal views on doctor assisted suicide, and how I would apply for this. Any help is appreciated. Thank you.
