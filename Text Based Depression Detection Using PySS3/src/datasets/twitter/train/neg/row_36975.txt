Today a friend and neighbor took his life 11 years ago..I was only 10, you were 15 we were just neighbors. We would always play on the road with our brothers and sisters, sports, race cars, everything. I used to look outside and see you and my brother waiting for the bus to come. But eleven years ago everything changed. I walked downstairs to see Crown Victorians outside your house, my father on the phone with someone from the fire department and hearing him say "he's gone? Who?". It was then I learned the pain you carried with you, and the pain you left behind. You left a note with a thumb print from your brothers shoe shine explaining this was no ones fault, you just felt unexplainable pain day to day. In Some ways I was pained, and some ways I could relate. I can still relate, but what I can't relate to is the pain you left behind in your family. I looked outside the window and saw my brother standing alone for the bus- it was then the realization of how permanent death is hit me. i used to look at your picture when you were younger at how old you looked, and now seeing it for the first time in ten years- you were a fucking baby, a kid, a teen. I wish I could hit you, I always wished that- where was your sense? Now I just hope you found some sort of peace, peace your family will never find.

I wish anyone on this thread would please, please hold on to a shred of hope and seek help. Please, if you're here you've already taken a step- that's hope. Please say something. 

This is my open letter to my friend, and to anyone else who suffers


Edit: I just wanna post one more thing... Your sister texted me this today
"It's been 11 years and nothing has changed. Hurts the same everyday. Whoever says time heals all is 400% wrong"
