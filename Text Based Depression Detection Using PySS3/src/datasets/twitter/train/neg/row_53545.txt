what about the children?How do you put on a happy face and show children it will all be alright when you know it wont? How do you show them that they will grow up happy and prosperous when you know life will tear them apart on the way? How do you set them up to idolize you, want to be you, when your own childhood idol killed himself? How do you show them that it will be different for them? 

Im a swim instructor for young children and showing them a smile hours after learning the guy I wanted to be, one of my childhood idols, had committed suicide was almost impossible. This guy was someone I probably had 3 conversations with in my entire life, he was a quite man. When I was a young swimmer the swim team was a hard place, full of cliques and hatred for everyone that wasent on of them. Micheal was popular, people loved him, he was a fast runner and an amazing swimmer. He was everything I wanted to be. Now I never really knew him. It wasent my fault that he died, but I do wish he knew the impact he had on my life. I didnt talk to him enough to know, or stop it. Nobody did. He pushed everyone away. He was a solitary guy. 

The point of this is, no matter how little impact you think you have, you made a big one on somebodies life. I was a nobody to him. Think about his friends. If he had such a big impact on a nobody than he had huge impacts on his friends. Every one will miss him. I will miss him. Someone will miss you. No matter how little you knew them, you've made an impact on their lives. You matter.
