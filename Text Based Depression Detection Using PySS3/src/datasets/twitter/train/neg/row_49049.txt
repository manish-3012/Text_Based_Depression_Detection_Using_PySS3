What is the point?"If the grave is mans only aspiration and guarantee, then life is a bleak path with little to recommend it. Wherefor this brief season of breath milady? What reason compels us to live?"

There is no real meaning to life, no grand scheme or master plan. Any attempt to give life meaning is artificial, a delusion to persuade us to endure the pain on our march to the grave. The reasons to continue living given by other people are utterly unconvincing. Love is nothing but a fabrication, nothing more than hormones attempting to clue us in to the fact that we desire sex, and sex while it delivers pleasant physical sensations is far to much work for the minuscule reword it brings. There is even less utility gained from maintaining platonic relationships. Relationships of any kind are a bother, and there is little consequence for not having them. You may argue that the utility gained from these kinds of relationships are people we can rely upon, but in reality people are highly unreliable making the trust we put in others dangerously misplaced. perhaps you believe in a calling, a job that can only be preformed by a specific person, but we are replaceable in every aspect, there is always someone else who can do it. What point is there in having dreams, we will most likely never achieve them, and even if we do it will never satisfy us. Money is only a reward if you view it as one, and I often find myself wondering why I get up for work in the morning, the money doesn't make me happy neither does the material things it buys, and the work definitely doesn't. Maybe life is about experiences? All sensations in this world are dull and utterly meaningless. In the end it is pointless, and I can no longer find any reason to continue living.
