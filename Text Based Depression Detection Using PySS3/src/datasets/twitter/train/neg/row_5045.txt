Feels- personal poetry from a broken heart.He stripped away my self worth, 
Layer by layer until even my bones held no trace of my personality. 
I lost sight of the girl I used to be, she was caged in my chest and he swallowed the key as I stood there and watched. 
The problem was that I wanted to be loved so badly that I couldnâ€™t tell that it wasnâ€™t love. 
You taught me love was you draining me of my identity, injecting self doubt into my veins, brainwashing me into thinking everything was my fault and that I was messed up. 
You let me think love was questioning my own sanity, walking around aimlessly. 
Love to me was rubbing your heavy words off of my skin and making my mental state fall to the floor. 
The taste of your â€œloveâ€ lingered in my heart and tore me apart.
Iâ€™d tell myself â€œI can fix himâ€ but he has been rusted for too long and can no longer be fixed. 
Donâ€™t be the lamb he sacrifices, drinking your blood like water. 
Donâ€™t be the martyr to his self hate and loathing. 
Donâ€™t save him by destroying yourself.
Donâ€™t let him say sorry over and over again like that same old song ....
