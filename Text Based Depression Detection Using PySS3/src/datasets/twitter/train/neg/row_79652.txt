I don't have a good reason to liveMy wife is divorcing me. I never had much to live for, but I had her. Our marriage has been toxic though. Screaming matches and hurtful words.

So, what do I have to live for now? Nothing really. I'm not interested in life, I'm not looking forward to anything.

I've been in individual therapy for years, I've tried tons of different medications. My wife and I were even in couples therapy until our therapist told us he couldn't help us.

I just don't feel like I belong anywhere. Maybe now's a good time to die.
