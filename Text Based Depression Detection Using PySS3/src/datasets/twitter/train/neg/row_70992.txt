Iâ€™m scaredThereâ€™s so many emotions going on in my head right now and I have no idea what to do, at time I want to leave the house and hang out with people and then just as Iâ€™m getting ready to go I feel this wave of apathy hit me.

I donâ€™t know what to do, I feel so lost. I have so many people there for me but do they even fucking care? Does anyone? Cause from all that Iâ€™ve seen no one gives a fuck about me, not anymore

If no one cares about me then why should I care? Do I even have worth? If my own family sees me as filth then what does the world see me as? 

If we all donâ€™t have a purpose whatâ€™s the point in trying to work for it? If this is the one life we live how come weâ€™re striving for something better when their is nothing after. Whatâ€™s the point in slaving yourself when after all that time you become lost from the world? 

Iâ€™m not scared of death because itâ€™s inevitable, we all meet it, we all die. But Iâ€™m scared of losing everyone. I donâ€™t want to lose anyone anymore. So Iâ€™ll just die before I can, beat them to the punch I guess.

I hope life starts taking a turn for the bestI cause if it continues at this rate, Iâ€™m not gonna be around for much longer.
