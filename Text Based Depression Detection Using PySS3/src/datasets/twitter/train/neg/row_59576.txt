Need constructive feedback and tips.I highlighted what I believe to be crucial information for a faster read.

I have to give a little backstory first, **my buddy [20M] and me [18M]** were strolling around town at about 19:30, it was quite dark outside since we live in Sweden when we spotted **a girl [18] sitting on the sidewalk** just looking at cars which we thought was pretty strange so I asked my buddy if we should go see if she was OK and both agreed to do it.

When we walked up to her I asked her if everything was alright and she replied in a sad voice that everything was fine, which it obviously wasn't since she had **cut marks** ALL over her hands. We sat down next to her and spoke to her a bit trying to find out if she wanted to talk about why she was sitting there or just walk with us around town but she didn't, we also asked her if she wanted us to keep her company for a while or just leave but we didn't get much of a reply so we sat down next to her just talking about random stuff hoping to lighten up the mood and get her to talk to us but it didn't work that well, we managed to find out her name and age though and that she had **dropped out of school** in 2011. After a while she stood up and said she had to leave and we said our goodbyes and she left. At this point we didn't want to follow her and continued our stroll.

Help me understand what might have been going through her head and what we could have done differently to possibly have a better outcome than she just walking away!

Did I fuck up?

P.S. I might add more or clear things up in edits.
