lolthink that my friends are better off without me i made a promise with one that we wouldnâ€™t kill ourself unless the other one did which kept me alive i guess but now it seems they have moved on and i could kill my self and it wouldnâ€™t even matter i donâ€™t know how long i can keep doing what i do at night i canâ€™t stop thinking about why iâ€™m alone and why iâ€™m watching all my friends move forward in life and iâ€™m not doing anything they seems to all be doing better than me in anything they do i always end up messing up everything iâ€™m around all the people iâ€™m around iâ€™m tired of being a cause for anger or annoyance and iâ€™m sure theyâ€™re tired of hearing from me.
