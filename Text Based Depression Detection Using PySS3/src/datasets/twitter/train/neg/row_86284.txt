SelfishI'm so fucking selfish I miss my girlfriend I havent seen her in months because of lock down and she just told me shes not coming back till July (she went to see her parents just before we went into whole country lockdown) and now that we have gone into lvl 2 she can come back but shes decide to stay up their and get a job and earn some money for us to go flatting next year but I'm angry because we arent going to have our 1 year together and ik it's not much and people are having it much worse then I am but she's my main supporter for everything I do and not having her with me feels like I've lost everything I cant seem to stay happy and I have gotten back into self harm it was stupid of me to rely on someone so much in the first place but shes been the most supportive girlfriend i have ever had but i feel like she doesn't understand what I'm going through because shes in her safe/comfortable place with her parents and everything's glitter and rainbows while yes i may be boarding with my mum at this moment but i havent lived with my mum for years I've spent the last 5ish with my father while finishing school I'm 18 and I've almost completed my scuba diving trainer diploma but I'm not even happy about going back to that next week because I just feels so depressed and empty without her, her course is starting back up in july which is one of the reasons she gave me about not coming back now but I dont understand why she cant do all this down here with me I feel like she doesn't understand how I feel at all but then again I'm being a selfish asshole because shes going to be working to help us for a bond....but now she wont even end up spending that money on that as shes having to sell and buy a new car since her current one has put itself to sleep..... main thing of all of this is I cant get happy without her I'm being too needy and I know it but I just cant do things without her I wanted nothing more than for us to spend our 1 year together but shes choosing not to and tbh I dont think it really bothers her at all so why is it that I'm the only one suffering I feel like that throughout my life I've had nothing but bad luck and any time anything's started to get good it gets pulled out from underneath me I hate the way I am so much
