Whatâ€™s the point?I feel like after years of trying and hearing people say things will get better it just gets you down more. Iâ€™m at the point where I wouldnâ€™t feel guilt for ending my life, just tired of it all. Whatâ€™s the point of trying when everyday youâ€™re fighting with the thoughts of just ending it? Itâ€™s not living. I worry about the future everyday, what I wanna do with my life, how am I gonna get by with bills etc and in a selfish way I feel itâ€™s because I feel forced to endure the shitty pain of living everyday just to keep other people happy.i could end all the worrying by being selfish and doing what I wanna do for once
