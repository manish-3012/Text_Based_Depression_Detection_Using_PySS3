I can't do thisOn the 9th I'm going to be going back to college to start level 2 of my course, I failed level 1 but my tutor put a word saying I'd be good at level 2 so they let it slip. I feel under so much pressure to do good I feel like I can't slip up on anything I feel so unbelievably stressed and anxious I dint want to do this. I've already paid for the course I can't back out now there's no refunds I can't do this I feel like I'm just going to fail again if I fail I'll dissapoint everyone even more I can't stop thinking about this it's driving me insane I just want to die. Somehow but that'd be selfish of me I can't do that is what I've always been told.
