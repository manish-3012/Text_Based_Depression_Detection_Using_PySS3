If I end up having to get rid of my dog, I'm gonna end it.He is, quite literally, the last thing I feel any deep emotional connection to. At all. I have had an emotionally dead reaction to literally everyone in my life for months now. My best friend left and he was one of the few strings of emotional connection I had hanging. All my other friends live far away and really only talk to me for League of Legends. And now my family, once again, is trying to convince me to get rid of my dog and calling me manipulative when I bring up that doing that will literally destroy me inside. I will have lost everything. A good job, my best friend and rock, my dog. And at that point I'm just gonna leave. Whether or not it's by suicide or just literally catching a train across the country. I'm done.
