doneSo at GCSE last year I got 1 A*, 5 As and 3 Bs.
I just did the first year of a-level and my results were 
U - maths
U - biology
A - art
I quit alevel chemistry about a week before the exam.

next year I'm predicted 
C - maths
D - biology
A/A* -art

that's it. I've failed. I'm useless. I revised tirelessly for hours and my teachers think i didn't revise one bit. it's not just failure but failure after trying my very best. my teachers and parents are SO disappointed.

I'm in a sixth form that I earned a scholarship into as well. they must regret their choice SO much. was suicidal anyway but this is really the icing on the cake.
