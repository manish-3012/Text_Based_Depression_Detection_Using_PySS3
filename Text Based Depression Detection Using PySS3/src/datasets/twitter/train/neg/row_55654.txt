I think my fiancÃ© dumped me and my mother is abusiveBye from me it can't go worse. 

With my fiance we argued and we supposedly had to marry in a week or so but we delayed. I guess I shoud be happy because he unblocked me after he calmed down. He still talks to me after he got mad but his last message is from 5 a.m and he hasn't texted more. 
We fought over fiancial matter. Yeah we were LDR but we really clicked. 

My mother is narcissist and she is abusive and controlling.  She also isolated me atm so I can't run away. She is asshole that only cares about herself

I am 19 and tired. Do you think my bf dumped me?
