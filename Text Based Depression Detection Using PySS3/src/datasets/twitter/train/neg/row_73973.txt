Thinking about doing it for sureI've been depressed for years, always been in my mind and I've had no reason why, then someone came into my life and my world changed in an instant, and then recently that person left, and now my world has changed back to how it was, I'm giving myself until January and then I'm killing myself if things don't get better, already have things planned and everything, hell, might do it sooner than that tbh
