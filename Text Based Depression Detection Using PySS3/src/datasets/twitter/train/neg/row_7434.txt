I'm going to hang myself in my closet.Tonight. I've been suffering from some sort auto immune Neuro logical disorder for about 10 months now. Doctors can't figure it out or don't care or believe me. I am 27. I used to be athletic and outgoing and hard working . I have been laying in a room for 5 months pretty much in constant pain and discomfort. I have no more options. I am a recovering drug addict. I live in an Oxford house 6 states or so away from any family. I am unable to work or do anything due to symptoms. I will br homeless on the street soon and I wouldn't be able to handle that in this condition. Its not fsir2 for my parents yo have to deal with my shit or try to pay my rent just for me to be in this desperate helpless state. I caused enough damage and pain for years amd years on and off drugs. May be this health shit is karmas payment plan. I just wonder what happens when I stop breathing and go. I am very scared. I love people and animals and life. This versiom of it is unbearable. 

Goodbye.
