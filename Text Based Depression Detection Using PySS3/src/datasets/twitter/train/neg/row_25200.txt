Itâ€™s coming back and this feeling hurts so badI was suicidal previously but the past four years brought me immense joy. University was challenging and amazing. Volunteering gave me a purpose. Traveling was fun. Everything was going right.

Lately though, itâ€™s creeping back. I canâ€™t seem to shake this endless pessimism. I see the way that capitalism works (like we all do). I see how money has eroded politics. Itâ€™s all a race to the bottom and endless competition is making it a fierce fight to undercut the world.

Iâ€™m scared about the future. I donâ€™t think  weâ€™re ready to tackle these global problems.

And personally, I have been in a bad rut lately. I lost my job and finding a career in my field is proving to be near impossible. Money isnâ€™t tight but itâ€™s not great. I feel trapped and impossible to live out my dream of owning a home and a coffee shop. Iâ€™m so ambitious and goal oriented but I donâ€™t see how I can possibly ever lead the life I want.

I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s left for me. I was happy and now Iâ€™m shaken. But itâ€™s only getting worse. Iâ€™m constantly anxious about anything and afraid Iâ€™ll amount to nothing and the more effort I put in wonâ€™t even be worth it. I donâ€™t see the point anymore. Iâ€™m losing my enthusiasm. Iâ€™m losing any happiness I once had. And Iâ€™m afraid Iâ€™m just burdening other people by sharing my endless pessimism.
