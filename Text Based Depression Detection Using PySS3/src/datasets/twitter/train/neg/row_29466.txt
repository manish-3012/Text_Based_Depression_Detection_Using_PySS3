I have suicidal thoughts at least once a dayFor a while. Even when I'm not depressed. The thought "I want to kill myself" routinely pops in my head on a daily basis, sometimes multiple times a day. Almost like a craving. Seemingly nothing makes me happy. I'm one of those empathic, dependent people who need another person in order to feel like they have fulfillment in their life. It usually is the only thing that takes my mind off death, but unfortunately people tend to not want to be around me
