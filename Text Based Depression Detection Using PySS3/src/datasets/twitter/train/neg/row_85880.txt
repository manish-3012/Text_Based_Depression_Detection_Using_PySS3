Iâ€™m not importantThis probably just going to be a rant but whatever. Iâ€™ve been through some shit Iâ€™m not talking light â€œooo I want to die cause he didnâ€™t like meâ€ kind of shit. I mean fuckn abused physically and emotionally type of shit. Iâ€™m not trying to play down any one elseâ€™s struggles but if you come at me with I know what ur going through and Iâ€™ve been down that road.  You have no fuckn idea whatâ€™s itâ€™s like for me on a daily fuckn basis to live and keep living. Iâ€™m just saying you donâ€™t know what Iâ€™ve seen in my life, you havenâ€™t walked in my shoes.  Also I know a lot of people have it worse than me.  

But anyways what I was going to rant about is I take meds for ptsd depression anxiety and some other health stuff.  My mother thinks those pills solve everything in my life, like Iâ€™m going to be the happy kid I was when I was little, like Iâ€™m good, Iâ€™m okay. Sometimes yeah I am happy but it doesnâ€™t last long. Those pills are only to keep my emotions a bit more balanced and even. So Iâ€™m not going to kill or snap at someone every 5 secs. She doesnâ€™t seem to understand that I can be depressed or wanting to kill myself when Iâ€™m on my pills.  Itâ€™s not some miracle drug that fixes all the problems.  I can be mad or upset when Iâ€™m on them.  Every time I get upset she comes at me like â€œdid you take your pills.â€ Mom can you just stop. I told you again and again that I can be un happy when Iâ€™m on my pills   But no she doesnâ€™t get it. Tbh Iâ€™ve never really been completely honest about how I feel with my mom. Whenever Iâ€™ve tried she just starts crying and saying â€œIâ€™m so sorry, itâ€™s my faultâ€ like not everything is about you   Yes you did do some of the shut that got me fucked up in the head but itâ€™s not all about you.  Iâ€™ve comforted you more times then I can count because your do much of a baby do go ask for help.  And right now Iâ€™m stuck Iâ€™m quarantined with her.  Hey I get along with my mom just okay but she doesnâ€™t know when to shut up.  

Speaking of which this self isolation shit has for me really really fucked up.  I like to be alone sometimes and have me time but i canâ€™t be stuck inside all the fuckn time.  With nothing to fuckn do other then just listening to my mother bark out chores or go on my phone.   All my so called friends arenâ€™t answering me oh correction they do answer just donâ€™t want to keep the conversation going.  But hey I have no idea if they are mad at me or not cause they wonâ€™t fuckn talk to me so fuck that am I right. You know this whole self isolation bull shit has taught me a old lesson that I forgot. Donâ€™t give a shit about anyone. Just donâ€™t care.  Be alone itâ€™s much easier this way. They donâ€™t care about you.  You try and reach out but you get nothing so fuck them. I used to live by this and Iâ€™m going to be honest I was much happier then before now  so I think Iâ€™m just going to shut them out again.  Iâ€™m not someoneâ€™s fuckn toy where you can just throw me where ever you want.  Remember kids. You are the only one you can count on in this world to get your shit done and take care of you. 

So end of rant conclusion is that I want to die and I hate everyone. Also if you made it this far and want to hit me up for a chat then just do it.  As much of the last paragraph makes me sound like an asshole, I can be a okay person to talk with.
