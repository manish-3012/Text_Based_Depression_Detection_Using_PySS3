Can some one pretend like they love me so I know what it's like before I end it?10+ years of sexual abuse 
Life full of neglect
Sexually abusive boyfriends 
Constant yelling and gaslighting
Surrounded by narcissism 
Living with some one I met from reddit
You guessed it. He abuses me AND my cat too :D
Dissosiate and depersonalization nearly 24/7
Nightmares nightly reliving everything 

I don't know what love is. I can't be homeless and I can hardly work these online jobs that don't even equal to part time. I tried to get disability for PTSD but just got accused of lying. SOMEHOW my medical records weren't found despite me sending them four times. 

I can't any more. I just want to feel love once before I go.
