Detached Further From EveryoneWas working on a drawing today, decided to ask a girl working at a counter of a place I've gathered the courage to sit near since COVID forced me from my last spot. Told her I could really use a friend and wondered if she would like to go see a movie. Her response was, "I'm sorry I'm very busy, I don't mean to reject you." Feeling downtrodden, "I told her don't worry about it, I'm used to it." and walked away. Later, I overhear two girls talking nearby while I'm working on my drawing. I'm fighting so hard to keep going these days, and I'm fighting myself to face ONE... MORE.... rejection. I gather enough fight and get up, so fucked in the head. I walk over to them and say, "Pardon me, I'm sorry to bother you." I pause, trying so hard not to cry. "I know this is going to seem awkward, but I could really use a friend and was wondering if either of you would like to go see a movie." They paused for a moment and one of them says, "Uhhh, how about no.". As I tell them "Sorry" and turn away. The other one says, "I hope you find someone.".

None of you out there will reach, even when I'm throwing it in your faces. NONE OF YOU

I sat down and put as much focus as I could into my drawing, so beaten down and tired. I couldn't finish the drawing after a few hours. I left.

I don't feel fucking human. I can't fucking feel anything beyond the pain of depression. It's getting worse, and I'm losing the will to go out there.
