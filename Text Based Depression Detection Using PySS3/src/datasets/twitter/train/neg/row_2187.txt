Chronic prostatitis, chronic balanoposthitis, very small dick and suicideItâ€™s over. Iâ€™m 27 and I want to die every day I cry every day. I try not think about my problems but I donâ€™t succeed in it. My chronic pelvic pain syndrome is killing me and my loneliness and realization that my dick doesnâ€™t developed normally.  I canâ€™t cope with it anymore. Iâ€™ve been thinking about suicide for a very long time. I went to lots of doctors and used antidepressants, benzodiazepines etc and nothing helped me.  I think the most simple method for me is to swallow amytriptiline with diazepam. I canâ€™t find barbiturates in Russia.
