I don't want to go on anymoreFucking acne, you know? I'm 27, and have never had a boyfriend. Everyone at work I get along with, but I'm seriously weird. My body is shaped awkwardly. My hair can't be tamed. And ugh. Acne. I'm tired of these beautiful girls complaining about "breaking out".0 when they have ONE pimple. I've been to the dermo since I was 20, been on accutance, the works, it just isn't going. I'm stuck with this hideous figure and face. My entire life just screams baggage! I don't want to go on. I have no reason.
