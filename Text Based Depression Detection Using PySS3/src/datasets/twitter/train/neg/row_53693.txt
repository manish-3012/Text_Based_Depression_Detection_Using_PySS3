I donâ€™t know what to do anymore.Iâ€™m a depressed twenty year old man with autism and I donâ€™t want to live anymore. 

I go to a private school for adults with autism to learn about how to be a productive member of society. We have therapists here, but if I tell them Iâ€™m suicidal Iâ€™ll get kicked out.

I tried getting a ESA two weeks ago, I brought it here and the staff had complete fits about it and threatened to send the dog to the pound if I kept it. So I gave it back to the owners. And then they threatened to kick me out about that.
The few hours I had it were the best Iâ€™ve felt in years. Ever since then my mental health has been declining rapidly. 

I donâ€™t know what to do anymore.
