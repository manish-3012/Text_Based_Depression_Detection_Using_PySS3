I just want the pain to stopI am afraid of dying. But I have been suicidal since i was a kid. I am 19 now and have done most things in my power to improve my situation and it some ways "it has". But I am so tired I am so lonely I want the pain to go away, I can't even call a damn suicide hotline because there isnt one in my country
