Terrible hotline servicesThe therapist I go to right now belittles me and demonizes me. Suicide hotlines only end up hurting me more.  
One woman said a hurtful statment and when I confronted her about it she decided to calmly shut the phone in my face.  
Another man would dismiss the conversation without my consent, and I confronted them about it at least two times (I just asked why they do that, and they would say they have nothing to say and that I did not give enough details despite having giving them every possible detail). At one point they repeated their pleasantry goodbye and shut the phone in my face. It was not even a heated conversation, it was rather very calm and they just disrespectfully shut the phone in my face. I would expect more from an open hotline, and I do not care if they volunteer. It's their choice to volunteer, they probably have valid reason to open up a suicide hotline and I do not deserve to get such maltreatment just because they are considered "volunteers". I almost wanted to commit suicide after those calls
