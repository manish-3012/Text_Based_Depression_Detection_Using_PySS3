The nightmares won't stop. I need somebody to listen.It started two years ago when I was 14. It started out small, they'd end quick and they weren't that bad compared to the ones I get now. But then it started to grow and they became more vivid by the day. They went from once a week to everyday. I tried keeping my self awake but I'd eventually get drowsy and fall asleep. 
Since, that wasn't working I tried coffee. I'd drink two cups of coffee every night. This stopped the nightmares but I never got any sleep which made me either very drowsy in the morning and I never got any work done or it made me very very hyperactive. This scared me, so I stopped drinking coffee, but the insomnia didn't. I barely ever got any sleep but of some how I did, the nightmares were always there. There is one in particular, it always started with me tied to a  chair, I'd be surrounded by dead bodies and blood and carcass and the stench would be  incredibly unbearable. Seconds later the lady would appear, she didn't have a form but she had the sweetest voice. She'd start whispering my worst fears into my ears while slowly ripping away parts of my body. I try really hard to wake up but it never worked. I'd only wake up once she's through with me. 

This messed me up really bad and I fell into depression. I started hallucinating. I used to see visions and hallucinations in broad daylight.  I tried telling my mum but she said that "it was all in my head" and that I shouldnt be afraid of a couple of nightmares. I tried telling my friends but they think I'm crying for attention. No one believes me. I'd rather die that have to deal with it again. I'm afraid to go to bed. I'm terrified of closing my eyes. I want to end it.
