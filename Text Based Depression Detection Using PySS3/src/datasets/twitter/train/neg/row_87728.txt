Not sure what to do.Two days ago I logged on to gmail at a shared work computer and my associate didn't log off. I wasn't snooping but before I logged her off the word suicide caught my eye. The title of the email was "My Suicide." She sent it to herself. 

I feel bad for looking at her private email but I know a little of her history and that she has been in a recovery program for at least 6 months. I also know she's had a few challenges lately. 

The email seemed to be a letter to family stating why she will do this and apologies to some people. 

I'm not sure how to approach this or if I even should. I just don't want somebody to hurt their self if they just need some help or someone to talk to. 

Just not sure what to do.
