I am so lonely.I have a husband who loves me but we're never intimate.  My coworkers are nice to me &amp; tell me I'm awesome at my job, but never invite me out to lunch with them.  I don't want to keep playing these games; other humans are so cruel, especially the ones who are supposed to love you.  I just want someone to talk to who doesn't treat me like I'm an idiot.  I don't understand why I can't just be happy and ignore all this crap.  I don't want to live like this anymore.
