I hate my lifeWhere do I even begin. When I was 6 years old my parents got divorced and they didn't tell me what was happening. Up until I was 12 I was physically and mentally abused by my dad. I remember that there where times when I would hide in the closet because I was scared of him. I have told my mom about my depression but she doesn't seem to care. I have tried therapists but they just make me see how shitty my life is. I have tried calling suicide hotline but they hung up on me. I am not new to suicide I have tried and failed 10 times now all ranging from hanging, drowning,refusing to breath, and overdosing on sleep pills. I'm 14 right now and hope to go home and take handfuls of every pill I can find then maybe take laundry detergent. And if that doesn't work I plan on stealing a gun. I'm gonna doing today because today is Valintines day and I hope it send a message to my parents on how horrible they are as parents. Hope I die a painless death today.
