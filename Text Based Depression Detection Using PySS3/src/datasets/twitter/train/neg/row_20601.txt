Why am I even bothering to write this when I should just do itI've come to terms that I'm never going to amount to anything in life. The only major accomplishment I did was graduate high school and get my driver's license (At age 23). I'm 25, still in college basically in limbo from graduating, I have no fucking idea what my plan for life is. Anything I have even the slightest passion in doesn't make enough money or is so common that millions if not billions of people do it already. 

The only thing stopping me are my family and friends and even then I'm starting to wonder if they truly see me as a friend or only befriended me out of pity or guilt. Same with family. It's me against the world and I can't take it, I'm a god damned freak of nature. I tried not to use that word but I think it's obvious God made me as proof even He can make mistakes. I'd have more success as a cum stain on someone's mattress.
