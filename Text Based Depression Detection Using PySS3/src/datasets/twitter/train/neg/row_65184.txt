Dating is literally impossible for me and I want to dieI'm a younger (22) nonbinary person who just inherently is not conventionally attractive... or inconventially attractive. I'm in a Canada which is just distanced hell. No people. The people who are here are more likely to want me dead than want me. 

Did I mention that I've never had any relationship, sexual or otherwise, and have no desire for sex? Reading any post about sex difficulties makes me want to eat lead. You'll never get that from me.

So what am I supposed to even do? By my decent fair estimates, my dating pool is about 200 people. That takes account of location.

Everybody tells me to focus on myself. Fuck off. I can't wait any longer. This isn't a desire from expectations, it's from total loneliness that none of you could ever understand. It makes me want to bash my skull in in the most painful way I can.

I have tried everything that isn't ridiculous. I have made no progress. I don't think anything will ever work out for me. And I can't be alone. Every wish and desire I have in life involves other people, from living somewhere nice and adopting older kids to just having somebody be there for me always. And everybody attacks me for this. I get called an incel regularly. That's about sex. I have no desire for sex. At most I resent people who receive intimacy so easily when the idea of ever finding anything is so slim that I'm seriously considering suicide over waiting and getting worse and worse until I'm feral.
