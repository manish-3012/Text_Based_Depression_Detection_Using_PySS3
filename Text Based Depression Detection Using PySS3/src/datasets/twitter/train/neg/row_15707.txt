Suicidal but not sadIn some of my previous attempts I cried or wrote notes you know. But now whenever I'm suicidal it's completely emotionless. Almost cold. Like those thoughts became so routine I stopped thinking they were bad. I'm not sure if this is a good thing or not because I think I'll just do it and have nothing to stop me.
