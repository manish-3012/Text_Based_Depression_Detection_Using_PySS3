I hate myselfI hate myself. Iâ€™ve disliked myself for a very long time, but recently Iâ€™ve come to realise I hate myself. But itâ€™s not just my appearance I hate, I hate my personality so much too. I canâ€™t see myself ever fitting in anywhere bc I feel so inferior to everyone and everything, Iâ€™ve tried to work on myself recently but all that taught me is that no matter how much I change, Iâ€™ll never stop hating myself bc I hate everything about myself and the only way to stop hating myself is to be someone else. I just want to die bc Iâ€™ll never be happy, Iâ€™ve been miserable as long as I can remember, but recently Iâ€™ve just been an anxious wreck. I wake up worrying, I go to sleep worrying, I even worry in my sleep, and even when Iâ€™m not directly thinking about something that worries me, I have this underlying gut wrenching anxiety. I feel like this whole time I didnâ€™t realise how much of a freak I am, but suddenly Iâ€™ve realised, and this realisation has hit me so hard. I feel so different to everyone else, but I just want to be normal. I feel like everyone else got an instruction manual to life, but I never got one. No one likes me, people just pretend bc they have to, but they canâ€™t wait to get rid of me. Itâ€™s okay, I canâ€™t wait to get rid of me too.
