Iâ€™m aliveI came so close. So so close. They didnâ€™t think I was going to make it through the first 24 hours, yet here I am 3 days on. As soon as Iâ€™m medically stable Iâ€™m being transferred to a psych ward for review and theyâ€™ll decide where I go from there. Thank you to everyone who commented and sent me messages, it really means a lot. Guess itâ€™s time to give this life thing another go.
