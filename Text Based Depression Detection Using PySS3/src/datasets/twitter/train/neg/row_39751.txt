Need outside opinions pleaseI currently live on my own in one of my father's condos. I just moved to this town, so I have no contacts/friends here. Been living rent free for a couple months until I get on my feet (you know how it goes with the ups and downs). The problem is I got in an argument with him and he took my wallet with all my money and my license/any identification I have. He also took my prescription medication. This was 4 days ago and he has been ignoring my calls since. I called the police and he said he can't/really shouldn't do anything because I will be evicted. So right now I have no money, and no food.. since all my cash was taken. I'm feeling really suicidal and have been putting a garbage bag over my head and chain smoking joints until I get the balls to do it. I attempted suicide twice last year.. and was admitted both times. I've just never admitted myself voluntarily.. and I'm scared that if I do I'll be in there a while.

Any outside opinions would be great... to be honest half of me wants to admit myself just so I can eat and get my prescriptions..
