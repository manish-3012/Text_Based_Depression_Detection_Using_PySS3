The world is going to hell and there's nothing we can do to stop it.Let's face it. This is getting ridiculous. Soon no one will be safe, we'll be all dragged out on the streets, raped and beheaded if we keep getting attacked. Europe has never been in that much danger ever since WW2.

The more attacks happen, the more I'm getting paranoid. I can't take this anymore. I'd rather shoot myself now than live and fight in an imminent World War 3.

Everything is on thin line. This is going to be like Middle Ages again, where everyone will break peace and will fight over territory. Once again all the values we've built over the past decades will have gone to hell. All the minorities will be pushed out to be shot or tortured for being who they are.

I am fucking scared. I don't want to live in a Mad Max like universe.
