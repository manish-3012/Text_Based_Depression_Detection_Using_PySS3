What can I do?Two of my closest friends are both suicidal and I feel like there's absolutely nothing I can do about it. They have both openly admitted to their situations so I suppose that's a good sign, but neither of them ever want to talk about it or if they do it's only ever "I'm so sad" or "I hate myself". I've told them both over and over how much I love them and that I'm there for them, and they say that they trust me but nothing ever seems to come of it. One, who is more open, is actually diagnosed with clinical depression and is on medication prescribed by her doctor, but it doesn't seem to helping her at all. The other is rather reserved and never wants to talk about what's going on with her. I just want to help, but I feel so useless. These are supposed to be my best friends and I can't do anything for them. I can't force them to talk to me, and I can only ever see them once or twice a week. So, for those of you who are experienced with this type of stuff, can I please get some advise?
