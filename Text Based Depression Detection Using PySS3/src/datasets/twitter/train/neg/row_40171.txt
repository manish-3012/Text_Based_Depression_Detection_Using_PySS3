Losing hope and reaching my breaking pointI really feel like a person can only take so much stress before they reach their breaking point. And I feel like Iâ€™ve been trying to go through life and pretend everything is fine but I feel like Iâ€™ve finally reached my breaking point. 

I do have a mood disorder as well as severe anxiety. I have actually had a mental healthcare provider tell me, after seeing me for awhile, that she doesnâ€™t understand how I function with the level of anxiety that I have. I donâ€™t either. 

I also have physical health issues now. Iâ€™m sick almost all the time and sometimes will be up until 1 or 2am just waiting for the pain to subside so I can sleep. 

I started dating someone who makes me so happy about six months ago and our relationship has been amazing but now all of a sudden it feels like these hard issues are arising. Weâ€™re both overwhelmed and struggling so I feel like I canâ€™t lean on him for support anymore. 

And the icing on the cake was starting family therapy with my family. Which felt like being gaslighted for 45 minutes. But now Iâ€™m sitting here questioning everything and wondering if theyâ€™re right and Iâ€™m just too dramatic and Iâ€™m just ruining everything around me for no reason. 

I feel so alone, and I feel so pain all the time. I felt like I really made so much progress lately in overcoming things and now, I just feel like Iâ€™m right back where I started. I feel like Iâ€™m not worth anything. I just want it all to stop sometimes
