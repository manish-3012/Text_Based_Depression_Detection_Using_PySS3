My family hates me, told me things would be better if I wasn't around.Hey reddit, this is my first time posting on here and I donâ€™t really know what to accomplish with this post. But I feel like I just need help. Iâ€™m 23 years old still in college and I am not a good student. Iâ€™m held back about one year from graduation and I just found out I failed my summer class. My parents and my brothers hate me right now and called me a disgrace to the family. They compare me to my cousins who are also my age and in professional schools. They think I have a disability cause Iâ€™m a bad student, I donâ€™t. I failed this class because I sent a classmate a project and he didnâ€™t change up the answers, he submitted it as it is and I got fucked for it. I really wish I could make my family proud like my cousins have for theirs. But I feel like my parents are right, I am a failure, Iâ€™m good for nothing, I donâ€™t even have a job. My life is going nowhere. I just donâ€™t know what to do, I want my life to just stop. I donâ€™t want to cause anymore stress to my family cause theyâ€™re already going through a lot. My mom even said I would just be better off dead or away from the family for a very long time because they cannot even stand the sight of me. She even went as far as to say that if she died from stress, it would be all my fault and her death would be on my hands. They think I donâ€™t care about anyone or anything because I always seem â€œrelaxedâ€ but what they donâ€™t see is the nights I stay up until 4 in the morning thinking how much a failure of I am and how I know Iâ€™m a disgrace. I do care, I do want a good future, I do want to make my family proud. But I feel as if nothing can be done for me. All hope is lost for me. My family will probably be better off without me around, or maybe if Iâ€™m just not around at all. Iâ€™m at the bottom with 50 meters of shit on top of me. Anyway, I hope anyone whoâ€™s reading this has a good day.
