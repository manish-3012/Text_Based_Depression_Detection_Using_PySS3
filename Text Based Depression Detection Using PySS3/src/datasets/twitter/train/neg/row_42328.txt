I don't think i'm gonna do anything, but I need to get something off my chestI've been struggling with severe depression for the last couple of years. It's not anything in particular that I'm down about, it's just a struggle for me. I'm 25, over the last few years I lost a grandma, my parents divorced, my brother got cancer, I was made redundant twice. just feels like i'm getting kicked in the dick by life on a daily basis and its really ground me down to a pretty dull point. Thing is, I've thought about suicide quite a lot, again, due to the struggle of getting through each day, not because i'm sad about anything in particular. The way I think about it is that I'd totally end my life if it wasn't for my family. I know how much it would upset them, especially having seen how everybody dealt with my brother's diagnosis, I'm just not selfish enough to put them through that. sometimes though I get angry with them, they don't know it, but I feel like I'm going through hell everyday for them and they don't even realise it. I feel like i'm trying to convince myself they deserve the punishment or something but they really don't. Sorry to ramble, I wanted to tell someone this but I don't really have anyone to talk to.
