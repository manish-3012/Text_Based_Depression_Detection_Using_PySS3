these thingsThere are all these things, I don't think it would matter. There is this thing I read that anyone would help, I don't think they would. 

Everything seems too difficult, I have been out of a job for a while, I tried to make hip hop beats, they aren't good. I tried to be a pianter no one likes my paintings, I feel like I'm annoying. I really feel like I don't have any friends who I can turn to. I get a friend every so often but I have a lot of emotional baggage so distance starts it doesn't work out.

I apply to jobs and it is hard, I feel like I dont have the social skills it is difficult for me. it is hard for me to feel at ease in the company of other people, I otherwise feel a sense of aloneness. 

I have family but I feel distant from me. My grandmother is dying that is hard from me. I have difficulty with my interactions with them, I feel really embarssed around them, for who I am and deeply ashamed of who I am. I have difficulty accepting my sexuality, I have never been in any relationship with anyone, I grew up in a real conservative Christian family this is real hard for me, I came out, but it is very hard for me to talk to other guys. It is real hard for me to be out to others still. I feel really scared of going outside. Things effect me a lot. Things stick in my mind a lot.
