My life is about to crash.I'm expecting legal difficulties soon. I got myself involved in something I shouldn't have, and I'd prefer to leave it at that. I am 1 year out from my bachelor's in engineering and I know for sure this is going to get me expelled. I'll be labeled a felon and never be allowed to work anywhere real, let alone finish my education.

It'll humiliate both me and my parents. If it weren't for them and Zoloft, I'd be long gone. But I now see suicide as a way to get out of this. I have long wanted to die, this seems like the time.

I'm not sure what I expect out of this, but if it weren't against the rules, I fully expect you'd agree with me.
