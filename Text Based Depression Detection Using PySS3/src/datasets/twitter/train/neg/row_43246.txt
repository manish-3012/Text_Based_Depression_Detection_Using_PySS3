Living to See Another BirthdayIn 2 weeks, I turn 20. That's never been the plan.
I've had depression since I was 12. A special brand called dysthymia that keeps you down all the time and kicks you sometimes when it feels like it. My oldest sister and my uncle had it too. They're both gone now. DPDR and an anxiety disorder starting around the same time. Anorexia joined the party last Aug.
What do I have to look forward to? My next 2 semester of university are the ones where everyone drops out. My co-ops/internships are dead ends and I don't think the job I want actually exists. Long distance has killed my closest friendships.
No strings. Shit future. Chronic illness and disability.

I've had the rope around my neck before. Why not just commit to the final step? I stopped wanting to be here over 6 years ago. Or better yet, starve to death. Proof in the end, I was in control.
