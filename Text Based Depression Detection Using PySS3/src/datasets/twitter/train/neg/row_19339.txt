The best thing I ever did was break up with my bf. I took him back the next day. I'm so weakIt's all in the title. Im terrified of being alone and we've been together for years. I cant let go. He texted me a lot and cried so we met up to talk and then it was good for a few weeks but now it's almost back to where we were before. I hate myself
