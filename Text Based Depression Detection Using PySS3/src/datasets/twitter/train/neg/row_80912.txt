I'm done. I'm going to start planning.My art fucking sucks

Everyone I looked up to either died, became a jerk, or got revealed as a pedophile/predator

I am constantly mocked by other people

People compare their depression to mine and say "You don't nearly go through enough pain that I do!"

My friends moved on and are happier without me

I'm obnoxious and annoying to everyone who gets to know me, but weird and creepy to everyone who doesnt know me

My first job literally lasted 2 fucking days because people kept telling me that I would fail, and I also had a crackhead run at me full speed

My cats could be in a much better home right now and actually have daily vet appointments 

I rarely shower, about twice a month because of how disgusting our restroom and living situation is

My parents could be retired and not be divorced if it wasnt for me

I am constantly told to kill myself because I'm a furry 

I cant get anything done 

I hadn't had any joy in life since 2018

I hadn't got over the fact my BF of 5 years broke up with me because I was annoying and obnoxious 

I have a massive overbite and eat weirdly, small heart and overheat easily, have Lazy Eye and vision blurs out a lot, and I cant stay on track on anything for the life of me

I only want pain and suffering in other people, I got so tired of being nice and giving people everything when I was younger

I cant fucking improve on anything I do

What the actual fuck is wrong with me. I cant do anything fucking right and I try to be funny so other people like me but I'm so god damn fucking stupid and ugly I cant so fucking shit right and the only thing I'm good for is begging my father for money and making my mother cry. I'm a literal fucking scum of the earth and deserve to rott in hell.
