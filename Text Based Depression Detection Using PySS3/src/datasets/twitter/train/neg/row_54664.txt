My life is falling apartMy life is falling apart, Iâ€™m 21 years old with no school or college qualifications. Havenâ€™t been working in almost a year, no Jobs get back to me. Resorted to selling ketamine to get by, which has made me become an addict to ketamine. Iâ€™m falling behind so hard, no girlfriend, feel like this is the beginning of the end, has anyone else been / overcome this kind of situation? Iâ€™d like some help please because this post is literally last resort.
