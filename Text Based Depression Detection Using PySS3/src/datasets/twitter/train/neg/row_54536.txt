I'm not doing well, and no one here caresI can't blame any of you. I mean, obviously I'm not really in a position to judge others who don't care about my mental health and physical safety - my life is full of intentionally triggering myself and committing various self-abusive acts. I just feel that I need someone else to care because I can't make myself give a shit, and I definitely don't want to worry or scare anyone I actually know. In my mind, that leaves the internet for me to turn to.

I get that I can't make random strangers on the internet care about my life when all I do is bitch about how I feel, but my last post here I was in a really bad place, basically crisis mode, and literally no one answered. I'm still here, obviously, but I am so angry with myself and ... I don't even know what/who else ... that I've gotten to a place where I hate myself more than ever and I'm relying on randos to give me a sliver of hope or self-worth to drag on in this stupid life. I had the perfect chance today to slit my wrists in the bathtub, and I definitely came close. I cut. A lot. And no one noticed. I feel like I'm stuck in a never-ending loop of: A) wanting to be left alone to suffer without anyone noticing, B) wanting to come clean to everyone about how I feel, and C) wanting to get to a place so bad that anyone who sees me knows something is wrong.

I don't want anyone's pity. I know that this post sounds abrasive and that's not entirely my intention, but I really am angry with myself and at least a little bit with this sub. I don't want any touchy-feely B.S. - that will just make me feel lied to - but I would appreciate if just one person could read this stupid rant and understand why I feel so frustrated. If you've read this far, thanks. I appreciate you.
