I am badly considering trying suicide againHi, 
As I said in the title, I really am thinking about committing suicide. I feel so stupid and helpless. All I want is for someone to love me, but the person I really like is so far away. It kills me to see her sad and to not be able to tell her how fucking sad I am. I don't want to make her worse, I don't want to burden her. I wish I could just disappear away from all the pain. I don't know what to do
