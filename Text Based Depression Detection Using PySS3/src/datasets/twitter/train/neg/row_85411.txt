I have imagined my suicide for years. And I feel that now it's finally time.For my entire life I have been depressed and had suicidal thoughts.  
I have had to realize I will never be loved and will never be able to have a relationship.  
I dont believe in God or heaven. But I sure wish I did, so I wouldnt have the thought of facing eternal darkness alone. My best friend and love took her life back when I was 16 and I couldnt stop her. If there is a God or heaven I sure hope she is waiting for me.  


Thanks to a guy I know im getting a potent poison that will make it look like I had a heart attack so that people around me will think it was because of natural causes. I plan on being alone when I do it and eventually someone will find me.  
Im afraid of dying alone. Im afraid of being alive and having to face all the pain. Everyday I wake up I feel sad and just want to cry. I hide it though, nobody can know or else I will ruin their happiness.

If anyone of you happen to live in Southern Sweden and feel like supporting a broken man in his last hour then please let me know. I dont want to be alone, but I also dont want to be around anyone I care about when I die because I cant face their eyes.  


I made this post just because I needed to vent my thoughts before I go.
