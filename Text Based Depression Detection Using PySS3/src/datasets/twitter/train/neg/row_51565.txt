I have nothing in my life that brings me joy. The last time I remember feeling true happiness was when I was 13. I am 20 years old now.I want to die. I am alone. The woman I loved has been gone for a long time now. I have no one I can truly consider a friend. No family. 

I can't tell anyone how I feel. When I had started opening up about how I felt to the woman I loved, she slowly drifted away. I always knew that showing any weakness causes women to drift away, but I thought she would be different. I really hoped.

But that hope is gone. I will end myself sooner or later. I just haven't gotten the courage yet, but I hope that comes soon. As I interact with more women, get close and intimate with them I realise they truly don't want an emotionally broken man, for me to continue their sexual attraction to me I have to continue the facade of being a strong, impenetrable man. I can't handle this truth. It pains me. 

I am truly alone and lonely. All hours of the day are spent by myself. I just think to myself.
