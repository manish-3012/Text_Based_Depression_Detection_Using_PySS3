Talk about suicide, but friends think it's a joke.For a while now I have talked about suicide, but like majority or all my friends think in joking. Like yeah in just going to kill myself by 25 and a buddy of mine said yeah same, but your ahead of me. Or tonight somehow we got on the subject of having a suicide packed and some of the guys were like yeah I will join jokingly.

I know people know I'm fucked, but I guess they think im joking. I guess when I finally do it. Friends will just laugh about it and won't care.
