I need to get better. I need this venom out of my system.My name is Kirann. I live with my parents, twin sister, and older brother. I am 16 years old and am a junior.

I feel useless. I shouldnt be but I do. I just feel like dead weight to everyone my family my friends and my girlfriend. I'm not really popular at my school, not like my sister.

Sometimes, I just have that impulse to end it. Just a few steps onto the road, off the cliff I walk past, cut deeper and let it bleed out.

But I dont want to hurt her. Brooke doesn't deserve it. She doesnt deserve to be hurt no one around me does. Especially because of my stupid decisions and thoughts. She's my Brooke. Shes been there for me ever since we got together. She knows that I cant stop cutting but she makes sure she's there so that I'm okay and do it as safely as is possible.

I've already seen how much my self loathing hurts her. I've seen her breakdown and start crying because of what I do to myself. And I dont want to do this to her anymore.
