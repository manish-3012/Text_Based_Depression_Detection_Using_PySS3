no way outlast night my only remaining friend told me that my emotions were emotionally manipulative, and pretty much confirmed my fears that my depression is destroying everyone around me - even those i've been close to for decades. i hurt them, i hurt everyone i know. the only people who care are hurt regardless of whether or not i'm alive or dead. there's nowhere safe for me anymore, and even if i tried to find someplace else, i'd just ruin everything there and hurt all the "friends" i tried to make. i'd be better off dead. the world would be a better place. why can't i do it?
