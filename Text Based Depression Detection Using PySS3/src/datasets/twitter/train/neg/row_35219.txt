My partner broke up with me yesterday. Need some serious help right now. Please. AnybodyI'm 33 and don't know what to do with myself now. She broke up with me yesterday and I found out that whilst I was away with work she spent the night with this other man. She was at his house and they slept in the same bed but apparently nothing happened, although it seems hard to believe two people with mutual attraction for each other would sleep in the same bed naked and do nothing.

I'm going out of my mind. I've had two hours sleep. I was crying all day yesterday and immediately when I woke up without her. I begged her not to do this but she said she doesn't feel the same anymore.

I have never felt so low. And all I can think of is her with this other guy who, at one point in the past I caught her sending flirty messages and arranging to meet up with.

I feel like my life is over. I want to end this pain so bad. Please any help or advice? Right now I just want to die or something. I'm losing it completely
