I just want to go homeI moved about a year ago to a foreign country. I gave up my job and friends and family to move here. I made an effort to intergrate but I have never felt more isolated and homesick, I have no network out here aside from my husband.

 One by one my friends just stopped contacting me, and now I just seem to have a bunch of phone numbers of strangers; and even looking through my wedding photos from a few years ago is heartbreaking, I thought we were all so close. 

I think even if I did move back home, it would be just as cold. Everyone was glad to see the back of me, and that's why they dont stay in contact. 

My heart's broken and I just want to go home. I just want the pain to stop. I dont want to have the memories of these people I know and love in my head anymore. 

I want non of it to have happened. If i dont exist then it wont have happened. I want to not be scared of afraid anymore of doing it, its been holding me back for years and I just want to close my eyes and not wake up.
