Ready for death.My whole life has been psychological manipulation and deceit from others.



Imagine thisâ€¦ So a few years ago I worked at The UPS Store and I was harassed in many different ways; sexually, threatened by the manager up close and proclaimed he wanted to punch me in the face, told by another co-worker they didn't like white people (I am white). Yes, I reported all that to corporate twice and nothing happened, nothing changed.


  
Being an individual who grew up with lots of abuse and neglect this adds to previous trauma and leaves me confused as to why nothing is changing. Over and over the evil plagues my life. 



Stay strong and move on, okay----
So I went to work for FedEx. I was there about 8 months when I decided to put in my two weeks because I was leaving Chicago, but I ended up fracturing my tooth which prolonged my employment to about a month. They had well over a two weeks notice ~CHECK THIS~ I moved and applied to the FedEx in the new location and found out I was put as non-rehirable for not giving a notice! WHAT? So I contacted corporate. The day that you write your resignation letter is the day that counts for the start of your two week notice. My letter was written 3 days short of the two weeks. I wrote it the day the manager asked me to. 



TREATED like shit two jobs in a row now (actually way more than that, Iâ€™m cutting things short). Time to be strong, well guess what- I just got fired from a job that was my only income for my new apartment right on my 90th day.



 I am a very kind and articulate person- ugly is the world. 
&amp;nbsp;
Iâ€™m ready for death.



**The abuse is never ending, no options for a better job, poverty, no tools to make the art I want to make. My existence is a waste of time.** 



The more I think about it
The more beautiful it seems
The ultimate decision 
I want to see all of my *blood*
