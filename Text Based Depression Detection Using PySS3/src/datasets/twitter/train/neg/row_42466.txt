I wish I didnt have to hurt the people around meI wish I could erase their memories of me. I just want to die. I'm in too much pain. In and out of hospital for suicidal thoughts. It wont go away. I've been in therapy and on meds since I was like... 12. It wont go away. I dont HAVE hope left. I dont WANT to be alive anymore. I dont WANT to try. I'm only alive because I saw how much it hurt my family and friends after my first attempt. I just feel even more guilty.
