I just want someone to listen to me, to understand.I got drunk again the other night and tried to kill myself again. The cops took me to the Hospital and then they called my Mom, who I hate being around. She didnâ€™t want me to go to inpatient again. So I lied to the doctor even though I need help. It was so hard, lying to him...but my Mom obviously didnâ€™t want me to go back...Iâ€™m so tired. Iâ€™m so tired of feeling this way, of being let down. Iâ€™m such a disappointment. Iâ€™m such a fuck up. Iâ€™m only 16 but I feel like my life has already gone off the deep end. I wish I could be happy, like my Mom wants me to. Like everyone wants me to be. But I just canâ€™t. Iâ€™m going into 11th grade and Iâ€™m so fucking terrified. Everything is a constant anxiety attack. I canâ€™t deal with it. I donâ€™t want anyone to tell me â€œYouâ€™ll be fine!â€ Or â€œKeep your head up!â€ All I want is someone to say, â€œThis really sucks, Iâ€™m sorry youâ€™re dealing with this.â€ But Iâ€™m too afraid to tell the people around me how I feel. I just want someone to listen to me. To be willing to understand a little. But instead I end up bottling it up and taking it out on myself. At least I have an appointment with my Doctor and Therapist on Tuesday. I just need something to help me. I wonder if they can give minors electro shock therapy because nothing helps and maybe thatâ€™s a lay resort. Everything sucks. I wish I could hit the reset button. I think suicide is the only way out for me. But I donâ€™t wanna give up on everyone around me, it would ruin my little brothers. But I donâ€™t know how else to stop the pain besides drugs and alcohol (which Iâ€™m no longer allowed to have) and killing myself. Maybe Iâ€™ll just distract myself. Maybe I will be okay. But right now I just need someone to help...to talk to. Iâ€™m sorry this is so long I just have a lot on my mind. I donâ€™t even believe in God but if you do pray for me because idk how Iâ€™m gonna get through this shit.
