I'm so tiredPeople don't care. They act like they do until your problems become a burden to them, then you're left alone and broken again and it's not fucking fair. You just sit in self loathing agony going through hypothetical situations in your head until the possibilities wear you out and leave you emotionless. It's not fair that I lost myself so young. It's not fair that my mother abandons us for weekends while she goes to Reno or Vegas and wastes my disabled brother's Social Security checks on gambling and drugs, money that is supposed to be paying for our food, our clothes, our rent. I can't grow up in a town where I am the only person who even knows what abject poverty feels like. My family is fucked up beyond repair by drugs and poor life decisions, it feels like I was predestined to this outcome. Hell, I'm pretty sure I'm the only one who even graduated high school. I'm now stuck in a position where I have no money, no friends, I'm extremely self conscious about my poor male physique brought on by the 4 nights a week I go to sleep hungry and alone, and the pain of waking up every day to this life surpasses that tenfold. I do nothing all day except master the art of escapism. I've developed severe anxiety of even basic social interaction, and I just want to end it all. Why was I born into this nightmare? And why would she choose to bring not one, but *two* children into this shithole? 

I have no appetite anymore, I think my body just trained itself like this over the years. I'm living for my brother at this point, because I can't fucking stand by and let this happen to another kid. it's not fair. I deserved better but I won't get it so at least he will. I swear I had dreams but they've replaced themselves with fear. I don't know what I'm doing anymore I want to die but I can't. If you read this then just don't ignore your kids.
