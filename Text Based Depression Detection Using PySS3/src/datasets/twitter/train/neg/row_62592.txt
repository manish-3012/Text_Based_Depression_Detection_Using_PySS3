My life is a messIâ€™m in the first year of a university that I decided to do ignoring my parentâ€™s suggestions that wanted me to do an university for joining their office. Now Iâ€™m 6 month in the university and I really donâ€™t like it. Iâ€™m depressed cause my cousin is paralyzed for his whole life because he had an accident and cause my parents wanted me to be the best and have spend a lot on my education but right now I have done 0 exams. I show them some fake exams results cause Iâ€™m scared of how they will react if they know the truth. Now Iâ€™m trying to join the army to change my life but Iâ€™m scared of the â€œmental test â€œ. If I would not enter I donâ€™t know whatever do instead of throwing myself down to a building. Iâ€™m scared because I know that I could do it without thinking too much if I lose the last thing that are denying my suicide. Right now I think that I would never do it ( right now ) Because I love my parents and I would never hurt them like this, but if the know that I faked the exams they will be angry and I would lost my last things that is blocking me from do it. I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m writing this I just want to tell my story cause I have no one to talk with.
