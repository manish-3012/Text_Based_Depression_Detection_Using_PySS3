Help, I don't want to keep going on this way...So, I just...sort of re-broke up with my girlfriend.  But that's not even the problem.  The problem is that I've been a waste of space for years now.  The problem is that I can't get my emotions together.  I'm conflicted, confused and messed up beyond repair.   I don't want to do this anymore...I don't want to live here anymore...

I can't stop making mistakes, big ones....

I feel like such an asshole... I shouldn't be this fucked up...I don't deserve to feel this way...
