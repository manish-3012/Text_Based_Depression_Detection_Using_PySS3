Funny cause I'm not even that sad tonight but I know tonight is the night I have to do itI just know that tomorrow I'll wake up again not wanting to be alive I feel like it's the right time right now. I am home with my best friend my buddy my dog and I can just drift off peacefully without causing too much turmoil I'm sorry I love everyone who has helped me and have acknowledged me and treated me well I am so sorry
