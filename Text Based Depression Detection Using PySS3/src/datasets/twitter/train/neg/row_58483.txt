Should I kill me self?I always seem to make a mistake. I know it doesnâ€™t seem bad but Iâ€™m a piece of shit when I drink I get violent towards my family for no reason. I want to take my life because I always wake up with bits and pieces of recollection of what I did. Iâ€™m thankful I always have someone to hold me in my place but the things I do are never forgiven. Please help me......
My life isnâ€™t bad either I own a house, I have a career, and Iâ€™m engaged to someone who loves me dearly but Iâ€™m just a piece of shit.
