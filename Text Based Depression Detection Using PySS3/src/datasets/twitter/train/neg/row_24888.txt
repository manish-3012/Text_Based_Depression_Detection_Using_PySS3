I am the embodiment of failureI just got fired from a job that most people would kill to have, and it's the second time it's happened. I am the very embodiment of failure.

I keep self-sabotaging myself. All my life people have told me how intelligent I am and how successful I'm going to be/should be. But I keep losing jobs and wrecking opportunities because I'm just so fucking screwed up I can't let myself be successful.

The people in my life whom I love, my parents, my SO...I just can't continue being an enormous disappoint to them anymore. I look in the mirror and my head is just filled with thoughts about how I am a waste of carbon and oxygen.

I want to die. I am wasting the life I have, and ceasing to exist is the only thing I deserve.
