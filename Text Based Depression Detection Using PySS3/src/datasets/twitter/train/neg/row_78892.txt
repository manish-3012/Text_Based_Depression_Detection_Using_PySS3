ventNovember is when I no longer have any obligations to be alive anymore.

Is it weird to pick a date to kill yourself?

I'm in a wedding in October for my best friend, so it can't be before then. 

I have a list of things I want to do before I end it. Or I guess rather if I accomplished those things maybe I won't want to end it 

I don't know, I've been depressed since I was a child. I don't know if I have an actual personality or interests

All my friends are in another state moving on with their lives, my family too. I feel...not real, like I'm not a person 

I used to be able to work through it, but now I'm crying at work in the bathroom when I should be in my classroom teaching

my guilt used to be the only thing keeping me here but now I don't know if that's enough 

if anything in my life will be enough or if I'll ever be enough 

Idk November is a ways away, but that date is in my head

I guess I won't kill myself before then, I need to at least try and claw my way out of this
