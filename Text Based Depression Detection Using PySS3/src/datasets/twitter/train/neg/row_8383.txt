I don't know what to do or where to goI have always suffered from depression. And over the last so many years I have developed some extreme anxiety. With the help of my boyfriend I still am barely able to work and don't make nearly enough money to come close to supporting myself. Because of my anxiety I am a SpongeBob driver and have not been able to get my licence after 7 failed behind the wheel tests. 

I am pretty hard on myself. I understand that these are my problems but I don't know how to deal with them or fix them. I have already failed at ending my life three times in the past.

My boyfriend supports me financially. I feel like a burden and try my best to help even though its not enough. I wait on him and do my best to ask for nothing but a monthly visit to see my family and a ride to the grocery store. I used to walk but we no longer live close enough and since I live in a more rural the buses are not ideal for running errands. I do all of the cooking and cleaning and until several weeks ago never really said no. 

I understand that this is allot for him to deal with and not fair to him and we fight over it all the time. He has anger problems and every week he tells me to leave or get better. I am on a waiting list to see a Psychiatrist but I don't know what else to do. He likes to call me Crazy all the time and treats me like a child and belittles me sometimes he hurts a bit. I would like to leave sometimes but I do not know how or where I would go. I lost all of my friends when I moved away several years ago and the ones I am in contact with are not in a position to help me out.  

I love my family and like to think they love me too. But they have made it very clear that I am not welcomed there, they tell me every time I come to visit. Besides they were very abusive in every way and I would not see that as anything better then I have now. 

I only really see suicide as the one way out right now.
