Iï¸ donâ€™t want to kill my self but Iï¸ donâ€™t want to live either and not being able to do either makes me sadderEvery time Iï¸ think about killing myself Iï¸ think of my grandma getting a call or someone telling her that Iâ€™m dead and Iï¸ killed myself. And Iâ€™m so scared whatâ€™s gonna stop me after she dies. Iï¸ just donâ€™t understand how some people can be happy and not want to fade from existence. Iï¸ just know some many bad things are my fault and Iï¸ stress and disappoint my parents so much. But my grandma keeps me from ending it and Iï¸ donâ€™t want to know whatâ€™s gonna happen in ten or fifteen years
