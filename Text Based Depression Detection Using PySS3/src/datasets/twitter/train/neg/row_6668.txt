Why not?I have nothing to live for. I am sad and miserable all the time and do not enjoy life. I fail at everything, like college and jobs. So why bother living a sad and hard life. What does it matter, so others can say every life matters. It doesnt! Idk why others cant just let people die when there is an off chance that things will get better
