-my ex threatened to call police because i wanted to kill myself... i vent to her almost everyday, she should KNOW how bad my life is from everything I tell her, and yet she wants to force me to stay in this cruel, unfair world. I deleted her last night, because I was venting and she said "here we go again" like... that's really insensitive and she claims "hell" is torture and "who would want to get tortured rather than staying alive" I GO THROUGH TORTURE ON A DAILY BASIS. WHATS THE DIFFERENCE? Also, i think when you die NOTHING happens. You feel nothing, see nothing, PEACE. JUST NOTHING. I think I'm done with her for good because every time I vent it always turns into an argument and she makes it about herself. I want it all to end, i'm tired of humans and life
