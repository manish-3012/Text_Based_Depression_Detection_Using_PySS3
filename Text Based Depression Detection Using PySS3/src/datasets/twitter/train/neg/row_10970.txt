I feel like a waste of space that has no futureThanks to my depression and laziness, I was not able to attend school for 2 years. Now, my important exams (GCSES here) are over and I haven't even been given an option to try the year over. I've tried learning german using Duolingo, but as it turns out whatever I learn just goes over my head and I forget everything. I feel like an idiot who has no future. I honestly wish I could just grow the balls to take my own life so I don't have to suffer or anyone else. I can't see a good future for me and I just want my miserable life to be over. It just feels like my family is just dismissing it and it hurts me.
