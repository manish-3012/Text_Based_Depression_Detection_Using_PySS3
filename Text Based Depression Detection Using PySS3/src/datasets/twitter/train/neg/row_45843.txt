I'll kill myself tomorrow.I have no friends. I'm unable to pay attention to anything that doesn't interest me which makes it impossible to perform well in school. I can't do anything productive and waste all my time needlessly scrolling through the internet. I have no genuine interests and spend all my time in front of a computer. I've "struggled" with severe social anxiety for years now and it has not only caused me to isolate myself from society but also been very detrimental to my mental health and I dread waking up everyday because of it. I'm extremely depressed and see myself as the most disgusting, pathetic, incompetent and worthless excuse of a human being to have ever walked this planet. I think of the world as a colorless place and spend hours daydreaming of what it would be like to live in a fictional world full of adventure and such. Not a day goes by without me thinking that I'd be better off dead and today my useless self has finally decided. I'll commit suicide tomorrow. I'll head deep into the forest and then hang myself. I've thought about killing myself before, but I never had the courage to and the thought of how devastated my family would be was just too much. I tried to change but I'm just not strong enough. I'm so exhausted. I just want to be free of this endless suffering.
