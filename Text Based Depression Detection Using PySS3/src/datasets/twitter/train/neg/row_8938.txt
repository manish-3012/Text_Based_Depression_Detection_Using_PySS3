How to help my fianceMy fiance was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes a week before his 18th birthday. He is now almost 21 and was extremely bad at taking care of his diabetes. Now he already has neuropathy and severe stomach cramps and I have just caught him choking himself. I don't know what to do or say since the damage to his nerves is permanent and won't get better. The rest of his life he will have to deal with the pain and I don't know what to say to comfort him. I'm so afraid that he might end his life because the pain will not be getting better. Please any advice is welcome I just don't know what to do at this point.
