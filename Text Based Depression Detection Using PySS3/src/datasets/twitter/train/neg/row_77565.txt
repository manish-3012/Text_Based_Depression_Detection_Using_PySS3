The ironyMost people looking at my life would say that Iâ€™m talking crazy , I have a good job, no debt, very decent money and Iâ€™m healthy. Atractive - not being arogant just trying to be honest - and independent. Had yet another failed relationship and no matter how I try to make it work it fails . People think I have it easy but Iâ€™m so tired now. I want to go. Never told anyone about it as no one looking at my life would imagine for a second what Iâ€™m going through
