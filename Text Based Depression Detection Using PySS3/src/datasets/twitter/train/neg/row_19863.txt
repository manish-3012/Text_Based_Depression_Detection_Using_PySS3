I am 16 and hate myself so much. I have very little friends, an introvert, never had a girlfriend, been bullied a lot and rejected a lot. Please help meHello I am 16 years old and I want to kill myself. It would make all this go away. I don't deserve to be on this earth since I can't make friends due to my social anxiety and my anxiety in general. I want to make friends, but it is hard for me to. I have no had any messed up experiences in my life, but I have social anxiety, generalized anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder. I also am a big perfectionist. I want to be smarter than that guy next to me and if I'm not I write notes on paper of how worthless and stupid I am. I want to become someone in the IT field but I'm too stupid to get in there anyways, and jobs nowadays need social people and I am not one of them. I've never had a girlfriend before, and I want to have one because being a virgin is a bad thing and I could never live with that feeling. If I don't have any friends or a girlfriend when I'm an adult I plan on committing suicide. Can you please help me? Thanks for reading.
