Please just help me.I've been waiting for help for two years. They have me on their list. But it feels like I'm never gonna get to a psychiatrist.
They remitted me to PTSD treatment half a year ago, but I've heard nothing.

I just want to break down and end it. I just want to stop hoping so I can stop living.
I honestly don't even know what's keeping me alive anymore. 
Maybe I'm stubborn, Maybe I want everything to be "ready" I don't know. And it pisses me off.

Every single feeling becomes red hot anger. And there's no one to hurt but myself. 
I don't want to live anymore, I really, really, really don't. 
I hate me.
