The only special relationship in my whole life means nothing to my ex. Whatâ€™s the point?Heâ€™s too good for me now that heâ€™s sober. His wife killed herself and Iâ€™ll never be able to fill her shoes because what him and I had wasnâ€™t as special as I thought it was. Iâ€™m not even worthy of
his love anymore, what good am i? Every man Iâ€™ve gone after rejects me. Iâ€™m cursed to be alone forever.

Canâ€™t get any lower than this. Planning on just stopping in a crosswalk and getting hit by a semi or taking a bunch of pills later. Will leave my cats to my ex so he has a reminder of what he could have had. 

I hate myself and my life so much i just want it all to end.
