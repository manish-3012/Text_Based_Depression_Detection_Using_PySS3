Suicidal NEET (21-22M).TLDR; I'm a useless burden on society, I want to commit suicide but I'm too scared to actually do it.

As the title says I'm single, ugly and unemployed, my stepfather hates me and kicks me out of the house for several days a week. I only have 3 friends who can easily replace me, and a mother who already has. All I do is waste resources and be a burden on society by reading fanfiction, working on shitty video game mods, and complaining about my problems while many people have worse problems than I do. Anyways I want to kill myself because society has no use for me, but I'm too scared to actually do it. Sorry for the wall of text.
