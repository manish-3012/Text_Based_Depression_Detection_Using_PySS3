I hate that Iâ€™m transgender so muchI didnâ€™t have much of a childhood and my teen years sucked. Iâ€™m probably gonna have to spend the next ten years of my life hating myself and feeling incredibly lonely and jealous because I canâ€™t even date yet. I wouldnâ€™t feel comfortable until I was at least on hrt and had top surgery. Itâ€™ll be years before I could afford it because Iâ€™ll have to move out first. Iâ€™ll be in my thirties by then and would have never experienced some of the best parts of youth. My time is wasted and I canâ€™t deal with this pain much longer. Either something needs to get done Iâ€™m killing myself. I canâ€™t imagine any other scenario.
