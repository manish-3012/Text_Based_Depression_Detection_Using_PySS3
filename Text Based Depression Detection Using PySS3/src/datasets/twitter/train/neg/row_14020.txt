I want to die, but my girlfriend needs someone to watch after her.I want to escape these feelings and this life. I have so much shame and guilt. Iâ€™m stressed all the time. Iâ€™m a burden to almost everyone. Shit keeps happening and it doesnâ€™t stop everything is piling up on me. Iâ€™m in so much pain I canâ€™t take it anymore. I was going to do it, I was going to take my life I was so ready. But the thought of my girlfriend stopped me. Sheâ€™s honestly the only reason I am hanging on. She needs somebody, she doesnâ€™t have many people that support her in her life right now and it breaks my heart. Sheâ€™s not doing well either and I donâ€™t want to her to get to the point that I am at. I donâ€™t want her to be alone. I need to stay to support her and do my best to make her happy. 
But my thoughts are contradicting themselves, maybe Iâ€™m not even doing a good enough job at helping her. She could probably have someone better who would be better support and love her better. But Iâ€™m scared and I donâ€™t want to hurt her and still donâ€™t want her to be alone. Iâ€™m so conflicted.
