Just letting it out cuz Iâ€™ll never in front of my peopleI donâ€™t know what to do with my life no more Iâ€™m so tired of shit tired of school tired of stressing of rejection tired of hiding things tired of overthinking things tired of not being able to stay sober so I wonâ€™t be depressed and when Iâ€™m not sober Iâ€™m depressed my parents donâ€™t believe shit I say they just say itâ€™s because your nose is stuffy and your anxiety causes u to be like that but itâ€™s not itâ€™s me I want to die I really just want to go to peace and feel nothing no more but Iâ€™m scared to die Iâ€™m scared to kill my self Iâ€™m scared of the way my mom would feel if i ever left her  Iâ€™m tired of this shitty feeeling I have everyday I truly only have 2 guy  friends I donâ€™t have 1 single girl friend *friend* itâ€™s fine but Iâ€™m just  done with it I fear rejection I lost the most beatiful girl in the world my life just isnâ€™t it doesnâ€™t feel right I just want to be at eternal rest with god  I wish I never grew up never thought Iâ€™d feel like this . 

If u reading this somehow depression sucks I wouldnâ€™t wish it on anyone hope yâ€™all can stay blessed with your familyâ€™s and happy New Years god bless you or yâ€™all
