I really need someone to talk toI'm a 24/f. I don't want to call a hotline, I'm scared to talk to someone on the phone, I don't want anyone to find out about this. I just need to talk to someone so badly, I don't know what else to do. I have great friends and a wonderful boyfriend and the most supportive and loving parents anyone could ask for. But I can't tell them how I really feel, they would be so scared and hurt. I have so many things to live for but I hate myself so much. I have confided in a few people in my life but I don't think they understand or grasp what I am saying. They can't relate to it. I feel so stupid even writing this, I just don't know what else I can do.
