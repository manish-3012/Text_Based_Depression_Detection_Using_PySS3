Took 5,200 mg of ibuprofen13 pills of 400mg of ibuprofen I just really want to die. I know I have people that care about me in my life but I donâ€™t care about that. I donâ€™t know what will happen after death. None of us know actually. I like to believe itâ€™ll be like how it it was before you were conceived. You just simply didnâ€™t exist. Thatâ€™s what I want. To just stop existing. Iâ€™m tempted to take more.
