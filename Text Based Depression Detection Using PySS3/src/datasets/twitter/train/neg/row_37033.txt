I just need adviceI am a very paranoid person in general. I feel like everyone around me will hurt, betray, or leave me. I feel like spending time alone with someone else alone is dangerous. And I hate it so badly. A week ago I was hanging out with someone alone and a few days ago my anxiety started to peak. What if they spread lies about me? What if they tell other people the things I told them? What if they hated me the entire time I was there? Its making my head hurt and I'm in a lot of pain. I am not in a good mental state. I was wondering if any of yall had advice to push the paranoia away.
