I almost did it last nightI Tried to open up to my friends about my suicidal and self harming thoughts and they immediately shut me down saying I should just get over it and stuff like that and then about an hour later one of my friends in the same group starts talking about her suicidal thoughts and she got support galore,  and I tried to awake her if she was ok and that if she meds anyone to talk to she can talk to me but she just told me to fuck off an d not doesn't help that she's also my crush
