Young homeless felon ready to dieIm 24 a 7x felon and homeless I did time for 1 crime when I was 19 (petty larceny burglary etc...) I will hate myself everyday for what I did not because I was caught but because I hurt innocent people who didnt deserve it I would like to point out that I havent had so much as a ticket before or since all of this  Ever since I was released 5 years ago ive been homeless and incredibly in debt I try applying for even minimum wage crappy jobs and nobody wants to hire a felon ive tried general labor gigs in construction but every single job has turned out to be a nightmare believe it or not there are some guys out there who are not handy and I am one of them our society makes it nearly impossible for felons nobody believes in second chances and then they wonder why we have so many repeat offenders no friends no family no money no car no home no job no resources never owned a license I am sick and tired of people saying it'll get better it's been 5 years ive done everything I possibly could and its lead me back here im sick and tired of people always looking down on me like im scum of the earth my purpose in life was to be a loser and a fuck up and I honestly have no desire to live anymore Ive already made plans to end it this is just me getting some things off my chest
