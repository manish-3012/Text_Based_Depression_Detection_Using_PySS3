Why does any of it matter?This is new to me but I'm finding myself more and more contemplating suicide - recently to the point of really deciding how I would do it in a way that my cowardice would not allow me to back out of.

Basically in the last 4 months I've begun the process of a divorce (my fault, my own behavior), moved 400 0 miles away, formed a very close relationship (stronger than my marriage ever was) with a woman who is also at a distance now and who is slowly pushing me away.

I came here for work, have no friends here.  I'm in my dream job but it just seems like nothing fucking matters anymore.  I can toil away in this job for some purpose no one will recognize, go home to my empty apartment in this city I do not know.  I am so lonely and am just unable to cope with it in any reasonable way right now.  Yes, life is hard, but for what?  What difference does it make if I live and work and survive some unnotable existence that leaves no mark on anyone - a life where I've pushed away those that care about me and been rejected by those I care about?  Does it really matter in the long run if I stick around for 60 more years of that or just go right now?

It's the weekend and the intensity of these feelings is growing to the point that if I owned a gun it would at least be in my hand.  I'm brand new to this city and hope to get a therapy appointment ASAP next week.
