How do I talk about this?When I was admitted to hospital, everyone assumed it was because of my anxieties and how I view myself. Which is partly true. However, How do I tell my parents that my attempt wasnâ€™t just that. Itâ€™s that I hate this species and world as a whole and donâ€™t want to live in it anymore. 

Everyone says Iâ€™ve got so much to live for, but I truly donâ€™t want anything that I can â€œlive forâ€.

I donâ€™t want kids, donâ€™t want a partner, donâ€™t want a career, donâ€™t want drugs, donâ€™t want friends, etc.

In addition, how do I tell them that I resent them for even bringing me into this world, and guilting me into staying by saying what it would do to them and my siblings?

I fell like a literal product that they arenâ€™t ready to stop using yet. 

Any suggestions would help 

Note: Iâ€™m on ssriâ€™s and seeing a physiologist, but just to humour them. Once my parents are dead Iâ€™ll probably just attempt again anyway.
