I can't stop thinking about itI have suffered from depression my whole life.  Tried to kill myself multiple times growing up but always failed.  I am on an anti depressant now which seems to keep me mostly level, but when things go wrong it sends me off the deep end.

This afternoon my husband and I had a horrible fight.  He's normally a very sweet and funny guy but he has a nasty temper and blows up a few times a year, this was one of those times.  So he was screaming at me, saying hurtful things while I just begged and begged him to keep his voice down because we live with my parents currently.  He wouldn't and ended up throwing me out of his home office.  I had nowhere to go in the house to be alone so now I'm at a community park with our dog.

I have no one to talk to. No one.  My husband is my best friend usually, but obviously I can't talk to him.  My siblings and I aren't close.  My mother is going through major health issues and is pretty self centered anyway, so I can't really talk to her either.  

I just hate myself so much.  I am a loser.  I am fat, no job.  I have done horrible things in the past.  I wish I could just cease to exist. I wish I just wasn't here anymore.
