Long post. Tired of being me. Iâ€™m just done.Im exhausted. I literally canâ€™t do it anymore. Anytime I am presented with a potential relationship, I fuck it up with exposing my feelings too soon. Ive tried all the online dating apps because I sure as hell cant meet someone the more natural way. Iâ€™m talking to this girl now felt like we genuinely connected and we were so engaged with each other but things are rapidly deteriorating. I can just sense that she will ghost me or call it a quits any day now. This girl was the last straw, I promised myself that even before we started to seriously talk. Iâ€™m done. Iâ€™m tired of being rejected. Iâ€™ve been flaked on way too many times now. It hurts so much, people have no idea. I see my friends on Instagram with their girlfriends and SOs and it just fills me with self-hatred. Why canâ€™t that be me. Iâ€™ve never had a girlfriend and Iâ€™m 23. I just want to be loved. I want to hold someone close to me and cuddle with. I wanna tell them everything. I wanna smile with them, cry, laugh, do all these things but I just canâ€™t. I fuck everything up. I care too much. Iâ€™m clingy. Iâ€™m desperate. No one wants me. I deleted all my online dating apps because I thought this thing with this girl was gonna work. But itâ€™s not. I can just feel it. Iâ€™ve been rejected so many times where I can pick up on these things. Iâ€™m not gonna redownload the apps because i donâ€™t wanna get hurt again like Iâ€™m getting hurt now. 

Donâ€™t fucking tell me to work on myself because I have. Same results. And donâ€™t you dare tell me that I need to be happy with myself because that sure as hell doesnâ€™t fix anything either. Iâ€™ve tried therapy with a counselor. Nothing. Iâ€™ve tried neurological treatment. Nothing. Not lowering my standards so Iâ€™m guessing Iâ€™ll just keep complaining then. Hopefully it will bring me closer to killing myself honestly cause i sure am on the brink right now. Any advice you give me does not fucking work. Iâ€™m done. I really am done. I donâ€™t wanna keep going. I keep getting hurt. I keep putting myself out there, I try, but nothing seems to work. Iâ€™m social, Iâ€™m funny, I like to think that Iâ€™m good looking, people tell me Iâ€™m handsome, but how genuine are they really being? I feel hideous. I wanna cry. Iâ€™m pathetic for wanting to kill myself because I canâ€™t get a girlfriend. Hell, I canâ€™t even hook up with anyone. Iâ€™ve tried that too and it just feels wrong. 

Smiling in public is a chore now. I have no reason to be happy. I have nothing to look forward to. Iâ€™m starting college back up again in a couple of weeks. I took a semester off because I failed all of my classes. I havenâ€™t felt this way in over a year. I was doing so well. But women just fuck it up for me. I donâ€™t know what it is about me. Ever since middle school Iâ€™ve been having women problems and itâ€™s taken a toll. This is it. Like I said, she was the last straw. I know finding a girlfriend wonâ€™t fix all of my problems, but I think it would help. 

Iâ€™ve stopped eating these past couple of days, maybe Iâ€™ll eat one thing a day and thatâ€™s it. I just donâ€™t care anymore. Everyday now all I do is drive around with no destination and listen to Mac Miller because thatâ€™s the one thing that I still enjoy to do. Itâ€™s somewhat therapeutic and keeps me sane. But as of recently, Iâ€™ve gotten tired of that too. Video games were an escape for me for a really long time but now I have lost interest. I canâ€™t even talk to my friends anymore. They try to talk to me but I donâ€™t say anything back. I have no energy to say anything. 

I have these dreams where Iâ€™m with someone that I love. But theyâ€™re just fucking dreams and thatâ€™s it. They vanish in mere seconds holding no value. I have these butterflies in my stomach that wonâ€™t go away. I have no nails because I fucking bite them all the damn time because of my anxiety. Wanting a girlfriend has consumed me to the point where Iâ€™m no longer myself anymore. People want the old me back but I just canâ€™t. The anxiety of wanting to be in love has changed me. 

But no fucking more. I swear to you Iâ€™m done. I havenâ€™t felt like this in over a year and when i did last year I didnâ€™t do it because I still had hope. I have no hope now. For anything.
