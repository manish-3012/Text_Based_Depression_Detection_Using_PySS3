I really don't want to die.For my entire adult life I've been in one bad situation after another. Most of it revolves around abusive work place environments that have caused me to basically lose faith in my fellow man. Every relationship I have breaks down and sometimes it's my fault, sometimes it's not. It's always the same result though. 

These days I find myself in an alien town, jobless, homeless and looking for work. I cannot seem to find a job that will pay me enough to live on my own. So basically I'm a huge failure at life, at least to myself. I can't keep a roof over my head, I can't bathe everyday, I can't even eat everyday. All I have is a few clothes now, this laptop that's 14 years old and keys to things I don't even own anymore. My health is deteriorating, not sleeping well due to the heat or police waking me up, dirty, the list of problems go on. 

I have no family left alive and even the shelter that was going to look after my cat for me put him to sleep. 

I've spent the last few years looking for a good job but I lack the social skills to get anything or keep it due whatever malfunction I have going on in my brain. I'm sick of walking 6 hours to a job interview to not get the job. I don't have a phone number, reference or address to give these people. You know how embarrassing that is? I look homeless now. People in this library are all keeping their distance.

I'm tired of all this and I want it to end now. I would like to hold on to hope but I think if I don't get some kind of good news today I'm just going to go kill myself tonight.
