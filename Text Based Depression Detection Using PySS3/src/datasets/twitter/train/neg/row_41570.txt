My friend may be going crazy...For the last few weeks he has been talking about the vast space and how limited he is and how limitless the world is. Whenever I see him he's staring at the sky. He acts normal around people but leave him alone and he'll talk to himself and talk about how the only way to connect with the Universe is through death. Now...this is kind of weird. I mean I've heard him speak of weird things like the spirit of the world that hates our ways and punishes us. Things like how paintings show the destruction and death of our world through the destruction and violation of its rights (?). 

He has said that he has... "noticed" some madness in himself lately and I'm a bit worried. I told him to go see someone about the "madness" and he refuses to do so for fear of being assigned a title such as "madman" , "suicidal", "threat to others". He doesn't like titles of this sort. He told me this when he was drunk. 

He has also spoken of the "Watchful eye of the universe that is forever and never. Here and nowhere. Not god. Not man. Nothingness." He said he wishes to be one with it. To be everything and nothing.

He's extremely paranoid and hates the governments of the world. May have a mild Multiple Personality Disorder. 

Any advice on how to handle this?
