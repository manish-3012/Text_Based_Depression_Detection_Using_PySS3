I'm sorryI'm so tired.

I just want to vent you don't have to listen.

So there was this guy I really liked. The first person that I really liked after my disastrous relationship with another, much older man. This guy was my age! We got along really well and we had similar interests. But then he started acting strange. Then he said he didn't want to date me. Because of my mental health issues. And I was trying so hard to be strong and happy for him! I really loved him but emotions are fleeting and worthless and you've heard that story a million times. 

Does being suicidal make me unworthy of love? If I hurt myself does that mean that no one will ever see anything good about me? Should I just give up now before it hurts worse?

I mean I don't know why I bother. I'm not worth love. People sometimes ask me if I'm dating anyone. Can't they see that I'm so utterly worthless? Who would date trash like me?

I want it to end. I hope my job gets robbed and I get shot so I dont have to do it myself

I went to the bridge but they had installed these anti suicide things and I couldn't bring myself to go somewhere else.  I'm so pathetic.

Why is it so hard to live?

Why is it so hard to die?

Why can't I do either one?

What am I supposed to do?

I think it's coming to an end soon. I've been writing a novel. It's nearly done! I think I can be at peace and have enough bravery. I just want to stop the pain. Please...
