Tired.Iâ€™m so tired of it all. Just wish I could finally make it. Iâ€™ve tried so many times. Been so close. Iâ€™m just sick of this living shit. Itâ€™s the same shit every fucking year. Iâ€™m sick of being depressed. Im sick of being alone. Sick of being an outsider. Im tired. Iâ€™m tired of trying. Iâ€™ve tried. So fucking many times. I just wish I could make it. Finally. Wish I could succeed. I just want to die. Again.
