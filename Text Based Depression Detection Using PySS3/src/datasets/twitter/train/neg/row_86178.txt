Every time I open up about depression I lose friendsI am a needy person I have nights where it feels hopeless to continue. I am not petrified of losing friends I'm down to 2 and might be 2 because I have annoyed one of my friends by daily texts. He doesn't want to hangout anymore made that clear. I haven't made any friends in years as I struggle to connect. Met someone I thought could be a friend but we can't hangout outside of work so she will forget me soon enough. I'm 23 haven't been on a single date haven't been kissed have no clue how to accomplish anything romantically.
