I cant do this anymoreI suck at making friends. Talking to people in general. I feel like my family doesnt even like me being around. I dont know what im going to do but i dont want to live ive given up. My therapist cant help me bc of quarantine and calls do not work. Ive tried to be positive, tried to hang in there, it doesnt work and i feel like i havent been happy in years and its days repeating itself. Im tired of the same boring life but i cant change it or at least i wont let myself. This is probably goodbye to everyone.
