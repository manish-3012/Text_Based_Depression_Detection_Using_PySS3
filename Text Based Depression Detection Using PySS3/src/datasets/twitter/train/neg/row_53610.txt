So I feel Suicidal because -

 - Shitty Name given by parents

Reader of this post, you can help me for time being by calling me on my anonymous fake instagram id and saying nice things about me like "Hey, I love you" "You are awesome" "Oh man I want to be your friend forever"

If its a female voice, even better as I am a virgin guy from a sexually suppressed nation.

If you feel fake but still say these things, it would still help me. Just 5 minutes of these fake nice compliments would do.

Love you. I really love you. You are awesome, reader.
