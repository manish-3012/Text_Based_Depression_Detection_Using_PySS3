I can't stand living on this fucking planet any longer I remember being joyful over seeing snow or getting a new game and how things were new. Everyday for me now is a slow and painful nightmare, I can't do anything without losing my temper or hating every fiber of my being for not being able to do anything with my sad excuse of a life. sometimes wondering if a bullet to the brain would be a good idea, can't say anything to my parents or risk being put into a mental ward. Fucking hate this nightmare I live through, I'm completely useless sack of meat that only feels dead every single day. I wish things could go back to the way they we're when I was younger, I remember the blue sky or white clouds that would fly above me, Feeling alive and seeing new places, Finding out all the different things I could do in life and how joyful everything seems, I was curious over the small things in life and how it all worked. I remember coming home from school after a long day of boredom and zero interest for all subjects and being excited over get a new game or to lay back and chill on minecraft. Fuck man, I hate how everything now is a nightmare. I just like my suffer to end, is that so hard to ask? Of course its to hard to ask for one simple thing, I just hope that I die in my sleep. Fuck this shit planet that we are forced to live on because it pains others and I'm called selfish for not wanting endless pain. Fuck most people
