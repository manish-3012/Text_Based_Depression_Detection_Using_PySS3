Does anyone else here sometimes just think about the lives friends, family, acquaintances, etc will lead long after you're dead ?I know some pretty bright people and I would love to see them succeed and grow as people. Sometimes I wonder what their lives will be like decades into the future. But I won't be there. And I definitely don't plan on seeing them grow old.
