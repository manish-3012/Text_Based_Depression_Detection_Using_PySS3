Lonely, heartbroken and depressed. Gonna end it todayI know itâ€™s been a year, but I still love you as much as the first time I met you. I knew it was coming, now you have someone else. It hurts too much, just finishing my letter to you. And then I will never be your problem again, I will always love you.
