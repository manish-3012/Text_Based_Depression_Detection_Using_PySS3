I'm so tired of hating myself and feeling like I'll never be good enoughI just don't feel like I can do it anymore. I hate how mediocre I feel. Like it's never good enough, Like I'll always be worthless or something. 

I feel like throwing up. How do I stop hating myself. I'm doing doing better productively, but my self-esteem is still really low.
