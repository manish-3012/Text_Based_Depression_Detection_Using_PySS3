SO many close calls/attempts.Think the first time was when I was about 10 when I tried to hang myself on a tree in the backyard. My parents were going through a divorce and there was a lot of domestic violence going on. Got into an argument with my mom and... yeah. 

Second time was after my mom passed at 12. I tried to slit my wrists. Dad was abusive. Bullies wouldnâ€™t leave me alone at school. Had no real friends and my psychosis started entering the picture. Constant paranoia, could never sleep which made the hallucinations worse. 

Third time I was 17 and I tried to slit my throat.   I guess I was just scared of growing up. Lost some blood but I was okay. Just traumatic. 

Fourth was right after that. Same thing. 

Fifth was I couldnâ€™t even tell you because Iâ€™ve lost track after this. Used the same method multiple times. Twice Iâ€™ve needed blood transfusions. 

One of those times was recently (Im 24) I went into shock. Iâ€™m so traumatized from this itâ€™s the most pain Iâ€™ve ever felt. And not just pain either. I couldnâ€™t breathe I was suffocating. I kept throwing up bile and choking on it. It was like every negative feeling in my body I could feel but to the max. Fear, fever, pain, nausea &amp; suffocation. The only real positive take away was that now Iâ€™m scared to die (if thatâ€™s a positive). 

No one really knows about my most recent attempt but I drank a bunch and did half a gram of fentanyl. I passed out and woke up with the worst hangover of my life. Thatâ€™s all that happened. 


Thereâ€™s a lot Iâ€™ve left out and Iâ€™m sort of sugar coating it but the point is Iâ€™m SO scared to die. And Iâ€™m not so religious these days but grew up Christian and Iâ€™m scared of the prospect of hell. Dying if youâ€™re conscious for the process is so unbelievably unbearable. It was for me. And Iâ€™m scared now in general. 

Tl;Dr:   (In conclusion. )

So Iâ€™m scared to live, Iâ€™m scared to die. Iâ€™m scared of my hallucinations. Iâ€™m scared of the prospect of hell. Iâ€™m really scared and I canâ€™t escape it. 

Thank you for listening to my TED talk.
