I just found out my awesome landlord who lived across the hall committed suicide last sunday.I was just his tenant and I didn't know him well, but I knew him, and I feel gutted.  His sister broke the news to me just a few hours ago. She looked like a ghost.  Evidently he suffered from depression. I just spoke to him, I helped him fix up the building.  Really cool guy.  The thought that I will never see him, ever again, that he doesn't exist, saddens me immensely.  Its especially painful that it happened this way.

To anyone on here thinking about suicide, know that the people around you care. Suicide leaves this cold void that everyone you know will feel intensely.  People DO care. I wish I could have just talked to the guy, maybe make him laugh or something.  Just raise his spirits.

All you need is a glimmer if hope, that little light that goes on and makes you feel happy for a second. Find that. Please open yourself up to others, you might find out that even someone you barely know might really care
