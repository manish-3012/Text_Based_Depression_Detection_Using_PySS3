I was told to post hereHello,

So I made [This post](http://www.reddit.com/r/DoesAnybodyElse/comments/jwwh9/dae_have_suicidal_thoughts_on_a_daily_basis/) last night somebody told me to make a post here. 

So basically I've been having suicidal thoughts for a few years now - thoughts like how I'd kill myself, who would be effected, what if anything would happen to me afterwards. Never really crossed into serious planning, but at one point I put aside a bottle of Oxycotin and Vodka and hid it in my bookcase. It's made me feel really good to just have it sit there, but I have no plans to use it.

I don't think I'm depressed - I'll have my waves of bad thoughts but I'd say a good 80% of my day is me having genuine fun and being happy. 

I just don't really know where to go from here. I thought the suicidal thoughts I was having were as normal as people's murder/rape thoughts. Happens a few times a day but never anything serious, so no harm no foul, right? But reading some comments last night and this morning have led me to believe that suicidal thoughts are not normal, but I'm pretty confident mine are just thoughts and will never lead to actions.

Should I just go on with my life like normal?
