My friend is suicidal and I don't know how to help herI recently started talking to someone one online and as it turns out she is severely depressed and suicidal. She has told me that she is planning to kill herself after she finished school. I live in a different country to her so I can not go to her to help. 

She has said that a lot of her friends have left or betrayed her and she is unable to trust anyone anymore. I am trying my best to help her, but she keeps going between wanting to be helped and not wanting to be helped. Every time I think I convinced her to get help she just changes her mind a few minutes later and decides she just wants to die instead.

I really don't know what else to do here. I have read some things that are in the side bar but I don't think that I am helping her. I just don't know what do say or do! Please help me help her! I am so scared that she will kill herself and it will be my fault that I couldn't help her!
