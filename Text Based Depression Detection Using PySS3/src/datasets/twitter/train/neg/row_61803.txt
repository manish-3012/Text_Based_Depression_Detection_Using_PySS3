I just need someone to talk to. Please.I feel like an absolute crazy person. I feel like maybe I have gotten so used to the idea that I should kill myself that literally the smallest occurrence will send me over the edge. Iâ€™ve been to the psych ward. Iâ€™ve been to the hospital. Iâ€™ve been to many treatment centers and detoxes. The reality is that Iâ€™ve hated myself since I was 8, having to go to the elementary school counselor every Tuesday to talk about why I hate myself so much. 
I had a decent childhood. My dad can be a hot head and get in my face when we fight but heâ€™s my number one fan. He is so strong and loves me so much. But heâ€™s human. And same with my mom. She can say hurtful things she later apologizes for but she will always answer when I call and there isnâ€™t anything she wouldnâ€™t do for me. Iâ€™m so fortunate in that and yet most days I donâ€™t feel grateful, I feel guilt. So much guilt for â€œhaving it goodâ€ when others are dealing with real problems and theyâ€™re staying strong.
 I turned to drugs when I was 13 and stayed numb as long as I could. I remember the relief I felt the first night I found that pain pill and used. Absolute relief. Drug use has come with much trauma, furthering the hate for myself and the general unhappiness I feel in life. Iâ€™ve been clean for a while now and I worked the program. They promised Iâ€™d be content. But I feel more alone than ever. 
I ruin everything. Itâ€™s like a compulsion. I do it without even realizing it! I have failed at just about everything since graduating high school. I canâ€™t handle simple disappointments without wanting to hurt myself. I feel shame so deeply in my soul. Over everything. Iâ€™m doing the coping skills. I go outside and walk, I journal, I even attend group therapy. But I made the mistake of telling them I wish I didnâ€™t wake up. I told them I didnâ€™t have a plan and I wasnâ€™t going to do anything but they called the cops on me. The guy came in and stood over me with his hand on his gun while I was sitting down trying to talk to my counselor. He just wanted to know if I planned to hurt anyone else. 
I feel so defeated. Iâ€™ve been to counselor after counselor and many psychiatrists and been on many many meds. Nothing seems to help. I donâ€™t have any friends. And Iâ€™ve grown so tired of hearing my mom say â€œitâ€™ll all be okay.â€ She tries. But she doesnâ€™t know what to do. I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s wrong with me. I failed the first time I tried to kill myself only I saw what it did to my parents. Now Iâ€™m so consumed with the anger at the inability to just fucking do it and the guilt of wanting to because itâ€™ll hurt my family so much. I donâ€™t know what to do. I have no one. I just want to talk to someone. I donâ€™t even care about what. I just need a friend. 
Thereâ€™s so much more I want to say but this is probably long enough that most people want even want to read. Thank you if you have read it.
