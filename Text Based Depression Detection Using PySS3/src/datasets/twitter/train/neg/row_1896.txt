Tired of talking about it.I've been talking about suicide for many months, and I've felt suicidal for a few years. I went through a horrible divorce, and lost my whole life. I received a decent divorce settlement, but my will to live was vanquished. I have been unable to rebuild my life, and to get my shit together enough to support myself. In December, my alimony runs out. I drank away the majority of my house equity. My savings will only support me until March at the latest. I'm finished.

I've tried to build a new life with the woman I am dating. We've been seeing each other for many months now. But I don't think she wants what I am looking for, and I'll never get it from anyone. All I want is what I once had: living together with someone I love, building a life together, leaning on each other. I'll never get that again. It's all I need to focus; it is the drive I need to succeed. I am just one of those kinds of people who need the stability in order to flourish. I lack that stability, and I am failing.

The only person I can talk to about this is my divorce lawyer--attorney-client privilege. I called the suicide hotline back in July, and had 5 deputies visit where I am living, and took me to a clinic, where I was discharged 2 hrs later. (Never, ever call the suicide hotline.) I called that hotline for years, to talk to someone, and now I have been cut off. I am uninsured, and cannot afford to see a therapist. No meds in my future, either.

I found a sure way out, and it is quick. I am trying to enjoy the time I have left, but it is hard.
