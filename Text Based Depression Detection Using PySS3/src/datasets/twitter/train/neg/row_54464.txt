Not sure why I'm still around or what I'm even doing anymoreHeh, I don't even know why I'm here posting this. Like everyone else here, I'm tired. I'm hurting. And I just want it to stop. I've lived with depression my entire life. I've gotten "help". I'm on medication. I still want to die.

I have a plan. Multiples actually. I've considered all the options. I've tried telling people how I feel, my friends and family. It resulted in me being locked up in a pysch ward for a day and nothing else came of it. Recently.

 I've told my friends I've been suicidal for so long now they don't care anymore. They don't want to hear it. They have explicitly told me they don't want to hear it. And I think that's what hurts the most. I am screaming for someone, anyone to take notice and those closest to me are abandoning me. It makes me want to just end it now, the pain and loss is too much to bear.
