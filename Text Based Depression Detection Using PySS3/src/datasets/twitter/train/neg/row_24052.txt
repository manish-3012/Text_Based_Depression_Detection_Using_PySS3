My baby sister just asked me about the worst day of my lifeIt took everything in me to tell her it hasn't happened yet. But I know it was January 5th, 2015. The night I first tried to kill myself. I still wish it had worked. Life hasn't gotten better but lord knows I've tried. I'm stuck in a job with people I hate and I haven't been able to find a new shrink since my old one died (after 10 years of progress) in November. No point to this post I guess, just breaking in my new account with a vent that'll probably get deleted in the morning
