I don't know if I should be posting here, but...I'm just tired of everything. Day to day stress. It's awful. I barely speak to friends anymore. Parents found out something I didn't want anyone to know. Broke down and cried in my room for the first time in years. All I've wanted for the last few months is to not feel anything anymore. Death has been a thought that came across my mind many a times. I just don't want to be here if it means struggling. Happiness doesn't outweigh my thoughts. Nothing has been going right for me lately. Bad habits basically ruin anything that was good to begin with. Damage has already been done to the point of no return. I just don't want these problems anymore and there seems to be only one solution, but that would require ending my life.
