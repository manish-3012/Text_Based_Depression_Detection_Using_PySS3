I'm finally approaching happinessI used to go out multiple times a week to hang myself in the middle of the night, but I never could. I had a rope which I had hidden outside my house, cuz I didn't want my parents to find it. Until someday it wasn't at the place I left it anymore. No idea what happened to it, but that doesn't matter. After I couldn't find it anywhere I went home and I layed on my bed all night. Not sleeping not crying barely even thinking. I could've just bought another one, but I didn't. I don't know why I didn't, but I just didn't. I went through my normal hellish life and just slowly got less and less depressed by the day. And that brings me to today like 5 months after I lost my rope. I finally realized I didn't feel the need to kill myself anymore and I felt relieved, but not happy. I'm somehow content with being alive whilst still hating every second of it. I'm still far from actually being happy, but I'm getting closer I think. I'm not sure if me losing my rope and thus not trying to kill myself so often helped, but I like to think it did. So this is me anouncing my leave from this sub. I wish everyone here the best of luck and I hope something like this happens to everyone of you.

Tl;dr: lost my rope, slowly got less depressed over the course of 5 months and now I'm not suicidal anymore.
