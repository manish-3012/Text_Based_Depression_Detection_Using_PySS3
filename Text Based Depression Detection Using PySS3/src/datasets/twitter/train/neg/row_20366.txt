One day before I hit my 30s...Not sure where to begin with. I'm laying in bed and I'm crying like I have for the past few years, it's not an every day occurrence that I cry myself to sleep but it happens often enough. 

I'm at my wit's end with life and I'm still in my early-mid 20s, but I decided to end my life before I will reach 30. 

I kept thinking for the past few days what is the best way to go out, and I think the quickest and least painful way (hopefully) is with a gun. It's not easy to get a gun where I'm from but it's doable. 

I've nothing worthy to live for. 

I'm ugly, I'm stupid, I'm a lone-wolf, I'm a horrible person and I drive everyone around me away. 

I've been succumbing to depression for close to 10 years now and I've had enough. I can't take this pain anymore and truthfully no one gives a flying fuck about me. That's the truth. 


I'm angry, I'm sad, I'm frustrated and I just want to be laid to rest in my eternal sleep. 

I don't know why I wrote this, I guess I needed a place to write something down. 

One person made me happy and that person is gone, I pushed her away, with my shitty attitude and my clinginess and I smothered her. Never gave her room to breath and I regret that now so much. Oh. Did i mention I'm ugly? Yeah... also one of the reasons. 

I miss you E, I hope you know I deeply love you. 

Buenas noches everyone.
