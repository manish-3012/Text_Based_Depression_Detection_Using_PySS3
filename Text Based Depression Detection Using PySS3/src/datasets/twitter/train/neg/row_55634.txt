The fear of what happens after death keeps me alive. (19 f)â€ªOur brains canâ€™t comprehend that once we die our consciousness goes too. I always believed that theyâ€™ll be some sort of thing that happens after death but itâ€™s really just nothing. Before weâ€™re born we donâ€™t have any thoughtâ€˜s either so why would there be anything after death? This scares the shit out of me. 

One of the hardest things I have trouble overcoming after not being suicidal anymore (compared to before) is finding the pleasure in living life again.â€¬ Sure I donâ€™t wanna die anymore but i donâ€™t wanna live life either.â€¬ 

Iâ€™m underweight, canâ€™t sleep, donâ€™t eat much food, cry constantly and listen to too much music. I feel useless and stuck in a sort of limbo. My best friend and person who I confide in the most overdosed and is in the hospital right now. I donâ€™t know if it was a failed suicide attempt but iâ€™m scared for her and maybe selfishly iâ€™m scared for me too... I donâ€™t know how long I can take this anymore.
