i want to finally end it ; female 19i've been daydreaming about being critically injured or killed since i was 8, and self-harming/attempting to kill myself since i was 10. i don't know what started me thinking this way, but i haven't been able to stop it. it was nearly unbearable until about christmas time last year.

for the past four months i've been genuinely happy; hardly any suicide attempts, hardly any self-harm. i have a wonderful boyfriend who i love very much that i got together with over the holidays. he is the main person i talk to, and we're happily connected at the hip. one is hardly ever seen without the other. we're both mentally ill, and working to understand each other and communicate.

lately we've been fighting more and more, he's been angrier with me more than he's happy. he's jealous over me having friends, over my past, every little thing i do wrong makes him explode. we've talked about it and he's aware of the problem, but he isn't able to control it. it's been pushing down on me so hard, i'm not sure what to do anymore. my suicidal urges are coming back, and i've been self-harming more. i don't believe he's aware of either

i couldn't possibly leave him, i'm in love with him. i wouldn't be able to forgive myself if i left the one good thing in my life. he's helped me so much in the past, and he's my best friend. he's the only person i can see myself spending my life with. he isn't always anger, he's kind and gentle and caring with me, but lately it seems worse. our mutual friends have made comments on us fighting. i just don't know what to do anymore

i swore that i would kill myself on my last birthday. i didn't. i'll be turning 20 in a little over two weeks. i'm afraid to die, but i'm also afraid to live. i think maybe it's my time? i should have died a long time ago
