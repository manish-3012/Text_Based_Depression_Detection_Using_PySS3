University is making me suicidalAny other guys from uni on here? Online learner is so shit cause nobody explains the work. I honestly think I'm gonna fail a module and I'll kill myself before that happens. 

I know you might think that's stupid but I have a terrible habit of trying to keep everyone around me satisfied. To the point where I'd rather die that dissapoint them

Can anyone relate to any of this?
