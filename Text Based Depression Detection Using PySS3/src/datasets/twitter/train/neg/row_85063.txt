Ill never be happyThe first time I cut myself was when I was 7 years old, after my dad died 2 years prior and my moms new bf moved in and began physically and sexually abusing us. Im almost 23 now and my life is barely better, I have no friends, I've disowned half my family, and every relationship I get into, I just end up worse off. Not to mention, every turn I make is some guy thinking my body is his for the taking just cause he thinks im cute and im too depressed and scared to fight him off and risk worse happening to me. Im so tired of being abused. Im so tired of having no say over my own body. Im just so tired of trying to make something out of my shithole life when im so obviously destined for failure. Every turn I make gets me further and further behind. My biggest dream come true would be finally having the courage to put a bullet through my head and end myself once and for all. Id finally be free.
