I just need some adviceAlright, I've never attempted to post anything here, but I need some help. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm getting either so angry or so hopeless that I don't see a way out.

I've been feeling down for several years now, and previously I kept my emotions to myself. About 2 years ago, a very good friend of mine found out about how broken up I always was, and told me he would always be there to listen if I ever had any problems. I was extremely grateful, and I can still never thank him enough for putting up with me and my rants, but I eventually realized that I was probably bothering the hell out of him with all of my bullshit, so I started dumping less on him and kept things to myself more.

I kept feeling worse and worse, and eventually started having suicidal thoughts. He got really worried and contacted my parents to let them know that I wasn't ok. Both of my parents love and support me, and immediately sat with me and talked about what they could do to help. They helped me get set up with a therapist and a psychiatrist, which neither seem to be helping. They say they see the meds helping a bit, but I'm not seeing much of a change. 

Recently, I've been dealing with quite a bit of anger. I've been getting so angry at every little thing that goes wrong, and it's affecting my friends and family. My coworkers are constantly poking fun at me, which usually wouldn't get to me, but is now making me want to hurt someone. Any mistake I make sets me off. I've started having more and more suicidal thoughts, and I just need to figure out what to do before I make a bad decision.

I don't even know if I touched on everything I wanted to, but I need advice. I've asked my family, my friends, my doctors, everybody. I just can't stop feeling like there's no hope for myself. Dying seems like the best option, but I promised my family that I wouldn't do anything I couldn't take back, so, I'm still here.
