I'm back againI had finally gotten to a good place in life, and then it started. My long distance bf decided to move down to be with me. I was elated. His family and church were not.

I've been accused of demon possesion due to my mental health, told I was manipulative because I was "seducing" my bf so he would move down, called a monster because they said I told my bf I would kill myself if we broke up (I never said that. Him and I both can confirm that.), a wh\*re because my bf and I got caught sexting (And yeah, that didn't help my case....), and now him and I are not allowed to have any contact. If we attempt to contact, my bf will get kicked out for good this time (He was kicked out for a short time after the sexting mess got found out.).

His church and family are angry that he wants to move down. They insist that I move to where they live, but the only problem is that neither my bf or I want to be around them at all. They've done nothing but persecute us and try to tear us apart. 

He's the only thing that's kept me going, and now we're losing each other. I'm sick and tired of all of this, and I just want to quit. I love him, and he loves me, but us being together would cause such a mess that we may never be able to be together. There's no good answer to any of this. I'm just so stinking tired of it all.
