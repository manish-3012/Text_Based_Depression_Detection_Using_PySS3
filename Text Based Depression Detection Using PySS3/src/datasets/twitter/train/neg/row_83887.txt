I canâ€™t..Iâ€™m too scared to be without my wife because I know I will off myself.

Iâ€™ve been trying to be a better person but she does this thing where she tells me to leave, that sheâ€™s going to divorce me, and to never talk to her again. And then after, she takes me back or contacts me or something.

It is so sad to see how much this girl means to me. Because I know I mean so little to her.

I donâ€™t want to die but I donâ€™t want to feel like this anymore. I canâ€™t ride this outâ€”it hurts way too much.

Iâ€™m so sorry, mom.
