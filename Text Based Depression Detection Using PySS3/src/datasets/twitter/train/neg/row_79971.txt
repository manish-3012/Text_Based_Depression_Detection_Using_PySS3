Being trans is gonna be the death of meI hate being trans. I fucking hate it. What a miserable, pathetic existence. Itâ€™s fucking isolating. Cis people donâ€™t understand what itâ€™s like to feel trapped in your own body disgusted by it because it ISNâ€™T YOU. Itâ€™s the complete opposite of who you are. Everyday the dysphoria gets worse. I havenâ€™t transitioned yet idk if thereâ€™s a point if Iâ€™ll never have a cis male body. I didnâ€™t ask for this. I didnâ€™t choose this body, I donâ€™t want it. I hate looking at myself. Yeah I know thereâ€™s nothing wrong with the female body objectively. But itâ€™s not me. My experience is being female is shit. Not the social aspects cause men and women face their own difficulties, but the fact Iâ€™m a man in a womanâ€™s body. I am in hell. Hell is my own body. Even if I transition I will still have this piece of shit body that has already undergone female puberty. It will take thousands to get surgery. I will never have a dick that functions exactly like a cis manâ€™s. Whatâ€™s the fucking point if I still retain primary and secondary sex characteristics. Even if I pass as a man and everyone sees me as one at first glance, thatâ€™s not enough. There will be people that knew me before I transitioned. They will always have the memory of me as a â€œgirlâ€. Fuck that shit. I wonâ€™t be satisfied. Iâ€™ll never be happy. 

Every time I see cis men I think why couldnâ€™t that be me. If I were born a cis man I wouldnâ€™t be suffering like this. No one would doubt my gender, I say Iâ€™m male they donâ€™t think otherwise. Makes me feel fucking stupid when I even say Iâ€™m a (trans) guy. I donâ€™t look like one. Iâ€™ll always be less of a man. Dysphoria is driving me insane. Iâ€™m reminded every waking moment of what Iâ€™m not, and what I am. Iâ€™m getting tired of this. Iâ€™m a waste of space. There is no point in living if Iâ€™ll never be content with who I am. 

Why not kill myself and have everyone remember me as a woman. What a tragedy huh. I die and get remembered as the thing that destroyed me. This has been one sick joke of an existence.
