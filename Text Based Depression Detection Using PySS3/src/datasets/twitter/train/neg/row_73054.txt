i officially am done.posted here a few days ago, wanted to die then. today i realized iâ€™m very done. tried to kill my self freshman year after being raped and then just became happy recently when i got a boyfriend who i fell in love with very quickly and he wasnâ€™t even there for me on days when i panic about the rape and i never told anyone but him and then today he was making me feel bad told me he didnâ€™t care about being with me and so i decided that i canâ€™t make someone care about me my parents are very disappointed in me and how i am barely gonna graduate and my friends are not close anymore never really cared and so iâ€™m all alone. i think i shouldâ€™ve just died a while ago. i donâ€™t know what to do. iâ€™m sitting in my car contemplating how to do it and i guess i want someone to talk me off the ledge. ever since i was raped ive felt like nothing and nothing ever makes me feel. i hate myself. i hate how much of a pussy i am. i constantly care about people who donâ€™t care back and i donâ€™t wanna do it anymore. i canâ€™t do it anymore.
