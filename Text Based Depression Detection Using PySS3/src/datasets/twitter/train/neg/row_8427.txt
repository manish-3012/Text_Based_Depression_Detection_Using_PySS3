I'm loosing myselfFirst of all:
Sorry, for any grammatical mistakes, this ain't my mother tongue.
I'm clean with cutting for a few months now and even then it wasn't that bad. But lately I want to start again more and more. Not because it might be a good idea. But rather because I just need to feel the razors carving into my skin. I just want to feel at least something else than anger and sadness/depression again. But I apparently can't.
Funny thing is: I'm not even lacking self control. I'm just cold besides those two emotions. There is no joy/happiness, no excitement (not even about christmas, to me it's just gonna be a mixture of being piss drunk because I can't stand my relatives sober, and my relatives trying to get along before bursting out in screaming and discussing again), no fear, no love. I know that I will kill myself sooner or later. I know that this won't be the solution to my problems. But it tires me. In the end noone will care about me eventually. I'll just be a scarred memory of a nice guy.
