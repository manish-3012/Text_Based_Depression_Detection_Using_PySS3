I made a (non-exhaustive) list of the reasons I want to kill myself so badly* Most recently, I think cheated on my girlfriend by sexting with people. The terms of the relationship were unclear, and she had a boyfriend at the same time she was dating me but I still feel bad. I've always hated cheaters and I may have become one. I broke it off fairly soon after I caught myself.

* I had unprotected sex once at 15 and my parents found out about it. I can't stop thinking about what might have happened if I'd gotten pregnant and beating myself up over it.

* I have a lot of emotional trauma caused by my parents from over the years. I used to be able to go to my dad to talk about the stuff my mom did, but somewhere along the way he joined her side and also turned against me. This situations has made me constantly on-edge and angry when I'm around them (which is a lot of the time, as I still live with them).

* I have tinnitus which gets pretty bad when it's quiet around me. Apparently it's usually permanent and I don't want to live with it for the rest of my life.

* I am obsessed with a boy I hooked up with about 2 years and 3 months ago. He's been at college since August 2015 and hasn't had a conversation with me in person since the hook-up. I have absolutely no chance with him and I keep remembering all of the times he made me feel even worse about myself. At the time, I was already depressed due to the situation with my parents but adding this on made me even more vulnerable, and I often cut myself thinking about my parents and him and how none of them loved me even though they were supposed to.

* I have a very ugly face that has kept me from countless socializing opportunities because I didn't want others to be disgraced by my presence.

* (I know this one is weird...) I have oddly-shaped inner thighs that make it nearly impossible to stand/walk/run normally, and I don't think there's any way to fix it because it's mostly caused by muscle.

* My parents have gone through private emails of mine which revealed my sexual preferences and other extremely personal things without telling me. I was humiliated.

* I've stumbled upon cp several times (report it when I do) and I sometimes have nightmares related to it.

* I have really fucked up in terms of my gender. I came out as trans about a year and a half ago, and have been living as a man. My dysphoria got to the point where I tried to kill myself, but got caught. However, recently I've figured out ways to (mostly) keep it in check without wanting to mutilate myself anymore. It turns out that for me, like many people with Gender Dysphoria, it was a form of dissociation from deeper issues in my past. I am so embarrassed and feel like I'll let everyone down if they find out that I want to be a girl again and that I won't be transitioning.

* I have four mental illnesses: depression, anxiety, BPD, and obviously Gender Dysphoria. I'm severely fucked up to the point where I'm not even going to school anymore, but rather doing the work at home.

* I only have one friend who would miss me. Most other people didn't even notice that I've been gone from school for a month.

I don't know what I expect from posting this here. I guess I just hope to get more meaningful comments than I got on 4chan.
