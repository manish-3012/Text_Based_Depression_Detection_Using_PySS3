I don't know what I am doing any more, I want to give up so badly...I graduated college with a great degree two years ago, I have yet to have stable employment or anything resembling a career. (Yes, I have had my resume reviewed and told it was perfect from multiple professional resources so don't go there) I liver with my SO and have been falling him over and over again since I moved in with him after college. I'd find a job, do very well, then shortly get fired for some reason. 
I have always had a lot of pressure on me growing up to be successful and I got my degree and now everything feels like it was done for nothing and I am in a mountain of debt from my top ranked education.
I have networked, gone to networking parties, called back the day after, sent thank you cards, done everything in my power to get an interview and do well, but even when I do get a job, they change their minds shortly after and fire me.
I keep failing myself, my bf, my family, and his family...i can't take this any more, I have worked myself to the bone my entire life, all for nothing, all to be nothing...I can't live with myself anymore, my failures affect other people. I am a burden on my bf, but i can't leave because I have no money, I have no friends, my family had no room for me, it just feels like this world just doesn't want me, maybe I should just do it a favor and give up.
