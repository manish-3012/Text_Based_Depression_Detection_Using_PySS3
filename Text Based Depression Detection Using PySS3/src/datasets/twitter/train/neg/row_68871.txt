Times like these I wish nobody in real life loved me so I could just off myself without remorse.I've been battling with these thoughts for years. It's never going to end. It's just never going to end. I was having a good day and then I went walk my dog and heard something from a fucking podcast that triggered me and now I'm crying in my room with all of this anger inside of me that I can't shake off. And it's never going to end, and I'm always going to go back to feeling this way. Why even keep trying, why even keep pretending.     

I wish I was completely alone in the world, except for those Internet friends that aren't really friends because you never meet with them and when you do they are never interested in seeing you again. They're fun, but they don't really care about you. I wish I only had them so I could once and for all take my minimal bucket list for life, do whatever I can to do those things, rob a bank, do violent things I've always wanted to do but never could because it would get me in so much trouble, pretend that I'm someone that I'm not for a little while and then go back home and kill myself.     

There. Dreams done, nothing else I want from life. No pressure on becoming a succesful adult. No pressure on being rich, no pressure on being smart with your time on this earth, no pressure on being sane. I was never sane, I always felt a connection with love and violence and for the most part I couldn't act on it the way I wished. So just satisfy that part of me and then going.      

But no. I have a mom and dad and sister who love me and a couple of real life friends who would be pretty sad too. I have to take responsability, keep studying some useless degrees in the hope I can make something useful out of them, look happy, look good phyiscally, try to earn good money, start a family sometime, and live until I'm 102 (because if you're going to be old, you better be really really old, the queen of old people).       

Goodbye.
