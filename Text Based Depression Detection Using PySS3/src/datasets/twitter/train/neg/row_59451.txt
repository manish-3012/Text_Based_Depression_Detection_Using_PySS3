Today i really wanted to be run by a carHi everyone, i'm new here 
I just turned 25(F) and having suicidal thoughts every day. It gets deeper and like, closer. I think it would be such a relief. My only fear is that i will hurt familly and close friends. I live with my parents, unemployed. I pretty much draw everyday in my room, it seems like it has been like this forever. I used to live close to friends of mine and be independent. Always had really crushing sadness episodes. Now i have no purpose whatsoever. I only got loneliness and shit t
suicidal thoughts. No one really is sensitive to what i go through because i think none of them experienced it. I'm filled with anger, and i really wish i could end it.
