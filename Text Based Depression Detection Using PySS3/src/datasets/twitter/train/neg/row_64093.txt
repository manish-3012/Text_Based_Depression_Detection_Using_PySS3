I cant take this anymoreIve been bullied my entire life in every possible way all the way from 6th grade which took a terrible toll on me.. and whats making me really fucking upset is that now that i remember not even a single person gave a shit or did anything to help me at all when i was being bullied. My self esteem is non existent and i dont think ive felt any emotion whatsover for as long as i can remember. I have terrible trust issues and i cant make friends at all and even when i make some "friends" it feels like a one sided friendship and that theyre just putting up with me... i really cant take this anymore and want to end this shit.. i just recently turned 21 and im seeing no hope for the future... this may be well my last and only post on here ..
