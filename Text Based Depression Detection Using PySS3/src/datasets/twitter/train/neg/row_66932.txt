Should I get help?Good afternoon everyone. 

Let me start off by saying I've had suicidal thoughts for a long time. I can't remember when it all started, but it's not important now. Over the past year I have learned and been through quite a bit. I'm going to cut to the chase.

Recently, the thoughts have gotten constant, and I actually have started to follow through with my plans. I've been incredibly happy and everything feels right, and it's because in a sick way I know it might all end soon. Should I call the Suicide hotline? I'm not sure if my case warrants their time, but I also do not want to be institutionalized. 

I always felt very alone. Now it is overwhelming. If I do end up leaving, just know that I did what I had to do. What you all do here is very beautiful for people. I respect that. I don't know. I'm just lost.
