Iâ€™m gonna be leaving soon.I donâ€™t want too, but Iâ€™m developing schizophrenia. As it progressively gets worse I can feel my mental functions slowly degrading, Iâ€™m getting dumber. Iâ€™m losing my ability to have complex introverted thought. I struggle to communicate socially. Iâ€™m hyper conscious of everything. I cannot give up my ego and lifestyle to make this better, I know I could leave my work and become a gardener. But nothing is as good as the lifestyle I have now. Minimal work, lots of travel and good pay... all for 21 yo. Iâ€™m doing better than everyone my age really.

However I just canâ€™t let this go, I donâ€™t want to do anything else in life. And I also donâ€™t want my family to see me become worse with SZ. I already feel like they donâ€™t really accept me. The hardest thing for me is my little brother man, I went to a concert with him in the weekend but canâ€™t even fucking laugh or smile any more. I donâ€™t really care about anything else on earth other than him. So Iâ€™m going to leave him a bunch of cash to travel and enjoy the world, he can have the happiness I canâ€™t experience anymore.

And another big theme in my life is: no one has ever loved me. Someone like me should never have problems getting a gf. But my whole life my falling point has been social skills, and after a string of failed relationships and girls wanting me just for a hookup had left me feeling like shit. I canâ€™t take anymore rejection. Itâ€™s devastating.

I have a plan over the next few months. Iâ€™m getting my shit together. Then booking flights overseas, the nicest balcony hotel I can for 30 days and a buying lot of coke and lsd. Then when Iâ€™m at my lowest comedown, Iâ€™ll jump.
