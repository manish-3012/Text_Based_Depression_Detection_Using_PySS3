Just a loser writing some shit, sry for wasting your time if you read this fullyI often wonder how good it'll be if I was not born at all. Or how good it'll be if I could just die today or if I don't wake up tomorrow.

I often fantasize about me killing myself And it feels honestly good. Like won't I have to die someday right why suffer till then. Why wait to eat your food until it's noon just eat it whenever you feel like it, or whenever you want it why wait and suffer. But I guess a pussy like me can't decide when i can I guess. 

I honestly hate this survival of the fittest game that we play. But hating it won't change anything, writing about it won't change anything. I know.

But the crazy things is we're often ignorant, we don't care about other people unless they have something to do with us. I guess it's just who we are but I wish someone would find like an cheap and an painless way to die. Like how abt a pill if you swallow it you won't feel anything and you'll be dead just like that. I bet that person will become a millionaire in a few weeks
