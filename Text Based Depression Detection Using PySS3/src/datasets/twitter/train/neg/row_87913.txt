Death would be so good right now.I was disgnosed with Chronic Suicidal Ideations, last time I went to the hospital I simply was told I would not kill my self. Why? Because apparently I had a loving family (itâ€™s true) and I just wouldnâ€™t.  I think about ways to die every day. Today I came up with 90 ways I could die. 10 of which would be painless. 5 look like an accident, 10 look like murder. The others just be there. The only reason I had to live was my dog, who now is sick. I donâ€™t know if I can handle this.

every night i pray to god, asking to be let out of this torture we call life. Every morning when I wake up I cry for a half hour, because Iâ€™m alive. When I finally get up I have to pretend to be happy for my family.    


when I do open to my family my mom just starts crying and I normally end up saying I wonâ€™t and promisig. I do not break my promises. Even to die. I just wish I could convince myself that tomorrow will be a good day.
