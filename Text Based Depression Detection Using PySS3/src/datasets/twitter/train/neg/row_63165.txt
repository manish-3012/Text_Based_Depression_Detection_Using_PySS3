Lost faith in humanityWhat with everything that is happening with the Presidential Election, people shouting at each other in the streets over childish debates. One of my closest friends came out and said that he didn't mind "locker room talk", which made me rethink and mistrust pretty much everyone that I know. I thoroughly despise my father and stepmother, taking their opinions as even more ignorance and pointing fingers. I don't believe that they would truly miss me if I were to kill myself, and when I've tried voicing my feelings to them, they tell me that I am only delusional and hormonal. If this continues for any longer, I'm most likely to jump from a building. I am not afraid if this is my last year alive. I simply don't want to live in a world that is so consumed with selfishness and greed.
