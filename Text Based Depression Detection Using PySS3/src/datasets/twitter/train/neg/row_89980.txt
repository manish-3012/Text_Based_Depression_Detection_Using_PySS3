Fuckin nothing to live for anymore after what I saidI made a slightly sexist statement about the new WAP song and dance and have now had the entire year level and more worth of girls send me threatening messages as well as a public feud with one girl in particular about it and had my one main female friend group cut me out as they all hate me now. To make it even better my girl best friend told me she isn't going to talk to me much until I sort my self out although within the arguments had my opinion had changed but no one believes. All I had before this was my two guys best mates and her but now with her pretty much ditching me, it makes it so hard to have anything to look forward to. Where I live we are in a stage four lockdown and have no will to live at all as all I hear is hate and can't talk about it to my mates as they are opposed to me.

I have nothing to look forward to or get excited about. I have nothing left and just pain. Would kill myself in an instant if it meant my mother and brother and father would not have to live with the pain.

JUST WANT TO END IT ALL AND NO ONE KNOWS and no one would care because I'm public enemy #1
