I Can't Take It Anymore!I'm currently attending high school as a junior. When I was growing up, I knew I was always different from the others. Now, they make fun of me, and treat me like garbage everywhere I go. I'm on the brink, and I need help. They always call me Gayrex, Kylorex, faggotrex, arex, and nigrex just because I have posture like a dinosaur and a larger than average nose. I feel like life isn't worth living anymore.
