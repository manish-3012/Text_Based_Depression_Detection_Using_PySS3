I think at some point I will end up taking my life.I am 17 and have been on and off suicidal since I was 11. I suffer from PTSD, and depression and anxiety that comes along with it. Iâ€™ve been trying to get therapy for over a month now and I canâ€™t get it. Sometimes I am doing really well, but there are times like right now where I feel like I have no hope left.

My friends are lovely, but Iâ€™ve had a rough year and everything feels so strange now. My best friend was diagnosed with cancer, I had acted out on a different friend because I didnâ€™t know how to cope, and I live every day filled with guilt. I donâ€™t know how to forgive myself for the things I did to her. We are working on our relationship now to make it healthier but I feel so alone sometimes. I know that Iâ€™m not but if I talk to people about how I feel then thatâ€™s just making them feel like they are responsible for my feelings and puts so much pressure on them. My family is lovely but together we are quite broken. They donâ€™t work on their problems or try to fix them. And Iâ€™ve tried. The only reason I havenâ€™t taken my own life is because somewhere in me I have always had the slightest bit of hope and optimism and I donâ€™t even know what for. I just donâ€™t know what to do. I donâ€™t want to upset the people around me or let people know Iâ€™m in a dark place again.

I feel lost and I wish someone would give me a hug. I know loving yourself is important but I feel like I need a reminder that someone else does too.
Thatâ€™s all, Iâ€™ll be okay, but I just wanted to talk.
