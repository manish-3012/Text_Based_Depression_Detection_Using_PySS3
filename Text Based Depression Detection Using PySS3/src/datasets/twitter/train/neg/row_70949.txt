People should be allowed to kill themselves and there shouldn't be such a stigma about itIt's like some people just get branded by the universe or whatever and totally fucked over and over. No matter how hard you try to fight you're met with failure, each time beating you down harder than you ever thought possible. Each time discovering a new rock bottom. And then when you've finally felt like you've been ass raped by life long enough even your suicide is this complicated joke where people are just left justifying themselves and sucking each other's dicks saying "it wasn't your fault no no" you get blamed in the end for this cruel joke. You don't even get respect when you die. But I guess fuck it none of it will matter on the other side.
