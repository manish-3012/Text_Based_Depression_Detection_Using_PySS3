Sorry for the long post...I'm honestly almost done. I don't know how much longer I can go on. All I'm doing is living a lie, and there's really NOTHING I can do to change it. Every day feels like I'm walking around in a life that I never asked for, never wanted, and a body that I can't believe is mine. I wake up everyday, and seeing myself in the mirror is the beginning of the thoughts that haunt me all day, every day. 
"You'll never fit in."
"Your so ugly."
"You suck at everything. Why do you even try anymore?"
"What are you even doing with your life?"
And so on, and so forth. I'm so done, and I'm so desperate to make it stop. I just want to be happy, but nothing I'm doing is helping. Please help me!
