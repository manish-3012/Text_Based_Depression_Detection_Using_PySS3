Never thought I would post here. Suicidal thoughts won't go away.Hi. I'm having trouble. I'm M 22yo, living at home, working, going to school, and playing music in a band. Most people would say I have a good life. I'm not a bad person, but there are things about me that I absolutely hate. I'm just worried that, at the way I'm going, everything is only going to get worse. I make terrible decisions. I know I spend too much time thinking about myself. I'm afraid to make new friends, find a girlfriend, and basically do something with my life. I feel like a huge pussy because of all of this. I've been having suicidal thoughts for a couple years, since I stopped swimming pretty much. I feel like I have no purpose. I can't talk to my friends about it anymore, it honestly doesn't seem like I have any sometimes. They all have more important things, and I'm just here. I don't seem to want anything, I just exist. I can't stand this feeling, and I want to know how abnormal it is, or what I can do to escape it. I hate thinking about how of my life I'm wasting like this, and if it is really like this, why bother? On top of that, I'm totally in love with someone I can never have, but am around constantly. I can't see that being positive for my situation, so I thought I'd mention it. I don't think I could follow through with anything, but this feeling is destroying me and I just want help. I want to be a better person, but I don't know how to bring myself to do so. Thank you everyone
