thanks to this subreddit and /r/depression i have decided not to kill myself,but i still need your help (one last time ) hi dear  [/r/SuicideWatch](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch)   
thanks to many redditors who commented here and on  [/r/depression](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression) i have decided to stay around for a bit and fight for myself and not to kill myself,now i have to confront my parents about how i have to repeat my first year in college (just the second semester) and i dont know how i will tell them this huge new i mean all of my other brothers passed the first years easily,and my father got back from hospital like last month,im afriad if i tell them this he will get worse  
at the same time im afriad they will hear this from the uni herself and think that i were lying to them,which is even worse and maybe will bring back to me bad memories
