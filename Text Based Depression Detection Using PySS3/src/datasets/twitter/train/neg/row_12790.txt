Should I post on Facebook?My effing car broken down which means I'm stranded alone until it's fixed and have to wait until Monday.  

I was even going to try to get presents for people. I guess they'll have to pick me up. 

Monday night, I guess. 

I don't know why I keep going to work. 

I wasn't going to leave a note. But then I saw someone I lived with defriended me on FB. I was thinking since so many people just effing hate me because of the abuse and/or because I started drinking again after I got back with him, to say if you know someone who's in an abusive relationship, don't turn away or blame them, learn about it and help them find support groups. 

Woke up terrified from a nap (again). Just want this to be over.
