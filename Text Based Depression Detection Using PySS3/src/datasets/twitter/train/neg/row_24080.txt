Does it Matter? Who cares anyways. Should I run away?I wonder sometimes weather I should take my life or not. To be honest I donâ€™t think anyone cares about me. Which is fine that only makes killing myself a lot easier. 

For starters nobody would know that Iâ€™m gone if I disappeared for a long time. I was thinking of maybe starving myself to death, or possibly shooting myself a couple of times. Iâ€™m not sure but I donâ€™t plan on staying alive any longer cause their is no future for me,I will kill myself at some point thats for certain. I donâ€™t have the mentality of someone who thinks right. 

I have extreme anxiety and Borderline Personality Disorder

And no I donâ€™t wanna see a therapist, its a waste of time to even attempt helping me. There are people who actually need the help and its a waste of my parents money. 

If you read this Iâ€™d love to know some methods to end your own life, if not thats fine. Iâ€™ll find some method eventually.
