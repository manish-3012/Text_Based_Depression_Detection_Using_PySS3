I am a sensitive, lonely little shitFor starters, im 16. Everyone that has been around me thinks so to be honest. Which is why i push away people who try to be my friend easily. its getting to the point where I cant be involved in anything anymore. even my mother is starting to see the mistake she made in having me. 


its meant for me to suicide, and thats that. it looks as if its my only way out tbh
