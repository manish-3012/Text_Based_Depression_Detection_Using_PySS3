I want to kill myself but what about my family/friends?I'm 18 and I've been sick for 5 years now. I have gotten lots of help, but I still don't see the point of living. Everyone will eventually die and I don't believe we will end up in heaven nor hell. I'm very sensitive and it hurts all the time. I'm anxious about everything and constantly depressed.

I have tried to kill myself before, but I was clumsy and drunk both times so it obviously didn't happen. I am certain that I'm gonna do it some time, but I don't want to put my family and friends through it. Even though I feel like nobody could ever love me it would probably hurt them very much. They would start to think about what they could have done etc. 

I don't know why I'm posting this. I'm not asking for anything. Nobody could ever love me or help me. I'm just ranting I guess.
