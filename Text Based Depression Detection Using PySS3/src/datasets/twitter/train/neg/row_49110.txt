I couldn't do itI undid the slack in my clothes line and wrapped it around my neck. I guess I was too lazy to make a proper noose, just like I'm too lazy to do anything else in life. I ended up just standing on a chair for a bit with a rope around my neck before I had a panic attack and let myself down to cry. I'm just too much of a coward to even kill myself.
