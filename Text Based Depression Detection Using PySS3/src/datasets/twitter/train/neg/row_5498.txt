If my school doesn't close from monday on i'll kill myself on halloweenI just cant take it anymore and school makes it so much worse. i have piles of unfinished work but i can't deal with all of this anymore. i have a plan for my suicide, i'm currently writing my last notes for my family etc.

Maybe when i become just another part of some statistic in the end I'll finally contribute something to this world.

stay safe y'all
