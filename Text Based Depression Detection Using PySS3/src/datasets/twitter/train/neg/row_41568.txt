Envious fuckIâ€™m just a fucking mess. I donâ€™t do nothing every day. I return from the school, turn on my computer and spend the whole day till the midnight surfing the Internet or playing video-games. I tried some apps to remind me to do some productive activities but I just donâ€™t manage to do them. My best friend is making thousand bucks a month doing almost nothing and Iâ€™m just sitting here being envious and I feel so bad for it because we really appreciate each other. 

I donâ€™t even take my meds (zoloft) because I donâ€™t want to mix them with alcohol I take sometimes with my friends. Thatâ€™s the only thing I enjoy which is fucking pathetic. I donâ€™t study at home I donâ€™t go to the gym I planned in my mind I donâ€™t do nothing Iâ€™m just depressed. When I go to school I stop being depressed and start being fucking anxious as hell. 

What the fuck do I do
