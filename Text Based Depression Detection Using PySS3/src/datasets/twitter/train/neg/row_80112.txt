somebody please helpI wrote up a suicide note and tried to kill myself today. I sat at my favorite spot nobody else knows on the way home from work and tried to overdose on as many OxyContins as I could.

But I guess Iâ€™m such a failure I canâ€™t even kill myself right. 

I guess I should be glad I didnâ€™t do any serious harm to my body it seems, other than feeling hungover and malnourished. But I canâ€™t help but feel so fucking angry.

I donâ€™t know what else to do at this point. I feel so selfish for being alive but I feel so selfish for wanting to kill myself. I donâ€™t deserve to be here.
