If anyone is around to talk i would appreciate itI cant get ahold of the few friends ive got and my ex wont say a word to me even though she knows im suicidal. What is the point of continuing on, i cant do anything right ill never meet another girl like her i think i should just shoot myself it feels like the best option right now. I cant think to do my college work i cant eat i cant sleep i cant meet people because its online :'( all i can do is be down and hope someone calls me or reaches out but no one will i feel like a bullet is seriously the best option. Ive thought about jumping, drowning, poisoning, death by train, hanging , but blowing my brains out seems like the best option.
