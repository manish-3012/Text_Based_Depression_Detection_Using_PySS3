I should jump off my rooftop todayI fantasize pf going to my rooftop and jumping. My mother would care more about the funeral costs and ow this makes her look to everybody else. My father will get over it and my sister is so small that sheâ€™ll barely remember me.

My friends say they love me, but theyâ€™re better off without me. Everyone is. Iâ€™m sitting on wasted potential, Iâ€™m fucking useless and canâ€™t get anything right. I could help find the cure for cancer or any other prestigious thing reserved for people with â€œpotentialâ€ that I donâ€™t want to do, or maybe I could be an engineer once I get out of high school, but none of what I have is enough. Iâ€™m useless and Iâ€™ll always be.

I push people away all the time. Fuck I just want to get away and jump, I donâ€™t even believe in the afterlife, I want to give up and let this be over. But I donâ€™t, there are thoughts drilled into my head that this is wrong and there has to be another way, and I just donâ€™t know what to listen to anymore.
