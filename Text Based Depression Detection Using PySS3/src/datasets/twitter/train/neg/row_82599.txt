Reliving Life Makes Me Want to End ItI ruminate on things for days in the vague hope that it will somehow give me control. People always talk about how thinking back on every little faux pas is normal- the sort of lying awake at night, reliving some embarrassing childhood memory. But no- I have to imagine myself back in every conversation, in every place. I remember every stutter, every silence, every moment of unsolicited eye contact. It's like I'm watching a cringe movie. I have to drop what I'm doing just so I can relive these moments. 

To top things off, of course I would think the most logical response would be to off myself, like I'd teach myself some bizarre lesson. That's my main problem, though. Part of my really wishes every time I said something stupid or awkward or other negatively-associatived words, whoever I was speaking to would just slap me. That way, I wouldn't have to fucking hurt myself with a lighter or a blade or- anything. I keep ignoring these issues, and any people who might be involved and thus able to help. I want to talk about everything and nothing all at the same time. I feel isolated, even when I'm with other people. There's always the happy feeling of being a burden to keep me company. 

Things keep bumping up in intensity. Years ago, I started just apologizing like a pushover twat for every small mistake. Even if it wasn't my fault, I would somehow *make* it my fault. Later came the self harm, first implemented for rather extreme social mistakes before supplanting itself as a "Part B" to the apologizing. Now I get to wanting to add a Part C, so to speak. The final test- one and done. I keep writing the note in my head, and in my mind I'm so articulate in what I want to say. Hell- a lot of that found its way into this post. And then I keep thinking about how I'd do it- I don't want it to be messy. I don't know why I'm here anymore. I don't know why I started writing this. I don't know why I bother with anything anymore
