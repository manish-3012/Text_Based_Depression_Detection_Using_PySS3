My life is for once not complete shit but my urge to kill myself was never bigger.I am nearly 20 years old now and until recently I was that typical big fat guy who got Bullied in school. In Middle and Highschool I Just had some "Friends" in school which I never met with after school. Everyone else hated me. In that Time I came Home crying everyday but I never wanted to kill myself. Maybe I was too Young to realise that that wouldve been an Option too. After that I tried to learn PC Stuff but at the Place I worked No one cared for me. I could sleep for 3 hours and no one would mind it. Now I started to become a Kindergarden Teacher (sorry dont know the right way to call it). I Love my Classmates and I Love the Job itself. I am often Meeting my Classmates after school and I hang out with them a lot but my urge to Kill myself was never so big. I am depressed and I hate myself. I really want a Girlfriend and I talked to my female Friends about that. They told me I am too shy and they know that I have no self-esteem. The fact that I really Like a Girl but I know that I have no chance whatsoever isnt helping either. I Just dont know what to do. I was never so Happy and so sad at the same time.
