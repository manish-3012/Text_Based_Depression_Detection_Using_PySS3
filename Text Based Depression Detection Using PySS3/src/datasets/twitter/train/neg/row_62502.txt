I start to feel really suicidal and angry and like I just want my life to end any time anyone talks about their husband/wife, boyfriend/girlfriend, even close friends. I just can't bear it and I wish I could cut myself open and die.Some guy just told me how he was going to be hanging out this weekend with his SO. I just want to bleed out all over my floor and end this life. I just wish my knives were sharper.
