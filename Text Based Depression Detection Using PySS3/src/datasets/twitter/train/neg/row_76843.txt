Holy shit, I'm a terrible humanAfter my first real relationship ended, I took it pretty hard, and as a result I said nasty things to my ex. That was mistake number one. Mistake number two was continuing to message her after she told me she wanted nothing to do with me. Why did I do this? I guess I wanted to try and amend my wrongdoings, but made it even worse by not leaving her the fuck alone. Third mistake: I continually stalked her social media for awhile (like some sort of addiction), and she does not have good things to say about me. One thing that stuck out to me was how I didn't really respect her bisexuality (as in fetishizing her having sex with other women). After all of this, I feel like a complete and utter pile of shit. I've realized I'm a horrible person. I want to be better, but the call to fuck off and die rings in my head very loud and clear. Also, I have a girlfriend, she thinks I'm great, but doesn't realize I'm a lousy piece of shit, that is also completely bat shit insane. I never loved myself, and have struggled with suicidal thoughts for many years. I have no idea how to recover and actually be a better person.
