18, looking to dieIâ€™m only 18 but I hate myself to the point of wanting to end it. First I hate myself, all my dumb mistakes, my lack of friends, my horrendous appearance. I look in the mirror and I hate everything I see. Second, I donâ€™t have the future everyone expects of me. My parents wanted me to go to college and be successful but my grades are awful, and theyâ€™ve said to me before that Iâ€™m worthless without a degree. My grandparents saved up money for me to go to college but I havenâ€™t been accepted anywhere. Iâ€™ve been debating suicide for months, when Iâ€™m alone I think about it a lot actually. I realize I â€œhave my whole life ahead of meâ€ but thereâ€™s no life if Iâ€™m worthless, alone, depressed stuck in this shithole I call my home town. I want to end it
