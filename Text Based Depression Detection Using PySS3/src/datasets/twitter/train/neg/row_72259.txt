Not helpingtoday I decided to talk to my mother about my depression. she once talked to me about it but i convinced her it was nothing serious but i just feel she doesn't get. she just wants me to snap out of it. as if i could. she even told me buying new things, or taking be to get body laser and making myself pretty would fix it. would fix what i am feeling. i desperately told her these things would only work for a second but not make me feel any better. now i feel even worse. i drink a handful of sleeping pills every day to wake up very late. that way i dont have to deal with myself awake too long. i am sleeping everytime. and numb. i wish i could end it all i just am not brave enough to do it myself.
