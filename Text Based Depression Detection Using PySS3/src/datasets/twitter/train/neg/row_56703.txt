I can't life. I don't want life.Sorry

I can't even write this because my eyes are filled with too much tears. Maybe this is something like a suicide note. I don't even know if anyone reads this or understand it (I am not a native english speaker).

I'm a 20yr old game programmer student. It's hard but i think its a cool job. I graduate this October. But how the fuck should i live with a 40h job then. I don't even start living. I wasted my time with idiotic videogames. I realized to late that there is a real world, a world with a sun. But now i am to fucking old, supposed to work the whole day, in a small office, without a life. I love the nature. I wish I could leave this fucking city with too much "cold" people and live elsewhere near forests and lost places. I like Oregon's coast in the US. I will go there when I have money. I want to work outside, I want to be free and not a slave of this cruel world.


I will kill myself while I'm young.


I am broken and tired. Nobody knows. Nobody cares. I "smile", i'm "happy", but I AM FUCKING DEAD. No friends, nobody I can talk to.

Graduate, move elsewhere, run towards a cliff, jump, cry. That's how I want it to end. I cant imagine anything else. This will be my last year on earth.

Sorry.
