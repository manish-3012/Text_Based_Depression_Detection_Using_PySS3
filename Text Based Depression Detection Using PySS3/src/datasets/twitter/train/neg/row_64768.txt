Iâ€™m so sick of everythingIâ€™m so sick of feeling alone and not enough
Iâ€™m sick of waking up and having more reasons to not want to be here than to want to be here
Iâ€™m sick of everyone leaving
Iâ€™m sick of not being good enough
Iâ€™m sick of this feeling and putting everyone before myself
Iâ€™m sick of not doing it just to save the emotions of people who donâ€™t even care about me
Iâ€™m just sick of going on like this and nothing is helping
