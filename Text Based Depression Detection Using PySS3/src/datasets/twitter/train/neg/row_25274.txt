Iâ€™m scared Iâ€™m still abusiveWhen I was younger, not on meds and out of control, etc.; I was really abusive to friends and family and my boyfriend at the time. I constantly think about suicide, I still do, I got diagnosed with chronic suicidal ideation so thatâ€™s not gonna change. I also have BPD. 
But when I say younger I mean, like, 13/14/15. Iâ€™m 17 now and Iâ€™m terrified Iâ€™m still that way. Someone I had cut out for being toxic tried to get into my friend group and I couldnâ€™t handle it so it split the friend group up. They said I was abusive. And I know Iâ€™m not really getting any detail, I donâ€™t really need anyone to msg me on this. 
I just want to die. Ever since they accused me of being abusive I canâ€™t function. Itâ€™s as if Iâ€™m so scared to talk to anyone in fear of being that person. I can barely do schoolwork, I canâ€™t eat I canâ€™t sleep and I canâ€™t work â€” My job is as a cosplay model, and I love it, but whenever I go to work on my wigs I just... canâ€™t. Thereâ€™s like a block. 
I havenâ€™t done anything for the past 2 weeks. I feel like Iâ€™m wasting away again because Iâ€™m abusive to my friends. And I just canâ€™t do this anymore.
