Why do I feel like thisThis is my first reddit post. I'm 16, struggling with school, had a hard time making friends (I only have 4) the first girl that asked me out said 'say no, I don't like you, it was just a dare.' Covid is getting to me badly, I'm depressed and I just feel like ending it all. Why? Why do I feel like this? I just need some support.
