Im scared I'm gonna do something stupidI don't want to kill my self, but over the last month I've been more and more tempted by the idea, I just feel like I'm a worthless loser and that no one cares about me even though I do have a pretty close group of friends, I feel like every day the thought of it happening seems more and more realistic, I'm scared that by Summer I might try to kill myself
