I'm so tired.I hate every day. I push myself so hard and I always end up having an emotional break down after a few days. I can only keep my self together for so long. Ever since I broke up with my (now ex) girlfriend about a month ago, I've been feeling very lonely even though I was miserable towards the end of the relationship. I don't think about it because I hate thinking about, but I still feel empty. I just want to be understood by someone. My parents or friends don't understand how overwhelmed I feel everyday. I wish someone could see the pain that I'm in. I want someone to love me and be there for me. I have a hard time just desiring to be happy because its so fucking hard it seems like its not worth it. I feel like giving up everyday... but somehow, for some reason I still keep on going.

 UPDATE: I was crying really hard late at night. My mom was down stairs and I thought maybe she could give me a hug to cheer me up or something. Then my fucking step dad comes down stairs and tells me to stop feeling sorry about myself because I have nothing to worry about. I felt like screaming, which I did into a pillow. My parents then say I'm obviously not ready for college and they don't want to deal with me, so they want to send me to my dads and get a job in that area. I was thinking "Well fuck. I already feel horrible and now I'm going to have to move and leave what little friends I do have. Fuck my fucking shitty ass fucking life. FUCK."
