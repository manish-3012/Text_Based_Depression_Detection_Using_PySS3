My husband cheated and I can live with it.I found out that my husband has been hooking up over several years. Nothing long term, just one offs. I have always felt that I have never been able to make him happy sexually, he always want more, bjs or annal, things that I just find completely disgusting. I always thought why do I have to do these things when I just gag when I think about it. In the last three years I have had a lot of medical problems so even less sex.  I feel so responsible for it. I ended up in hospital for thoughts of suicide. My depression is jut off the charts and my panic attack have kept me at home so now we are having financial problems. I just canâ€™t take it anymore.
