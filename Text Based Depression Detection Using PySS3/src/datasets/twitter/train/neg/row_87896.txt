Somebody help meMany of you may not be in the UK and won't fully understand what I'm on about, but here goes.

Tomorrow, I have two exams in  GCSE English lit and RE. In both I'm expected to get A*s. I haven't prepared for either. I can't think legibly or coherently and I promised myself I would revise for 16 hours each day. In short, I didn't because I'm so depressed. 

Many of you may be thinking it's puerile of me to commit suicide for such a trivial reason. But our exam system here is so fucked up   and the pressure to do well is crushing. I plan to commit suicide this morning by hanging and I'm well and truly done for if I don't. 

What the hell should I do?
