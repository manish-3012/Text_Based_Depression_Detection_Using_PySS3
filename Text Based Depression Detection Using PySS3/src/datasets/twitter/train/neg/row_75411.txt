I can't redeem myself fuck thisI'm crying as i write this. I'm sorry if this is a ramble i need to let this out I can't talk to my family or friends or even counsellors about this without fucking everything up beyond belief I hate the fact that what I did when i was young could very well have ruined my sisters life and also my own ([This](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/evetfg/feeling_horrific_i_realised_i_abused_my_younger/) is what I'm refering to) and the only thing keeping me from ending it right now is my family and my girlfriend and the knowledge they'd be heartbroken, but I don't even deserve them. This is  coming out as nonsense I'm sorry but I need to let this out this is the closest I've been to a suicidal thought and I don't know where else to post this but yeah. I'm sorry to everyone out there whos been affected by someone like me I really am and for being such a selfish PoS. I shouldn't be the one complaining and I completely understand that I really just can't hold this in any longer.
