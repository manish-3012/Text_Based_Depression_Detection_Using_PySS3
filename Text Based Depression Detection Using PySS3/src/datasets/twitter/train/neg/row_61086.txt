i can't stop thinking about killing myselfi'm so sick and tired of living. my family and "friends" dont make me happy and/or satisfied. i'm incredibly selfish and a fucking horrible person. i'm just hoping someone will stop me before it's too late. i need help. i used to go to a therapist but she could never help me. no one wants to give me medication. i have severe anxiety and stress with depressive characteristics, according to my psychological eval. i'm either emotionally dead or completely fucked up with feelings. i havent had a positive emotion in what feels like years. i feel like i've always been bad, but this year it's gotten so bad. i've fucked my life up. i dont study, i dont socialise, i just starve myself, eat too much or too little, practically starving myself these days, don't exercise or push my body to it's limit, engage in reckless behaviour, do smoke, smoke up, drink, punch walls, i dont let myself sleep i'm constantly angry and upset. i'm fucking up my relationships with my friends and family. i loathe myself to the point where i don't give a fuck about what i do to myself anymore. i'm a fucking mess and i want to fucking die. thank you for reading till this point. thank you for reading through my pointless rant with my fucking stupid talk. i can't stopping thinking about suicide and death.
