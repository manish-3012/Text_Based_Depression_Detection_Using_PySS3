Where does the soul go once one committs Suicide?Part of the reason why I'm still here is because I'm afraid of not going to heaven. I believe that hell is on Earth, so there's nothing worse than that.
What if my soul stays here forever as a form of punishment and I never get to see my loved ones that are gone? 
It may seem like a silly thing to think about that to some of you, but I really wanna rest in peace once I'm gone.
