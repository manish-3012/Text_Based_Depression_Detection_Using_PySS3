Time 2 endI just think the world would be better without me. 
I've thought this way off and on since I was 10 and no one's really proven otherwise. 

The only reason I'm not right this minute is because I don't want my fiancee to be responsible for my kids and I can't trust grandparents to not make their lives terrible. Like, I'm the moron who got pregnant by their dad, it's not their fault they exist and it's not my fiance's fault that I had them before we were together. 

I don't know if I can wait for my youngest is be 18 but I guess I'll try for now, just to be responsible. She heard me crying earlier and tried to comfort me and I felt even worse. Like who makes their kids try to comfort them when they're being a selfish bitch. 

I don't know. I haven't felt this bad in a long while. But I have no idea why he agreed to marry me. Maybe I'll make sure to have enough life insurance so he's not stuck with my debt. Maybe that will make it a little better, the time he's wasting with me. 

I'm sorry for the rambling. I just don't have another outlet.
