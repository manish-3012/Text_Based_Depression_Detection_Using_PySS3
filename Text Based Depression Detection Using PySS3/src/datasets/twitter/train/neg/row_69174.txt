Missing out on the "Teenage Experience"?I became home schooled due to my social anxiety a few years ago, and although it has helped (somewhat) I can't help but feel like I'm missing out on valuable time and experiences in my life because of my situation. I am currently 17, turning 18 in some time and I just feel like my time as a teenager is over.

I never got to experience a real high school. Or push through awkward experiences with friends or girls. Since leaving public school my relationships with other people ended and I have no friends and rarely go outside. I have been feeling this sort of "ending of teenage youth" building for months now and recently after seeing something in the mall I came home and broke down crying as all of this hit me. On one hand I feel like leaving school because of my social anxiety was stupid because I caused myself to miss out on these experiences. On the other I feel like I had to leave to stop myself from getting worse mentally, even though I feel like in the long run me isolating myself might have done far worse than being anxious non-stop in school would have. But I can't say for sure.

Ill keep this short but there's so much going on in my thoughts that I left out or else this post would be much longer. I'm just at a loss for what to do. My depression and issues come in "waves" if that makes any sense. I will have bad to severe months and sometimes its like the issues with my brain and thinking turn off and ill have 2 weeks where its like my old self is coming back until something flips in my brain again and the next 2 months are a constant battle I fight in my own head because I don't talk to anyone. I fully realize how insane I must sound to some people but I hope I conveyed my feelings properly. I have no clue, and it pains me every time I think about it.
