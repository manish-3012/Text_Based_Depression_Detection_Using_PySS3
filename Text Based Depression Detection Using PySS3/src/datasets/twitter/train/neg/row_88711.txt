nobody wants meboyfriend gone. everyone else just wants me for sex, nobody cares about me as a person. iâ€™m annoying to everyone. iâ€™m sick of this. been living in this hell for years. i want out. i feel nothing now. iâ€™m tired. i might kill myself this weekend on sunday, had my last meal today.
