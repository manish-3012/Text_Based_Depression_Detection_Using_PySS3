I want to kill myself, but i just can't.Everytime i get in my car i want to get in a wreck. I want to die, but i can't kill myself because i know there are people that care about me that would be devastated if i died, but much worse if i killed myself. I get why everyone says suicide is selfish. I just don't have the desire to want to do anything anymore.
