I hate myself and my life and I think about suicide all the timeI just turned 18 and Iâ€™m miserable. I have a loving supporting mom, dad, and brother however my household feels like itâ€™s filled with stress, resentment, and anxiety. I was abused as a child and I am horrified of what I have become. Every-time I look in a mirror I wish I could put a bullet in my brain. Iâ€™m overweight and am currently eating myself to death because of an eating disorder that my parents donâ€™t seem to care much about, and my brother is the only person I really have in my life anymore. But he is a normal functioning human with tons of friends and I have no one. Iâ€™ve never felt more alone and this much hatred towards myself ever before. Iâ€™m constantly tired and have no will or motivation to really do anything other than sleep. Iâ€™ve lost interest in things I used to love and just feel like a husk at this point. I donâ€™t even try and talk to girls anymore because I know Iâ€™m so hideous to look at that there is no point in trying. I have one close friend but he barley texts me. I try to keep myself distracted from how unhappy I am by playing video games and sleeping but I donâ€™t know how much longer I can do that for. I have an awful compulsive lying habit that I would do anything to be able to stop but I just canâ€™t. I try and put on a facade so my family doesnâ€™t get worried because they are all great people and they donâ€™t deserve to have a burden like me. Iâ€™ve had 3 plans to commit suicide and actually went through with one of them, which landed me in residential rehab for two months, and I was so traumatized by that place that even the thought of going back to one makes me instantly think of suicide. The only reason I donâ€™t want to do it is because of my family because I know how much it would impact them, because they tell me all the time that if I killed myself that they would never forgive me, never move on, and that their lives would be ruined forever. I donâ€™t know what to do and Iâ€™m just so lonely and Iâ€™m so much pain and anguish and I just want it to be over without hurting my family. Thanks for reading.
