Why shoudn't i do itI am completely failed human being. I have severe stuttering and I'm on the autism spectrum. I have 0 social skills and severe social anxiety. The only friend I have ever had died to overdosing. If there was a technology to spot a person like me before I could have developed any futher, I should have been aborted. I cant find a job, nobody would hire me. I am just a rat on the tax payer.

Staying sober and drinking only weekends is an achievement to me. The only reason I haven't ended it all yet is drug abuse. Nothing else has made my life feel tolerable than abusing ADHD meds, cannabis and alcohol. 

Adult life won't bring anything new to me. My body is getting weaker, I can't eat as much I used to without getting fat, my eyes get red with too much staring the screen and I get worse hangovers.

I am so isolated that my mother tongue has started to degenerate. My English isn't the best but I have to google what different words mean much more often when I am chatting in Finnish.

I have so bad social anxiety, that I couldn't finish the high school. I used to hide in the bathroom for hours because I feared so much seeing other people. That's why my English is so bad, I'm basically going with middle school education. 

I can't enjoy things, I won't ever have a relationship, I will die a virgin and nobody will come to my funeral, If I manage to survive longer than my mother.

I just wish my mother would die already so I wont be causing such a emotional trauma to her with my suicide. She still believes that her child genious could rise up from his depression and became again that genious kid I was and have high paying job that requires mathematics and programming
