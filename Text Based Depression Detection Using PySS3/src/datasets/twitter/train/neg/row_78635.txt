I seem to always come here for my problems
Yea.... not a good night. Started with an argument between me and my boyfriend. then me getting crapfaced. Then when I started to sober up, he got depressed so I let him sleep.  So... I know hes gonna hate himself for this in the morning and I am already really sorry for this... but I feel rather alone... I counted out pills and I have his whiskey.  I dont even know what to do anymore.. I feel so useless now... I've already cut myself and have the urge to cut again...  I even have a bunch of his pills laid out for me to take... I want too but I dont want to end things....  I don't find a point in going forward anymore.
