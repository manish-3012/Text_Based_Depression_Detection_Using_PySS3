It feels as though I am wasting my lifeIâ€™m so stuck, itâ€™s driving me insane. Every year itâ€™s the same thing: â€œI just need to get through this. I just need to get through this. I just need to get through this and it will get better.â€ But it hasnâ€™t been getting better, it feels like itâ€™s only getting worse, and itâ€™s been 10 years of this every day in and out over and over and I just feel like I am wasting my life. I am wasting my life like this, but itâ€™s not improving no matter what I seem to be doing. 

I wonder if hospitalization is something I should do because I am getting too antsy to keep this up. But I think it would make it worse. Imagining my parentsâ€™ reactions is terrifying. Imagining having to take a medical leave from college is terrifying. Disappointing everyone is horrifying. Iâ€™m so stuck. I want to believe thereâ€™s a point to all of this but I just donâ€™t know. I feel like a failure for not being able to get better. Iâ€™m looking for little things to hold onto, like the fact that my dog and cats would be confused if they never saw me again, but I just donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m doing anymore besides torturing myself.
