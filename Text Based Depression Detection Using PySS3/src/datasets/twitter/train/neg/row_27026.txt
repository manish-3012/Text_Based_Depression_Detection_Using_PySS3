it always returns in autumnEvery year without fail, the thoughts come back in the fall. They're little whispers around September but once October hits, I feel like I'm in an inescapable emotional prison. I want to smoke and drink and starve and cut and just disappear. My favorite season always means the return of these thoughts. No matter how much I prepare for the feelings and thoughts, it still feels like a new excruciating pain every year. I feel everything except for connection and empathy. Every fall I feel so depressed and empty and hopeless and lost but i can't even connect with those around me because im so numb.

I just want it to stop. I need it to end. Im begging. I just want to enjoy my favorite season again. I can't stand the cavernous feeling in my chest anymore. There should be a heart somewhere in there, not an abyss.
