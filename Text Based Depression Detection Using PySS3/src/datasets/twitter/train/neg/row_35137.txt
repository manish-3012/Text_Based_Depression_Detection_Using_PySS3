To the girl who jumpedI remember getting the call. Just an ordinary night for me was the night you wanted to end it all. I remember getting dressed in a hurry and rushing out the door, we didn't bother locking it behind us. You were more important. As we raced to the cliff I was hoping we would get stood down, that you would be okay, that you would go home to your family that night. I dont know what you were going through, I dont even know your name but I swear my heart stopped when I heard you jumped. I took us 3 hours to get you from the rocks, from up so high you looked so small, so vulnerable, I wanted to believe you weren't in pain. As the paramedics worked to save your life I could only hope you would get the help you needed. Watching as you were lifted up by the rescue helicopter I thought about your family. I thought about my own. Whoever you are, I want you to know that even when the last light goes out and you feel like there is nothing left, there are always people who care, people who will fight to keep you alive. 
I remember every job I've been to. No matter what you will stay with me. I hope you are okay. I wish we couldve gotten there sooner. I hope that whatever you've been through gets better, that you find a reason to keep going. 

From,
The girl who helped rescue you.
