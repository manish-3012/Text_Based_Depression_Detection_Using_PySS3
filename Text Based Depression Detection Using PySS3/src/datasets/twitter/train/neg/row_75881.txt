I am so close to going from ideation to making a plan.My contingencies are all laid out and would work. I'm a huge burden on my spouse and a bad mom to my kid. I got laid off before covid (so its been almost a year) and can't find a new job in my career field since it's airplanes. Right now there's two potential jobs but I don't think either will amount to anything. If they don't, then I have no plan. My unemployment ends in two weeks and congress isn't going to help. I have no plan for financially recovering. I'm going to loss my car and not be able to feed my son. At this point, he'd probably be better off going to live with his dad instead of me. 

My mom and I are close but we literally just had a conversation a few days ago that we both feel like if a semi was out of control and coming at us neither of us would swerve and we both were absolutely not joking. I feel so bad telling my mom that because I would hate to know that my son feels that way but she's the only person I can verbalize this shit to. 

There's so many god awful things going on the world because humans are awful to each other. Kids in cages and being sterilized, people getting their organs taken out because of their religion, and so much more because it's impossible to know how much humans really suck. 

This world is absolutely awful. The positives do not redeem the negatives. 

I just want to be done because nothing is ever going to get better. Me getting a job to pay the bills won't change the horrible things, it'll just make it easier to ignore. I can't live in blissful ignorance to all the suffering. I just can't be here anymore.
