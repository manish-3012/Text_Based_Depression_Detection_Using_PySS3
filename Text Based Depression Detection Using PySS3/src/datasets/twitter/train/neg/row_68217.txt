Sitting here scared of impulsivityI'm now sitting on my bed after almost killing myself. I don't feel like I can control my actions. I just made a noose tied it to a hook and just about walked off a chair before stopping myself. I had a normal day, I didn't feel overly suicidal throughout the day. I just got home and did it after seeing how much more I had to finish and the quick thought that i contribute nothing to society. There were no emotions, I was just cold and stoic. I'm now on my bed with the noose still just sitting around my neck scared that I'm going to not be in control of my actions in the future.
