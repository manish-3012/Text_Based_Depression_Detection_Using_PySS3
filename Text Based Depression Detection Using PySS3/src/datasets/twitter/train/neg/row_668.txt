Please help my friendI donâ€™t know what to do. He kept talking about how it is so difficult for him and that no one cares about him. I tried to listen, and state that there are a lot of people who care about him but I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s working. He said to not be surprised if he doesnâ€™t respond. Please.
