I just want the pain to go awayI am constantly depressed and i hate every aspect of my life. I have asthma, social anxiety, i am lactose intolerant, i have bad vision,i am short, i have weak body in general, born into a poor family(still dirt poor), bullied a lot in school (or used to it is a new school, but it will probably start again), never been in a relationship with the opposite sex, my father is an abusive drunk who constantly beats me and calls me a little girl when i start to cry(after the beating, and verbal abuse), i have almost no friends, i can't drown my sorrows in the virtual world because my computer is a 7 year old piece of junk that can't run any games. my lack of motivation has made my grades drop so i have no hopes for the future all i can see is pain.

i have tried kill myself many times, most of these times were because of bullying, and maybe because the bullies were right i am worthless.



oh and today is my 17 birthday (no parties no friends no presents no happiness) and all i can do is think of how crappy my life is and how much i want too end it, i want the pain to go away.

i could go on about how pathetic my existence is, but it is to much to write in one post.


Happy birthday to me........right?
