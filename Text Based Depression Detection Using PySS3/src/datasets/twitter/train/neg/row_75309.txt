sorryhow do people keep going? why do people keep going? i cant figure it out. i was in an abusive relationship from age 17-20. its fucked me up. im 23 now and i still wake up screaming. ive lost all of my friends because nobody believed me and they all wanted to be friends with him still because it was easier for them to just be friends with him and pretend like nothing happened than to admit that i was raped repeatedly and controlled for years. you become so out of control you eventually just give up and just accept that thats your life now in situations like that. i didnt tell anyone for 2 years and when i did they didnt believe me. i keep trying to be okay. im in college, i had to take some semesters off because i attempted suicide twice. im 23 now, ive been in therapy for 4 years, and i just cant find joy in anything. i used to be so fucking joyful. most days i just want a hug but im so isolated from everyone i used to love. i still love them all but they didnt love me enough to believe me. im so fucking desperate right now. im very scattered and just retraumatized by something that happened this week. me being suicidal is an every day thing, but its like a volume knob thing, somedays i want it more than others. somedays its a 1 or a 2 and im just checking out my ceiling fan, aware it could hold my weight. other days its a 10 and im smashing things into my head until i bleed so that my pain can be seen on the outside. you cant see ptsd the way you can see a broken leg. people don't just get why im hurting all the time. have to explain "i was raped and i can hear it every night!" im tired. of explaining myself. of taking time off school only to just get worse again. i feel stupid and worthless and forgettable. idk what the fuck im doing posting on reddit i pay for a therapist and to call her whenever im just tired of her trying to convince me i should go to an inpatient facility. would rather just die. its cheaper thats for sure
