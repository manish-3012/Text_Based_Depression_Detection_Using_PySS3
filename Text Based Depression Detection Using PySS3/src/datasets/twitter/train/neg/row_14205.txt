Is there something I'm missing?Sorry I don't want to be an attention whore, but I just want to make  sure there is no flaw in my logic before I make a permanent decision. 


I really don't see what the big deal of killing my self would be, I made a pros/cons list.  I'm a weak, lazy, selfish person and I think for me it might be a better decision. Here is the list I wrote up:

**Pros:**
- Iâ€™m going to die anyway to the same exact outcome.
- Save myself years of loneliness and pain. 
- Quit while youâ€™re ahead, save your self a lot of work.


**Cons:**
- Devastate friends &amp; family.  But theyâ€™ll all be dead within the century anyway so in the long run it doesn't matter.
- Miss out on fun, but the probability of me ever having fun is very low, plus even then it will all be lost anyway when I eventually die. 


This isn't a hasty decision, people say time heals all wounds so I've given them a chance but it's been over two months.  I've dug my self a deep hole, it will take years to climb out and I'm not sure if it's worth the hard work especially when life outside of the hole doesn't look appealing.
