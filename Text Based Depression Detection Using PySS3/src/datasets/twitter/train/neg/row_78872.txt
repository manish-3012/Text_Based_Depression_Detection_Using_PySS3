It's really hard to say I'm not okay.I've been depressed for a while now and it got to a point where I attempted suicide two months ago and was minutes away from succeeding.  My wife found me unconscious and I woke up in the Emergency Room. I get asked every day if I am okay and I always say the response everyone wants to hear.  Yes I am okay.  I should be saying on some days that NO I'm not okay. I don't want to stress everyone else out and I don't want to be put back in the nut hatch. That's what would happen I think if I said I am not okay. When I was in the hospital I blamed the whole incident on medicine I just started called Effexor so everyone would just back off a little.  I don't think it was the meds anymore making me feel bad.  It's just hard to say Today I'm not okay, and if I don't say anything I can sit here all day at my desk at work being upset and no one even notices. I'm a ghost.
