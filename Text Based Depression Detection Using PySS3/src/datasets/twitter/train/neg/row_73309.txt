I just want to end itâ€¦24M, been depressed for the last 6. Barely any job experience, no college degree despite having changed major twice and still being a failure now after trying my hardest, no passions, no hobbies, no friends, I'm literally just a fucking weight for my family, never had any romantic relationship or experience at all, constantly rejected by everyone and everything in life. I suck at everything I do despite having tried literally anything. Therapy not only didn't work (tried multiple therapists), but also made me even more mad because I now know there's no way for me to go back to being a fucking normal person. 5 years ago I tried taking my life by too much alcohol and drugs at what was supposed to be a party, I later woke up in the hospital and, after they told me it was a miracle I was still alive, I was absurdly upset (like, seriously, WHY THE FUCK couldn't I have just died then? Why did they have to "save me" without me wanting to ffs??). Over time the situation got only worse and worse and I hate myself and life more than I never did, but I just never could bring myself to replicate another suicide attempt. I swear, I HATE survival instinct so much, if I could just die RIGHT NOW without feeling pain, I'd do that 100%.

I don't even know what this post is supposed to be. A desperate call for help? Asking for ways to finally bring myself to do it? I just don't know what to doâ€¦ I want to suffocate in these fucking tearsâ€¦
