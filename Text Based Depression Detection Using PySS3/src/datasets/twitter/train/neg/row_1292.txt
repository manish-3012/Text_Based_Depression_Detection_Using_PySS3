Not sure what to doI moved states to live with my mom and step dad to try and finish college. When I moved in they told me to just focus on school and if it didn't work out, they would pay for trade school. After my first semester they started talking about me getting a loan for community college. I lost a lot of motivation and when I talked to them about a trade the first thing out of my step dad mouth was "who's gonna pay for it?" I have been trying for a few years now and everytime i start school i have to stop normally for financial reasons. This whole time though they have helped my step sister threw school. She graduates next month with her master's. But community college cost to much for me to keep going. I dont even want to anymore now. I stopped going to class over a month ago, and finals will be soon. I just feel defeated I am 26 with not even an AA. I feel so betrayed and life still hasn't gotten better. Just more disappointment and set backs. If this is all life is for me I think if I make it to 30 without being able to make it on my own, that I will just end it.
