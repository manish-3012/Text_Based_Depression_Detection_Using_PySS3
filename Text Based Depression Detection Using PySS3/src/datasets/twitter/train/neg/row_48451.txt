whateverIn 120 years from now all 7 something billion people currently alive on this planet will be dead, every single one. Life is so short and fleeting and yet everyone is obsessing over trivial nonsense. Every plight, every joy, every memory and every experience we go through will vanish once we're dead, in 120 years from now everyone currently alive will be but a memory for the next generations to come, and even then 100 years later the vast majority of us will have been completely forgotten, virtually erased from the universe.

I find solace in this, because I know that my death will not leave a permanent scar, I'll just be speeding up the process a bit. I'm fundamentally incapable of living a content life so I don't see why I should even try.
