New here as a last resort, I can't go onHi everyone 
I feel I've hit a new low posting to a bunch of strangers online about my deepest sorrows. But I don't think I can last another day like this.

I'm 24. I've been like this for years. At the end of last summer I started dating a boy, and although I wasn't looking to start something I gave him a chance because he made me feel happy again - like someone really was invested in me and made me look forward to my life again.

On Christmas Day my grandfather passed. A week later my boyfriend left me with no explanation. A week later I started my last semester of college, which I hate. I'm barely passing. I have one friend and she lives on the opposite side of the country. My ex got back in touch a few weeks ago but today ended things again and called me a bunch of names, told me never to talk to him again. 

I live with my parents, and I have to sit in the bathroom running the bath water so I can cry without being questioned. I have picked my cuticles and skin bloody and raw. I have not eaten I have not gotten out of bed. I don't want a hobby, I don't want a job, I don't want to like anything or even try.

I feel like I have not one feasible option left besides to lay here and waste away. Please help me
