Nothing Really Left to DoI'm pretty tired of life. I've sort of accomplished all the things I think i'm going to do. All the things I really want to do (i.e. the things that give me real joy) are so far out of reach apparently in this life so they're unattainable without significant rolling of the dice (and if I know anything it's that life will always throw you shit). 

So i think I'm just really ready to go. There's nothing I can do to effect real significant change.

No need to try to convince me "what about a, b, c?" I don't care about experiencing anything else, or rather that small amount of joy is really not worth the bullshit.
