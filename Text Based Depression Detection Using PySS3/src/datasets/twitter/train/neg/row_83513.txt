3 years ago today3 years ago today, I nearly killed myself. I was delusional and incredibly depressed. I was involuntarily hospitalized, put on a 6 month commitment, and given my most updated diagnosis to date: bipolar I disorder. 

I did not hit rock bottom until November. After that, it was an extremely slow rebuilding process. Most of the relationships in my life had been destroyed. My own psychiatrist told me not to go back to school, not to try to finish college. I said \_fuck that\_ and I finished college. I worked in my field (psychology) for two years. In the interim, I moved across the country on my own. I am now in graduate school for mental health counseling and I do not take any medications. I have never been so happy with my life or had a clearer picture of who I am or what my purpose is. I am literally grateful every fucking day and it's so stupid, I still can't believe I'm here.

I am not saying that you should all believe it will get better. Because when I was in such a dark place, I thought \*only the lucky ones\* get better and I was too fundamentally flawed to be grouped with them. I thought I wasn't fit for life on earth. I was mad at anyone who would told me just to hold on because it would get better. 

Like I said -- you don't have to believe me. I probably wouldn't have believed me. But I was the last fucking person I would have expected to get better, so I feel compelled to share my story in case It gives anyone an inkling of hope. Whatever you can do to stay alive, please do it, because I promise things will get better -- even when you least expect them to.
