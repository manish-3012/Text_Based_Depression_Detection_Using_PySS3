I hate my life.The title says it all but also, I know that nobody cares about me in my life and I just wish I wasn't here in life, in society, in this world, at all.

I don't even like myself. Nobody will care about me once I'm gone, which makes me wish I was gone already.

I'm just a stupid, lame old duck who does nothing and probably has nothing to contribute and nothing to live for.

I'm 22 from Florida and I just hate it. Yes, I do have suicidal thoughts every once in a while. Though not super serious, I do have it and on some days, I just feel like I want to go do it.
