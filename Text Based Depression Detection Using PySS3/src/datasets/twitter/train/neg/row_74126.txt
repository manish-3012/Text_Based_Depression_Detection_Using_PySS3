It's not that I want to dieIt's not that I want to die.  
Believe me, standing up and looking out on the city below makes me feel sick and dizzy.  
Also, anything with blood or cutting, yuck.  
Or taking a bunch of pills, I've accidentally OD'd before.  
I'm not doing that again.  
So it's not that I want to die.  
It's that I want to live.  
I'd like someone else's life that someone else built.  
I want it and then I want it to magically keep itself going and I am just along for the ride.  
I'll have joy and happiness, frustration, anger, guilt, aches, pains, scares, hugs and tears and triumphs.  
I'll learn to sail, and I'll take the family out on the lake.  
The kids will drive me nuts.  
The wife will nag.  
All will be well.  
It's a fantasy I haven't worked myself to fantasizing about.  
Sure, at night I might pretend I'm Clayton Kershaw,  
Or I'm Kobe Bryant,  
That doesn't bother me.  
It's totally beyond my reach.  
Fantasizing about a family and children gives me a panic attack.  
This is the origin of the concept of fault.  
Can you blame yourself for not being a superhero?  
How about for not being the best you that you can be.
