I can't sleep at night anymoreEvery night I lay awake with the thought of ending it all running through my mind. I play through scenarios of how it will affect everyone around me. I play through how I can do it with the least amount of hurt to my family and friends. I wrote notes to everyone close to me just in case i do end it without giving my goodbyes those people. 

I'm 20, in college, with the best friends anyone could want. I have my dream job already, I get to work a job that is my passion. The one thing I long for I can never have. Every. Single. Day. I am reminded that the only thing I really ever wanted will always be right in front of me and I can't get it. 

The only reason I'm still here is because of a few talks one of my best friends and I had a few weeks ago, and a few months ago (https://imgur.com/r25KslR). Without him it might have already been over for me. But even he can't stop my thoughts, and every night it gets worse and worse. One of these days soon it might all end, and I don't know how to stop it.
