Can't get it off my mindAlright so I just finished my masters degree in an area that I couldn't give a fuck about. I come from a small town and I'm studying away from home. Parents divorced and both mentally ill. Only son. Mother is a terrible influence and only gives bad advice. Barely knows how to take care of herself so I'm pretty much stuck with her. Father can't take disappointment otherwise he won't be able to sleep for months. I always go into depressive state when home. Can't feel well anywhere. Dating a girl for whom I care but we barely have anything in common. Developing some kind of social anxiety (I guess...) and can't seem to make conversation or friends and beginning to avoid needless social interaction. Feel stripped of all dreams and tastes. Haven't recognized beauty in a long, long time. I feel like I'm already dead. Every night and every day, the pounding wish to end everything. I imagine it. I dream about it.  I'm about to wuss out and I don't even care anymore.
