I don't know what to thinkToday I was almost hit by a car. My friend keeps saying I could have almost died and that I could have been severely injured. Is it bad that I don't care. In fact I could even say it would almost make me happy if I died. Life just doesn't seem as awesome as everyone makes it out to be. I just kinda feel emotionless about the situation. I don't know what I should feed
