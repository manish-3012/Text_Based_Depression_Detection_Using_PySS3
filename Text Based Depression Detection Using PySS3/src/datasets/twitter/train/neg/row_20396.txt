Passively thinking about suicide.I spend a lot of time thinking about suicide. Not necessarily planning it/actively thinking to do it, but thinking how i would do it if i wanted. Or what i would say to my friends and family.

Ive started researching how to self harm safely
Im acknowledging my spiral and doing everything i can do to not reach the bottom (psychiatrist, psychologist, meds, time off work, gym, healthy eating, ive told close friends/family so they know to watch me)

I noticed when im driving, specifically on highways, i have a desire to just unbuckle my seat belt, and flip my car. Drive fast, slam the break and turn the wheel so i flip side ways more than once, with the hopes ill die. I know it sounds and seems so traumatic (i work in a morgue, these deaths can be brutal) but i feel so guilty for wanting to commit suicide that i feel like this would alleviate my friends and families concern as they may just think it was an accident, and they wouldn't take on any blame. 
- ive also actively acknowledged i would do this to not involve any other victims - small town, highways arent busy, i could have both directions empty with just me on it. I would never want to involve another person in this. 

I dunno. I just needed to type that out. To say it somewhere other than my brain
