risky coping methodsSo, Iâ€™m going to be honest. Iâ€™ve been suicidal for a very long time and I try to do all I can to avoid doing what seems inevitable. But I just canâ€™t do it anymore. I donâ€™t really care enough or have much strength after going through numerous long-lasting depressions. Iâ€™ve pretty much given up on everything and right now Iâ€™m just trying to make it longer and make what time I have left worth it. Iâ€™m trying to live ad happily as I can, so I have resorted to taking in massive amounts of caffeine and and drug it myself to sleep at night. I know itâ€™s not healthy and to be honest, the caffeine doesnâ€™t even really do much for me, but at least itâ€™s something. God knows father medicine doesnâ€™t help, regardless of what I try.  Iâ€™m not even really sure why Iâ€™m posting this. I used to think I wanted someone to talk to but Iâ€™ve realized through numerous therapy sessions that I donâ€™t really have any way to describe what Iâ€™m feeling, nor do I really even know what I would say. I guess this is more of a â€œventing postâ€ than anything else. Anyway, Iâ€™m probably going to inadvertently kill myself with chemicals. But I honestly have no idea how else to cope because Iâ€™ve tried almost everything I can think of. If anyone had any suggestions, Iâ€™m all ears. But honestly, I doubt that anyone had any ideas that I havenâ€™t tried yet. But either way. At least I can say that I got this off my chest. Not sure if this would be better here or in suicide noteS. But I just decided to post it here.
