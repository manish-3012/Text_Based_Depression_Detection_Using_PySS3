I know i only posted here yesterday, but im ready to talk nowYesterday, i made a post explaining my situation. A part of that said that i was going to end my life by the end of the week.

Well tonight, i tried but in the end i couldnt do it. My plan was to leave home with hardly any clothes on and just keep walking and never look back. Eventually, the cold would take me. Except i couldnt do it, and i dont know why. I just sat outside the back door of my house in the cold until i was shaking and blue.

I admit defeat. Where most of my posts before were just to know that someone cared, or that someone was listening, tonight im here to ask for help. Im ready to make things better now, ive hit rock bottom.
