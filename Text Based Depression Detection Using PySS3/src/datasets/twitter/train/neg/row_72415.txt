Im about to kill myselfI'm going to take a whole bottle of trazadone and gabapentin and if it doesn't work I'm just going to stab myself in the neck as hard as I can. My life is worthless and I've been depressed and had extreme debilitating anxiety for as long as I can remember. Nothing will ever get better. I hope my next life is worth living.
