I'm so scared right nowI have been on anti depressants for almost 8 weeks now and tonight I gave myself an ultimatum based on what happens tomorow. To be honest I don't think I have it in me to take the final step but then i've never felt this low before. Previously i've overcome suicidal thoughts but the fact i'm posting this right now is just further proving that i'm worse than I ever expected I would be. I'm just so fucking scared.
