No matter how many times â€œit gets betterâ€, I just end up at the bottom of the same hole and Iâ€™m ready to lie in it.Iâ€™m 26 now, have tried to kill myself twice before which led to my 12 year on and off again journey through therapy and mental health treatment. Itâ€™s gotten better, but I always fall into the ditch and wonder if I should just fucking do it already and do it right this time. The thought of my mom having to live the rest of her life with me dead, mourning me and my choices, is the only thing that sobers me from the suicidal ideations. Today has particularly been a rocky day though, and I feel like that grip on staying here for her is weakening.

I started having ugly thoughts tonight, like how I was so jealous of Kobe and the other victims of that helicopter crash. Or how I wish I were infected with the coronavirus and on my way out. Iâ€™m actually embarrassed to admit this, but at the same time feel so passionately about these desires, it scares me.

For the first time in I think maybe 3 or 4 years I started researching suicide methods. My dad takes anticoagulants for his artificial heart valve, and I figured if I steal some of his medicine and cut myself in the bathtub I can bleed out and die peacefully. I have the growing urge to hurt myself permanently. The only hard part will be leaving a note for my family and a letter for my ex maybe, but I donâ€™t know what I even need to say to him besides sorry. Still, this terrifies me but excites me, I just crave life to be over so often and Iâ€™m getting restless.

No matter what happens in life, I always end up in the same place. I keep fighting but Iâ€™m wondering whoâ€™s battle is this actually? Iâ€™m definitely not fighting for myself anymore. Iâ€™ve officially given up and am just waiting for my dad to come home from a trip so I can see him one last time.
