What would you do if..What would you do if you had a severe case of social phobia, had a strong life-long depression and couldn't ask for help?

I've been wanting help for years now, and I can't go to the doctor myself, I'm 17 years old and the closest thing I've come to getting help was when my mom went to the doctor for me, the doctor said she couldn't prescribe anything because she hadn't talked to me. I can't even leave the house, I've lost touch with pretty much all my friends after they found out I had a depression. Any suggestions on what to do here? I literally only see one option..
