I just want to end it allI'm not happy with my life right now. I'm suffering from anxiety and depression and every day is a struggle just to even force myself out of bed. I have lost the will to do anything with my life, I don't find enjoyment in anything anymore. I feel like a burden to those who do spend time with me. I would be better off as dead if it was any concern to them. I face nothing but disappointment and fail at everything I try. I just want it to end.
