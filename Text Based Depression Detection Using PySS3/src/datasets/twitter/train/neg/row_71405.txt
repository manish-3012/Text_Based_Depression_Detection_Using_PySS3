I should and you should tooYou're delaying the inevitable for nothing. Escape into stupid fantasies, delusions, distractions, for what? Another day in this horrible life? Stop kidding yourself. You're a trash can of sentiments. All the garbage of culture and history crammed into an ugly dirty bag with miserable personal anxieties and idiosyncrasies tossed on top. Go. End it. 


We're all worthless. Think of the best person in your life. They're shit. They make our slavery seem bearable, and that makes them the worst, the most guilty. At least the callous and cruel are obvious, those who hurt you are overtly expressing nature's inherent harms, they're sincere, unlike the disingenuous pieces of shit that try to convince you there's good things. There aren't any good things, just distractions from the painful things.



I hate you all almost as much as myself. I stick a gun to my head every night and hope I can finally squeeze. I hope I get the guts soon.
