I'm getting tiredI've been having this on going battle with myself and I can't be asked to fight anymore. There's no future for me; even if I do manage to be successful, so fucking what? I can't be happy. I'm literally afraid to. I've been miserable for so long that's all I know how to be.

My life at school is fucking anarchy. I'm only good at one subject. I'm already a year behind and time is running on me. I'm supposed to be going to uni next year but because I failed I have to do an extra year (I'm 18 for context; in the UK we go to college at 16 for 2 years, then uni. I failed the first year), all because of my mental health. I have depression which I only recently got diagnosed with as well as Body Dysmorphic Disorder, and you know what Reddit, I am *fucking tired of it*.

Tired of taking medication, tired of fucking up at school, tired of spending majority of my time alone because I only have 5 friends. I always feel isolated and excluded. I've never been to a party, I don't even fucking go out regularly, partly because of the BDD and not wanting to leave the house without makeup. All I ever seems to do is piss people off and disappoint them. 

Most of all I'm tired of myself. I don't even fucking do anything, I just sit down and think and think and think until I either cry or vomit. I don't learn, or have hobbies. I don't *live*. I'm just there.

Go to school, feel depressed, go home, feel depressed. Rinse and repeat until I wanna blow my head

 I feel like a massive burden.

I don't know what the future holds for me.

I can't even get a job because my BDD likes to fuck me over.

I live in a shitty area too, literally the worst in London. 

Everything is fucked and its about time I pulled the plug on this train wreck.
