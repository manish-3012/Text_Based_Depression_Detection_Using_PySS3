Failing life.I've been suffering severe depression and social anxiety for the past five years. It has never gotten better. I turned to video games as an escape and that has just made things exponentially worse. 

I transferred to my college this semester and told myself it was going to be different, but I fell back into the old habits. First I started getting social anxiety again, it has been hard for me to meet and talk to people. 

My depression started fading in, I couldn't concentrate on my work. I sit for hours to study and get stuff done but I just can't focus, I drift away and just end up doing nothing. I just fade right back into suicidal ideation, just feeling hopeless that I just can't move on in life and get my shit done.

I'm failing all my courses, two our of three is beyond fixable at this point and I'm pretty much guaranteed an F. I sit around doing nothing most of the time, just laying in bed doing jack shit, turning to browsing the web and playing games.

I've hit a brick wall. I don't think I can get out of this slump, this was all not meant to go this way and I'm just pissing away my parents' money.

Before it was just ideation but now I have a plan and I'm done. I just can't take the pain anymore.
