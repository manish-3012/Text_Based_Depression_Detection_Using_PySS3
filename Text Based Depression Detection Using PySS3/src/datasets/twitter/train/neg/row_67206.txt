I wished my daughter a beautiful lifeItâ€™s been a long... life?  
But I donâ€™t even care to mention my whole life, I care about tonight. 

I have severe anxiety, severe to the point of being unable to go to my job that i work from my garage kind of anxiety , its everyday of my life everyday to some extent but sometimes, a couple of times a month I guess, itâ€™s more than rehabilitating- itâ€™s killing me. 

I know though, that If I miss one more day of said job I will be written up. 

Today I was plastered with anxiety and my wife and I have been having major problems for at least a year, and itâ€™s really hard to ask for help bla a bla well I asked my wife if I could had a hug before I started work, she didnâ€™t know I asked until it was to late and it turned into this really big fucking deal and all about the shittythings I do and if only if only I didnâ€™t do this this and this then maybe just maybe I would be better off. 

Stupid ass reason to fight but here we are.
She told me she wanted to just give me a hug and make everything ok and went on and on and on about all butâ€™s and reasons why she canâ€™t just give me a hug and make it all ok- she always has to talk shit to me and so much shit I canâ€™t even take in as many words as she spits out. 

Well, I ignore her messages while Iâ€™m working and she basically said that because Iâ€™m ignoring her because she is unsure if weâ€™re just gonna fight when I get off work that she doesnâ€™t want to stay home tonight and thatâ€™s sheâ€™s going to take my daughter to a hotel for the night. 

She always takes my daughter , itâ€™s always me being left which further reinforces my loneliness and bullshit. 

Iâ€™m off work in less than hour wife quickly packed their bags and left. 
Made sure I told my daughter good night and as I scooped her up when she ran to me , I wished and hoped that she has a beautiful life. A beautiful wonderful life - God. Thatâ€™s all I want, and I really always thought I would give that to her, Iâ€™m not sure how it got to this moment so fucking quickly I thought we were doing better,  and now Iâ€™m just plastered with this anxiety and Iâ€™m shaking with.... grief... because I know I just know 


I canâ€™t continue this way. I feel blindsighted but this night that doesnâ€™t feel like my life because I have been so on the up and up lately but yet itâ€™s so fucking familiar and ... I remember. I have nothing. 
I have always had nothing. Maybe I can stop fighting that and just let it be where it is. Maybe thatâ€™s ok, and the only one with a problem with that is me and I should just l let it go . 

I just wanted to feel supported. I just wanted a hug. I didnâ€™t want the pages and pages of texts of shit I just wanted to feel like Iâ€™m safe 

Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.
