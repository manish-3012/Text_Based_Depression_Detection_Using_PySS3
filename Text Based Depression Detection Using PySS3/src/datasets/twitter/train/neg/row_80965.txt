making plansI've been suicidal for a while now, but it's never been this bad. I feel so alone. I talk to a lot of people who all seem to support me, but I don't have a connection with them. It's all one-sided. 

I'm making plans today. I might take my bike out tonight to stake out a good bridge. Hopefully I don't go right then and there; I want to write my notes first. 

I also hate that if I do die soon, people will connect it to the now-popular show "Thirteen Reasons Why," but that's just my luck, isn't it?
