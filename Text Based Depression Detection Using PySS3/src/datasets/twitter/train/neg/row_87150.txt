What are your reasons for wanting to die?Mine are:

Iâ€™m uglyâ€” Iâ€™ve always been told I look older than I am, have had a receding hairline since I was 17 and have premature wrinkles. Iâ€™m 35 and heard as old as 50, when people guess my age. When I was in my 20s, ppl thought I was in my 30s.

Unsuccessful- while I have been on the right path (multiple degrees, military service) I failed. I had a mental breakdown after 9 years of service and am losing my career. All that hard word down the drain. It will be very difficult to get a new job as well because I lost my clearance and all the experience I had requires a clearance for that type of job. 

No meaningful relationships- Iâ€™ve never had a real girlfriend. Iâ€™ve had short term partners, one nights stands etc, but no girl has ever wanted to call me her boyfriend. Only girls that â€œwantedâ€ me had ulterior motives, as being in the military I had good benefits and housing payâ€”2 women with children tried to get at me, but I found out they cheated and were never even attracted to me or liked me.

I have no friends now. I use to have a lot, but over the years they diminished. It seems as I have grown uglier, people like me less. 

Iâ€™m always the scapegoat, the punching bag, the person people take there emotional baggage out on. If say something happened at work where it was someone elseâ€™s fault, I would get blamed. I think Iâ€™m an easy target because Iâ€™m short, not visually appealing, quiet and no one likes me. 

I just give up. This world is not for me.
