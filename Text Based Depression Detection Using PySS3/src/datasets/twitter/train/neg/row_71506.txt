Voices in my headGot razors, alcohol and pills on the table. I haven't spoken with anyone in quite a long time and all I have is my inner demons to keep me company. The same fucking demons that have drove me to making all the wrong moves in my life that got me to this point. Instead of being happy and surrounded with people, I'm alone in silence with these voices telling me I fucked my life up and I should drink up that whiskey, take those pills and cut my veins wide open but this time carve into my skin real good. They must be desperate to collect because I've never felt depression this bad before. It's completely soul crushing, as if your life was a lie and everything you ever did was for nothing.
