The water looked really invitingSo I have been struggling with my inner demons for quite a while now and do fantasise about suicide but never do anything towards it. However a couple of weeks ago when out drinking at a large party I slipped away (it is hard for me to keep up the appearance of being happy for too long) and went on a walk.

I went to the river, as it was night the water looked black and murky but yet so inviting to me. I stared at it for what must have be an hour fantasising about leaping in and breathing in the water, filling my lungs with the blackness. 

But I didn't do it, I didn't want anyone to think this was just some drunken accident, that I was a fool. But for the time I was thinking about drowning myself, it one of the only moments of peace I have felt this past year. All my problems and worries would vanish, I would fear no monsters. I would be gone.

When I returned to the party only one person even noticed I was missing, only God knows how long it would have been before someone found me.

I know I will never do it but I still don't know how to feel about this event. An event no one else knew anything about, nobody knows I am not happy.
