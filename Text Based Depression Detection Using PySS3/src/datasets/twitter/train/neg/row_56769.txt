I'm homeless, I don't have food or shampoo or money for my doctor's appointments. I just want to die.I don't know how to handle things anymore.  I'm 21, out of school for medical leave and owe my school $4000.  I'm sick and just had surgery.  I can't get a job.  I can't help my parents and they have to support me and I feel awful.

We're living with a family member currently but it's a small one bedroom apartment and I'm sleeping on the floor.  I hurt so much from surgery.  I just want a home and a bed.  

I can't go out and make friends because we're in the middle of nowhere.  My boyfriend is states away.  I'm so alone.

We don't have food until Friday, and even then we won't be able to get much.  I'm gaining weight because I'm depressed, and it's hilarious because I'm not even eating.  It's making my anorexic thoughts come back and I feel like if I get more depressed it'll be too hard on my boyfriend.  He's already depressed now.

I just feel like if I ceased to exist things would be easier for everyone and I wouldn't have to suffer anymore.  I can't handle it.  My family is contacting every resource we can think of but this is a high poverty area and no one will/can help us.  

I'm supposed to be focusing on my health and recovering on medical withdrawal so I can go back and do well.  But I'm recovering from surgery sleeping on the floor and barely eating, I can't afford medications or to go to my post-op check up.  My hair is stringy and gross because I'm washing it with hand soap.  I already don't feel attractive and now I'm just even more gross.

I don't know what to do
