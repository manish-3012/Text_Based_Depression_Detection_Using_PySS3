Here I sit with 33 pills and 12 beers.I know this isn't 100% effective and could just leave me fucked up. But I'm gonna take a crack at it anyway.

Now, I'm not going to lay out the reasons why I am doing this. I have thought long and hard over the last year and I have looked at everything, bottom to top. I don't need opinions on my choices, judgment, or alternatives.

It just seems weird to go without telling anyone. Can't tell my wife. She'd stop me somehow. Wifes, uh... find a way.

Can't tell the woman I am in love with (shock!). I left my job and moved across cities to get away from her. She has her own life and doesn't need the burden of me.

People will blame themselves. But I am to blame. I made my bed, as it were.

Anyway, Jackson Montauk isn't my name. So no funny business, reddit. Otherwise, if you feel like chatting for a bit. I suppose I don't have anywhere to be.

EDIT: Have you guys heard of Sir Sly? The entire You Haunt Me album is genius.

EDIT2: 2 beers, 6 pills. Heartburn.
