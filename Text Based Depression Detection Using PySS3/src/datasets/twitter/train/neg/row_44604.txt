Iâ€™m going to jump next weekIâ€™m going hiking next week. Iâ€™m going to disconnect the safety rope and jump. Iâ€™m 16, no friends, no talent, I hate my face and my body, my parents are abusive and constantly fight.
Whatâ€™s even the point of going on anymore?

To live the next 70 years in complete agony? To die old and horribly depressed with memories full of abuse and self hate??

But whatâ€™s the bet I wonâ€™t even do it, Iâ€™ll get so close to the edge and Iâ€™ll pussy out like I always do. Useless piece of shit canâ€™t even kill himself properly. I donâ€™t deserve to live Iâ€™m just a fucking coward.
I always have been, but hopefully not for much longer.
