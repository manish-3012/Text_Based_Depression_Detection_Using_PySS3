Dark control?Most days i tell/ask myself "maybe i should just kill myself", ive put some thought and time on thinking on how; but i realize i just tell/ask myself that question just feel like i have some control over my life. I guess its darkly comforting to ask/think that way im in someway in control of things. Especially on those days when "i just dont know". Im a nihilistic pessimistic fuck, and i try coping thru circumstance by saying fucked shit to myself. If its not "i dont know" its maybe i "should kill myself" days. I dont if ill ever do it, but sometimes things just feel so out of control and im so tired most days...  Anyone ever feel like this too?
