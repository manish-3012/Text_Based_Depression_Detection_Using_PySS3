"The American Dream"A friend of mine just ended up getting a nice house bought for him, at 18, by his rich parents. He lives alone, and doesn't have to worry about bills for the next several years. He'll never have any financial issues in his life.

Meanwhile, I'm wondering how I will ever be able to land a job so I can at least try to afford to live in a shit apartment one day, and because of my mental illnesses, it makes it even harder for me. No credentials, no ambition to go to college, and no way to ever not live paycheck to paycheck. I'll be a lower class loser for the rest of my life because I wasn't born with rich parents, and instead I was born with these debilitating mental illnesses. I'll never have the free time or energy to pursue anything soon.

Yes, I'm jealous. I'd love to have money. I'd love to not have to worry. I'd love to have some kind of safety net. But I'll never have those privileges. And I don't see why *anyone* should be expected to keep living when they are stuck at the bottom of society, never able to get any higher. It's these unfair circumstances that make me want to die. People call "The American Dream" the ethos of the US, but really, it's all a fucking lie.
