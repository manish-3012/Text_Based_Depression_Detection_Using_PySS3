I have no passions, no desire, no will powerIâ€™ve been depressed since I was 17. Have thought about killing myself almost everyday for months now. I have crippling social anxiety paired with severe undiagnosed ADHD. I dropped out of university a few years back and then started a successful business until it crashed but luckily enough I got out before I lost $. Since then Iâ€™ve travelled to 15 countries but never left my room because of my anxiety. The pressure of expectation from my family leaves me mentally unstable. Idk can someone just please talk to me Iâ€™m so scared Iâ€™m gonna kill myself very soon.
