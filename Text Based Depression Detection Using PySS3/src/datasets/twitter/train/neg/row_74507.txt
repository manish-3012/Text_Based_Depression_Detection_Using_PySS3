some nights on my walksSome nights on my walks to clear my head I think about just stepping in front of a fast moving car. It's been getting a lot worse recently and I don't know what to do. I need the walks because without them I know I would be so much worse. I just feel so alone , even though I have great friends and a loving family. I really just want to step in front of a car tonight.
