Part of the journey is the end. (18M)I think I am ready to go

I don't think I'm depressed, or suffer from mental health issues. But at the same time the thought of death is so comforting to me, I'm always so tired mentally, emotionally, and physically. It seems like it would be nice to drift away into nothingness rather then grind my way into corporate America and work for the rest of my life only to be killed by climate change or some bs. 

I look forward to getting a bag of helium and making my final goodbye messages. I hope I did good with my 18 years on this Earth, I'm ready to rest now.
