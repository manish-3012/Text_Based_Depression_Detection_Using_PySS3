my parents are refusing to let me get help againi am so goddamn hopeless. all i want to do is end it. i could have a happy life, i know that, but now is hard enough to make me not want that. i had a psychiatrist appointment scheduled on the 7th, but my dad found out and is in a fight with my mom about it, who keeps coming into my room to tell me its all my fault because i don't want to try to convince my father that i DESERVE to seek treatment for already diagnosed depression and ocd. i am tired. nothing ever gets better. tonight might be the night i go. i fucking hope so anyway.
