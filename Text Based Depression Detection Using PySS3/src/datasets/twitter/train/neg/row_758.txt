How do I get help?How do you reach out? I don't want to burden anyone, but I know if I don't talk about it I'll end it before university. I don't want to waste everything my parents have given me by dying, but I know I'll just end up disappointing them in the long run. I can't turn to the school counselors, one already doesn't like me and I'm to nervous to talk to the other one. My friends shouldn't have to be worried about me. I'm not close to many of my teachers, and I don't want the ones I am close to to be disappointed in me...

I wish I wasn't such a monumental fuck up.
