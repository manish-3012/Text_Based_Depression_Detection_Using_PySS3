I'm going to jump off a freeway bridge.I've been depressed and suicidal for 4 years now and I can't deal with it anymore. I've tried everything. I've been on numerous anti depressants, talked to  a therapist and other family members about it and I can't seem to find a solution. So I'm going to kill myself because I don't see any other way. And don't tell me "people care about you and will mourn for you" shit, it wouldn't matter if I'm dead. I'm finally going to do it and I'm so ready to finally kill myself I don't enjoy living anymore. I won't have to suffer anymore it would just all be gone.
