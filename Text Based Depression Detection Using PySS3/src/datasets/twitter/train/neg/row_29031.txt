Husband wants to divorce his disable, schizo, useless spouse... and I don't blame him. All I can think about is how much I want to die.Posted over on the [schizo subreddit about how I was having relationship troubles...](https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/7evmnw/have_any_tips_for_schizos_in_relationships_with/) He says he doesn't want to continue the relationship, hasn't felt close in years, and it's over. He is wanting to help me move on and isn't kicking me out or anything... but we sat for hours talking, and I kept thinking how much I want to die. I don't have the strength to start over... and i'm so broken now... 

edit: looks like I am going to spend Thanksgiving alone... I told him I didn't want to go hang with his family... I can't spend time around people I am losing... ghosts...
