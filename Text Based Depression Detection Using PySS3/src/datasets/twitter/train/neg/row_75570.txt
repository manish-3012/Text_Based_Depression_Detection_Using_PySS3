WiltingI feel like I'm wilting and I should just pull up the roots, make it less painful for my fiance and the others in my life.  My anxiety is literally paralyzing me,I can't seem to eat any thing but chocolate and sweet rolls. I'm way over weight, found out a few days ago I have PCOS and might not be able to have kids.  I think the only reason I'm alive is I'm frozen by my anxiety .
