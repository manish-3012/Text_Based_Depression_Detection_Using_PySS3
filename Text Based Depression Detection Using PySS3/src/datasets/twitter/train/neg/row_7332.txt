I can't connect with people anymore.It's like my mind has completely disconnected from itself. When I'm in social situations I have to strain to formulate thoughts. I can't speak correctly... it's broken when it comes out. I'm relatively catatonic. I can't live. I can't exist. I just shouldn't be here anymore. I'll never be a productive member of society and I've just hurt people.... my entire life. I've just hurt people. I hate that this is what I am, and I know that killing myself would cause more pain, but living just seems completely wasteful. I want to go. I just... want to go.
