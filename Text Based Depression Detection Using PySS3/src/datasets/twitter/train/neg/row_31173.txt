I feel like Iâ€™ll just end up killing myself no matter what I doIâ€™ve made a lot of mistakes and I think Iâ€™ve basically made it so my future is ruined. My boyfriend gives me a lot of hope that everything will be okay but lately heâ€™s been talking about breaking up or at least taking a break. It really hurts to think this is just happening and I feel trapped. I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™ll do and I feel like if he leaves I wonâ€™t be able to take it anymore. I canâ€™t tell anyone about it, I feel like itâ€™ll just be seen as a cry for attention. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore and I almost feel like I should just end everything now.
