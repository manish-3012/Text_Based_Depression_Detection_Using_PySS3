Just called the suicide hotline... fuck you rachel.I sat there for 5 minutes crying on the phone and I guess my cry or something about my voice made her not able to handle it and she was audibly laughing as I broke down on the phone. I heard what sounded like her get up then another representative come to the phone...thanks a ton....
