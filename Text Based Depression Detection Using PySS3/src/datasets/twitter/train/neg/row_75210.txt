My mother constantly forces me into situations where I have awful anxiety. She has also taken me out of therapy for depression. This weekend sheâ€™s making me go to a pool party. I think itâ€™s making my depression worse. How can I get her to understand that I genuinely have severe social anxietyObviously itâ€™s not just this thatâ€™s causing my desire for suicide. There are many more factors that play into it. But having severe social anxiety and a mother who wonâ€™t bother to listen to you about it really sucks.
