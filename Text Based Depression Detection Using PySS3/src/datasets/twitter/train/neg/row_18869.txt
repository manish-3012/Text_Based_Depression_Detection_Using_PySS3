Meet them where they are"Here" is one of the few "safe" places that people can come and talk openly about suicide without judgement and in theory, without eliciting an immediate emotional response that blocks that person from expressing their feelings.

The responses here are obviously going to be different to the responses that would be received by or made by the people that come here, in real life, in a "non professional" face to face setting.

I would be the first to admit that if I suffered a tragedy tomorrow, I wouldn't be in the best place to be here and "be present".

And that's exactly the point.  

It's the realisation that it's not that simple as thinking "count yourself lucky"  because oh my, you don't think that people destroy themselves that they can't think like that?  That they don't scream at themselves to stop feeling the way that they do?

Here, it is safe and we "meet them where they are" we join them in their despair, even with the knowledge that we may not be able to "make anything better" but offering that space and time, may be the one thing that is needed and that nobody else has ever done for them.

It is in fact a very precious thing to be able to offer yourself, to just "be" with somebody else and fully present to them.
