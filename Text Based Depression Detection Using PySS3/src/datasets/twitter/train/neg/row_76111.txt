I'm hanging on by a thread that is my familyIncoming angsty teenager. 

I'm in high school and I feel hopeless. I feel nothing. I have no motivation to change myself and rid myself of the list of insecurities I have that would break reddit. 

My only true friend won't be able to talk to me anymore soon. She is going to go to an online school and every form of communication with friends is going to be taken away from her. 

I feel worthless. I can't talk to people. It's bad enough that I'm gay so I'm attracted to guys, but it's worse because I can't even talk to anyone I'm relatively interested in. I shake and I'm afraid I'll fuck everything up. 

I'm not good at anything, no matter how hard I try, and I feel that it's too late to start doing anything with my life. Sometimes I lay awake at night, thinking of all the decisions I could have made earlier in life that could have made me happier now - deciding to keep playing a sport or keep some friends. The only thing I have are good grades. 

Whenever I seek out help or someone notices my struggle, they're dismissive. 

* My sisters have noticed it and just called me angsty. 

* My parents have noticed and didn't know how to handle it. My dad barely cares about me. 

* My friends have noticed, and they've gone through the same exact things, but they never ever reciprocate the help I gave them. 

I don't know how to get help or even if I want help. I'm afraid that if I do and seek out therapy that my parents would deny me it and get angry, either because they think I just want attention or because we have no money. 

I'm afraid that I'll be driven over the edge any day now. I'm teetering on it and may have already fallen, but a thread holds me up because I fear that it'd just break my family after my death.
