Deadlines in three days but I can't fucking get myself to do anythingPLEASE FUCKING END ME. DEATH IS BETTER THAN ALL THESE MIGRAINES IN MY HEAD. I CAN'T GET ANYTHING DONE. MEDS ARE NOT HELPING. SHITTY FAMILY. NO FRIENDS. SHITTY WORLD. NO WILL TO LIVE. NO REASONS TO GO ON. NOT SMART ENOUGH. NOT GOOD ENOUGH. NOT COURAGEOUS ENOUGH. BETTER OFF DEAD.
