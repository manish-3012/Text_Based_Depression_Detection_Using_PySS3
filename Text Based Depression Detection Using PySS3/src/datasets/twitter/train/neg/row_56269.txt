Will it be my fault if he dies?I met, what I thought, was a good friend when I went to the psych ward back in October. We clicked instantly as friends. He has already tried to kill himself once and I stopped it. I wrote a post about it.  Well, about a week ago he told me he was in love with me. I have a husband and two kids. I'm not looking to leave them. I rejected him and he has been very clingy and depressed since then. What's best for me is to cut all ties with him. I am just emotionally/mentally spent at this point. I am scared to tell him this because he has already threatened suicide if I "leave" him because I am the only person in his life. He really was a great friend until he fell for me. Should I feel guilty when he does kill himself?! I am so stressed about this. 


UPDATE: I talked to him about this on the phone and he is very upset. He is crying and threatening suicide. He told me he was going to tie a block on his foot and jump in the lake. He got off the phone with me and is still texting about how he fucked up and should have hid his feelings. Guys, I don't know what to do.
