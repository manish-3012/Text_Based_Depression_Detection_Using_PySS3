Iâ€™m gay and I deserve to die for itIâ€™m either doomed to fake it and marry a man or accept that Iâ€™m gay and be completely disowned by my family and friends.  Thereâ€™s no way around it.  Thereâ€™s something seriously wrong with me that I canâ€™t fix.  I hate that I was born like this.  It would save me so much trouble if I were to just die.
