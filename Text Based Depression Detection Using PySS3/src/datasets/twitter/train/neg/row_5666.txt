Where to go from here?I don't know why I haven't done away with myself by now. I really have no idea where to go from here. 
Maybe I should finally make a foolproof plan and go through with it? Maybe I should ask someone to take me to the hospital? Maybe I should just sleep and hope not to wake up? 

Can anyone relate? Anyone have advice? I'm just so incredibly lost
