Everything is meaningless enjoymentEventually we are all going to die
Might as well make the time you have worthwhile, right
But if you donâ€™t feel like the time you spend now or in the future is going to be worthwhile
Then whatâ€™s the point. 

People are just playthings you toss aside once their use has outlasted your interest 

In the end, everything is for nought
