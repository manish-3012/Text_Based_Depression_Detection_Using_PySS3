Spiritual consequences of a suicideI'm not 100% (as most are never) convinced yet in commiting suicide but interested in hearing on what you think are the spiritual consequences of commiting such an act. If you believe in karma and reincarnation -  would ending your life mean you would still be born again to learn those "lessons" or would this be it?
