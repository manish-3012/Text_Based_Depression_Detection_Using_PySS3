Think I'm gonna stay until August 22nd.Im quite young, only 16, finished my GCSEs. Recently just lost literally all of my friends irl. They were the only people making me think it's worth living on. They didn't know about my suicidal thoughts or depression, though. 

I'm just curious about my GCSE results, then I can end it all. I don't know why I'm posting here if I'm honest, maybe I'm hoping someone can convince me but don't want to admit it to myself.
