My girlfriends suicidal but isnâ€™t here legallyMy Russian girlfriend of 2 months is here (USA) illegally and weâ€™re planning on getting married. Sheâ€™s had suicide attempts  before when she was younger but got the help she needed and started taking depression pills. She started to not feel like herself anymore so stopped and was fine for years. She has manic depression and had her first major episode last night. Didnâ€™t try to hurt herself but kept saying thereâ€™s no point anymore and just wants it to end. I was terrified and wanted to take her the hospital but she refused because of fears of getting deported. This morning she woke up feeling more like herself and is sorry about hurting me last night, even though Iâ€™ve told her not to be sorry and that I care about her. She needs her pills again and Iâ€™m so afraid to leave her alone while Iâ€™m at work. Is there anything I can do to help more than be as supportive as I can. Iâ€™m terrified and canâ€™t stop crying please I need some kind of help Iâ€™m the only one she has here.
