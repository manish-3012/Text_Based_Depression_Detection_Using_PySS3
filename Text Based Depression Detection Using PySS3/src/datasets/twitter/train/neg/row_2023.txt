Itâ€™s okayIâ€™m ready. I know how Iâ€™m going to do it. I know when Iâ€™ll get the chance to. And itâ€™s okay. Because i was meant to do this. And itâ€™ll all stop once Iâ€™m done and that is the most relieving thought. I have people who will miss me but I canâ€™t keep going for them anymore. Itâ€™s gonna be okay
