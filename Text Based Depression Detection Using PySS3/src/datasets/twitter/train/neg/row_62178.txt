Hate that Iâ€™ve ended up like thisSo I just donâ€™t want to do it anymore. I donâ€™t actually want to lull myself, but Iâ€™m having a hard time seeing reasons to be happy that Iâ€™m here.

The pandemic has wasted my career. Iâ€™m married to someone I am fairly certain is a narcissist and I just donâ€™t have the energy or will anymore to leave. I donâ€™t want to start over. I donâ€™t want to rebuild. I just want it to be over. I donâ€™t really want help or medication or anything.

Not sure why I am posting this. Itâ€™s my first post ever on this platform. I think I just wanted to say this to someone who doesnâ€™t know who I am.
