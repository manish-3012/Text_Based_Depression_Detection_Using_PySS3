My letter short and simpleIt's been quite a day, or year if you want to take it that far. Can't help but think about all the things I've done to get where I'm at. At least I can say I'm still breathing. Not that, that isn't enough.. 
To live, to love, to be in peace. Do this and you will do fine. On the other hand too many factors. There will always be roadblocks that trip you along the way. 
Hell, if I had a penny for everytime I've fallen.. I can't begin to thank the people that have been there for me enough. So thank you.
