Im not sire how to cope... So sad and alone :(hey guys. my girlfriend has been having a really hard time lately as have I, long atory short she hasnt seen her daughter in almost a year and it was getting really hard for her this week and especially yesterday.   She was extremely manic and all over the place yesterday,  normally she is the sweetest most caring loving person i have ever met.  She jas been acting off lately, but still kind of herself.  well fast-forward to yesterday and it finally exploded. i have my sons for the first time in a few years for Christmas Eve and she was so excited to be a part of our Christmas.  She helped pick everything out for santa and we were both really excited.   As i was just now putting santas stuff out it really hit me, shes not here with me , instead shes alone in psych ward on Christmas . I turned my back for literally a minute but thats all it took for her and im extremely scared and sad without her . I love her so much and this is to much. Im so scared to live life without her by my side, and she zaid some things that were extremely hurtful and just not true. Im blamimg myself that i didnt call 911 sooner. I dont know why she felt the need to try to leave without saying bye,  but i know she loves me so much ......  Merry Xmas and stay safe, watch your loved ones close, i wish someone was here to watch me:(
