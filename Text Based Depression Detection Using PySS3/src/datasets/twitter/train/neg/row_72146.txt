I'm tired of being aliveI'm not happy, I can't see myself ever being happy. I have no friends (I did, but I don't now) I've completely messed up my chance of graduating, I don't have the energy to get out of bed (or if I do, theres usually a lot of crying involved), I'm good at very very few things. i wish my parents would have had a less disappointing kid, I feel so guilty. I'm 17, the idea of living for potentiality another 60-80 years seems unbearable.
