How do I keep living?I was wondering if anybody knows how to find a will to live. It sounds really dumb, I know.
But I don't think I can live much longer. I don't want to die but I cannot keep doing this. Do you know how you find motivation to live? Maybe a goal or something I can live for in the long run?
If I don't do something soon I might commit suicide which I truly don't want.
 Help would be appreciated.
