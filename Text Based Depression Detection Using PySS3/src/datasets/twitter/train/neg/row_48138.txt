Health Anxiety driving me insaneTuesday I almost killed myself. Because of pure exhaustion from my anxiety.

I already had health anxiety before the pandemic but somehow itâ€™s intensified and has nothing to do with COVID itself. My brain is just constantly spewing about how Iâ€™m either having a heart attack or a stroke or an aneurysm.


Itâ€™s been that way every day since May. Maybe Late April.
And Iâ€™ve done nonstop crying and panicking and then going into depressive episodes. Iâ€™m so tired of it all. 

But I almost did and I still want to. Iâ€™m just so exhausted of my thoughts and myself constantly spiraling into this dangerous cycle and I want it to end.
