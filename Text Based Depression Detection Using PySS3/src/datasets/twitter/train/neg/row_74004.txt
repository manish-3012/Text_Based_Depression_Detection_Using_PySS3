What's the point of going to work if I'm gonna kill myself soonI might just stop showing up. I don't know why I care anymore I'll literally be dead soon. I hate my job anyway and it's a small but still-existing part of why I want to die so why should I let them take so many of my last hours.



I wanna walk in tell my boss to go eat shit and then get in my car drive a thousand miles away and hang myself
