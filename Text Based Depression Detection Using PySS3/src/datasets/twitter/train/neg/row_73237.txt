The red envelopeI keep it in my pocket, the red envelope, but I never look inside.
Your name is written on the outside
In bubbly cursive, happy, happier, happiest
So that when that day comes you'll know that the person who wrote the letter inside
In jagged, rushed, painful block print
Loved your name so much.
You'll know it was never your fault. You'll know how deeply loved you always were. 
The red envelope is from your muse.
The letter inside is from your monster.
