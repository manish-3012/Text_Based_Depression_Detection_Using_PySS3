I can't cryI can't cry, and this is the time I want to

I remember when I was really social, really healthy, incredibly ambitious and just a smiling type. But even then I felt shit. Now that just seems exaggerated and completely idealistic. I can remember teachers kept saying ''Oh he has the ability but he just needs to push himself'' 
I have that notion, I keep pushing and it's pathetic.

I want to love everyone and for everyone to love each other. But how can I love people and make people happy when I can't even be happy myself. 

I was a dreamer, I still am. But at least now I realise that they're dreams, nothing else. 
I still didn't get to the point in my life where I can fully articulate what I'm feeling into words. And I never wanted to express what I'm feeling, I wanted to prove to myself and everyone that I can do it and you can do it. But that's just fantasy no matter how nice I make it look.

Love Yourself and Love others
