Feeling passively suicidal alot.I think about it alot. I google depression tests all the time. Like i need someone to give me permission. To reassure me that i feel like this because I definitely have mental health problems. Even though ive been diagnosed by my dr and am on meds. Which were helping but i stopped taking because i froze. But also feel ridiculous and self indulgent because 'what the fuck am i so depressed about? How selfish am i to even entertain killing myself? WTF is wrong with me?' And that its all attention seeking..every self test i do tells me im high risk and i should go straight to emergency room because im in crisis. But i just cant take it seriously. Is it normal to feel like this? I dont know how to move on. I dont want to cause pain to my kids or husband but i dont want to live like this either...
