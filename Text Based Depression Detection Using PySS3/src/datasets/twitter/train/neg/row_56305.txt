Dead inside?I have never felt more depressed and suicidal in my life. Every night I go to sleep praying that I wonâ€™t wake up. I feel completely shattered and yet I canâ€™t cry. I have not properly cried in months now. I used to cry all the time but somehow the tears just arenâ€™t coming now. Why? I just want to let it out but for some reason i just canâ€™t express anything at all. Just hiding behind a fake smile and fake laughter. How can I learn to cry again? How can I learn to become real again?
