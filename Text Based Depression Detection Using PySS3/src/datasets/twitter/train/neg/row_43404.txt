Harassment but I probably deserve itI woke up to men, including â€œmale feminists,â€ sending me dick pics and others talking to me about incest fantasies. This was in response to me talking about my trauma of being molested by my father and then shame about sexual experimentation I did as a teenager from the hypersexual effects of abuse. These responses have tipped me over the edge and I feel like it confirms people see me as a freak. I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s to do anymore. Iâ€™m permenantly ruined. I can never be a normal girl.
