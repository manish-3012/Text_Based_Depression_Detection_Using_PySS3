I think I might kill myself tonightAbout a year ago I was really bad off, was depressed for 4 years and had finally conjured up the courage to try to kill myself, but my parents took me to the hospital where they sent an ambulance to take me to a different hospital. They kept me there in this program they had for adolescents for about a week and a half and then let me go, but requiring I came in to therapy group session type thing for a month. We would go there about the time we'd go to school and we'd do that Monday through Friday for a month to 2 months. then I had another group therapy session for aroub 2 and a half hours after school each day for 8 weeks, and now I just have to see a therapist every week. I've been through a lot of therapy since then beside my weekly visits and everyone thought I was getting better. They even convinced me I was getting better until about a week ago when things sort of feel apart, and now I'm back at square 1. Getting bullied by kids at school, antagonized by teachers, yelled at by parents, all that jazz. Finals are next week and I can't bring myself to deal with them because of how everything is falling apart again. Before I killed myself I just wanted to see what everyone had to say, because I'm pretty sure I'm going to do it tonight.
