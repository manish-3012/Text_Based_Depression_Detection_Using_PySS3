There is no reason for me to stay.I have reached a point where I couldn't possibly think of a reason to stay, or anything, have reasons to leave early actually.

There is noone to truly care about me.
My father was never truly there for me, drank, abused my mother, used me, lied to me. Typical narcissist.

My mother, the last one I loved, mocked me, humiliated me for self harm and feeling like shit, made it about herself. 

And I suddenly realize, I've always been alone. I thought at least my mother would care, but apparently not. I can never see her in the same light again, believe she loves me. I've been lied to again. If anything, she'd probably feel no remorse to hit me again from here on.

My "friends" are all immature, fake bugs that pretend to care for the sole purpose of not starving as a loner, and keeping up a good outer image. I've always been introverted, but the few I let take part in my life for a bit were never genuine.

With only 14 years old, I'm already mentally ill to extents I disconnect from reality, live inside my head, can't control my anger, suffer from ptsd, dpdr and depression. I'm going to end up as some miserable, pitied adult that is fucked because of her child and teen years. I've already done so many mistakes.

Anything could happen to me. I could win a million euros, win 50 competitions, whatever. But I finally realized, that I live based on lies, abuse, and illness.

With noone to care, no future to look forward to, and a mind broken, I see no reason to be in any more pain. My dogs will die, which will absolutely kill me off, my relationships worsen, and my years of absolute isolation as an adult draw closer. 

To put it short, it can only get worse. It'd be nice to at least go before everything is on fire.
