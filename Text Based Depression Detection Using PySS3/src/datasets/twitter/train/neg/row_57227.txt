I don't know what to do anymoreThe person I loved the more than anything told me I was probably never going to see her again. I don't have anyone to talk to and I don't know what to do. I wasn't told why, and I don't have anyone to talk to at all.  Not knowing why seems like enough reason to die, it eats at the back of my mind at all times. 

It has been a year, and as everything reminds me of her, not because of nostaligia, but as we did so much together.
