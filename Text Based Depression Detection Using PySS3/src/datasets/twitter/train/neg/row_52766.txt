guys I hope you all have a great life and not a wasted one like i hadits just time for me to go. i am starting to become lonely with no one to back me up, and people have already started rejecting me whenever I try to speak to them and my parents (mom, stepfather) are starting to see me as a mistake my mother had with my real dad, and that i was the WRONG child she had. its starting to get REAL worse and i think suicide might be the only right way for me now. I need to find something to commit suicide with, but I dunno what. if you have any ideas, leave them in the comments ig.
