So upset.Iâ€™m so upset and I just canâ€™t take it.. I keep trying to make progress so I can achieve my goal and get my happy ending but everything just keeps getting worse and is telling me I should just give up and die. Iâ€™m probably about to self harm worse than I ever have because I have the urge to after what Iâ€™ve learned and how much of an idiot I am. Iâ€™m a little scared but honestly nothing could hurt more than what Iâ€™ve been going through so Iâ€™ll probably be fine.
