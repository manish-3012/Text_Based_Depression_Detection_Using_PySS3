I just lost my job.I can't help but to feel like a complete failure. I did nothing wrong and I'm filing an appeal but I feel like I just got pushed farther back than before. I'm about to lose everything and I have painkillers in my room and I love sleeping so why not go to sleep and just pretend I'll wake up feeling better? I valued my life before but now I just don't want to do anything anymore, I'm tired of trying to reach my goals and trying to provide for myself and take care of myself on my own but I just give up. I don't plan on ever having kids so I have no future or anything to look forward to in my future. I lost interest in so many things because of my bipolar depression I feel like I got better and things were going good and I just got slapped in the face and pushed afterwards. I don't feel like I'll ever do anything with my life except just bounce from job to job. I just want to disappear and not deal with people or see anyone or have anyone see me again. I want my family to leave me alone and I want to be alone and by myself and I just want to disappear and just not exist. Like erase myself. all my childhood was nothing but abuse and I just don't want to be a person anymore I don't want to exist I don't feel like I should be here anymore cause I'm not doing anything except just living and breathing I just want to die peacefully by myself. this is my thought process right now I'm going through a lot. Kind words are nice but I think I'm going to go to sleep now. my names Alicia and it was nice being brought into the world but frankly I think i don't want to be in it anymore.
