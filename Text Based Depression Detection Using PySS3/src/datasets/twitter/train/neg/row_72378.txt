Can we not gatekeep suicidal depression?Hello. I had an interesting conversation with another redditor the other day from my post. I was gonna attempt and this person tried to talk me down, only to get agitated at me and say,â€ youâ€™re only attention seeking and wasting good peopleâ€™s time.â€ Like isnâ€™t the point of this subreddit to be a bit attention seeking? I wanted someone to talk me out of it. But donâ€™t tell me that Iâ€™m not suicidally depressed, you donâ€™t fucking know me and what Iâ€™m going through. You shouldnâ€™t have that attitude if youâ€™re trying to help people on here. Thank you all, I hope you have a good day.
