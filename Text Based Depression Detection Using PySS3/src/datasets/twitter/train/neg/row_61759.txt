I just took a bunch of ibuprofen and I regret it please helpIt was in the heat of the moment, Iâ€™m stupid I know. But I took maybe 10 or so tablets of ibuprofen and now that Iâ€™ve thought about it, I donâ€™t wanna die yet. Wtf do I do, am I going to die? I read that in some cases it can kill you but I didnâ€™t find out how much you have to take before you die.
