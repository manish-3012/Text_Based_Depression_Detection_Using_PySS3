I canâ€™t anymoreIve already tried suicide last year and failed at that. My life has only gone even more downhill from there. I got locked in a psych ward for weeks, I got back into hard drugs, ive been put on every antidepressant/antipsychotic in the book and just when I think I found the one thatll finally work, it stops working. Even though we just raised the dose. Im so tired of this post suicide failure life. Its worse than it was before. Its been months since then and nothing has gotten better. Its been years since ive been struggling with BPD and depression and about a million other clinical diagnoses and I keep hearing it gets better. Well I know its not getting better. No therapy, no medication, no person is able to help me. Im alone in life, ive never had a girlfriend, my parents both dont love me because they see how worthless I am. Even my dog would be better off without me. All I do is push everyone away and cause drama everywhere I go. I burden everyone elses life, I burden my own life. So why are people trying to keep me on earth? Do they want me to suffer more? Its getting to the point that I dont even feel like a human being anymore. I have nothing to be proud of at 18 years old. I havenâ€™t accomplished anything. Im one of the dumbest people I know and I would do anything to not be as ugly as I am. I really wish I had a gun so I could end it all painlessly and quick because cutting and pills take too long. This isnt even a cry for help anymore. Nothing anyone can say hasnt already been repeated over and over and over to me. Nothing anyone says will hold any weight to me anymore. Im just so tired of existing and bringing down everyone around me with me. Someone please kill me because im not even smart enough to do it myself.
