Just gonna rambleI never felt suicidal until the summer of 2015. After I was sexually assaulted I was convinced I had HIV (I had mono three weeks later which mimics the symptoms of seroconversion exactly). I hated myself for putting myself in a position that could wreck my life. I quit seeing my family and going to train martial arts because I was scared I would accidentally infect someone (you're most infectious the first 6 weeks).

After looking up the cost and terrible side affects of the HIV meds, I realized I could never burden someone with a relationship if I was positive. So I broke it off with the guy I was falling for and decided if I was positive suicude was the only option. This horrified me because I loved being alive and my self hatred reached new levels, since I blamed myself for what happened. 

I cried all day every day for weeks alone. I tried going to a few clinics for help but they were only interested in helping homosexuals psychologically. I was too afraid and ashamed to report the assault for many reasons so I didn't get help.

After I finally tested definitely negative I thought I would feel relieved and grateful. But nothing got better. Ive been alone and unable to function since. A lot of really horrible things also happened to me in mental hospitals and stuff. I lost my dog and the abusive guy I dated stole over 10k from me.

At some point I fixated on suicide again. The constant fear of death was gone and the PTSD lifted. I stopped having panic attacks and nightmares. But if I start feeling a desire to live again, I am overwhelmed with grief, terror and grief at everything I have lost and how evil some people are. I feel like if I ever found a smidgen of happiness it will be taken from me or used against me. The person I was a year ago gone. I'm not a person anymore. I've been dead for a very long time already.
