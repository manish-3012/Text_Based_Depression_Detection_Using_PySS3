The idea of suicide seems comforting to meReading through some posts here, I understand logically that my life is supposed to be okay. I'm 18, recently started working as a full time developer in a start up. Finished school with great grades and supposed to go to Uni next year.

However, I think of commiting suicide almost daily. I feel like anyone who has been my friend is now derogatory towards me. I feel like if I don't act like shit towards who I thought were my friends I won't get any respect. Same goes with my mother who's a depressed woman that takes it all out on me.

To be honest, nothing really feels fun to me anymore. Not trying to date girls, not playing my intruments. The only thing I think about that makes me feel some comfort, that makes me a little bit happy is the thought of just ending it all and writing a letter to everyone.
