Every time I drive I just want to jerk the wheelItâ€™d be so easy, and then everything would be over. I could do it in the night so that I wouldnâ€™t harm anyone else in the process. Then all of the worries, the dread, the soul crushing sadness, would all be over. I donâ€™t see the light at the end of the tunnel anymore. I know I should probably get back on my antidepressants. Iâ€™ve been off them for two weeks and I thought I was lucky enough not to experience any side effects...unfortunately they were just postponed until I had hope I could go without it. I donâ€™t want to rely on a pill in order to function as a normal human being. Iâ€™m done trying.
