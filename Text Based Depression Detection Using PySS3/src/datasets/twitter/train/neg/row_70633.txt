Lost my bf, all of my friends, and the place I consider homeMy boyfriend of 3.5 years just broke up with me out of nowhere. I've lived in the country I am in for 5 years now, but it has been on student visa time so it doesn't count towards citizenship. My visa expires in January so we were going to get a civil partnership so I could have another guaranteed 2.5-5 years here but that is now gone.

  


I have made so many life-long friends here who will no longer be life-long because I am getting kicked out of the country now. The entire life I have built here is for fucking nothing.

  


I won't do anything but idk if a car or something were to hit me in a genuinely freak thing, that would be ok with me. I've had a lot of stuff happen to me, but nothing has come close to how emotionally obliterated I am right now. He is my entire world and we are perfect for each other. I don't know how I'm going to cope with this. I have a history of depression and lots of mental health weirdness, and this has kind of triggered a lot of already existing issues with abandonment and self-worth. 

I don't want to exist in a world where I'm in this much pain. I'm talking with friends though and don't have any actual plans but there was never an 'after' him in my brain and I don't think I'll ever be ready to have one.
