I live two different livesI don't know how to properly start this text, but i'm 19 and i've been dealing with depression for the past few years. The worst part about is that i don't have any particular reason for it, i'm just completely unhappy with life itself and i don't see a a point in living.
I have got a great social life and a lot of friends who see me as a hilarious and cool guy and i really enjoy their company, but as soon as i'm back alone the depression starts to kick in again. I get mad at myself because i know i don't have anything major to complain about and this is what makes it worse for me. I read other peoples posts here about their serious conditions and i'm just a whiny douchebag that fucks his life up because of nothing.
No one knows this side of me and i don't think i have a person to which i could fully open up to about this topic.
How can i deal with the feeling that i'm worthless even through i'm doing okay in life?
