Life is pointless.We suffer through years of school just so we can go to the same monotonous job everyday until we're old and have no energy to do anything and then we die and in a few generations we're completely forgotten. Why go through so much bullshit for nothing. There's no point in doing anything. I wish I was never born. I wish I never existed.
