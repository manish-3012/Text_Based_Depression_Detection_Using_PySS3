My GF's twin sister took her own life 5 months ago. Some of the things she says worries me. How to be there for a grieving person who talks of suicide?I have personally had to deal with grief before myself but never to this degree. I know twins have close relationships in more ways than one and my GF describes it that way too. She has her good days and bad days, but her bad days are really bad and sometimes I am not sure what to say if anything. As someone who has had grief and been to therapy for many years for my own issues I know how important it is to listen. I am also painfully aware of the stages of grief, but this is different to me. Some of the things she has said which I didn't know how to respond to:

* I don't see the reason for anything anymore if I can't share my experiences with someone anymore. If I could switch places with her I would in a second without thinking. I wish I could have gone with her and be done with it. 

* I just can't fathom her not existing anymore. One minute I am living my life and the next I am getting a call that she is dead. I just can't deal with this. Why didn't she tell me what was going on with her. I see her right in front of me. I literally know everything about her; how she thinks, how she is, what she feels like and I just can't even say that she is dead. I can't even speak about her in the past-tense. I can see her right in front of me. I am still just waiting that one day she will just text me. I just want here with me. I just want to talk to her. I don't have anyone to talk to anymore. Nobody will ever replace her. I will never be able to talk to someone like her again. 

* I am going to go crazy. This will never get better. Some days I would just rather not even exist. I have nobody. I'd rather just hang myself and be done with it. 

So, I am have depressed to the point of thinking of putting a shotgun barrel in my mouth but I always knew I could never do it. I never talked about it outloud because it was always a passing thought, but I mean... on her bad nights especially after we've been drinking a little and trying to have a good time her cry is so incredibly deep and painful I can almost feel her pain myself even though I was an only child. It' such a deep cry that I start crying. It's incredibly gut wrenching. It's terrible and I feel helpless because I want to help, but I feel like when a person is grieving so heavily let-alone when your twin takes their own life so suddenly the best thing I can do is listen. 

We have already discussed seeing a psychiatrist to help her, but she goes back and forth with saying it's a good idea to last night where she said "this will never get better. Another person can't help me. What can a complete stranger do for me?" 

So what can I do? I obviously can't force her to do anything; but I am just worried about her.

  **tl;dr**: Girlfriend's twin sister whom she was really really close with took her own life and GF is having hard time coping often talking about suicide and wishing she could have gone with her or switched places. Not sure how to handle. Openness to talking to a psych has been yes and no depending on her mood; so for now I just want to know how to best be there for her.
