Life isn't for me.Let's get straight to the point. 
I've been severely depressed for quite some time and I want to kill myself. I've stopped going to school just a few months ago. My parents haven't noticed anything, but they just let me stay home. I want anti-depressants but I don't have the heart to tell my parents. I used to be a top student in 8th grade, but everything went downhill in such a quick time. They don't care as much as they did in the 8th. Maybe that's because they expect me to take care of myself now. I don't have a purpose. I don't know what to do with my education. I don't want to have an education and I already want to drop out. It devestates me knowing I'd have to keep the same routine each day. It's a mindset type of thing, and I assure you my mindset is far from suited to living LIFE.
I just want to sleep for eternity. I don't enjoy things as I used to. My sleeping schedule is messed the fuck up; sleeping at 12AM or so and waking up around 9pm. I'm messed up, and it hurts to see that everyone around me either doesn't care to check up on me or doesn't see anything wrong with me and pictures me as "the bad girl who doesn't go to school". I'm only young but I already feel as if shit is just not for me. I can assure you I do have potential, lots of it. It'd be a miracle if something just magically made my mindset full of positivity. And seeing as my mom struggles as well as my older sister, I can see where I'm going from here. I just had to let this out.
Please try not to say anything like "make a purpose for yourself" because I already know about that. I know what I SHOULD be doing. I don't even know whether this is just pure laziness, depression, or even both mixed together which is a fucking disaster. 
This is my first post and I barely have anyone to vent out to so I decided to use reddit.
