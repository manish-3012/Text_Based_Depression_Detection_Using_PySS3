should I just end it this summer? And if so, how?I had suicidal thoughts since I was 8, and tried killing myself when I was 9 fro the first time. For more than a 1/3 of my life I always felt depressed. I always felt like I was a burden on others, to be honest the only reason I'm still here is because of the internet. I have attempted drinking bleach, ingesting random pills, hanging myself, chocking, and cutting. None has worked so far. A couple of weeks ago my school found out about my cut marks, it is forbiden in my religion to commit suicide, but I just can't stop myself. I am hoping to end it this summer at around 5-7am. So that there would be nobody to stop me. I am yet to decide which way to kill myself. But I'm hoping for something that doesn't hurt too much, for example no stabbing myself. I'm also quite not sure whether I should just run away from home, and do it in a remote area. Or just in my home. What's the most perfect plot in your point of view?
