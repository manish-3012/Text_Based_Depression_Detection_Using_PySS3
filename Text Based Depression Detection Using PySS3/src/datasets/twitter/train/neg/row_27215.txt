I don't deserve to liveI just can't do it anymore. I am an absolute and total failure in every way one can be. I'm fat, lazy, unintelligent, angry, and just all in all a bad person. I'm alone and rightfully so. I worked so hard a few years ago to get in shape and lose weight and now I'm the heaviest I've ever been in my life. I can never apply myself to anything and I always give up on anything I do because I know I'll never be good at it anyway. I dropped out of college because I just could not handle all of the work and could not comprehend things fast enough, while everyone around me has either graduated from some form of education or are getting ready to. I constantly see how happy my ex is in their new relationship with someone far more successful than I and it crushes me. I see  everyone around me living full, happy lives and I'm glad they are, I really am, but it just makes it that much worse to know how much of a failure I am. I'm just so angry with myself and that has lead me to damaging and destroying a few relationships already. I used to have a good control on my anger but now I'm slipping. I get so mad so easily and then I just feel terrible that I got mad and then I get even angrier with myself.

The most ironic part is that on paper I have a really good life and it just makes me so angry that I can have as much as I do and still feel this way. I don't deserve to feel like this when other people are out there suffering from much worse circumstances. I just feel worthless. I feel like I can't contribute anything meaningful to this world.

My mind just feels like a dark maze that I am lost in, with constant obstacles and pitfalls and I just want out. I can't think or focus on anything and it has just weighed on me for too long, to the point where I don't think I can ever make it back to any sort of happiness. I'm afraid I'm just too far gone and I just need to put a stop to it right now before I hurt more people in the process.
