I was hospitalized in November for attempting suicide.At four AM on November first I drank a bottle of vodka and tried to hang myself from my bathroom door. For five hours I was going in and out of consciousness, suspended by my neck, in complete darkness. Around nine in the morning my father kicked in the door and found me wheezing covered in my own vomit. The next two weeks I was involuntarily admitted to a inpatient facility. The "counselors" seemingly did more harm than good, and only confirmed my fears; which were the main driving force behind my attempt. I still want to kill myself, but this time I don't want to want to kill myself. I'll just keep my fingers crossed for an accidental death.
