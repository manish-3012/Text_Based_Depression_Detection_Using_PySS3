i just want to stop livingthis feels stupid to say but i guess saying this is better than keeping it bottled up. don't really expect any responses but whatever.   
i don't think im depressed, like at all. im happy with life. buttttt i don't want to live. i think "i want to stop living". just kinda like *poof* then im gone, regardless of the how. im just tired of being alive. i look up clips of suicide attempts from tv shows and movies and fantasize about doing them myself. is that weird? Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯ sometimes i come up with plans but i never go through with it. maybe one day, but not now. so yeah, suicidal but not depressed i guess...? thanks for listening
