I want to die before I turn 25...It's been a while since I've been thinking about it... It all started , two years ago when the idea of turning 25 makes you old... and the idea that I'll lonely for the rest of my life makes me sad... I don't want to get married or even have kids someday... I just don't want to get old , I do have some mixed feeling at the time I want to get a girlfriend like most of my peers and at the same time I don't want to because no matter what I do I'll end up hurting the person.. I'm a useless human being that deserves nothing , I have lots of regrets such as I'm not able to speak for myself , I can't make friends , I can't talk to people easily even tho I really want to be friends with them... I'm sad of being fat. I'm currently 17 years old and I think it's too late to turn my life towards a better direction. I don't want to be selfish and think only for myself I don't want to hurt my family especially my little brother but... I can't do this anymore.

Thank you for reading... and also sorry for my bad English
