Canâ€™t stop thinking about it.I donâ€™t think I really wanna die, but I canâ€™t stop thinking about it and planning it out. I told my doctor and she made me come in and she changed my meds. Didnâ€™t really help. Looking for a therapist right now. But it would be nice to not have to worry about anything. Thinking about ending it actually makes me feel better.
