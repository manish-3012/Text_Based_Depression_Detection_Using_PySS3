Don't even know why i am bothering to post here I guess I have nothing to lose and nowhere to turnI honestly have no idea why do I even continue through everyday there is no point my life is a joke and a series of bad events that make it impossible to find a reason to live on, I honestly don't want to wake up anymore I have no friends or any support my girlfriend gets pissed off or annoyed whenever I get depressed and I'm only with her cause no one else will love me and I don't want to be alone I prefer a farce if a relationship than loneliness. I honestly want to die there is nothing to look forward to or that gives my life any purpose I hate my job and people there hate me despite being friendly they look at me with such contempt and walk around me like I'm fucking made of egg shells, they treat me like I'm some kind of creep which I'm not I swear no girls allow me to walk even behind them cause they stop and wait for me to walk by sometimes they cover their behinds just to make me feel more like shit! I don't stare I'm not a fucking pervert, I always walk with my head down and always have to hide in some corner of the factory to cry cause I can't take it anymore I swear I want to kill myself with the industrial equipment there, and I fucking hate the state of Indiana all a bunch of bigots where I live I tried to buy a bedroom set on Craigslist, took me to some upper class neighborhood where the seller looked at me like a poor piece of shit and had his hand on the taser the whole transaction and still told me to leave once I had him the money, I wish I had friends or support, I wish someone would have cared enough about me, what is the point of living if I hate myself more than anything where everything I do is a complete failure and I'm just a failure. Why should I get up anymore when I'm just a joke I have a gun and I really want to pull the trigger but why can't I!!! WHY!! I DONT WANT TO BE HERE ANYMORE! Nobody care nor will ever care the world isn't losing anything special if I pull this trigger I'm just plain worthless and that's all I'll ever be, I don't really expect anyone to listen or care I guess I just wanted to be heard for once
