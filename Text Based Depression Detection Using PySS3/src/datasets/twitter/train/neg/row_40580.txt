Life has been hard since I was bornI come from a fucked up childhood. I have all sorts of emotional issues. My mom, my only friend, died when I was 12. My stepfather abused me horribly. I grew up to be clingy, overly sensitive and emotional, and obsessive. I've been raped twice in my life. Once when I was 17. And once again a month ago. 

A week ago the love of my life left me. Now he is ignoring me. 

I am unlovable. I have ruined every good thing in my life. I found love and I used to think "its okay that these bad things happened to me, because it led me to him" but even he has realized that I am unlovable. I cant be fixed no matter how hard I try. My emotions ruin everything. I feel everything to the extreme.  I can never just be sad or lonely. Every time I am sad or lonely, it is the saddest and loneliest I've ever been in my life and it is devastating. Is that why I love him so obsessively? I want to die. I hope that if I die maybe something better is waiting for me. Or at least this pain will stop. I am so tired of hurting. It's a lifetime of guilt and shame and heartbreak squeezed into me. 

I hate when you call me strong. I am not strong. I am just barely surviving. Dont tell me my rape wasnt my fault. I turned to prostitution, I put myself in a bad situation. He told me to be careful and I didn't listen. Dont tell me it gets better. It wasn't been good since the day I came to this earth and I doubt things will change 22 years later. 

I want to go out quietly. But then I want to go out loud and ferociously. But no matter how I go, I want him to be the last thing I see.
