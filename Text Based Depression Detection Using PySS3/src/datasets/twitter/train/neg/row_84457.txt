Need helpI am stuck right now and I dont know what to do. Long story short: Was made to move to U.S. at a young age to have a chance at a future, moved in with parent and family that I didnt know very well, was sexually abused for a few years, didnt have anyone here that I could confide in, struggling with depression for the last ~10 years, no money, friends and almost homeless multiple times, made it to college and started dating someone who helped me get through the depression, few years after college we were still together but the depression started creeping back and it became too much for her so she left. Now all the old feelings are coming back, suicide thoughts and all. I dont think that I will do anything crazy right now but if I dont get better soon I am afraid of what might happen in one of those moments where im feeling at my lowest. She left ~2 months ago and I have seen multiple doctors but it hasnt helped. 

I saw her today and I've been on the floor crying since I got back home. I need advice as to what I can do to get out of this state that i'm in right now.
