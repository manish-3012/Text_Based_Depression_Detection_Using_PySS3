i briefly thought i would die in an accident.nothing too serious, but last night i was stuck in an elevator for a couple of minutes. it was very scary because the whole place started shaking, it felt like the ground was going to crack beneath my feet, i was all alone and the buttons and phone didn't work. this is actually a fairly common occurrence with the elevator in my building, but no one ever died from it or got hurt or anything. (they're always "fixing it", but it just keeps happening). it's just really nerve wracking, and being all alone it was quite traumatic i guess. 


my first thought was "okay, this is not how i wanted to die". possible scenarios flashed through my mind. either the elevator was going to fall out or explode (?) or something like that and i'd be destroyed with it, or i was going to be stuck there forever and eventually die without food and water (impossible because people would be trying to fix the elevator in a couple hours and find me ofc). when the door opened and i landed safely i felt extremely relieved. 


i just find it so ironic that i am a suicidal person, but whenever i have my little encounters with death, i feel so scared and i just wanna go back. like the times i swallowed too many pills on purpose, or slashed my wrist too badly, or was almost hit by a car. for a brief moment when you feel like "well this is it" it's like you lose all your breath and time stops and nothing feels real. it's so weird. so surreal.


just a rant, i guess. today has been really rough, and i just caught myself thinking "i wish i had died in the elevator yesterday". oh well.
