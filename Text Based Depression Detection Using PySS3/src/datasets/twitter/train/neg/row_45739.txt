no one to cry to no place to call homeim so alone. i have no family at all. been on my own since i was 12, moved from place to place to place to place, never had one person to talk to about anything. don't have anyone if I'm sad, mad, if i do something good there's no one to tell. If i fall i pick myself up, but im tired of getting up. i hurt all of the time. As i sit everyday silently 
I scream in my head as loud as i can begging this to all end wishing it was over but I'm to scared to end it, i dont want to mess up and live through it, i dont want any more pain. i just want a family. anyone. A mother, a dad, sibling, anyone. I just want someone to tell me they love me and they missed me if i go somewhere or that someone is thinking about me at all i just want to matter to one person. But it doesn't matter and i don't matter and no one will ever remember this and no one will ever know i even wrote this bc i don't matter to anyone or anything if you comment thank you but you don't know me you just saw something that made you feel bad for me no one cares at all i just want my mom i just want someone im so alone I'm so scared i can't stop crying and my inside my head i can't stop screaming i just want it to end
