Who to open up to when you don't really have anyone?My relationships are, the people I work with (not on bad terms but not friendly with anyone), my pot dealer, and my mom and brother. I've tried to talk with my mom and brother but that hasn't helped for various reasons. Sometimes it feels like it would help if I had someone to talk, frankly, with about depression and suicide. I have way to much social anxiety to talk to random redditors, it's nothing personal, I just can't even read the responses to my comments and posts most of the time, even if they're upvoted. Everytime I google "suicide support groups" it's literally all groups for people who've had loved ones commit suicide. I've wondered about official hot lines and chat rooms (the idea of talking to a professional freaks me out less) but am worried about ending up in a ward. I'm to the point where I'm throwing hail mary's here, does anyone have any advice or better info on support groups? Anything that costs money is not an option.

Apologies for the rant or if this is a rehashed subject, and please don't feel obligated to respond, this is half venting as simply typing some of my problems out sometimes helps put things in perspective.
