I'm done?No, I cant tell you exactly why but I guess there is one thing I can say.. I don't belong here.. 
I know no one will actually read this and definitely no one I know will read it but I just need to say I'm sorry for all the hell I put people through.. 

~Edit~
After a morning of my dad trying to wake me up, I'm okay now I guess..
