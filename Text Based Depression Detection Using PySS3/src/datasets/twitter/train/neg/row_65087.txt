I just fucking want outAll I fucking want is to stop doing this.

All I felt for in life was my girlfriend, and she stopped loving me. She says there was nothing wrong, it just didn't work anymore. We started to be friends again. Two days in I broke down and told her the truth.

The only thing keeping me "ok" was the plan to act cool for a few months and try to ask her out again. But now that chance is dead and gone. She'll never love me again. Memories of that relationship destroy every other one because they just can't fucking compare. And I don't give a shit about anything but being less alone.

Different people live for different things. I live for a relationship, and I found mine. But it just can't work.

Why does everyone have to make me feel guilty for wanting to stop hurting? I know I have potential. I know I have good things, I know I have worth, I FUCKING KNOW. I just don't want to hurt, and there's only one way left for that.
