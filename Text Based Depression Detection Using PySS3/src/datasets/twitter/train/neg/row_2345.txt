If I was convinced it would end my torment I would have already done it.You guys wouldn't believe me if I told you so let's just go with schizophrenia.  
So I'm schizophrenic and I can't take the voices and especially the visions anymore.  
It never stops.  Sometimes it seems like it's getting better, like I'm my old self again but it's always so brief and then it's right back to hell.  
That's where I am.  I'm in hell... or like... a waking nightmare.  
I drank tonight after a year of sobriety.  It's not really helping but it sort of numbs the emotional impact.  
I went to the local Shambhala meditation center in hopes that I'd find some... something.  The instruction was good... but I kept hearing things like,  
"He's creepy!"  
"We don't want you here."  
"You don't fit in."  
"I don't like the way he keeps staring at everyone."  
etc.  
etc.  
etc.  
Before you even say anything, no I am NOT going to go on meds for this.  Fuck that noise.  I've seen what that shit does to people and I myself have never had a good experience with psych meds.  Never.  I went through 3 months of awfulness withdrawing from Clonopin, I'm allergic to prozac... just no, it's off the table.  
So where does that leave me?  I can't do this.  
A good twenty mg of Clonopin and I could just go to sleep and never wake up.  
  
EDIT:  And they recently found a "mammary growth" on my dog.  My best and only friend.  Going to find out if it's benign on the 4th.  I can't believe I left that out, fuck I'm selfish.  But if I lose her I'll have nothing.
