My whole world is falling apart and I can't stop laughingEverything family related just fell apart again like it always does, and of course the one sobbing his eyes out has to go and comfort everyone and make everything work out. I can't stop slamming my head into the wall and punching myself as hard as I can. I want to run away, far from here when I never have to deal with this bullcrappery again, and where I can just die peacefully and alone. It's so funny, if you think about it. I have such a great life, yet I still feel like this and can't stop bawling my eyes out. I need a fuckton of weed to get through this, but don't have a dealer, or weed. Even when I'm sobbing I can't stop laughing over the tiniest things, like that little bug on the wall. His life is as pointless as mine.

I don't want to talk about the issue going on, just really needed to vent. The fights never end in my family and I always have to deal with them. Just need some kind words so I won't crack. :')
