i cant take it anymore, my family cant support me.im tired of the fake mask i put in public, im just rotting inside, i cant even express emotions, im unable to cry, feel any sense of happines, i just feel guilty and worthless all the time i know im just 18 years old but every year since i was 12 is turning worse and worse  
now every day or two i get a random panic and just think about suicide i want to fucking do it but i cant, i once told my mother about that and she started crying telling me that IM hurting her and i make her feel bad while refusing the give me any help, told her about my social anxiety tells me its genetic and both my parents were like me and refuse to give any help.  
my sisters heard me telling her that and anytime they have an argument they threating to commit suicide because they know that they will get what they want saying that.  
now my mother doesnt even care anymore she got used to hearing that. i stopped telling her about anything, i was even bullied in school for years and she never helped.  
dont say that i should try or anything like that i tried losing weight and nothing im still getting bullied and still have anxiety...  
ill probably be doing it next summer she refuses to get me to a doctor because she doesnt want me to live all my life taking meds, literally all my teenage years i spent 90% at home and 10% going to school and never talking to anyone outside school, i dont even care about my appearance anymore, i just wear hoodies to hide myself and i always get morally destroyed by literally 99% of people in my life... i just want to cry like a baby but i cant man im numb.......
