Hearing people say that if I talked about feeling suicidal then I would just been attention seeking and not actually want to go through with it stopped me from asking for helpI've been having suicidal thoughts again. All I can think about is people I know saying that those who say that they're suicidal don't actually want to do it. I didn't want to draw attention to myself and I did want to kill myself so I kept it to myself and didn't tell anyone. I ended up in hospital because of it. The nurses asked me questions when I'd only just woken up and was confused so I just agreed with what they were saying. They forced me into denying that I did it deliberately so I didn't get the help I needed. I feel lost and scared and I don't know what to do.
