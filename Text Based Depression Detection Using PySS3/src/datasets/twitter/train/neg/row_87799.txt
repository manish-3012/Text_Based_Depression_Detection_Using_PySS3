I found a rage novel that mentions suicidal thoughts.The rage novel in question is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/ragenovels/comments/q4h62/i_seriously_think_about_it_on_a_near_daily_basis/). I've posted to ask reddit [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/q4uzu/a_redditor_just_posted_a_ragenovel_that/)  and told me to link him here, but I figured it couldn't hurt to post something here to get advice from you all. 

Is there anything else I should do?Z

Edit: so far I've linked him (I'm assuming it's a guy from the context of the comic) to a suicide prevention website, as well as here. I've sent a message to the mods and have reported his link also.
