Disability ruined my life and theres no reason to be aliveI'm hurting constantly. I can only walk short distances without lots of pain. I can't do any of my old hobbies. I can't go out. I was an artist- I haven't been able to make art and it's rotting me. I never get out of bed but even that hurts. I'm always terrified and anxious about the next body part that will give out and hurt constantly. I can't sit, sleep, eat, shower, basically live without something hurting. Typing this hurts. I've had to give up on all my dreams and I can't make new ones because what can I do other than sit in bed? I've never wanted to die so much. I've been sick for weeks which makes my pain so much worse. There's no point to living. I can't do anything! There's no point to me being alive! I think about it every day but it's becoming way too much to deal with and I have no one to talk to about it

the world has become so small since becoming disabled and it's only getting worse. it's so small and it's crushing me and I can't breathe. I can't live in a world that is so small. I feel like my insides are rotting. I feel like a completely different person, completely empty and I can never be myself again. and I thought just living with severe cptsd was hard. Dealing with that plus the trauma of losing your body and old life is unbearable. I'm gonna end up self harming today but I wish I could kill myself instead
