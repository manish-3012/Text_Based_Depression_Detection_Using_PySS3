Almost ended itI've been having some rough times the last couple of months and I've thought about suicide a lot. Last week, I woke up in the middle of the night and experienced something scary. I felt such an urge to kill myself but my body didn't move one bit. I think that if I wouldn't have been stopped because I couldn't move, I would have tried it. Anyone experienced something similar?
