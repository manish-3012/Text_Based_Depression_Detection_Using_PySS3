An odd trendIâ€™m beginning to notice, that a lot of posts here are happening late at night. Did you know sleep deprivation can keep you from happiness and bad thoughts you donâ€™t want? Your body and mind need to rest, try sleeping with music or get off your bright screens (I have mine in nighttime mode, the yellow is scientifically proven to help you actually want to go to sleep logically way better than white screen.) my brother loves to listen o the sound of gentle rain and it sends him to a deep sleep and never fails. Try it out for yourself. And donâ€™t give up until youâ€™ve tried absolutely everything. I suggest a few things to ease the nerves but many people just make excuses that they donâ€™t want to try it. Why do you think we suggest these things? We do it to help you. So try to sleep with the sound of gentle rain or whatever else you might prefer
