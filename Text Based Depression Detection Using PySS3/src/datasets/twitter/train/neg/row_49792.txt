Iâ€™m not sure how to begin to post but Tonight I hit my lowest point.All at once everything in my life came crashing down on and and I found myself googling how long it would take for a Diabetic to die without insulin. I am type 1 and I give up. I thought I could handle the pain, depression, weakness but I donâ€™t think that I can. 

The sick twisted thing is if I stopped taking my medicine it would be a long agonizing week of my body shutting down piece by piece, followed by a coma before I die, but all I would have to do to start that would be giving up completely. I feel like I deserve a death like that, Iâ€™m nothing but a burden and failure to everyone around me.

While everyone I know is successful, seemingly happy, doing something with their lives, im couch surfing, in crippling student debt, barely keeping it together at work and pushing away the only real relationship Iâ€™ve had. But Iâ€™m tired, so fucking tired. Always worrying about other people and how they are feeling or how they would feel if I was gone. When does it matter what I want!

I just donâ€™t know what to do
