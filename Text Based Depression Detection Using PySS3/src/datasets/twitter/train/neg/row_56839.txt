Wishâ€™s that wonâ€™t happenWish I did it while I was happy and loved instead of alone and tired. My last memories would be so negative. I donâ€™t want to leave my dog, heâ€™d be so confused and lost, heâ€™s my pride and joy, my conversation starter. Idk how much longer I can last but I have one more try to fix it.
