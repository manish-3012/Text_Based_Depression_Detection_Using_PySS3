Please only suicidal people read or respond.I am planning my suicide quite soon and I have full confidence in my methods. I don't want to explain, but I hate nearly every aspect of my life with my self at the front. I wish dying were easy, but it really isn't. I might sound like a contradictory idiot, but I might want to live if my life had a singular purpose. I don't know how to transition, but I want to suggest something ridiculous and maybe offensive. I want to make a pact between strangers. That is, we will live until 30 years from now then meet at Niagara falls and share what we have been doing, I suppose identify by walking around clapping really loudly. If you will join me please share why you are suicidal and start waiting. I cannot promise that I won't perish at my own hands or that others that decide to join won't either. But I guess just the thought of such a thing would be interesting. I could die saying I joined a life pact I couldn't complete. Maybe that would make me into a ghost with unfinished business. Still, I might go die.

Edit: either join the pact or say nothing please.
