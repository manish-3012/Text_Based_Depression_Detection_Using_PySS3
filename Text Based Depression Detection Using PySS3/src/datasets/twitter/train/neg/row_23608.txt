A scream without noiseYesterday I was crying. It was a change from that numb emotion I've been experiencing for the last 10 days, so there was at least something different. I was trying to scream, but I couldn't. I had my mouth open, I was exhaling, but I wasn't making any noise. I was unable to throw these negative feelings out.

There are still some periods of time when I'm feeling fine. However, the longer or better they are, the more depressed I feel afterwards. It feels like taking a loan from a loan shark - you have money for some time, but then you have to repay it with predatory interest. It has definitely been like this for 6 years (I'm 20 years old), maybe a bit more, and it's not getting better. I'm still alive only because of some coincidences and unlikely events, which made me try something for another few days or months, but I can't force myself to make any effort now. It's pointless to return to the same cycle, especially when it's more difficult and hopeless every time. For the last few years I constantly tried to make changes in my life, to try something else. It only made me stressed out and regretful, so I thought making no significant change for once would be better. It turns out that it doesn't make a difference which option I choose. I'm depressed because of the past and anxious about the future. I made a lot of mistakes and I have no idea how to improve anything. I'm angry at myself for failing to fulfill the expectations I set, even when they're not nearly as ambitious as they used to be.
