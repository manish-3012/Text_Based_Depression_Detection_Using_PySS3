I don't want to kill myself anymoreI've been abused by stupid PhD geniuses who thought it would be awesome to give a creative atypical adhd teenager some neurotoxic medication that they like to call neuroleptics.i took all of them for years, they slowly disabled me, made me loose my Friends, made me look like complete shit, fucked my studies, my hobbies, i was complitely psychotic for years... I couldn't read the page of a book, and they immediatelly labeled me as retarded trust me. But because they wear clean white  jackets they think they are gods. Even stupid nurses with they cute psychotechnic tests think they are helpful or kind person because they secretly think inside that working with "monsters" (not true, but i felt that way for myself) like us that were once in their life in psychiatic hospitals is bold.they made fun of me, even if i would cry because i couldn't even order at mc donalds or walk in the street without being stared at. And none of them suggested stopping the posoining.ok so the quarantine saved my life because i stopped the medication. During the following months o thought about killing myself everyday. But after 3 months i'm finally able to think, and even if i suffer from an other chronic illness that make me stuck at home. I feel so happy, i'm having good cognitive functioning and improvment everyday. i love myself, even the way i look (it changed a lot). I once was out for grocery and i was well treated and i was surprises ... So i decided it was worth posting something here because i might not be the only having wathever strong invasive symptoms or even medication that manipulate their way of thinking in a deep way and anormally. So i would have loved if someone would have been interested in finding the root of my suffering and highlight my true self without judging so quickly. I Hope i didn't offend anyone, i needed that out. A spychotic episode is not Always a movie.
