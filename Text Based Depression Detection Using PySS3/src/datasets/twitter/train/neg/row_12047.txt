I don't know what to doI've been depressed for a while, and the only happyness is the internet, and when my mom caught me at 12:00 AM doing computer, she doesn't trust me anymore. It makes me more and more depressed and I want to kill myself. If I tell my parents, they are going to freak out and get me special help, which I don't want and when I get treated specialy, It makes me sad. I haven't told any of my friends, and I don't want them to think differently of me. I want to die.
