Too scared to kill myself but too scared of failure in life.I'm failing highschool already at a young age and i honestly don't know what i'm doing. My depression &amp; anxiety among other mental disorders (all of which are diagnosed by professionals.) hinder my ability to function in life to the point where i want to end my life but i want to make something of my life. I don't want to fail school miserably and be driven into a corner by society, all i want is to be an electrician or something simple and live alone in an apartment. Only current motivator in my life is fear and porn.
