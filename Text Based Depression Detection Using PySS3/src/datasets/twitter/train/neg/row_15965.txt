Stop telling me I'm being selfishGod please stop fucking telling me I'm being selfish. That doesn't fucking help. 
Stop telling me that I should've been stronger and asked for someone for support because they're the ones who suffer! I don't give a fuck if they suffer. If you didn't support me or make me feel comfortable to come and talk to you, that's on YOU and I don't give a fuck if you suffer. I literally have nobody in my life who emotionally supports me. 
You don't know how others feel or their situations so stop fucking telling them they're being selfish. You make me want to end it quicker than I already do.
