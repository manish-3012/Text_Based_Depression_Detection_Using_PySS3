I know this girl.The whole situation is wack, but I would like you to listen. 
I know this girl. She's my age, born 6 months after me, and she's someone I wish I didn't know.
She has mental illnesses, and she always talks about running away and shit, getting high with a stranger, killing herself, prostituting herself. I think she's just bluffing, but it's getting serious. I don't know who to tell, who to talk to about what she's experiencing. 
It may be none of my business, but I'm concerned for her.
She hates me, and I hate her, but this is serious shit.
What do you think I should do, Reddit?
Should I stand by? Should I tell someone?
