i'm a shitty personeverything i do seems to be abusive, even though i try not too. i only hurt. i put the idea of cutting in her head and now she might commit suicide bc of me. i should go away and try and hide my death from her. i only want to keep her safe but if i do i have to go away and die. i can't treat her the way she deserves and now i need to go. i never meant to threaten to hurt myself, or to guilt trip, but i can't be forgiven for it.
