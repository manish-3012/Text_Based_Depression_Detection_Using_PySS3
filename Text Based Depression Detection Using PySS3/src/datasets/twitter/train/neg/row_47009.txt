Iâ€™m tired of the pain.I live a life some people would envy. I donâ€™t work or go to school anymore. I just sit around at home and do nothing all day. The problem is my mind. I can no longer feel happiness but the pain of all the things Iâ€™ve been through. Everyday I wake up with flashbacks of the horrible things that happened to me, sexual abuse, being bullied, abusive parents. Itâ€™s all over now but my brain loves to take me back and make me feel everything all over again, like some kind of sadist. But I know itâ€™s just reminding me that the world is a horrible place and I need to go soon. Iâ€™ve tried pills and therapy but nothing really cures the pain of knowing those who hurt me are living great lives and a sense of power for what they did to me. I love my best friend but I canâ€™t enjoy my time with him anymore due to this misery, and Iâ€™m going to feel so bad how this will hurt him. But I know it needs to be done to end my own suffering. Now Iâ€™m just cleaning up a little before it happens and planning it in such a way I wonâ€™t fail. I will do it before the year is over. Thank you.
