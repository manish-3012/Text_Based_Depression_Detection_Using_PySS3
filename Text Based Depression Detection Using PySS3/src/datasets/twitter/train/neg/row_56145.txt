All alone with no where to goMy life has crashed completely.  I just flunked out of college, and my girlfriend left me for another man yesterday, saying I "didn't make her happy like he did".  She is the only person I have ever truly loved, and I don't have another way to meet people.  I spent all my energy and money trying to make her happy, and now that she's gone, I can't find another reason to go on.  She was my entire reason to live, to work, to keep trying, and now I found out that all I was to her was someone to talk to who could give her orgasms.  I don't want to hurt anymore.  I've been hospitalized, and I feel like the only thing stopping me from killing myself is the fact that I would hurt the people I care about if I did.  I know that won't last.  All I see is an endless hell ahead of me until death, and I don't see why I should continue.  Every day is a waste.  I'm told this will help me feel better, but I don't know what to do.
