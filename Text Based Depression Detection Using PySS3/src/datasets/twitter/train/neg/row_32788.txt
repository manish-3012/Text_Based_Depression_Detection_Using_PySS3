Increasing suicidal thoughts. Anyone else with tinnitus want to talk? I'm feeling really lonely and trapped right nowReading all the research on plasticity changes have made me realize how fruitless it is to expect a cure anytime soon. My family is sick of me talking about it. I'm going to fail my barrier exam. I look at that video on front page today of the guy jumping off the building and secretly wish that was me.

I was doing really well in med school too, about to graduate soon. Now I can barely concentrate. I'm going to get kicked out of my course.

I just came out of a bout of depression years ago and was doing really well and now this suddenly out of nowhere.

I'm just feeling terribly hopeless and lonely, I really wish I could talk to someone right now

Sorry for posting twice in this subreddit. I'm not a mentally strong person.
