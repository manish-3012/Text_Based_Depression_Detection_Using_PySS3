I tried to end it and I need to know what happenedContext: I've been fighting depression on and off for the last 10 or so years. Sometimes I'm better, sometimes I'm worse, but it's just a constant.

A few months ago I visited my parents to another city. My relationship with them is complicated and the main source of my mental issues. I had a huge argument with them and just wanted to get out. Problem: It was late at night and I had no way to come back home, I don't know their city but I know they don't live in a nice area, so I did not dared to just walk the night out, and hotels were not an option. 

I felt as I was trapped, the previous argument had messed me bad inside, so as soon as they got out of the room I tried to jump through the window of a sixth floor. I couldn't make it because my SO was there and browled me to the ground until I came back to my senses.

I've harmed myself in the past, but this was my first attempt. When I self-harmed I always had the feeling that it was not right, that it was not something normal people do, that there were other options other than self-harming. I always thought if I tried to commit suicide, the feeling would be simmilar, maybe stronger, but it was not. 

As I was trying to pull myself out, it felt... normal, like it was the logical thing to do, like being alive was unreasonable. I didn't feel sad, I didn't feel angry, I didn't even feel empty, I just felt like I was completing a task, nothing that special. And that feeling of "normality", of feeling everything was okay and I just had to jump because it was the logical thing to do, has haunted me since then. I'm afraid, if I have another break down like that and there's nobody who can stop me, I'll end it. 

I tried talking about this with my psychiatrist and with my psychologist, but since it was a situational one time thing they just brushed it off. I'd love if someone could explain me what happened and if they've ever felt the same. Thank you.
