I don't know what to do anymoreI'm a junior trying to take two AP classes and a concurrent enrollment class all at the same time, while being apart of activities and working 10-15 hours a week. I just can't do it anymore. I can't quit my job because I need the money, feel too guilty to accept money from my mom (my parents are divorced and my dad doesn't really help out with money stuff), and my parents won't let me quit unless it gets to be too much. In my mom's eyes, this is just a normal part of adolescence and I'm handling it fine. I also can't really decrease my hours because I'm already working just about the bare minimum. 

I was in an honors-type program for the majority of my education up until I entered high school, at which point I began taking AP and college level courses. This year I'm taking a total of 2 AP classes and 3 concurrent enrollment classes, as well as electives. I can't handle all of the pressure and I don't have enough time to get the things done that I need to.

I'm clinically depressed but don't take antidepressants. Due to my course load, it's gotten to the point where I don't even have time to sleep or eat meals, which is taking a toll on my mental health. I don't have time for friends or hobbies. I miraculously made it this far in high school with a 4.0 GPA, but I also put too much pressure on myself to preform well in school. This means that its really hard for me to give myself any kind of break because I just can't justify it.

I don't know what to do anymore. In August my suicidal thoughts got really bad so I went to my doctor and started seeing a therapist. For a while, school started to take up so much of my time that I didn't really have time to be depressed, but now I just can't deal with all of this. It's just too much, and I don't know who to go to anymore or how to alleviate any of this. In recent weeks my suicidal thoughts have been sporadically returning, I don't know what to do and I'm scared.
