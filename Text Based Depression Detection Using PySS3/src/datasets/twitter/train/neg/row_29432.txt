'talk to someone'i tried to talk to someone, and they either ignore me or tell me im trying to manipulate them.

i tried to get therapy and ive been on a waiting list for a year.

ive called suicide hotline after suicide hotline and all they did was tell me to try the above things.

its such bullshit lol. nobody gives a shit. nobody can be bothered but when im dead theyll parade around, and make it my fault, 'oh she shouldve talked to me'. i fucking tried. nobody listened.

i feel like im screaming out that im in pain and everybody just walks past. i cant do it anymore. im just so scared ill go to hell
