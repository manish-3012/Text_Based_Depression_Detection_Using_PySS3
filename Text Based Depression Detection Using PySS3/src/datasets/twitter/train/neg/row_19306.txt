No one will care if I dieI have absolutely no reason to live. I have nothing to look forward to. I have no friends and my family doesnâ€™t care about me. I could hang myself with a belt tonight and no one would know. Iâ€™d be left there until my body began rotting and neighbors started to complain about the smell.
