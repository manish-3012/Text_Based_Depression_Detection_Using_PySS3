Life honestly sucksI don't want to live anymore, it just seems like everyone else is born with good genes and good looks while the rest of are absolutely fucked, for anyone saying "you probably don't even try, fuck you, you don't know shit about me. I put in the effort to change my looks, improve my intelligence etc but nothing works. I hope something takes me soon. Please that's all I ask for, at least that I canâ€™t chose if Iâ€™m lonely or not.
