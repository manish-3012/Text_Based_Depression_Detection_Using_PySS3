Ending my life just before 2019Kinda lengthy so if you read this post, thank you

About 6 months ago, I was at the lowest point of my life. The only working vehicle we had got repoâ€™d, I was living in a crowded trailer that felt more like a crack house, my dad was blowing his money on drugs leaving us with little to no money for food/rent/bills. Iâ€™ve had depression for years but itâ€™s gotten more severe about 2 years ago. One of my â€œfriendsâ€ talked me out of ending it then, but I didnâ€™t tell them that if my life didnâ€™t get better by the end of the year I was gonna kill myself. 

As Iâ€™m writing this, Iâ€™m stuck moving between temporary homes because we were kicked out due to my dad not paying rent for 3 months but still having enough money to buy drugs. Iâ€™m stuck in a job with weird hours that can get pretty demanding for the pay, and I canâ€™t take any time off because I need the money. Due to my work, I distanced myself and Iâ€™ve lost contact with nearly all of my friends. They all found better things to do and better people to be around. They donâ€™t want to be associated with someone whoâ€™s suicidal. My family is full of narcissists that attack me for defending myself or if I do something they slightly disagree on. 

The only reason I can remember staying this long for was to play the new super smash brothers game that just released, and now that itâ€™s done, itâ€™s time for me to leave. Itâ€™s pretty stupid; I know. I kept trying, and waiting, and hoping that eventually life would be better but itâ€™s gotten worse. I canâ€™t take being alone anymore. I canâ€™t take being stressed out anymore. I canâ€™t take being unloved anymore. If the people who I love donâ€™t want to be with me, then I think itâ€™s time I leave, and never come back.
