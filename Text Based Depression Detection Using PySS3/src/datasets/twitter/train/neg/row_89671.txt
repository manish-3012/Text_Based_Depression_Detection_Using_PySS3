I'm on my way to recovery and it's mostly thanks to r/suicide watchJust by seeing how bad other people have it and people reading my stories  I realized that I am very lucky even with autism both my parents are still together and they love me which is more than 80 percent of the people in this sub have even I am sorry to all the people I gave bad advice I have been banned for it in multiple accounts and I hope I didn't cause any harm this isn't really a suicidal thought I just wanted to thank all the people who spend their time here to help others
