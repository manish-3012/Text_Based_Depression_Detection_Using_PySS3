Therapy Sessionmy therapist: how are you today?
me: i feel so tired, can i sleep?

and she let me sleep until the end. i felt better but i'm wondering if it's okay to sleep? i mean... i asked for it so maybe it's okay? i'm just worried if her co-workers knew, it would affect her job?? they'll be like... "YOU LET A PATIENT SLEEP? YOU DIDN'T EVEN TALK LIKE HOW IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE?"

i'm sorry this is my first time in therapy. i don't know anything. pls go easy on me.
