â€œYou have such a negative mindset, think positivelyâ€ .... Wow! Thanks! Iâ€™m cured!How can I *possibly* not feel this way, considering the stuff Iâ€™ve been through? How can I possibly feel comfortable or safe opening up when people look me in the eyes and tell me itâ€™s â€œall about mindset and thinking positivelyâ€? And that my thoughts and feelings are invalid because Iâ€™m â€œso *negative*â€?

I have severe chronic PTSD for fucks sake. Iâ€™m in treatment. If I could just â€œthink positively,â€ I wouldnâ€™t be in a constant state of wanting to die. If I could just â€œthink positively,â€ I wouldnâ€™t have to take medication and see a therapist once a week. Coming after me and telling me I have â€œsuch a *negative* mindsetâ€ makes me not want to ever speak to or open up about anything to anyone again. 

Just adds to the list of reasons I shouldnâ€™t be here... Iâ€™m just this *negative*, *nihilistic* piece of trash who â€œrefuses to think positivelyâ€ and drags everyone down with him. No wonder Iâ€™m alone, and lost everything good in my life. No wonder I have the urges to hurt myself. No wonder I want to die. No wonder I find comfort in my death. 

I wonâ€™t be a such a *negative*, weighing burden to people when Iâ€™m not here.
