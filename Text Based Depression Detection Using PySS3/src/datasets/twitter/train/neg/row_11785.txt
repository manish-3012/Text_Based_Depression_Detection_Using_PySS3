HiI'm so damn depressed. I know I'm overreacting, and I'm probaly just lazy, but I'm only in 6th grade and wanna kill myself. Everyday it's a nonstop cycle of work and relax, work and relax, every fucking day I wake up and work and go home. That's it! I'm so miserable. Everyrtime I think of times I COULD be being with my friends and family, I just cry. I cry myself to sleep. I am bored as shit in class, having to do all this dumb ass work we will literally not use in the rest of our lives, while being in an unpleasant cold room full of a bunch of idiots. So. My redditors. My reddies. How would I kill myself?
