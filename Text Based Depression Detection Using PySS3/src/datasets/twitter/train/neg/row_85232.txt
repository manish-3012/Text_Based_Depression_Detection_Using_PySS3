Only 3 months left!Ah guys (and gals... you too (; ) I like how you treated me it was nice it's been 7 months now and I like the fact that I'm finishing high school. I was severely abused, battered and a dozen times almost killed in primary school. No reaction was taken by the school employees except grades were a bit up in generic. Then when I entered high school I found myself in sightful agony of having myopia. I hated my life and I thought I should end something in it cause I knew I wouldn't be getting glasses min. 2 years later. Then even though it was 95% girls in high school- and I'm male, no one respected what I was in my closet- a religious teenager. That's why I didn't date. Everybody hated me and tagged me with all kinds of tags. Anyways I got over the celibacy and "gangstalking" in high school the community gave me cause I'm finishing it in 3 months. Also, if you are one of my schoolmates, this following cap message is for yall trippers: YALL PEASANTS BEEN GAY THUGS, FUCKING TEEN BITCHES. Now to yall suicide watchers- yall cool boys and girls talking to you feels like sex (I imagine I didn't lose my male virginity).
