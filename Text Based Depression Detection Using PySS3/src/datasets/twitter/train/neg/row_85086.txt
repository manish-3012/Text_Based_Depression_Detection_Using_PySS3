Wasted potentialI haven't felt sad, angry, happy, or anything for a long time now. I'm just numb and empty every day all the time. My grade average went from the high 90s to below 50%, but I don't care enough to stress or do anything about it. I haven't done homework in months nor handed in several overdue assignments. I'm in my senior year of high school, literally the only time I should give a shit about grades. I've tried reaching out to teachers, adults, and friends around me, but no one really knows what to do with me. They all express more grievance than I do, seeing me waste my potential. I'm not hiding anything from anyone, but I don't think anyone's listening. When I voiced my mental health concerns to my doctor, they didn't think I "had it that bad" because I'm still able to hold down a part-time job and attend school. 

I just don't want to disappoint myself anymore. I used to be ambitious, outgoing, and I used to love life. I made a big point over the years to go through self-improvement and care to get my mental health out of the gutter since I've always had my problems. I worked out regularly, volunteered, played on sports teams, studied with friends, all of that stuff. It was such a high, so seeing how quickly it could all crumble apart is the worst of it all. It's like no matter how much I struggle, it's fruitless. 

Maybe I'll be okay someday, but when? I'm sick that a "someday" is all I have. I come to this subreddit, finding people in the same spot, just at different times in their lives. So who's to say I won't just stay like this for years to come? Settling for mediocrity, feeling like you have nothing to live for, and constantly entertaining the thought of just ending it. I'm just another whiny teenager, so who's to say though?
