Should I go to the hospital for suicidal thoughts?Lately, Iâ€™m thinking of cutting myself and I tried a couple of times. It hurt so I stopped. But, Iâ€™m afraid that I will try to cut deeper sometime. I think of suicide every day. Iâ€™ve gone to the hospital before but I was discharged too early for me to be admitted to the psych ward. I have no support from my family and the crisis center, my pastor, therapist, and medication has failed me. I donâ€™t mind going but Iâ€™m aftaid thereâ€™s going to be no hospital beds because of corona. What should I do? Iâ€™m tired of feeling like shit every day.
