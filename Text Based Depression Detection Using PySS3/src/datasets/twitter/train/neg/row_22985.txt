I am checking into a clinicI've been suffering from clinical depression as long as I can remember.  I first told my mom I wanted to kill myself when I was around ten years old.  She blamed it on me listening to a smooth jazz radio station, which I still don't understand.

I've tried countless medications.  Some did not work, others worked for a short time.  

The fact that makes me feel so guilty is that I have a wonderful life.  I have a good job, loving and supportive fiance, a home, pets.  Why do I feel so sad and hopeless.  I have attempted only a few times but never had any hospitalization.  I am ready.  I'm going to the ER on advice of my doctor.

I don't want to feel this way.  I don't want to drink myself into oblivion every night and wake up with self harm wounds.  I'm checking in and I think anyone reading this and feeling this way should consider it too.
