I have every intention of drowning myself within the next 24 hours.I have had a long history of depression, recently amplified by severe anxiety, loneliness and several bouts of homelessness, which is currently ongoing. Iâ€™ve had very little contact with many people for the past year or so, and zero of them have been what I would consider â€˜friendsâ€™. For a while Iâ€™ve considered the closest thing Iâ€™ve had to an actual human being who cared if I lived or died, the closest thing Iâ€™ve had to a â€˜friendâ€™, has been someone Iâ€™ve been penpals with for about 6 years. She was the only person outside of Reddit who wished me a happy birthday a couple of months ago. For about half a decade, Iâ€™ve wanted to meet this person to hang out, even just for a couple of minutes, and so finally we make plans to. Weâ€™ve had vague plans since January, and solidified these plans of me coming to their country and town today about a couple weeks ago. So I make the journey, spending literally all the money I have on tickets, to get to their town. About an hour from when we were gonna meet, they text me â€œI canâ€™t meet you today, Iâ€™m ill.â€ Andâ€¦ I message back only to be ignored. I just, I guess Iâ€™ve been running on 1% for such a long time, but now Iâ€™ve finally hit 0%, total deflation. Iâ€™m in a strange country, in a town Iâ€™m completely unfamiliar with (Hove/Brighton?, England), homeless, no clue what the hell to do. And the one person in all the world I thought actually cared about me, canâ€™t give me a hand. I mean, sure theyâ€™re probably just ill, Iâ€™m probably overthinking this, butâ€¦ Itâ€™s really making me come to my senses about how lonely I am. This is the only friend I have, and they canâ€™t do any more than let me know ONE HOUR before we were going to meet? They couldnâ€™t have told me in the morning, sparing me from travelling all the way here? I mean, I was still paying for the travel which has crippled me, and yeah, that was pretty dumb, but I really thought actually seeing a person who considered themselves my friend, even for just 5 minutes would be worth all the money in the world. Besides, the main reason I was going now was because of how depressed and suicidal they were, and I just wanted to cheer them up. They have a million friends, and literally everyone of the opposite sex trying to charm their way up this personâ€™s ass. I haate myself for being bitter that someone who has everything that would leave me content with life,  yet wouldnâ€™t bother giving me the common decency of cancelling at a reasonable time. 


I canâ€™t do this any more. Iâ€™m empty. Iâ€™ve got nothing. I only ever wanted to help people, and my life is stagnant and pointless. I wish you all the very best of luck, but for me, itâ€™s over. I donâ€™t know how to get home, Iâ€™m lonely, Iâ€™m tired, Iâ€™m hungry, Iâ€™m hopeless, and feeling like itâ€™d be more efficient to just alleviate those problems from my life by just ending it. The number of people who would miss me has truly hit 0, so I see no problems with taking the quick and easy road. Goodbye and goodnight. Later nerds.
