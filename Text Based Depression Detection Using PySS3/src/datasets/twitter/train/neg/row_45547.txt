I thought i was done.I thought I was okay. I thought it was a thing of the past. I assumed my struggle was over. I paid my time and I'm able to walk free, but here I am. A prisoner again. It's just the start of it, but I've been here before and I know what's going to happen. I don't want it to happen. I need anything but this to happen. Part of me wonders if it's my fault that this horrible nightmare is coming back. 

All I wanted was to be done.
