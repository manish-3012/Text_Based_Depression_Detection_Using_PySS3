I'm pissed that I'm even posting here.I don't want to feel better. I want to feel worse. Or at least, confident enough, secure enough in the idea that it'd be better if things ended.

I might be trans, I might be fucking insane, it doesn't really matter. It all boils down to this huge fucking mess that isn't worth cleaning up. I am far too fucking intelligent for my own good and there is 0% chance that my mind is ever going to shut the fuck up and let me enjoy life. There are too many little things that are like knives, that upset the sense of understanding in my brain until I literally can't function.

I don't want to solve it, I don't want to work on it, I'm not a fucking puzzle. I'm tired. I know I will feel better. It probably won't even take a week from now for my feelings to change. But they're going to cycle back to this eventually. I have no goals and no accomplishments. There are things I want but they seem abstract and imaginary, even when they're not. I'm too fucking flaky and I can't trust myself, let alone face myself.

I don't care to fix this.
