ran out of reasonsi'm out of reasons and choices and excuses to live. i attempted suicide a couple days ago but it didn't work. my psychiatrist put me on ketamine and i have to live my worst dissociative nightmare over and over because somehow it's supposed to make me feel better? ok. i am a stupid ugly fatass who doesn't deserve to live. 

the biggest reason to live is gone. i used to be a person, and i feel like somewhere along the way she died and all that's left is me, a fucking shadow or a ghost and i have to suffer endlessly. i feel like i died a long time ago and staying alive right now is just prolonging the pain. i don't think i'll ever get better

there's no hope for someone like me
