My thoughtsI've tried so hard. I tried everything I could. I've seen the psychologists, I've tried the medication, I meditated, I exercise, I tried to change, I've put in so much hard work and fought the pain as much as I could. Everything I've done has been for naught. I feel immense despair at the many years of pain I've endured and the futility of it all. How can I keep living when I have such incredible fear and emotional anguish to look forward to? The professionals have let me down time and again. I just want the feelings to end and I can only find one way to do it. It's a solution that's been with me for so long it upsets me.

I'll keep trying for a bit longer, but it's so, so hard when there is so little hope.

Edit: Thank you to those who private messaged me.
