Pointless lifeFailed school, have debt with no way to get a decent enough job to pay it off

Underpaid at my current job

Can't find anything better in my field because I live in a rural area

Dad says I have no reason to feel like killing myself

Friend I was living with got married and had a kid so I had to move back in with my parents, meanwhile I've never had any kind of romantic relationship and I'm 23

Car broke down so now I have a car payment in addition to my loans that I have to try and handle with my shit job

Even if I did have the credentials for a better job I don't live near anything

Therapy doesn't work

Meds don't work

Exercise has helped me lose weight and get more fit but it hasn't decreased my symptoms, because they aren't caused by my body image, they're caused by being alone and hopeless

I've been depressed since I was 12 so over 10 years now

There's no help for me
