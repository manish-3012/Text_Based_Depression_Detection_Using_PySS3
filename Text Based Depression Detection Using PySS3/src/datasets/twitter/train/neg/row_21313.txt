I wrote a book!I just wanted to let everyone know that they can work towards their goals! It is hard, but I have worked through my bad thoughts and did something I have wanted to for years! I wrote a book and put in on Amazon Kindle. I didn't think I could do it, but I worked towards it and now I have some more self-respect. I believe in you in achieving whatever your dreams! You can work towards it, even if it is tough! I am rooting for you!
