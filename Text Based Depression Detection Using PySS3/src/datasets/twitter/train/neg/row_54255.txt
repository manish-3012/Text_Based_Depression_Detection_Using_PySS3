I'm selfish for even posting thisIt's 3am so the only way I can do this is with a list to keep my thoughts straight.
-I'm a senior in high school
-My friends resent me because I'm not as smart as them
-I don't know what I want to study in college or even if I'll get in to college with my current grades
-I'm falling in love with my best friend but I know she doesn't feel the same way so it only hurts now
-I'm finding myself coming up with less and less excuses to not turn to drugs and alcohol
-I'm unable to enjoy things I had a passion for 2 years ago
-I keep having thoughts of what would be the quickest way to die and how I would write the note
-I lost a girl I had a small crush on to cancer over a year ago and it still affects me
-I can't imagine a future where I'm happy anymore
-I haven't self-harmed in years but now it's starting to look appealing again
-I'm unattractive, dumb as a bag of rocks, and talentless in nearly everything
- I'm known for being the shoulder to cry on so I don't feel like I should be complaining about anything because I have seen what so many people go through at my school alone. Drug addiction, alcoholism, self harm to the point where there is more scar tissue than skin, suicide attempts or losing a friend to suicide, and so much mental illness that their parents refuse to take seriously. I shouldn't complain, everything I listed above is so miniscule compared to what I've seen happen to others. But I am weak. I am so much weaker than everyone else in nearly every sense of the word. I can't see myself being happy any time in the future and it scares me so much. Is my life always gonna feel this way? Or do I just exit stage left before things get worse and I have something to actually complain about?
