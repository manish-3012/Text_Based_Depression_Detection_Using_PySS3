Why am I Sitting Through This?Recently it feels like my nightmare coming true. I have always felt like everybody hates me and just won't tell me. It used to be smiles and sympathy, enough to make me think it is the depression making me believe this, but I was right in guessing they would tire of me eventually. Everyone has been so cold to me these past few days, we have finally reached a breaking point. This is not a delusion, it is a real change in conduct and I am more uncomfortable being alive than ever before.

Now, their disdain for me is written in their words, their body language, their disgusted glances. I thought I was escaping my deluded mindset, but now I am more sure than ever. It's real, this time.

I have started laying out plans. No half-baked waiting around for the day to come. I know where I will go and how I will do it. I will disappear myself, simple as that.
