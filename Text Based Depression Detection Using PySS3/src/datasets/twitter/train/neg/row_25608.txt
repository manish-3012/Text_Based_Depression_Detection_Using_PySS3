Why do we tell others not to kill themselves?We are our nervous system. If all someones life is suffering, are they not better off pain free? Do we have trouble accepting this due to our brains will to survive and reproduce? I have had what most consider the best things in life. Love, drugs and natural beauty. As nice as all those things are in the moment, it is not worth all the awful and mundane feelings that make up the majority of my existence. It is not worth the insatiable craving of those finite moments. 

The universe is not compatible with human happiness. I long for the embrace of non existence.
