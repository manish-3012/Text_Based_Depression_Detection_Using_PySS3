nobody cares.. and this just confirms it even more1 month ago a guy from my city (20 yo) hanged himself.. the only phone number he had in his phone was a girl's number.. i remember seeing on facebook that his brother posted that he died.. and litteraly 6 people said "i feel bad for you" and that's it (i live in a small city so when something like this happens people tend to find pretty fast ) but this time.. no one talked.. no one cared.. no one even knew that he hanged himself.. when he went missing from home nobody cared.. and this just confirms it for me :/ nobody really cares about you and this makes me feel sick
