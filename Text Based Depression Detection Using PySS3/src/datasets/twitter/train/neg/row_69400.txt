Sometimes I think about killing myself cold bloodedI mean I don't think I'm depressed. I enjoy life and its pleasures, but at the end we are going to die. So what's the purpose of living in the first place? Ok life gives some pleasures but at the end it is full of thorns. Nothing is easy, as I get older and older life gets harder and harder. 

So what I'm trying to say is, why should I wait for death? When I can execute myself and choose my own death, before universe bringing it to me. Until now I experienced pretty heavy shit. What if my death would be so gruesome too? I highly doubt about perishing away when we die. I am sure there will be something else but I highly doubt it would be pleasurable. Best would be not existing at all.
