Can someone maybe talk to me, pleaseI can't interact with people. Speaking is so exhausting so I don't anymore. When I do get out I always come home crying. I do nothing but lay in bed and stare at my laptop all day. I get upset and cry over the smallest things. I don't enjoy anything. I don't have a family anymore, I have no friends, only one person will care when I do it but he'll get over it, he won't have to deal with me anymore. I've wanted to do it for years and it's only gotten worse. I've been thinking about it daily for months, constantly researching different methods and looking around my boyfriend's house while he's at work for things that can kill me. I can't think of a reason I care about to keep living. I'm not scared anymore.
