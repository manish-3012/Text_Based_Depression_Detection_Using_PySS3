I feel so so fucking alone.I feel so extremely alone nah fuck that I am extremely alone . I only have you guys on this subreddit . I have no friends no family no one that I can talk to it about but Iâ€™m a guy so of course suck it up donâ€™t be a bitch and go on .

Thereâ€™s no one there that really cares or someone I can talk to , not even my family theyâ€™ll just use it against me or undermine my issues because â€œthey had it worse â€œ so fucking what you had it worse it doesnâ€™t mean I donâ€™t have it bad . If you raise someone to be soft they will be soft. Basically shitty parents who I canâ€™t talk to .

My friends , most of them are fake they chat shit behind my back but to my face nothing and think Iâ€™m dumb and donâ€™t notice anything but itâ€™s cool just letting me know who my real friends are and what friendships not to invest in .
I have 2 genuine friends in my life but each of them has their on problems and I donâ€™t want to be one to burden them with my shitty life and problems .

My ex helped me when I was down but it showed her Iâ€™m vulnerable which came back to me and fucked me over 

Everytime Iâ€™ve ever opened to someone even in the slightest itâ€™s came right back to me to fuck me over in some sort of way Iâ€™ve even been laughed at for opening up to how I feel itâ€™s insane . This is why I keep everything inside and try to bury it deep but itâ€™s slowly eating me and destroying me from the inside . 

As a guy in this day and age with no role model and not a single person in my life I feel so fucking alone and hopeless .

All I have left is you people on this subreddit .
