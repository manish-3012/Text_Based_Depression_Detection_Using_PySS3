Chronic Pain and Suicidei'll start by saying i'm not suicidal, but i wish i could just die.. .if that makes any sense. i have fibromyalgia and i'm in a really bad flare up right now and have nothing that will take the pain away. all over my body from head to toe it feels like someone is trying to pull the muscles from my bones and i feel like someone has literally set me on fire. my flesh feels like it's burning everywhere. 

i'm not sure how much longer i can handle this. if this only happened once in my life i could handle it.. but it's repeatedly and usually for days at a time.. several times a month. 

sorry just needed to vent

anyone else dealing with chronic pain of some sort feel the same way?
