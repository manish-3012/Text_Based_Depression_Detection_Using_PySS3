I'm so upset and angry inside I really wish I was dead, but I'm too scared to commit suicide. What can I do?Every time I suddenly feel like crying (in a sad way) is during night time when both my parents are asleep. I'm so fucking angry. I want to tell someone I feel sad. Also I really want to hit my dad in the face extremely hard. He's extremely stubborn and won't take me or my younger 10 year old sister to a counselor or therepist that is who I really want to talk to. All because we are different, I'm very autistic and my little sister doesn't eat most foods.  It's not fair. I wish I died. But there's so much other stuff preventing me... I'm so lost what do I do
