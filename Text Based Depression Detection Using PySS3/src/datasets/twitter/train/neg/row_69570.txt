I just need a way to do itI fucked it all up. I gave up everything that made the world great for me. All because of my misery, my pessimism and my selfishness. I lost friends. I lost love. I feel like my life is next and honestly, Iâ€™m okay with that. One hundred percent. I feel like I donâ€™t have the mental or emotional capacity to go any further. I havenâ€™t learned a thing these past 7-8 years of my life and have succeeded in wasting my life away. As young as I am, this is my peak.

In the back of my mind, I always knew I was destined for failure. It comes the point where I canâ€™t live with myself any longer. Iâ€™m so tired. Iâ€™m so tired. Iâ€™m so fucking tired. I have nothing. I am nothing. As much pain as it might bring others, I am willing to go along with this decision and the selfishness that goes along with it. I can only say Iâ€™m sorry for being such a bother, such a burden to everyone. I donâ€™t want a funeral. I donâ€™t want to be cremated. I want to be put in the ground and forgotten by the world. I live in a 4 floor building. Other than that, idk what would be an efficient way.
