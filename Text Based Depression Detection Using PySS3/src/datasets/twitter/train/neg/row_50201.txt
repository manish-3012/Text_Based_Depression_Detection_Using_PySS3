I want to honor my plan from last yearOn the 21st of feb Iâ€™ll be done from the week. During my lunch Iâ€™ll end it by jumping off of rock formation at the center of town. Iâ€™ll take as many pills as I can so I canâ€™t be saved if the fall doesnâ€™t do it and do one final cut to just let go. In the pain from the cut Iâ€™ll be able to force myself off the edge. No one will notice Iâ€™ll have left. No one will notice something is wrong. My note will be in my pocket if I choose to have one. One year ago then was my first hospitalization. Hopefully not another.
