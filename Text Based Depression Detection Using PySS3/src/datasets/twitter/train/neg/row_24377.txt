Mother of my kids moved out with our two daughters (6&amp; 19mos) I feel like ending itShe moved out in October didnâ€™t tell me she had a new place until days after moving in. Didnâ€™t tell me the address until 2 months later when I got upset about the fact and now she has a bf and in all alone looking at her things in my house and an empty baby crib and girls room.

I feel better off dead at this point and I feel like when my phone dies (6%) I wanna be dead too. Iâ€™ve never felt pain like this before and all I can think about is the best way to end it
