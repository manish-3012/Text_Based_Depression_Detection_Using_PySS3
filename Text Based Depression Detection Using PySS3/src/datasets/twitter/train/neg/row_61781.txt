I decided to leave this sub and try to live on.I don't know if ANYONE cares but I'm gonna give it a shot.

So hey. As a lot of people have, I've been struggling with depression. This year is being the worst. And no fecking lies there, I couldnt even do it, like, I just posted here to see if someone cared at all. I didn't actually try it.

Now, I realized that this subreddit does not help me a lot. Other related ones, kinda, but this is not. So I decided to leave it. 

And, I will try my best to not to think about it. And I'll try to improve myself. I realized saying that "I want to die" "I wish I could go back" etc or trying to hurt myself or other is 'conditioned' (Idfk if this is the right word) in my mind. I get a sudden relief. I decided to work on that. I decided to find more healthy relief techniques.

I got hope. I have a hope that I will achieve my dreams in the long run.

So, if you're reading this, you may think like "this bitch doesn't know what they're talking about, they're just looking for attention" - and yes, I've looked for attention, I've looked for someone to talk to in this subreddit. It's a human need. And/or you may be thinking like "They do have a hope, I do not" but trust me, my dreams are almost impossible to achieve but they give me life. 

And think about this - living and surviving are instinctive. The reason you couldn't shot it, or you couldn't run it on your skin is the instinct called "surviving". 

Talk to someone. Talk to me. Find me on discord: vanillasky#1571 or dm me here. I'm here. We're all here.

So guys. Even though I don't know who you are, even though I'm not on this subreddit anymore, I'm here for you. I care about you. Please, keep on trying.

I'm out. Bye.
