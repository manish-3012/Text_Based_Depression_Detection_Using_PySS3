so fucking doneI donâ€™t want to die, I just wanna fade away. I wish I could just press a button and go somewhere else where no one here remembers me and no one there knows me. I donâ€™t know if that makes sense. 

Dying feels like the easy way out. I always take the fucking easy way out and it feels like this is no different.

For context, Iâ€™m an ace male teen that has extreme social anxiety. It hurts to leave my house. Iâ€™m not out with my family so I donâ€™t think theyâ€™ll ever understand. I canâ€™t come out, no matter how much I want to. It wouldnâ€™t make a difference.

Every relationship Iâ€™ve seen is sex based. I would like to have a relationship but Iâ€™d probably just hurt them in the end. Besides, who wants to date without sex? 

Depression and anxiety have fucked me over. Iâ€™m either an asshole to people that donâ€™t deserve it, say the wrong thing, or push people away because I donâ€™t want to hurt them. 

I canâ€™t sleep because I feel like I fucking said the wrong fucking thing again. I donâ€™t even know why? The feeling just wonâ€™t go away. 

Please tell me at least someone knows what Iâ€™m talking about. I canâ€™t deal with this anymore.
