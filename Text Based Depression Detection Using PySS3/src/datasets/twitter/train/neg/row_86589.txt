What am I supposed to do with my life?I have an incurable illness that by itself won't kill me, but makes my everyday life hell. I had to drop out of school at 14 because I was physically unable to attend anymore, and as a result of that I'm a complete shut in with no friends and no future prospects. Treatment and therapy haven't helped, everything is a struggle, and there's no one who understands the extent of what I'm dealing with. 

My girlfriend, who was also the only close friend I've ever had, broke up with me in January and has barely talked to me since then. She told me it's not my fault but I keep replaying everything I said in the week leading up to the breakup and throughout the rest of our relationship over and over and over again thinking of things I could have said or done better. I structured my entire life around her, she was my only connection to the outside world, the only one who understood my situation, and my only chance of having a normal life. 

Since she stopped talking to me, I've barely eaten, I've left my house once, and everything I used to find fun has become draining. I spend almost every hour of every day thinking about what could have been if only I wasn't such a fucked up person.

I'm heavily considering just ending it all in a few days. I don't know what else I'm supposed to do. Death is terrifying, and I don't want to hurt anyone anymore (my extended family is already critical of my parents for raising someone like me, and I'm fairly sure they'd get completely shunned from my family if I were to kill myself,) but I'm at a breaking point. I spend all day in bed or on my couch, thinking about how much I hate the person I've become, and it's hard to imagine a future where this suffering is worth it.
