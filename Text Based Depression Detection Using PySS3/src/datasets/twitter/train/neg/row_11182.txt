Nearly there.I was on my way to college when I decided that todayâ€™s the day. I got the bus straight back home where I raided the medicine drawer. Iâ€™ve decided painkillers could be the route...Iâ€™ve sat holding them in my hands scared that this could be it...I mean theyâ€™re only otc painkillers but I donâ€™t know where the stronger stuff is. Iâ€™ve taken about 2000mg and I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s a placebo but I feel much more relaxed than what I was...maybe the relaxation will help me take a bigger dose. Anyway how much do I need to take to be in the od territory?
