I've never felt so suicidalI seen my psychiatrist the other day &amp; I have been given 3 options.

Option 1. Stay on the meds I'm on &amp; continue to hear people laughing and talking about me whenever I leave the house. Continue to be uncomfortable every time I'm outside. Continue to have crippling anxiety.

Option 2. Go back on Seroquel, a medication that heavily sedated me &amp; made me lose all motivation but it worked well for my symptoms.

Option 3. Go on clozapine. The last resort drug for treatment resistant schizophrenia. It comes with a tonne of side effects. Weekly blood tests and physical health risks.

I honestly want to end it. I've had schizophrenia for 4 years and it's only getting worse. I feel bad for my family and I feel selfish for even having these thoughts but I'm in a bad place. It's all I think about. I think about how I'd do it, I think about how I'd be found, I think about the aftermath.

I feel so much guilt but everyone has their breaking point and I guess this is mine. My doctor's have tried to help me but I feel like they're losing their patience at this stage.

I just feel bad. Constant images in my head of doing it. I don't know what the hell I should do. I feel like I'm beyond help so I'm not even bothered asking anymore.

My doctor does not know I'm suicidal. I've never wanted to end my life before so this is all new to me and I'm scared to tell them. I don't know what to do.
