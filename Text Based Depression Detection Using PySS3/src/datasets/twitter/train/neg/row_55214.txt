I'm only staying alive for my familyI can't be fixed, it will not get better, I'm tired of trying. I don't have hope for my future, I never did. I remember thinking when I was a kid that the way I die would most likely be suicide, because there was no way for me to live with a mind and body like my own. The only reason that ever stopped me from actually doing it was that it would cause even more pain to my family. I've made them suffered enough, they don't deserve to suffer even more.



But at the same time, if I'm dead, I won't disappoint them anymore.



Every time I'm at the subway station, I think about how easy it would be for me to simply jump in front of the train when it arrives. The only thing stopping me is the picture of my niece that I saved as my phone wallpaper. I don't want my brother to explain to her why I'm not there anymore.



But that will not fix my problems. I'm still alive and mentally ill and no one knows about it because I don't want to hurt them. I don't want them to know how messed up I am, what would they think of me if they knew what's in my mind and my heart.
