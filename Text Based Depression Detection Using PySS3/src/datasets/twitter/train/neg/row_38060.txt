I havent cried in over a decadeI've struggled with feeling suicidal for a while but tonight has just hit a real crux for me. Nothing I ever do seems to go right for myself and every time I feel like I'm finally getting somewhere and improving things for myself I find some way to fucking it up, again and again and again I always seem to be faced with my own destruction and failure and nobody seems to understand or want to have an extended conversation about it. I know I'm not the worst off person in the world, and I know that even my pass is nothing compared to some other people I know but it doesn't stop me from feeling like my life is already over and I have no prospects at success so what the fuck is the point. I'm just rambling because I'm honestly afraid of myself right now, I'm sorry for this post.
