It's less that I want to die and more that I don't want to live.If I had a switch to just end life, I think I would have pressed it by now. The whole process of dying scares me. I don't want to leave my body in a mess and I definitely don't want to make an unsuccessful attempt.

I just don't want to do another 60 years of living. Life has been too long already and there isn't enough good bits to make up for all the bad and the lonliness.
