Is there a way to exist in a non-burdensome way?I feel offensive. All the time. 

When I talk about my feelings I feel attn seeky. 

When I hold in my emotions I feel in-genuine. 

When I get close to someone I feel anxious that Iâ€™m somehow subconsciously tricking them into liking me. 

When I isolate I feel like Iâ€™m worrying people or am being a freak.

When I joke around I worry Iâ€™m cringey or making people uncomfortable.

When I give my honest opinion I feel like a bitch.

When I go along with people despite opposing feelings I feel artificial and like a fraud.

I wish I could figure out a way to exist in a non offensive way. I just want to live alone in a cabin in complete isolation. I donâ€™t want to have to interact with people in fear of causing negativity in anyoneâ€™s life. Iâ€™m so uncomfortable with myself.
