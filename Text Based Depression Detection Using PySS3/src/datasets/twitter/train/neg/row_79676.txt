I don't want to be here anymore but I'm too scared to do anything about itAt the moment everything just gets to me. I don't want to get up, I don't want to study and I don't want to go to work. I've been struggling a lot with everything recently and I don't see anything in my life improving, I often feel ill or drained even without doing anything. Despite everything that has been going on this year people around me are still finding ways to enjoy life and I can just feel myself withdrawing further from it all. I hate pretty much everything about myself and I know that for however long I manage to hold on for I'll probably always be alone, I'm not easy to be around because sometimes I just don't feel up to being social and I have lost a lot of friends because I might not always be in the mood to do what everyone else is or I'm not interested in the same things. 

I want to die but I can't bring myself to do it because I know that it would hurt my family and that just makes me feel worse honestly. It's struggle that day by day I just want to give in to.
