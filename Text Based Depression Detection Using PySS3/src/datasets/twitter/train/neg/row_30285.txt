Late night thoughtsIâ€™m gonna start this off by informing yâ€™all that i am a diagnosed insomniac but i donâ€™t take melatonin or anything like that (i hate any kinda of drugs even OTC ones). Iâ€™ve been struggling with depression for about 2 years now. the problem is, my life is literally perfect. iâ€™m from a wealthy family, have 2 awesome brothers, a beautiful girlfriend, etc. i just donâ€™t know that the problem is. iâ€™m about to graduate high school and i have no idea what i want to do in life. when i think about it i always come to the same answer: nothing. i want to do nothing in life. i just wish to fall asleep one day and never wake up. i just wish there was a way i could end my life without hurting other people. i am extremely close with my mom (big time mommas boy and not ashamed) and i canâ€™t imagine what losing a child would do to her. her and my girlfriend are the only things keeping me around. i know i should get help or talk to someone but iâ€™m too ashamed. iâ€™m embarrassed that this is happening to me and i donâ€™t want to tell anyone. this shame and embarrassment kinda feeds into the whole loop. i sometimes fantasize about moving out of the country or something getting away from my family, and ending it there. that way they wonâ€™t have to go through the trauma of finding my body.
