I always hold everything in until I hit my breaking point.Like I always do, I held everything in until I broke down today. I've trying my best to talk to friends who are supposed to care about me so this doesn't keep happening but it always ends without relief and people giving me shitty advice and trying to "diagnose" me. I can't blame them though, it is a lot to hear about my issues with my homophobic, verbally abusive, and physically abusive father and my issues from sexual abuse when I was 13 by a male "friend". On top of that, I'm a lesbian from an extremely homophobic family. I broke down today and started having suicidal thoughts. The only thing that kept me from killing myself was knowing what I was going to use wouldn't work very well. When I wanted to talk about it I was told I was "selfish". Especially when I expressed that I was jealous that everyone around me seemed to always have good things happen to them and it seems like I never have anything good happen to me. The only response I got was that I should "get used to it" "life isn't easy" and that I should "just be happy for other people". I've been suicidal since I was around 12 probably from the extreme bullying I got in middle school. My first major attempt was when I was 14 and in 9th grade where I downed a bunch of pills to kill myself. I was in therapy around that time and my therapist suggested that I may have bipolar disorder. She called in my parents to talk about having me taken somewhere that specialized in pediatric mental health to have me tested or whatever. My parents pulled me out immediately because "there was no way that their daughter had a mental disorder". I've been crying all day, I couldn't pull myself together to go to class. I do have an appointment at my college's counseling center on Monday that I made a while back (they were booked). I'm sorry if I'm not making much sense, I'm a bit of a wreck.
