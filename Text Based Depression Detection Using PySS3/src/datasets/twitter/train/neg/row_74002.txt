I wrote this in my journal and it scares me.Everyone thinks I'm happy and outgoing. I have a lot of friends. I have a boyfriend. I should be. I donâ€™t think anyone knows me. I donâ€™t think anyone knows what is really going on.

I have so many regrets about this life. I feel like I was given a pretty good life (despite having a shitty mom) and I did the worst things with it. I used it up. I let that happen when I was younger. I fucked up school and my career. I was a slut and a whore. I was shitty to my friends. I never did anything important.

A few months ago, I was sleeping in a bed. He was sleeping on the floor. After the wedding. I woke up when he was next to me and touching me, it took me a few minutes to realize what was going on. I tried to stop it but maybe not forcefully enough. I feel stupid because itâ€™s so small but Iâ€™ve been so angry and sad since then. I canâ€™t tell anyone and I will never tell anyone. I want to make it not happen. I feel bad for him. I feel bad for myself. I donâ€™t feel like I know what really happened and I donâ€™t really understand it. It feels like it happened to someone else.

Dad died over a month ago. Mom sucks like always. The rest of my family contacts me when they need something from me.

Iâ€™m going crazy. There is more and more shit that happens every week. People say I am strong. They donâ€™t really know what I am. Iâ€™m staying up until I pass out every night because I donâ€™t want to lie there trying to fall asleep. I'm scared all the time. I cry every day Iâ€™m going to work, at work, and on my way home. I go to sleep and donâ€™t want to wake up. When I cross the street I wish a car would hit me. When I see a bridge, I want to jump off of it. My heart has been racing and Iâ€™m scared of dying but I want to get it over with at the same time. Iâ€™m just struggling through this life. I donâ€™t have anything to live for.

Every day I want to set my whole world on fire. I miss being alone and not having any friends. I feel so lonely with a lot of people around. I wish I could be alone every day and not have to get out of bed and not have to live a life. I feel exhausted by life and I donâ€™t see the point.

I thought that by staying alive things would get better but they have only gotten worse.
