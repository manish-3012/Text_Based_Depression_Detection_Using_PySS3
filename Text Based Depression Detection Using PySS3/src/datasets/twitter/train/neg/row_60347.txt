On the verge of relapse...I've been self harm free for close to 10 years now but these past couple months have brought me so close to the edge that I just dont have the urge or the want to fight it anymore. The last time I made an attempt on my life I almost succeeded (a friend found me and rushed me to the ER). I'm 27 years old, FtM transman, non-supportive family (family in general likes to pretend I dont exist even before coming out as trans), my best friend ended our friendship over my relationship choice (and honestly I should have listened to her because the woman I love treats me like shit), and I have little to no support network. I'm about ready to either end it all or baker act myself. 

I'm just so sick of fighting. I want to just give up.
