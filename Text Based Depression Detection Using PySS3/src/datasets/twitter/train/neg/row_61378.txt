Im suicidal but nit at the momemtIm definatly not scared of dying and its a safe to say i have this never ending battle going on in my head where i honestly do hate myself whether its previous choices that led to where im at or just getting handed life lesson after lesson, i do not want to distract from those who need help asap as i am not going to actually do anything at the moment, but man do i always find myself walking that tight rope of when should i do this is it actually something that i wouldnt think twice about. I sit there and think how many times HAVE I felt this way how many times do i keep having these reoccuring thoughts, i list out the few close people and YES I have two beautiful daughters one and three years old and think wouldnt it be better if someone else raised them and they never knew me, i think about my family and hope they could get over it quickly, which just sucks cause I want to feel better but man i keep feeling and thinking the same things over and over, and it just plain sucks amd i cant really tell anyone either
