Just when things were looking up..Have had a rough last few years, but overall I was able to endure. Lost everything after leaving a cult, and losing my grandfather shortly after. Was focusing on myself trying to build my emotional strength more than ever. I came to meet a wonderful girl who started to open my eyes to the possibilities again. Today I was hit with the news that she is moving, and to top things off my grandma was just sent to the same hospice center..I really just donâ€™t know if I can handle all this at once. Could really use some help for once. Appreciate it!
