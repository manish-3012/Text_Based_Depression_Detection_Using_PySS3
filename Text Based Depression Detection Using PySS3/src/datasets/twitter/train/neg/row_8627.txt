I think about committing suicide every dayLife is shit right now and I feel as though Iâ€™m the burden of the family, my mom doesnâ€™t pay attention to me and my dad works and doesnâ€™t leave time to partake in my life, my siblings hate me, honestly the only reason Iâ€™m still here is because I push myself everyday saying â€œoh itâ€™ll get betterâ€ and â€œthink about your futureâ€ but it just keeps getting harder to push on and I donâ€™t think I have it in me, I wanna thank everyone on this app who may have given me that rare occasional laugh, and Iâ€™m sorry to everyone Iâ€™ve let down.
