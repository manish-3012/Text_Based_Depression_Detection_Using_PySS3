I don't have anyone to talk to. So I'm sharing with you, since at least y'all understand.I feel completely dead inside. The only emotion I even feel is just sadness. Just deep sadness. I feel like I'm going crazy. I spend 90% of my day now just thinking about suicide. And I've been self harming again. The only way to numb it is with heavy drinking. I drink a fifth of vodka pretty much every night at this point. Sometimes more than that. Which I know is only making things worse, but for a few hours a night I can get rid of the never-ending thoughts of what I'm gonna look like after I eat my gun. It's affecting my job performance. I'm constantly distracted, and I'm beginning to have trouble talking to people. I feel like I'm locked up inside my head. I've dealt with the ups and downs of being depressed, but it's getting way worse. I used to tell myself that I couldn't do that to my family. Now I don't know if I even care. Sometimes I find myself feeling angry that I should have to stick around because of them. Like that's not fair to me. Over the past few months my whole outlook on life has changed. I'm finding that I'm bitter. I'm beginning to have hateful thoughts about people for no reason. I truly feel like I'm losing it. I don't know where to turn. I know that if I just keep trying to ignore it, I'm going to kill myself. It's inevitable it seems. It honestly at times it seems comforting. Other times I feel scared and panicked. Angry that I'm thinking these thoughts. Then they just come back tenfold. I'm sorry for the rant. I'm just lost. I know I'm going to kill myself. It's just a matter of time at this point.
