Question from someone who cannot relate but would like to.I understand that most of you feel like their is no meaning to your life, that continuing on is not worth the time, effort, or pain. My question to you is, "Do you think it will ever be possible for you to find happiness, love, or meaning again in life, given enough effort and time, or do you think that you are beyond the point of no return, and you will never feel happiness again no matter how hard you may try?"

I am not a therapist, psychiatrist, psychologist, or anything else, I simply want to understand your position.
