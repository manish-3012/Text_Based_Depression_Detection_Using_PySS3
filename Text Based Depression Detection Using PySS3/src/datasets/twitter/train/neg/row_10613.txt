I want to die because I have no friendsWhy can't I have someone to talk to and do things like everyone else does? I'm jealous on people who have friends. Literally everyone else has them while I'm a pathetic loser who has no one and only gets mocked and laughed at. I want someone to care. I know it sounds weird but I get triggered when I see the word "friends". I don't even need a partner, all I want is a friend. Where do I get one. Why does no one want to befriend me and treat me like a human being. I'm desperate. Oh I'm so desperate I could throw myself out of the window even if I sit at the third floor.
