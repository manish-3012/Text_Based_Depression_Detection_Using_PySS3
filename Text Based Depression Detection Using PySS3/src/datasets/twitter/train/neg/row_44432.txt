I almost hanged myself todayI was this close to offing myself. I had the rope and noose set up and everything. I can't and don't want to live but I'm too much of a coward to go through with killing myself. I know I'm doing my family and friends a favor by ending my life. Today was the closest that I have ever been to actually killing myself. Nobody else knows that I feel this way, and it's better that they don't know. I don't feel anything anymore, like I'm more than empty inside, like there is less than nothing in me. I've resorted to hurting myself intentionally to try to feel something. I absolutely do not deserve the life that I've had. I know that people will be heartbroken that I'll be gone but they will realize that I did them a favor in time. Anybody out there please give me the courage to kill my self. I can't live anymore knowing what I'm like and how many people I've hurt over and over.
