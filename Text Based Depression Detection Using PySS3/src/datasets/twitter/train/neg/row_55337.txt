I despise my existenceNever met dad, mom left at 4, the useless bitch is dead now. Raised by grandmother who when I was 16, her son my uncle who died when I was 19. 
28 now. 9 miserable lonely pathetic years since. What a fucking joke. 

I'm afraid to have a child bc they'll have no family from me. I don't think I'd be a good father. Plus who in the fuck would ever want to build a future with someone who doesn't have any fucking family? I know I wouldn't if I were them. 

I exercise 5-6 times a week that does nothing. I'm in school that does nothing. Nothing helps. I'm writing a poor, shitty book on my experiences and I've been contemplating suicide when I'm finished. 
There's literally zero point in me trying. 
I cannot bring myself to care about my career. 
I don't even care about money. What the fuck am I going to do with it? Some dumbass told me buy a boat. 
Honesty I rarely say anything bc I don't want to give ppl the satisfaction of hearing how much I truly, really hate my life. 
On the outside I may appear as a normal person, maybe even happy at times. 
But in reality all I feel is resentment, frustration, loneliness, and emptiness. 
I don't even feel like a fucking man. 
This is all I have felt for my entire adult life. Countless holidays. I don't even have my youth any longer, so any semblance of hope I contrived to keep myself from hating my existence even more is no longer effective.
