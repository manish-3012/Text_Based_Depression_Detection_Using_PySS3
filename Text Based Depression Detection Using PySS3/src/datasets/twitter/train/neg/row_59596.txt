What will a doctor do/say/ask if I tell them I self harm and have suicidal thoughts?I have a doctors appointment today in a few hours for my ongoing treatment of anxiety (GAD) and I know heâ€™s going to ask the same questions like â€œare you depressed? Do you plan on hurting yourself?â€ Over the last 4 months I said no but I think Iâ€™ll finally have the courage to finally say yes and get some help since starting last month I have been thinking about being dead a lot and how I would do it and looking up ways to do it incase I survive. Just a lot of reading and thinking about it but I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll actually do it. It does get intense some days though if Iâ€™m having a bad day or week. As for self harming, I really only do it when I get super frustrated with myself or something bad happens. Itâ€™s always my go to, but itâ€™s getting bad because now when I do it I start to cut harder and it concerns me but I have no control over it. 

So I was just wanting to know what to expect when I tell him yes. Thank you! Iâ€™m in the California if that helps any. And just a reminder, I donâ€™t plan on killing myself... I just constantly think about it and how I would do it.
