wish my cancer killed melike my title says i wish i died and not have to suffer like this. if i were to kill myself now itd feel like all that money going into my treatment would be a waste and my family would probably hate me for that. at the same time every moment that passes it feels like nothingâ€™s improving and im gonna waste everyoneâ€™s time and money (especially my family )
