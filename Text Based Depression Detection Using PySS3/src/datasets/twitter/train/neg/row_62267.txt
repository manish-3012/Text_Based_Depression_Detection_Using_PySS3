I'm scaredI think I may be depressed. I've bottled up my emotions my entire life and I recently sought therapy at the inquiry of a close friend, but it didn't help with my feelings. I have often told myself that I will never ever commit suicide no matter the circumstances because life is always worth living, but maybe I'm just fooling myself. I'm scared because I can't trust my emotions and I just keep saying it to myself to myself to avoid the harsh reality that I may be okay with just ceasing to exist. What if now that I finally allow myself to really feel emotions, I'm just faking it because that's what my brain expects me to do?

I'm only 19 years old and I don't know if I am truly suicidal but I'm really scared and crying right now, so could someone older who has lived more of life please share a happy life-story of how things got better or something? Because right now, I can't see the end of the tunnel.

Edit: I'm pretty durnk right now and ready to face my true feelings. I didn't want ti to shine throught in my post, but despite all my re-reads I noticed a lot of grammatical errors despite my frequent re-writes after I posted.

Ãˆdit 2: I'ma lot drunker but my best friend is here and I will be fine.
