The pointFinding it hard to find a point in the grand scheme. Scared of the fact that there might not be one. Not suicidal necessarily, rather chasing 16+ hours of sleep to avoid looking at the problem each day, having tri weekly meltdowns that end in me such a mess on the bathroom floor I can barely make it back to bed before I pass out again. 

There is a lot more to unpack here but I'm not sure where to even start. There is this dreadful anticipation sitting in my stomach as though there is something extremely important I am forgetting to do, but there isnt, and it makes me want to curl into a ball so tight and small I just cease to exist.
