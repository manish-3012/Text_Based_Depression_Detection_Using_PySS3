i fucked up dude.i fucked up so badly. i want my life to be over. the past haunts and catches up with me. i fucked up relationships friendships school everything. i just feel like itâ€™s over for me and iâ€™ve said that before and i wonâ€™t stop saying it because itâ€™s true. i feel like now is a good time to end it all this general time period. iâ€™m out of school i have no social interaction and no one will find out because no one gives a fuck about me it seems. for fucks sake...
