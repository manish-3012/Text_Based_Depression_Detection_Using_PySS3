What if suicide was okay, or even good?Why is it up to society to tell us that suicide is bad? If I was dead, I wouldnt regret it, bc I couldn't. If it hurt my family, so what? I would not exist to be able to feel the guilt of hurting them. I think everyone who wants to kill themselves should feel empowered to do so. Were not even here for a reason. Fuck it.
