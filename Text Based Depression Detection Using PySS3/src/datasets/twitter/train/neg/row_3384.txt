Please help? Anyone here know anything about overdosingHey guys/girls can you develop a tolerance when using H (heroin) once a week? My bro overdosed last year and im in a wheelchair from an accident ( my wife left me as well) please God just let this suffering end... I've tried to OD so I can finally be in peace and see my best friend again.. but snorting and mixing with heavy doses of valium and alcohol just doesn't seem to do the trick and I just wake up a day later covered in vomit.. you'd think a box of 2mg Valiums and half a G of china white would do the trick but maybe I have a tolerance now because I've been doing it for a month or so now trying to kill myself but I've only experienced non fatal overdoses... For fuck sake I just want to be free from this hell can anyone help me? Should I just shoot a whole G of china (heroin) as well as 100mg of valium surely that would do it? (Not looking for advice on changing my life and staying positive so please don't comment that shit just looking for advice I cannot take this anymore) thank heaps for Any advice :))
