I'm exhausted. I just want to go. I set a date. I've been fighting this since I was 12 and it has not let up. 
Too many bad things have happened. 
Bad things keep happening. 
I don't even know how to start taking about it. 
There's no help. There's never any help. 
I'm tired of people asking me to stay when I'm in so much pain. I just want to go. 
I know it's selfish. But I feel like it's selfish to ask me to continue a life of agony....I don't know what else to do. I can't stand living like this. 
I don't know why I'm posting this...I'm sorry...I don't know
