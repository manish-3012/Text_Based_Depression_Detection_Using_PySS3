I feel unfixableso i'm 14 nearly 15. I have depression which is getting worse. I have Ptsd from nearly drowning. I have anxiety and paranoia. anger issues and trust issues as well basically i'm stuck in my own head. my self-esteem is so low i don't even care about myself. i tell myself nobody cares about me and i don't matter and i would be better off dead. i don't want to die but i do at the same time. it's getting harder to go to school i recently skipped 2 days on purpose. i just want to stop existing entirely
