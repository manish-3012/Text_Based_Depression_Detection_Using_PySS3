She left me for someone else so quickly and all I want to do is dieI kinda new this would happen..we had a lot of problems.. But I was pretty dedicated to her to solve them..it turns out she wasnâ€™t..she was my best friend..we spoke everyday. Iâ€™ll miss that.. I guess this is a lesson to be good with I myself
And not need anyone.. whenever I had problems like I was sad or something she didnâ€™t care one day she said to me â€œI need to live my lifeâ€ just threw me away like that like I was nothing. And thatâ€™s what I feel like.. I feel like Nothing. I miss her a lot and feel disgusted yet I still mourn the loss of my best friend. I wish we would of never gotten together if I had known Iâ€™d lose her. In such a frivolous way. Like throwing away trash.
