Feeling rather numb. Afraid I might hurt myself.Hey guys, I was on here about a month ago with severe depression. Since then, I've gotten off my anti-anxiety/antidepressant meds and am still adjusting. Every day since then, I've felt really emotionless. Like I really don't care if I live or die. And every day, I just get these thoughts like "it would be so easy for me to just drive off this bridge." And when I'm alone, I think of suicide. Like, how would I do it, when, where. Stuff like that. It's kind of scary. I guess I don't feel like I have any friends to turn to. I've tried to talk to my really close friends about my anxiety and depression, but they don't really understand what it's like. I feel like I'm alone anyway, so why stick around and prolong the numb feeling? I'm not seriously contemplating doing it right now. But I think about it a lot.
