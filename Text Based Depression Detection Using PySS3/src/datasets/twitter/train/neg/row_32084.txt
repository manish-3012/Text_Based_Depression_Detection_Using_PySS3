Anyone else feel like they're waiting for something that isn't comingDon't really post much but felt I needed some advice. I guess I'm what people would describe as semi popular for an 18 year old, hang out with a few lads at uni and some old school fellas but I have no actual friends who make a concerted effort to see me personally, its usually just coincidental that I end up seeing someone. On top of that theres nothing romantic in my life at all despite the fact I don't consider myself to be too ugly. I used to be able to alleviate depressing thoughts by saying things will get better out of high school but its getting worse, just sitting aimlessly at home just waiting, scrolling through news feed or reddit or whatever. I feel I legitimately have no positivity in my life and there's not much hope for me to ever have what I'm looking for in life and it just feels like a matter of time until I get fed up with the monotonous routine and attempt something. Just wondered if anyones gone through anything similar and wants to lend some advice cheers
