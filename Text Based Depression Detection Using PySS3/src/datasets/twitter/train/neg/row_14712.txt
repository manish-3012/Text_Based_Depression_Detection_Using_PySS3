Is it just me or...I have never been so, unhappy, uncomfortable, uneasy. I'm at the brink of succeeding suicide but every time I tried, I somehow managed to fail. Is it just me or some other reason as to why I feel so bummed for not killing myself? I feel this desperation to finally put myself to rest and I am so frantic to making it happen. I have no purpose to keep going anymore. My job here is done. I also want to go back to my old ways but those are only temporary and I just want to be gone for the benefits of other people. I've done enough hurting. I don't want to cause anymore pain to them they deserve a much calmer happier life.
