It's time for me to go.I'm not in the right state to write a long sob story so I'm gonna make this short. This post is going to act as my online gravestone.

It's time for me to end my life and I'm doing it today. I've already decided. I'm not going to be in a sad state or cry when I do it, because I think I lived a good and satisfying life for the most part, but it has got to a point where I don't really have any other options. So this is my final goodbye to Reddit and /r/SuicideWatch. Thanks for always giving good advice and lifting me up whenever I've needed it the most. You are an important community and all the people actively posting in here helping out people; you are doing god's work.

 Just know that me being away is not going to negatively impact anyones life and I currently have no responsibilities or such that would fuck up someone elses situation. I also want it to be clear for everyone, that this is a happy suicide. Trying to talk me out of it or something at this point is not going to change anything, because this is actually what I want to do at this point and I'm happy that I have finally reached a state where I can do it without fucking anyone else over.

Goodspeed, r/SuicideWatch.
