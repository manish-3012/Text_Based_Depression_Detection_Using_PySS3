Genuinely scaredJust thought Iâ€™d share as I donâ€™t know what to do. Due to the corona virus itâ€™s looking like College will shut on Friday and then there will be a 5+ week holiday and I donâ€™t know how Iâ€™m going to make it through it. Iâ€™m already severely depressed and on the weekend when Iâ€™m alone I really suffer from suicidal thoughts and self harm. A few weeks ago we had a 1 week half term and by the end I genuinely thought I was going to commit suicide right then. Now there is literally going to be 5 weeks of being just me and my thoughts and I canâ€™t see myself making it through and Iâ€™m just terrified.
