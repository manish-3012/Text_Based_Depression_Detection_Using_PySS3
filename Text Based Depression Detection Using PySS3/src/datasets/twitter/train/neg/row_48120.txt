Loose cannonIm a loose cannon with many friends and a loving family. Despite a great upbringing i have these self destructive tendencies. I overdosed 5 times last year and am still doing heavy drugs although not as heavily as i did in the past. I often think about killing myself, and have had these thoughts for close to 7 years. I have some underlying mental helth issues that obviously make the situation worse. For some reason, even from a very young age, ive told myself that i will die early. And its weird because i cant attribute these suicidal thoughts to anything apecific, sometimes i just dont want to be around anymore. I cant relate to anyone,  and i dont know what to do anymore. Im so filled up with anguish and anxt. I just want to be able to be sociable and have fun a few more times before i kick the bucket. And at the same time i have this immovable feeling that im going to do something great with my life, and its the only reason im still around. I just hope i figure out what it is soon.
