Intense guilt and depression after accidentally getting a bird killedSo yesterday we found this baby sparrow my cat brought in and it was still alive. After about a day it was starting to get comfortable and was comfortable sitting on my hand and walking around. I decided to have it on my chest. But then it jumped off and went under the bed. I heard it chirp, it was like a frightened chirp instead of a happy one. I pulled the mattress off and saw my other cat and the bird. At first I thought 'Thank god' thinking it was ok. But when I picked it up I realised it was bleeding from the rib cage and it was motionless. It died quickly but I cant get over the guilt I feel right now. 

It was a baby bird who never got to see the world and just as it was starting to trust me it died. I keep on thinking if I just put it in the cage instead of handling it it would still be alive. Its dead. And I am mostly to blame. I feel so sad and guilty and ashamed with myself.
