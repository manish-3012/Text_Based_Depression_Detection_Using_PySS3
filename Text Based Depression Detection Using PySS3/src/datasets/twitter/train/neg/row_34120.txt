dont know when but im doing itthe single biggest fear i have of killing myself is this idea that i will be able to see from above the misery i create by leaving my kid and my wife and the rest of the family.

but ive managed to realise that after you commit the act, it's nothing. there is no existence. you dont see hear or feel anything, youre not here or anywhere, youre gone. no matter what you were afraid of, it wont be there to confront you. all existence ceases to exist in terms of your existence.

&amp;#x200B;

so fuck it. im afraid for them but after i do it, i wont be. all of it wont matter because ill be dead.

theres quite a few bridges around my area. ive checked their heights and it will work fine. ive also got some mountain drops higher than the bridges to choose from. im gonna do it sometime at night while the kid and wife is asleep. just drive away in the dark, park the car, and jump. life fucking finished finally.

if anyone wants to help me, dont try talk me out of it. ive made this decision. if you want to help me try chatting to me about anything, your hobbies, what you like and dont like, where you live, your life experiences. all this "ohhh noo please dont do it i love you the world loves you, you need to stay".... FUCK THAT BULLSHIT. take your treehugging la la land attitude and fuck off.
