If not even iâ€™m not okay being me, itâ€™s time to leave suicide date is this saturday today is may 18th on a monday
i came out as liking girls last year. nobody knows i might be non-binary. just that word makes me want to puke. i hate having my hair long, wearing feminine things, and my chest makes me really uncomfortable and insecure. i donâ€™t go outside without wearing hoodies. i feel disgusting, weird, and like thereâ€™s something significantly wrong with me. i canâ€™t handle the hate from myself and most everyone around me. the thought of coming out like that makes me want to die. i canâ€™t live like that, like me living makes both myself and everyone else in my life so uncomfortable. i hate myself so much i canâ€™t handle it anymore iâ€™m going to kill myself sometime this week.
