either way i'm fucked, and so are my parentsso here's my situation.
i don't want to go to school anymore, it's destroyed me and made me depressed. not because of bullies, but because of the inability to leave and hate iv'e built up after years of small annoyances.
so with that being said, here's my situation.
i want to leave school,move out and get a job but the law is preventing me to do that. so the answer would be to leave the state as the truancy officer doesn't have any jurisdiction outside of the state and searches would most likely be at the local level. but that includes running away which means leaving my parents and i'm worried they will try to follow me/ not be able to work out of worry. but then there's suicide( which i already attempted) , that would leave my parents in a state of depression and i don't want that. theres medication but i'm not willing to try that. i can't go back to school as it just makes more depressed and ill end up trying to commit suicide again.
soâ€¦ why not just end it.
