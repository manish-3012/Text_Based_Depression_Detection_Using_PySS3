Lost everything, cant go on i miss her so fucking much she was my last thread connecting me to this world..Used to ive in australia found a thai firl we were mad in love for 4 years, i helped for the visa and then i was on her visa then i got anxiety depression made her go through tough shit had to go back to france to heal, she then broke, and never talked to me again .. nothing worked all the pills all the therapy , ETC, sports..but i 
mustered the courage to go back and she was just so cold not even to meet some explanations.. then i go out yesterday with our old friends but she wasnt there and after around the end of night some dude tells me she is with him its been almost a year (i had some suspicions saw a few pictures a bit close to him ask a friend to ask if she had a boyfriend and she said no..why...
I was like almost dreaming about her everynight or having nightmares while she was getting fucked.. Im not hungry, girls dont interest me, she was my only small meaning.. This existence man i dont want to give up on her but yeah im a worthless piece of shit. I could get girls but i just want her, maybe my BPD is strong.. BPD MDD OCD anxiety alcohol and benzo addiction sprinkle some mdma. I really want to fucking die i have suffered too long made my mom go into depression.. And lost the girl of my life. 
And i learn it on april fools day FU GOD
