Just some thoughts..Out of all the things the hard things in life, I never thought having a will to live would be one of them. I used to be one of the happiest people around, I'd smile everywhere I went and wave at strangers. The older I got the more I realized I don't like people and I hate myself even more. Just opening my eyes to wake up seems like a fucking war. I have nothing to live for. My dad hates me, I don't have a job anymore, and I'm to the point I don't even try to get a girlfriend anymore. I just wish I could spare my mom the trouble if I were to do anything. Jeez, is this all life has to offer... I'm only 18
