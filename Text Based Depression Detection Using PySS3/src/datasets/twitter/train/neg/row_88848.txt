Lost $2k and donâ€™t know how to copeI think this is gonna be the last straw for me. I got scammed. Iâ€™m 18. I place great emphasis on my finances (cause they find my hobbies and fast food and pretty much everything I do). Iâ€™ve been working two jobs and itâ€™s killed me for the last year, $2k is so much work that Iâ€™ve done that I had so many panic attacks over... and itâ€™s just gone in the blink of an eye.

I think I might jump off a building. Everything feels like too much now. Iâ€™m a waste of resources. I donâ€™t even deserve to be this sad because other people have lost way more than I have and I actually have it really good. But fuck man. Life just isnâ€™t worth it.
