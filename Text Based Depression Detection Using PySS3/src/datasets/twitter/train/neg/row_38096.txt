I'm in love with someone I can't ever be with and i can't take it anymoreI've had suicidal thoughts for months now. All because there's one person I'm so very much in love with but can't be with because he's already more than happy with someone else: a girlfriend he's had for years. And I don't want to break them up either, I want him to be happy most of all, but it's agony living with him in my life and being so completely in love with him- I don't want to live any more. I'll never meet anyone anywhere near as wonderful and genuine and caring as him, even if I did they'd never fall in love with me. I'm a nervous wreck, my personality is fractured, I'm not at all attractive, I'm short, forgettable, meaningless. I really don't want to live anymore. 

The one thing that keeps me from actually hanging myself is just the thought that I'll be hurting others by committing suicide; giving them guilt and regret, and other shit like that. I never want them to go through what I feel every day. If I could die by natural causes, like a car crash, I'd do it in a heartbeat, until my own stops.
