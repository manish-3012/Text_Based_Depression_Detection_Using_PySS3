Can't take much more nothing is really getting betterBeen struggling through depression, for what seems like forever now I'm 19 been fighting through it since I was 14. Now I am away from the abuse, I got the girl (But I am paranoid as fuck and she isn't even doing anything wrong, it's all just my head). I am terrified of failing out of college. My laptop fucking died and I essentially had to pay almost a months rent to buy one (need a decent one as I am in a computer related major). I'm really struggling at nights, I have absolutely no confidence and I have to fake it all the time, and after faking it for so long I find myself getting really angry at people and really anything which is something that has never happened before. I feel like i'm at my witsend and there isn't a light at the end of the tunnel. I really don't think living is worth it. I just want this pain my sickness to be over with, I don't think I can ever win, I never win at anything, nothing ever goes my way it always ends up in pain. What's the point, I can't take this living anymore, it just feels like I am already dying.
