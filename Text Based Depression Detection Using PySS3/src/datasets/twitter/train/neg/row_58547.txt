For once in my life, I tried to resist my parents. It didn't work.I'm 19. My parents have been planning a long, international family vacation and I don't want to go. My depression has been kicking my ass, I have horrendous motion sickness which gives me anxiety,  and I don't think i can handle a 10 hour flight. I also have a hard time not having my own private space, and usually have meltdowns during these kinds of vacations. I did not want to go on this trip. 

I've been trying to tell them this for weeks,  but they never took me seriously or paid attention until now. First I asked, and then I decided to state and demand that I stay at home. I've stayed home alone for week long periods in the past before.  They say I can stay home alone this time but they decided that I can't have use of the car for the rest of my life, and if I stay home, I have to leave my door open and the security cameras pointed at it 24/7.

They tell me that I don't love them any more and that I've ruined the parent-child relationship forever. They say I don't have my priorities straight. I'm in school. I'm training for a new job. I've never done these kinds of rebellious things. 

They cancelled my flight already and if I apologize, it'll seem like I'm doing it just for material gain. They already think I'm using them just for money. 

I didn't know that this was going to happen. It feels like I can't fix it. The only thing that's keeping me going is my boyfriend, but only just barely. I'm ready to end it all. It feels like the concept of freedom has been taken away from me, and I doubt they'll understand or listen to that.  I've said that I would kill myself multiple times in the past but they just told me to shut up.  I want to die in front of them to prove that I'm not faking it.
