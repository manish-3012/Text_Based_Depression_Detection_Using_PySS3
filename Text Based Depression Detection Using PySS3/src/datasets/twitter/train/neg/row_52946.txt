i feel so alone...... and i'm tired of it.  i quit drinking every day, but since then i haven't figured out how to deal with my negative thoughts if i'm not drowning them away.  i can't keep a job, my house will soon foreclose, my marriage is ending, and i have so many trust issues, i can barely open up to friends or family.  i never finished college, and have no idea what i want to do with my life.  i feel like it's too late for me, and i feel like this low that i'm currently at is as high as i will ever get.  i feel very lost, and alone.  i just needed to vent a bit... thanks, reddit.
