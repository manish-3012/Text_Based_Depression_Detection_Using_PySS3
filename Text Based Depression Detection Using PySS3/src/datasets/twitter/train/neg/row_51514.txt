Thinking too much keeps me aliveWhat I mean by that is I've thought about multiple ways to end myself, its wierd how common the thoughts are, feels pretty normal to me after having them for over a decade. I lost my best friend to a rollover which catapulted me to a mental "rock bottom" state. It didnt help that I was deployed at the time, with him being stateside. Anyway, it's been 11 years since finding out, I've since pushed dozens out of my life, became a recluse with no care for the outside world, I've spent countless nights laying awake fantasizing about ending it all.. the mental exhaustion from constant battles with my inner demons, a dirt nap sounds so good. However, during these countless nights of planning my suicide, I'm also countering that with the thoughts of what happens if I fail? Will I end up a vegetable, forced to stay alive by machines? How bad will it hurt if the noose doesnt kill me and I'm out there by myself suffering? Would a pretty awkward situation having someone just walk up seeing me like that right? I've thought about slitting the wrists, I'd rather not have my kids see the aftermath of that, jumping off a bridge, standing on the tracks waiting for a train to turn me into bits, popping too many pills, I've thought it all up, it's the thought of failure that's kept me from attempting any of it. So here I am today, feeling like I'm fucking cursed to live out my days until death finally takes me.. 

On any typical day I wouldnt bother to say this due to my disdain for society but to anyone reading this who feels hopeless, dont give up. No matter what hardships you're enduring, keep fighting, sometimes it gets worse before it gets better. Take it upon yourself to reach out, follow another path. And know you definitely are not alone.
