Thereâ€™s a reason youâ€™re here.Youâ€™re here for help. As a 22 year old man (relatively large one) i can assure you thereâ€™s no shame in reaching out. If you think thereâ€™s nobody out there, Iâ€™m here. Iâ€™m extremely suicidal as of lately and itâ€™s all thatâ€™s on my mind tonight. All my life Iâ€™ve found peace in unity, and Iâ€™m all alone. Please, give it a chance, everyone needs someone, no matter how strong you are.
