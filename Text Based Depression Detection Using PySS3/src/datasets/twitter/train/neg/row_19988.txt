I'm going to do itI've waited long enough and tried my absolute best, but I give up. I'm a loser with no friends and not a single person who cares about me. Tomorrow morning I will write my note and final goodbyes then I will finally do it. These past few years I've tried everything: opening up to people, therapy, antidepressants, being locked to a hospital for three weeks, everything. I cry everyday, multiple times and feel horrible because I make others around me feel bad as well. Nobody cares about Nick. Kill yourself Nick, that's what these voices are telling me and I believe them. Goodbye
