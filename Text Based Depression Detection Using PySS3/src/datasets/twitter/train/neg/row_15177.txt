Hard to pick a dateI guess this means I don't really want to die. Seems like I always make excuses for why I should wait a little longer. Honestly, I should have killed myself back in May, but I wanted to see my parents one last time.  Now, one of my favorite singers is about to release an album, and I don't know whether I should wait for that. I guess I will. But I really want to die before this summer ends.
