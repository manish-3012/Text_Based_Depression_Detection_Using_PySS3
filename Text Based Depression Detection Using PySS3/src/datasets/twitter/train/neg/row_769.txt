I see human cruelty see continuously emerging and it is just to much for me. Especially over all the years and from people close by.I'm living in the western world and a rich country and yet I have seen and experienced so much cruelty from these everyday well-fed, actually could be carefree people, that I just don't want to be here anymore. 

I tried ro establish good friends and good and caring relationships. Ended cruel and seriously life damaging again.

There is a part in me that fears to rise up again and hope and there is a part in me that thinks it' s pretty delusional to even have hope. 
I strived for the better and now I am truly disilluioned and disgusted.
