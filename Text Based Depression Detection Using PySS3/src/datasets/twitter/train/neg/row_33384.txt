So close to giving upIâ€™m 18F. Iâ€™m in my senior year of high school and I really just canâ€™t take it anymore. Everything is so fucking stressful. Iâ€™ve got a 10 page research paper due in 18 days. I am barely passing trig. I just feel useless, and my parents continue to assure me that I am.
Who do you turn to when your own parents hate you? Reddit, apparently.
I just donâ€™t think I can do it anymore. I think itâ€™s time to say goodbye.
