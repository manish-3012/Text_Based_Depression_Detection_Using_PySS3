I'm planning on finally ending it all.I made a deal with myself. If I'm not feeling happy when it's 12/11 I'm going to do it. Allready got it all planned out. Last time I was planning to do it I tried to slith my wrist vertical but I didn't have the balls to do it. So this time I will OD using a couple of xanax bars and vodka so I won't feel any pain. If you're asking "why 12/11?" it's because that day I've finally found happyness but I lost it all a couple months ago. I told myself to just wait that everything would be okay.. But I'm done with waiting. I'm just done with life. It's just a waste of time. We just live to die. I'm not able to be happy and I'm not able to make other people happy. So why do I even bother living. Like 70% of human population are assholes. Everything is fake. Even your best friends. The only people that I trust are on this reddit. If I tell my friends I'll probably get laughed at again. I hope all of you guys find happyness and live a happy long life. And deep down I hope that so do I. But I'm afraid that's not gonna be the case.
