My suicidal thoughts are backI've been stressed out about school and moving and while it hasn't been too bad (might be the best I've felt all year), I'm not sure I can take it anymore. I fucking hate myself. I hate myself for not having the courage to talk to someone about this. I hate myself for not having the courage to actually kill myself and I hate myself for pushing everyone away. No one likes talking to me. I can't make friends and a girlfriend is someone I'll probably never have. I finally feel really depressed after a few days and the next few days might be the final straw for me.
