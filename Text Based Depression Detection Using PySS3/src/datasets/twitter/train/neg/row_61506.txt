Sure donâ€™t want to do this anymoreBroke up with my abuser. Struggling every single day with even wanting to wake up. Sleep past my alarms all the time. Undeniably sad and depressed. No one knows that everyday on the drive to work I battle with just ramming my car into a wall or off a bridge. Sucks to not have anyone. Literally donâ€™t have friends anymore thanks to my ex. Canâ€™t do this alone anymore.
