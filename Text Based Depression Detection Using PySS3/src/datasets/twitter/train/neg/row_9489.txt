Iâ€™m legitimately useless and my family is suffering because of me.To elaborate, i quit my last job in April of this year and have not been able to get a job since then. Because I quit my job, my mother has had to work twice as hard to bring in money. My brother has also been job searching to no avail. 

I havenâ€™t been trying my absolute hardest when it comes to jobs because I have hardly any skills worth merit as far as experience is concerned. The entry level jobs in my immediate vicinity all have requirements that I canâ€™t meet. The ones that donâ€™t have those requirements are too far away for me to bike to. 

I donâ€™t have my license or a car, I donâ€™t have minutes on my phone to even call local businesses. I canâ€™t help but feel as if itâ€™s all my fault for quitting in the first place. My mother has a breakdown everytime something goes wrong and she feels like she canâ€™t talk to me about anything without upsetting me. 

I keep thinking how worthless I am to my family and the job market, how all of my effort is never going to be enough and how if I just ran away and killed myself in a place where theyâ€™d never find me, I wouldnâ€™t even have to burden them further with funeral costs. They could just assume I went missing and theyâ€™d stop looking for me eventually. Theyâ€™d be able to pay for the bills, the section 8 housing would pay more of the rent without me living there. Everything would be fine for my family.
