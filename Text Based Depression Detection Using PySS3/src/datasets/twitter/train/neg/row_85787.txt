online school is ruining my lifebefore online school, i was able to keep many things in check. stuff like grades, relationships, and time management. now its just terrible. im always stuck doing busy work without learning, so im constantly losing time to talk to my friends. i have no time for recreational distractions, and when i do make time i end up giving into said distraction. i keep procrastinating time and time again. im at home idk what these teachers expect from a low attention span teenager. i really hate living this way. none of my friends are even helping me. it feels like im doing the same thing everyday, but it just keeps getting worse and worse.
