I wish I cared as much about my life as others do.I'm not happy. At least, not most of the time. I flirt with the idea of death, it would be so easy. I've managed to convince myself there is an afterlife, which makes it so much more tempting to kick the chair.

Two things weighing on my conscious though; My narcissistic family, and my dog. My family...that's a story for another time. It would be so much easier if i were like them though, blind to everything. Ignorance really is bliss. Anyway, my dog. Shes absolutely amazing and i tell myself i wont end it until she passes. But i just adopted her a year or so ago, so shes still got at least 13 years. Maybe my mindset will change by then, maybe not. Either way, im at peace with it. Life is a journey, maybe the next one will be better.

To anybody who reads this, I wish you the best, truly. Life shouldn't be lived the way we live it.
