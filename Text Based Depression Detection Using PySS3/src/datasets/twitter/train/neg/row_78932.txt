Help?I suffer from an Anxiety disorder, and the last month and a half it has felt like hell. I care about my boyfriend, but I feel as if my anxiety is disorting my views of him. For example; I'm terrified that I don't like him as much as I did at the beginning of our relationship, and I get so frightened that I don't. I can't tell if what I'm feeling/or not feeling is because of my anxiety or not.
It's gotten to the point that I just don't want to be around (alive) anymore. I don't know what to do, I keep thinking I should just continue to play things out but it's getting unbearable.

I want to tell my boyfriend that I feel suicidal, but he lost his best friend to suicide and I feel like his reaction wouldn't be good, which is understandable. I'm also afraid he'll tell his friends.
