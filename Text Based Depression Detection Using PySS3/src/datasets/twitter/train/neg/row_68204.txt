I am in painMy neck, back and head are all aching. My stomach is nauseous and tight which makes it difficult to relax. My eyes feel like they're drilling backwards into my skull. I feel that no matter how much I breathe it won't be enough.

I've almost had enough of trying with people. I'm disgusted at how much pain I cause others and want it to stop. I want them away because I hurt them but damn doesn't it suck to be alone. I want to bring joy to others but my ugly and vengeful side sabotages everything and make isolation more attractive.

The worst part is the excruciating emptiness and emotional flatlining. Things I used to enjoy now cause frustration because my lack of emotional response reminds me that I'm an outsider. I spend weeks in an apathetic daze and when I come down everything I've done hits me hard and I feel like a monster.

Idk what I hope to achieve with this self-centred rant, maybe to see if anyone out there can understand. Thanks for reading, I really appreciate it ðŸ¦
