I simply don't want to liveI just don't have anything worth living for, I don't see myself in the future. I don't want to go to college, I don't want to study for a decade just to work, I don't want to buy a house, a car, I don't want to have kids. I simply don't want to exist, at the end I'll be gone anyway, so in this society we live can't I even choose whether I want to stay here or not?
