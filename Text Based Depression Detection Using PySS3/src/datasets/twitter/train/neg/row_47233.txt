Help pleaseI tried to call my country's suicide hotline but I just can't force myself to talk with the operator, and there is no chat based hotline. This is the only place I have.
I have been depressed for the last 10 years, i have tried so many therapies and they pumped me so full of medicines I was reduced to a hollow husk of a person. In January I quit all the medicines and I felt better, I could start drawing again, but lately I just realized it's all a delusion, I have been drawing for so many years, studying hard and putting out work to share on social media, nobody cares about my work
 I will never gain an audience. People say my art is anachronistic and I should draw differently
Yesterday I've been drinking a lot and I deleted everything I have online. I only had 30ish followers so it doesn't even matter. I am still hungover and sleepy, I want to disappear. My art is worthless, I can't be hired anywhere because all I can do is draw. There are teenagers who are a million times better than me and are already professionals, I'm just not cut for this. I failed, I failed so hard.
