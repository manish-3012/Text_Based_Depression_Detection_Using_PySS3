Rant.About 2 months ago half of my friends told me that I was an annoying cunt and to go fuck off and it has lingered in the back of my mind  ever sense and is absolutely destroying my social life Iâ€™m self conscious about my voice  and my appearance an incredible amount I feel like no one cares and I barley go outside because I feel like an incompetent cunt who can barely accomplish anything and never will I feel constantly ridiculed and everything hurts I feel like I will never experience a relationship because I have been told by multiple girls that I am completely incompatible with the opposite sex and I should just stop trying, when I do try to hit on someone I often get laughed at or told no before I can get into anything 
Anyway if youâ€™ve read this entire thing thanks for listening to me, you deserve to exist.
