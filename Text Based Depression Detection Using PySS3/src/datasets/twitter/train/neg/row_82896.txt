Don't know how to convey how I'm feelingI probably will delete this soon, maybe somebody will read what I have to say before then.

I wish I wasn't born. I wish I didn't have to wake up everyday and be me. I hate myself. I hate the way I look, I hate the way I act, I hate how big my lips are and how yellow my teeth are. I hate being this big. I hate having balding hair at the age of 17. I hate having this lazy eye. I wish I could go to bed and never wake up.  I hate myself I hate myself why do I have to be me.
