I have no friends, my family hate me, I quit my job in a fit of rage 2 months ago and since then I have been rubbing pennies together. I owe my roommate 2 months of rent, Im in debt to every local dealer making me scared to even go outside for fear of getting jumped, ive applied to every job going - even stuff like being a janitor, manual labour - no one will take me on. no matter what i try im still left lonely and poor - its taken me 22 years to hit a total brick wall and its time to go
