Fighting suicidal thoughts, but I'm afraid?I'm trying to help myself out of this, and I think I seem to be making marginal improvements in that regard, I have a very supportive family (godbless) and friends who are willing to help me out when I'm in a bad place, to an extent.

But, I'm afraid, because I'm just 20 and there's going to be things much worst than what I have been through that I might have to deal with: being married and divorced? being alone? unemployment? dissatisfaction with my job? health issues? I don't know. It just seems like somewhere along the way, I'm going to snap, I'm genuinely afraid my life will end with me killing myself :(

Does anyone else have similar fears?
