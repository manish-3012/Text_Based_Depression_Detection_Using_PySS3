I have everything now...why do i still feel like sh*t?All my life my Dad mever really loved me..but recently things seem to have gotten better..my grades..my friends..i even have a nice boyfriend..but i still consider takeing my life. I dont understand why. Why cant i just let go of the past and let myself be happy.how do i go about erasing my horrable memories? It makes no sense.
