I would just like someone to talk to.Something happend today. Something that was my fault. I acted like a bitch. I have too many emotions now about it and I feel to bad. Something that always helps me is cutting. I'm bleeding right now and it didnt make me feel better. I'm going to go take a bath with a razor blade in me hand. Maybe run it across my wrists. 

It would all be better if I had someone to talk to.  Someone who let's me talk about my feelings without seeming bored or like I'm bothering them. I hate myself, and I think I deserve the pain. I just don't know how to tell people about any of this. I feel like I'm bothering them...
