How do I meet new people?I feel like I'm not happy anymore with what I have and I want to meet new people to see if it gets better or to talk or make it more interesting or anything. But I'm not very charismatic. I try really hard to make people like me, but I'm just someone you talk to a few times and just forget afterwards
I'm terrible making new friends or talking to someone or just sounding interesting(even though I feel like I am interesting). I'd like to meet someone who lives close to me but at the same time I don't want to go out to meet them
