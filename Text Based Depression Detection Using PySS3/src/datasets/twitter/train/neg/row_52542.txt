I feel like a failure and don't know what to doI fucked up my college career due to immaturity and irresponsibility. It's my fourth year here, yet I've only completed half the number of classes I need to graduate. I'm going to drop out after this, but I can't deal with the shame and feeling of failure. I have no excuse for fucking up my college career, I'm just lazy and irresponsible. In a way, I don't want to commit suicide. But I just feel so dumb and ashamed.
