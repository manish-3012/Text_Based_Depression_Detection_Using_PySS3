I want to die, but I can't until my mom diesIm going to kill myself I just don't know when 
I hate this reality I live in and knowing I have no potential 
Im not even average, but below average 
Nothing special about me 
Nothing im really good at
School wasn't for me and made feel worse about myself even when I put the effort my hard work wasn't rewarded. In the end I fell out of college with terrible GPA ive worked many different jobs and sucked at all of them. I've been unemployed after corona hit and been living off savings that I've had and don't know what to do in fear of failing again or finding out i suck at something else. Ive had to move to a different state and move back with my parents and isolate myself further from few friends I had that I could speak to about my mental health, but now I'm alone. My parents take it personally when I explain how I feel and my mom guilty me about dying before her and makes me feel worse. I understand it though
I dont want to hurt them, but I have nothing going for me at 28 years old 
Been single for 5 years with very little experience  
Feeling like I missed out in my 20s 
Feeling alone. 
I just don't want to feel anymore
Don't want to hurt.
Cry. 
I just want to leave this reality and reset
