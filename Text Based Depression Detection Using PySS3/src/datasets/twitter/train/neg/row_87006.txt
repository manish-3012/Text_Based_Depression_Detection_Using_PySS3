Since everyone treats me like I'm such a horrible fucking person then they should be happy when I'm dead.Not one single person who treated me like shit is allowed to be upset when I'm dead. I needed you and I asked for your support and help and all you did was make me feel like shit and tell me how much of a useless fucking person I am. All you did was tell me I'm the reason shit is as bad as it is now. Since I'm always so fucking horrible you're not allowed me angry when I'm gone. You're not allowed to be sad when I'm gone. I do not want you at my funeral. I do not want you anywhere near my family. Stay the fuck away from them and don't act like you were loving and supporting when I needed you.
