If I had a quick, painless way out, I would take it.I'm done. I'm broken. I really hoped I would never make a post on here, but look at me now, reaching out for help when nobody cares and nobody wants to give it. I get it, it'd be a lot of work to look after me. But I just feel nothing. I've made posts on Reddit wanting advice, and gotten maybe one comment. It's my way of reaching out for help, but it's only reminded me that I am not worth the help. I won't ever be. I can't see a future for me, my family will hate me because I'm trans, and I don't think the hospital would care enough to keep me. Went to a clinic a few months back, they talked to me for an hour and sent me on my way. 

I want to say I'm scared, but I feel so hollow inside. My world feels detached. I can't find joy in the subject I'm studying. I know I need help, I'm fully aware. But I also know I don't deserve it. I'm a waste of space and air, and that's it. I just feel nothing. Nothing at all. I don't think being dead would be so different.
