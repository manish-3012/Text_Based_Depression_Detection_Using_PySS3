PatheticMy friend said Iâ€™m starting to look real pathetic over the girl who left me.  Girls donâ€™t like weak needy men.

â€œThatâ€™s soooo attractive!  So hot when you keep crying over a girl who is clearly not into you.â€

The pain is just too much I canâ€™t function.  I donâ€™t feel like I got closure.  The girl said sheâ€™d call and she never did... she liked me so much.  Why 

And my career is over they say itâ€™s my fault 

I am a weak pathetic mess   I canâ€™t do anything.  Iâ€™ve never done anything.  And thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m alone  thatâ€™s why no one ever loved me 

Why waste the breath.  Why am I wasting this space.
