Taylor has let me down and I just can't keep living anymoreTaylor Swift's music has been an important part in my life for the past two years and has given me hope. I have been to her 1989 tour and everything.  Taylor Swift gave me faith in humanity, but today she has been exposed as a liar. I thought she was the only genuinely good person in the world. I just can't keep living in this world anymore. I just wanted to let you guys know.
