several attempts. praying that this one will be the last.ive tried killing myself since the start of last year. none of what i did worked.

these coming months, iâ€™ve set a date on when iâ€™ll do it, and this time i know i will succeed. I hope that i do this time. I just dont have the strength to continue life anymore. 

ive caused so much trouble for the people around me. ive pushed them away too hard this time. iâ€™m pretty sure that they will be happy when iâ€™m gone.

i just want to die. to rest in peace. this world is not for me. im to weak to thrive here.
