Overdosed last night. Woke up, but still want to die. unsure of what to do next?I've wanted to end my life for years, but this past year has been really bad. I've overdosed before, but obviously I'm still here. 

Anyway, I thought I'd do a better job of it than before. I took 4500mg of Seroquel, 4 Zopiclone and around 3000mg of Pregabalin washed down with a few beers. I really thought that would work, but I woke up. I lost a day and when I woke up I was confused, shaky, and at times I was delirious.

I'm annoyed that I'm still alive, but because I am, I'm thinking of going to the hospital to get checked out because I have no idea what damage I've done. I'm still really shaky, my neck is really tight, I'm still a bit confused, but not delirious anymore, thankfuly. I am having some minor hallucinations, which I've never had before. On the other hand, I still want to die so there would be no point in going to hospital. I'm unsure what to do. 

Thanks for reading :)
