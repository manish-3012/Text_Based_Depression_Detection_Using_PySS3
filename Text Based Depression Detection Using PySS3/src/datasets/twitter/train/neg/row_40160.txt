iâ€™m just too muchiâ€™m too needy, too emotional, too dramatic, just all together too much. and every time i get rejected or hurt or anything, this anger and sadness build up. anytime someone gets upset at me for expressing my emotions it just builds more. and when iâ€™m in a rare good mood?? iâ€™m just annoying. 

i donâ€™t think people realize how much of myself i give. they donâ€™t get that everything i do is just so exhausting because it takes so much out of me. no one gets that iâ€™m trying my hardest but i just canâ€™t seem to get it together. 

im trying so hard but iâ€™ve been suicidal since i was like 7 years old. eventually it just weighs down on you and takes over everything 

iâ€™m thinking iâ€™m done. i have a therapy appt with a new therapist next week but honestly i canâ€™t wait any longer. iâ€™m done. iâ€™m tired.
