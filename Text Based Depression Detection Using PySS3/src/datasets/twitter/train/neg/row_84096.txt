Volunteers: why?I was just wondering what are the motives/reasons the redditors that volunteer help in this subreddit have to do so. I believe it is noble of you to offer your help and support, but at the same time am curious why. I would like to hear your opinions on suicide and what drives you to answering your fellow redditor's SW posts.
