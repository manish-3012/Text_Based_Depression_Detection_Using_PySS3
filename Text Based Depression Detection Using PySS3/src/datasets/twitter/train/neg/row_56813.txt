I think I need to stop prolonging the inevitable.Hey people. It's 2AM here and my brain is fogged as fuck, so I'll give a basic overview of how shitty things are and sorry if this is a mess.

I'm a 24 year old male from the United Kingdom. I've always been a socially inept loser who can only blend into social groups by playing a court jester style character. I'm unemployed, live with my Mum, have no skills, low intelligence, no friends, no real interests and just generally feel like I don't have any kind of belonging in this world, nor do I identify with any aspect of it. This world is a fucking horrible place, built with suffering and oppression of the weak into its inherent nature. I don't really want to spend another 50 years carving out an existence on this planet when it's pretty obvious I am a complete genetic dead end and am not equipped to handle life. 

I've had nothing but bad luck from the beginning, to top it all off, this year I've developed a condition called Peyronie's which has bent and shrunken my previously decent sized dick and I am being kept up every night from the pain. I honestly hope I can just develop cancer, I'm sick of this shit, I just want to die but am too weak to do it myself. I've tried everything, SSRIs, therapy, self help, none of it has helped. I just think I'm avoiding the inevitable and I need to find a way to do it that isn't going to leave too much of a mess and isn't going to leave me with any opportunities to wuss out.
