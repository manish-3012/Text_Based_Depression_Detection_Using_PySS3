I want to drop out of college than kill myselfI am falling really behind in college and my treatment for my depression is not working. My medication is not making me feel normal and actually makes me feel worse at times. I am falling behind in college because of all the appointments and days of feeling like crap from the medication. I really just want to kill my self, my life isn't worth living even if I do go through with my treatment. My professors were able to give me extensions, but I have so much work that I am actually getting more assignments than I can catch up on. I'm a retarded piece of shit who doesn't deserve to live.
