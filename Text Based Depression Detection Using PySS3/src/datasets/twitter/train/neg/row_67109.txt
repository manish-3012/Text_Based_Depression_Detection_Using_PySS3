The one thing that I crave the most is the thing I don't ever think I can haveSo, I'm mentally broken. Scarring from past relationships mixed with a soup of mental illness has left me pretty numb to just about anything. I've tried dating people to see if I could feel anything, and it just comes up blank. I've recently met someone who, despite how much I hate it, has actually made me feel something. And it was amazing for a whopping 5 seconds. Then the brain kicked in, all the paranoia, all the sadness, all the insecurity, all at once. I try to keep a leash on it, but sometimes it goes haywire. But they're just like me, going through a point of their life that is extremely reminiscient of the scars I've experienced, and as a result they're not emotionally available. I understand it, I don't blame them at all. But to think that for the first time in years I've actually felt something, I feel like I'm trying to cling to it, an idea that probably will never come to full fruition. I don't want a life like this, with the idea that this could continue to happen, over and over, with the rollercoaster of feeling/numbness. Old thoughts are coming back, and I may take the out this time.
