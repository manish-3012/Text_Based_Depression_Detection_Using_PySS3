story again and the emotions in me seem to be running permanently on empty now that it even gets insulted by people who think their lives are worst than mine.been through alot since i was a kid and up to now exactly, beatings, mental abuse, social abuse, psychological abuse... majority of which were really unjustified and questionable that had me made into the quiet pacifist type of a person, since i love writing reading and playing music (instruments) mainly things that interest me i do to the fullest extent, but it left people particularly counselors with the wrong impression, i got wrongfully diagnosed with being a sociopath and a psychopath since they found what i wrote was completely disturbing my hobbies too weird and different and my actions of being way too quiet be too creepy...i was forced to change, my being sociable with friends and my writings and research that i only reserve to myself that i primarily use to improve myself led them to believe that i was purely a psychopath so i got isolated, more like quarantined when i come to think of it... which led to even more problems, got into a bad motorcycle accident and went through alot of beatings and tons of abuse, i got serious trust issues and never go out now, what is worst is that everything i throw at myself to improve my life like getting hobbies gets either socially abused or just be used for jokes or towards people particularly towards the women i highly admired, such bad jokes and humiliations are started majority by my friends and continued on by my family leading me to be isolated even more that its not even funny. 

nearly every solution and fix that i put out gets shot down telling me that its not good enough for their standards which led me to having really horrible trust issues with people now because some of them are being too manipulative particularly towards me. 

and in the absolute mess of things the majority of the people who put me in this position either wants me to go back or forces me to go back TO MAKE THINGS RIGHT by me and even being warned that i'm damaging myself past the repair point risking permanent ruin, when i know i'm already done for and did everything i could. 
and that i am way too emotionally traumatized to be fixed. 

disappointed at the fact that it took them 7 years to find out that what they were doing were wrong.
