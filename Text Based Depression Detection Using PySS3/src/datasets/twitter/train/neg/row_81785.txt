Can't remember the last time I felt alright and not suicidalI've been in this constant battle with depression since a long time. It all started from my childhood as my family were broken, I used to live with my mother who had severe paranoia in this period of time because of my abusive father and I was bullied a lot
I survived a lot of horrible events but they didn't make me stronger they made me a freak. I've always struggled with making friends and having romantic partners sometimes I envy those who has a normal social life and decent social skills because I can't be like them. I feel so worthless and I feel my life isn't worth trying anymore I've stopped getting help from my psychologist because of that, I'll never be good as I want and my life will never be good as I want no matter how hard i try. I've nothing to live for tbh, I've no dreams or ambitions in this life  I always feel like I'm better off dead and killing myself is the best way to get out of this hell but i'm scared of attempting again. I just want an end for this suffering, pain and loneliness
