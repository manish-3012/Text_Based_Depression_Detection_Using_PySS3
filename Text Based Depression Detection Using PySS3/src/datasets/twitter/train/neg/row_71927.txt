every day it gets worstabout a month and a half ago. my girlfriend of a year and a half left me and moved onto her ex in less than a week. everyday i feel so empty. everyday these suicidal ideations get worst. iâ€™ve tried twice but it didnâ€™t work (obviously lmao) iâ€™ve been having suicidal thoughts since i was like 13 and here i am, turning 18 next week, and theyâ€™re still here. everyday i go from being mad about the situation to depressed about it and thatâ€™s usually when i want to kill myself. iâ€™ve thought about so many different ways to kill myself but every single one of them has something about it that i canâ€™t do. like i want to hang myself but nothing in my room can support my weight. i want to OD but i have nothing to OD on. i just want this empty feeling to go away. iâ€™m sick of life.
