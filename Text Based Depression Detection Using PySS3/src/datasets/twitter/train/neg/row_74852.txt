I'll never be normal...I just want to end itI have dyspraxia (spatial-learning delay disorder). It makes really simple tasks like giving directions or driving really hard. It also makes me really clumsy: I have an awkward gait and bump into things/knock things over all the time. My handwriting is also bad. The most frustrating thing is that I can't fix any of it; no matter how hard I try, I will always be the clumsy, awkward one.

I feel like I'm always the "odd girl" or the butt of everyone's jokes. Even people who like me still mention my clumsiness in an endearing context: "Oh catcherinthesly is just so smart and stupid at the same time. She's so unique." I don't want to be unique. I want to be a normal person who can handle normal, everyday situations. 

Having this disorder has made my life really hard, and has caused me to be a burden on everyone around me because I constantly need help with basic things. I just want to end my life. I think about it every day.
