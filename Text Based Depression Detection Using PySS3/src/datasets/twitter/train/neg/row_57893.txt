i just don't see the point anymoreno love from the family, no real love anymore. just daily explosive arguments. friends are gone. "nobody actually cares" i keep thinking. i keep thinking how alone i am. i keep thinking how fucking easy it would be to get rid of myself and be free of this immense and seemingly never-ending bullshit pain. i started hitting the walls in my room, then stabbing them, breaking my hands on them. now i'm hitting myself. i know it's only a matter of time until something pushes me over the edge and i give in. i just need freedom. this is killing me
