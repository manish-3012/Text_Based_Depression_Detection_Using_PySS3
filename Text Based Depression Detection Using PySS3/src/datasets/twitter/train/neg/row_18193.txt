Friend is on the phone right now and talking about killing herself, don't know what to doI've been in this situation a couple of times with different friends and I've some how helped them through but I'm just not sure what to say this time. She says that she can't talk to people about it because she doesn't want to be seen as weak (cried at her grandfathers funeral and her grandma still kind of makes fun of her for it). She is drunk and seriously considering killing herself tonight or in the very near future. Right now I'm mostly just trying to listen and trying to let her know that I understand what she's going through (dealt with depression the last 5 years of my life). If anyone has any advice whatsoever I would really appreciate this (and if there is a better subreddit to post this in please let me know)
