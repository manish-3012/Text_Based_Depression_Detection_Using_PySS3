Why do you think life is worthless?I am as inclined to accept this is not the right place to write this as to think there is no better place to find people who experience some emotions and have ideas that tempt them to commit suicide. Even though I do not consider myself suicidal and happy in comparison with the world I live in, described in many ways, one of the most relevant of which reads "A quick test of the assertion that pleasure outweighs pain in this world, or that they are at any rate balanced, would be to compare the feelings of an animal engaged in another animal with those of the animal being eaten, I am always interested in the question of why people feel suicidal or at least suffer from constant depression, relatively good but still bad, in a half-sentimental half-scientific manner. I occasionally read the posts here and most people talk about the painful reality or the meaningless universe, however these answers do not satisfy me, pushing me further to look for some other answers.

Yes pain is not the answer since I could show you counless ascetic groups in history that never questioned even once whether life is worth living or not.

But again, why in the face of the "objective meaninglessness" of the universe induce people to think nothing matters at all,  neglect the conspicuous prospect that subjective values can be created so that the universe may be rendered temporarily meaningful, meaningless as it seems from a distance, from an objective view. In other words, why do you think inevitable suffering necessarily justifies suicide, or objective meaninglessness defies subjective meaningfulness? I would like to understand why
