If I don't feel socially and romantically validated by the end of this year, I'm going to either jump from my 4th-floor apartment window, stab myself to death, hang myself, or just overdose on sleeping pills.Enough is enough. I've tried fitting in as 19-year old with aspergers since i was 13. For 7 years I've been anxious about being good enough, fitting in, having friends, being popular and finding a girlfriend. I destroyed my sense of self-worth and identity and became a persona I now hate and never wish to grow back into. I've only recently started to discover who i am. Even before that, my sucess in attending a normal elementary school and somewhat functioning with the other kids made people validate me for "fitting in" with the normal kids. Because of that I based and still base my value as a person off of that. 

I want to be confident. I want to be sucessful and not be anxious all the time. I wanna go to parties with other non-social outcasts, get drunk, have a girl find me hot and attractive and have a sweet, caring girlfiriend who loves me, finds me funny, one I can be nice to, make her laugh, take her out to places, fall asleep on the couch watching movies together. 

But I'm unatheletic, short for my country (im 5'9, the average height for guys is 6'0), have a high-pitched voice and have a plain, if somewhat ugly face. No girl has ever said i looked hot. Ive never had a gf. 

I wanna be normal. And DON'T tell me to wait "until someone comes along". When is that? 5 years?? No way Im sticking around for that long, fuck that. I've suffered enough. I'm not gonna go through more ardeous self-improvement or shit like that. I'd rather die. 

My only goal in life is to take a few of my other suicidal friends with me, because they are in the same position as me. There is no hope for people like us. 

I''ve lived long enough for my parents' and other people's hopes and expectations for me.
