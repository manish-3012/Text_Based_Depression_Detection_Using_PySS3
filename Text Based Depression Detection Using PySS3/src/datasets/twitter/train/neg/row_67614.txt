Just existing, I guess.No idea why I'm still alive. Why I haven't come up with a plan to make up for those broken promises and finally Follow him already.

I'm hoping I get hospitalized soon. If I keep overexercising on an empty stomach, it'll hopefully be sooner rather than later.

I'm so numb. I have a wonderful, loving boyfriend, but I can't - won't, don't want to - resist the self-destruction.

I relapsed on purpose. I *want* to give in. I want to see him again. But that can only happen after The End.

I'm lost without him. We were supposed to die together, and he left without me. What do I do now?

Habit is keeping me alive. Go to work, boyfriend's making dinner so I guess eat, go to bed. I've passed a month or two that way. Maybe longer. I have no idea, my brain still thinks it's June. It's like it all came to a standstill with his Death.
