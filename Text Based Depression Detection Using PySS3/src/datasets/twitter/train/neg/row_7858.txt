I don't even want to try to make it through life anymore.I can't even be bothered to properly write this down.
I'm just... I'm done.
I'm not good at anything, I'm a fucking idiot.
Done.
I'm done. This is it, I think.
I really want to die now. I'm really exhausted of life.
I can't be motivated to get up in the morning or to sleep at night. 
I feel like I'm just floating through life.
