I'm losing every reason to live.5 months ago, my brother died. 2 months ago, my closest friends stopped talking to me. 2 weeks ago, my dad died. Tonight my girlfriend broke up with me. I have nothing but my mom, my cats, and my job.

I'm loosely planning dropping off the cats back off at the shelter, finding the highest building near me, and just taking the plunge. I had true happiness, but it was so fleeting I could barely even savor it. And now I feel I'll never really be happy again. And if I am, I'll immediately break into a panic that I'm going to lose it all.

Last couple years were my previous toxic relationship and the aftermath of that. Years before that were depression and loneliness in community college. Years before that were depression and loneliness in high school. There's no fucking point. I want my pain to end and life has made it abundantly clear it won't end while I'm alive.
