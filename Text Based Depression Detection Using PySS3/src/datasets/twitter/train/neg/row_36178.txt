My life is my own responsibility, and I just want to throw it away. Stop telling me I canâ€™t.Iâ€™m tired of people being around me who say they care. They tell me that life is so precious, but it only because we live. Iâ€™m sick of hearing constant half-assed reminders of why I should live from people who only talk to me when they need to use me. I tell people of all of my self harm and sabotage and the most I get from anyone is â€œyou shouldnâ€™t do thatâ€. Nothing else. I openly reject any help given to me, and now people are starting to finally see me for the trash I am and are starting to avoid me. Iâ€™ve made myself into a bitter and jaded douchebag who wants nothing good for anyone in the world, not even for myself. No one, especially myself, will do anything good for my well being, and I will eventually break. Itâ€™s already started. I just need to keep on this path and my suicide will come so easily. I promised myself I would die by my own hands, and it will happen soon.
