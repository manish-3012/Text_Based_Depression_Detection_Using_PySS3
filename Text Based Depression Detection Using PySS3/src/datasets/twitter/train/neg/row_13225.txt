Phantasmigorical lifeI don't feel it in the morning, or when I'm alone.  I've had some hard life times as the rest of these fools, but have been blessed with people around me that make the day.  We've gone from penny lunches to beach service sammiches. 

But every single day for the past thirteen years I've had a desire, and a plan to just let it all go.

The worst part is when I'm enjoying life is the time I take a big huff, and find a giant liquor bottle, or a sharp knife... and tell myself "you've had a good run".

I don't want to be a burden anymore...
