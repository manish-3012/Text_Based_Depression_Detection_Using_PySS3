Never going to workI never liked working but I do enjoy helping people. But not the type of help that you have to do good just help because they want to their thing to be done faster with a friend. 
I hate customer service work every other person is so self serving it's like why am I there. I don't like feeling like my help is bad. I don't like it when my bosses tell me I should do better when I can only do as good as my brain is capable of. It tool me 2 years to memorize the menu at my old job and after I finally did everything got so much harder. My boss made me train people and work and do it fast. I'm not even able to learn fast and he doesn't care. Nobody wants to give me a good job that I can do. Everyone just wants to hand me some other job that nobody else wants because they think he's desperate. But I'm not.
I would rather die. I hate working now. I'll steal before i earn and I will take what I need to live but I won't work.  Never again
