Why am I even alive?Iâ€™ve had suicidal thoughts for years. Ever since I first thought about taking myself out, I always have ever since. Sure there have been times where everything is great and I actually tell myself that Iâ€™m glad I didnâ€™t go through with it. But it always comes back... the thoughts *always* come back and right now I donâ€™t see them going anywhere anytime soon and I could just use some support. I feel like I should be grateful for everything I have, which I most certainly am, and I feel like an asshole saying that I would trade it for other things that I would personally prefer. But not having those things on top of being treated like shit makes me feel like shit.

I would give anything in the world to just start over, or to have a personality I actually like, because I do not really like who I am. I never have. As people we constantly try to re-invent ourselves so I know this may be kind of normal, but I wish I didnâ€™t feel so shitty. Iâ€™m making very poor decisions just to feel immediate gratification as a result. Iâ€™ve given up and I just do not care anymore, Iâ€™ll do whatever it takes just to feel happy and stay away from the things that make me upset in any way. Which I believe is the right thing to do, but Iâ€™m going lengths I really shouldnâ€™t be to do so.

Bottom line, I just think that maybe starting over wouldnâ€™t even be a good idea. Maybe it would just be better if I didnâ€™t exist.
