38/m/no purpose in lifeHaving trouble gathering my thoughts to type this right for spelling and grammar Nazis, I been so jittery today its unreal...so expect a near incoherent rave...

I have no one that cares for me and no one that wants me to care for them. My life is empty and meaningless, all I have to do is convince myself of how meaningless it is to get over that hump.

Because I love life and being alive its the people I hate, just one person to be close to is all I've asked for and its too much

Those thoughts keep running through my head, thought I had much more to type but that sums it up. Then come the variables, the what ifs; the yea buts...im full of em and difficult to reach but I'm here on a subreddit I've considered pathetic and only for people crying out for help...asking for help...
