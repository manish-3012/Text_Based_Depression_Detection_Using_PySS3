Why can't I be better?So uh... First time poster, here... I don't really know the protocol for this type of thing, as I'm usually just an anonymous, silent lurker on other topics. But... Been going through some pretty serious marriage troubles... Both of us are mentally ill, we have a young son... I'm 29/M, she's 30/F... Met online almost 12 years ago on World of Warcaft, she's from the good ol' US of A, I'm from the Great White North... This has been one of the worst periods of time in my life. I've always had passive suicidal thoughts. Like... A lot of them. Some days it would be almost constant. Self-degredation and shit. Nobody would miss me, etc. Actually tried killing myself when I was 16. I was on "black-box" anti-depressants, and my new psychiatrist thought it would be a great idea for my to try sleeping pills to help with my insomnia. Luckily they weren't true sleeping pills, 'cause I took about all 20 of them one night... Just 'cause. No reason, really. Was just watching Monday Night RAW, Cena was doin' some Nexus shit, and suddenly I think; "Hey, it's late, supposed to take the pills. Let's take all of them!" And all it did was put me in to a 3-day semi-coma. Woke up a few times and typed gibberish to people on MSN. Told my mother while laughing my ASS off that I want to die. Turns out those pills were basically just weed pills.   


But now, I have a reason. The thoughts aren't so passive any more. I'm almost at the point where I want to take action. The only reasons I don't are because I still have hope we can resolve our marriage issues, and I don't want my son to go through life saying his father killed himself.  So, I was told to write down my feelings. It would help with the pain. It does, a little bit. This is what I wrote on the 2nd day after she left;

"I am in pain. She's not here any more. She left, deciding that a shelter would be a safer place for her to stay, than with me and our son. I don't know if James really understands what's going on. He smiles at me and sticks his thumb up while playing games or watching his shows, as if there's nothing wrong. I can barely look at him. But all I want to do is hug him and let him know that everything is alright. This pain is unimaginable. I want it to stop. I don't know how to make it stop without spreading it to everyone else. I want to hurt her. I want her to come home, and we can make everything better again. We could be happy. I could be who I was supposed to be. Who I failed to be. I cried so much yesterday that by bed time, despite sobbing and still crying, no more tears would come. I feel like I'm drowning in them. Mine, hers, James... I've hurt them both. I wasn't the husband I should have been. I wasn't the father I should have been. I don't want to die, I just want her to come back. I need her Light. She is my life line. I don't want anyone else... I've never been with anybody else... But she doesn't believe me... Doesn't trust me. I don't know if this is temporary or permanent. I don't know if she just needs time. Time to heal. Time for quiet. I don't want this to be permanent. I know we aren't perfect. We both have our issues. Many issues. I did more in 2 hours yesterday, finding phone numbers, looking for councillors and lawyers and anything to help her stay, anything to help the pets, than I've done in the last 10 years of our relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

I fucked up during her pregnancy. She has every reason to believe that I cheated on her. I was neglectful. I barely spoke with her. And when I did, it wasn't... What I should have been saying. I asked her if she would be okay if I murdered people and stole their money, to help us get by. She said she would still love me. For some incredibly stupid reason, I asked if it would be okay if I gave oral sex to a woman in exchange for a ride home from work, to avoid a 45 minute walk at 1:30am. I know I shouldn't have. I knew it the moment the words escaped my lips. We only had sex a few times while she was pregnant, and even then I wasn't as I should have been. I was going to be late for work, but I had finished, so I asked my pregnant wife if she could finish herself. I knew she was paranoid, she has Disassociative Identity Disorder, anxiety, depression, possibly Bi-polar disorder. I knew all of this, and I still asked her those questions. I was scared. I was terrified. We had a child on the way, and all I could do was look at a computer screen, work, and sleep. I went to almost all of the appointments, the parenting classes, everything. My body was there. I thought that was enough. But my spirit was in a screen. I should have been holding her hand. Instead I held my computer mouse. I should've been hugging her. Instead I was practically ignoring her. Pretending it didn't exist. Nothing was going on. I detached myself from everything during her pregnancy. I fucked up.

&amp;#x200B;

I have only had physical relations with one person in my entire adult life. But I've cheated on her in the past, through ERP (sexting, basically) with other women, even though I could've been ERPing with her. We could've been making love. Instead I was talking to other people. This was very early in our physical relationship, and even then I was fucking up. I knew I was fucking up. I should've been able to stop myself. To tell myself that what I was doing was wrong. I knew it was, but I didn't. I cheated on her spiritually - to an extent - while she was pregnant. I was looking at some of the women I was working with, when I should've been looking at her. I knew she was emotionally damaged when we met online. I wanted to help her. I wanted her to feel as beautiful and as wanted as she deserved. I think I did more for her during our year and a half of online relationship than I have in our ten years in person. And even then, my online persona was almost as fucked up. Talking to multiple women, ERPing, convincing them to show me themselves naked online. Pitting them against eachother. Because I wanted attention. I wanted to feel like people actually wanted to be with me. It's stupid, I know. 

&amp;#x200B;

But I want her back. She called the cops and said I abused her. They didn't find anything, and she was very vague when talking to them, but I don't think she lied. I've put hands on her. I've never hit her, but I might as well have. I wanted to exert my control. I wanted her to stop questioning my fidelity, because even though I've never actually had sex with someone else, it doesn't change the fact that I did cheat. Spiritually and mentally. I WANTED to cheat, physically. But I couldn't. The only instance that I can recall actually intentionally flirting with someone besides her, was while she was pregnant, I was working, and a girl and I were closing. I don't remember what I said, how I said it. All I remember is hearing the girl say; "Haenous\_Acts, you're married." and that was it. That's the closest I've come to making my cheating physical. 

&amp;#x200B;

But even now, up to a few days ago, I was still fantasizing. I still think of someone, the woman that my wife thinks I DID fuck. I wanted to. I even went to her house, her boyfriend was there, and that woman sat on the floor at MY feet pouring ME drinks. I even re-added her to Facebook shortly after my wife left. I don't actually want to be with the other woman. I haven't even responded to her message saying "What's up". I thought that I could try and fill the hole right away, but I can't. My wife is gone, but she is all I want. I can't even imagine other women right now. I try, and all I see is my wife. My Love. My life. My Light. 

&amp;#x200B;

If this is temporary, I will do everything I can to make sure I don't make the same mistakes. She will never doubt my affection or my love for her. I will be the best version of myself that I can be. For her. But if this is permanent... I dug my own grave. I'll have to suffer with that until the end of my life. I just wish I hadn't made her suffer. 

&amp;#x200B;

If I could go back in time, there are several instances that I would've liked to kick my own ass. Redirect myself. Realign myself. I would go back to a few months after we met. I had seen her body. Everything. She had seen my face. But she was still technically with another guy in an open relationship... I couldn't have her the way I wanted, so I tried getting every other girl to be with me until then. I would tell myself to just be patient, you don't need anyone but her, and she will eventually be only yours. A few months later, her and the other guy officially broke up. I would've told myself to drop all the other girls right away. Forget them, because your Empress, your Goddess, is finally yours and yours alone. You don't need any online sluts. You had her. I would go back to the day we finally met in person. I was fresh out of the Carnival, having worked my first and only season. I would've told myself what to expect. That she was there. Instead, my mom brings me to a coffee shop, and sitting at a table right by the counter are my wife and her mother... And I don't notice. I just walk to the counter and order tea. Like a fucking moron. I think she forgave me for that. Seeing someone on camera and seeing them in person really are two different things. That night, she practically glowed. Neither the sun nor moon could compare with her radiance. That night was the night of my first real kiss. My first hug with someone who loved me that wasn't family. She was there to stay, at least for a few weeks. She showed me her rats, Alethra and Cinder. She let me name them when I was still in the carnival. Maybe I wouldn't change anything about that night. In a way, it was perfect. 

&amp;#x200B;

I would go back to our first apartment together on the third floor. I would kick myself in the ass and tell myself to get out of the screen, and help my wife with her immigration. I would tell myself to stop trying to ERP with anyone else besides her. I would stop myself from thinking that sharing an apartment with the other dude was a good idea. It was a terrible idea. Her engagement ring was stolen. So much was stolen from her... And I tried to pretend like nothing happened. 

&amp;#x200B;

I would go back to when we had had enough of the bullshit there, and were staying with my Uncle. I would've made us stay there, but instead we went to my brother's. Things didn't go well, there. Fighting with my brother, his wife, and even with my wife... They tried to defend her from my fuckups. They tried to give us the right kick in the ass. Instead, it just made me want to leave there with my wife. I don't think I ever even asked her if it was OK that we didn't go back. I had already fucked up so many times by this point, and it was only like year two or three. But one of the happiest times I had with her, as strange as it may seem, was when we were basically homeless and staying at a hotel. I had actually tried praying to God to help us out of there - which is funny because I'm a Satanist and she's a Witch, and she didn't judge me for it. In reality, it was my mother that helped get us out of there and in to our apartment. We didn't fight very often. We had been making some progress on her immigration, little by little. We had a regular friend who would visit us, or we would visit. I was still absolutely obsessed with screens... But we were playing games together. We were still playing World of Warcaft. I had by then stopped trying to ERP with every 'toon with a hole between their legs. At least, I think I did. I had a job, though the commute was draining us dry. And again, I was the one who made the decision that we should leave that apartment. Mom had offered us her second bedroom, she was rarely there, so it was like having a really nice apartment we had never had before. But again, I don't think I asked if it was what she wanted. She just said she would go anywhere with me. 

&amp;#x200B;

In the new apartment, we still didn't argue much. I think we were generally happy. Still gaming together, watching anime and other stuff together. Just enjoying eachother's company. I think the sex in that apartment had probably been the most intense and passionate we had had. It even resulted in our son, a child concieved with love. My family was less than supportive of the idea of us having a child. They didn't think we were ready. They didn't approve. In many ways, they were right. But my wife stepped up. She did EVERYTHING. She was pregnant, but she still cooked and cleaned and took care of me. And while she was doing her absolute best, I seemed to do everything I could to destroy what we had built together. What she had built for us. All I did was drop the ball, again and again. We were fighting more. I could've blamed her hormones, but that wasn't it. It was my fault. I wasn't doing what I was supposed to do. I wasn't who I should have been. I couldn't seem to step up. My Uncle saw this, he tried talking sense in to me, and I just nodded and let it pass in one ear and out the other. I went to the classes. I only missed one or two due to work, I tried to make sure she never went alone, at least. But it was like I was just going through the motions. I was still detached. She knew it, but she still hung on to me. She knew I could be better. She was waiting for it. But it never seemed to come. 

&amp;#x200B;

And then our son was born. I still remember our time in the hospital, arriving before 7AM, my mother meeting us there. I think that day, I had finally woken up a bit. I was holding her hand. I was consoling. I assisted with the birth process. I held our son, and it felt like something sparked in me. She was resting in the hospital bed that night, our room was dark, I had just read about the Paris attack on Facebook... I was holding my son again, and decided to read to him stuff from the laptop, about Queen Elizabeth. I don't think I read the whole thing to him... All the while my wife was resting. I don't know if she was asleep, or just starring at the ceiling, listening to us. I don't know if she was happy. But for some reason, after the first few weeks, that spark that had been started seemed to go back out. I honestly don't know why. Maybe the demons in my head had gotten too loud, again. I think I did pretty well during the first week. I think I was who I was supposed to be. And then I just... Wasn't. Back to the screens. Back to work. Always ready to change a diaper, and yet I couldn't look at or even hug my wife. The mother of my child. She was practically alone. Our fights had gotten louder and more venomous. They shouldn't have happened at all. She was scared and I... Just didn't seem to care. I knew I loved her. I knew I loved my son. I had thoughts of abandoning them, of just leaving... I have fucked up SO MUCH... But at least I never did that. Small comforts, right? 

&amp;#x200B;

For the first year of living in our apartment, it was like I wasn't there... Work, play video games, sleep. Work, play video games, sleep. And it's just been like that... Until we had had another fight. She wanted me to quit my job, so I could stop being an asshole. So she wouldn't have to worry about my cheating on her. So I did. I quit that minute, sent a text, and I was done. It was good again, for a few days. Once more, I think I woke back up... Only to just go to sleep and video games. Sleep and video games. I wasn't even gaming with her. Not as much as I could have. She was trying more and more games for me, trying to reconnect... It worked, some times... But more often than not, I was just... Gone. 

&amp;#x200B;

And it's all lead to this. This pain that I feel now is probably only a fraction of what I've made her feel in the last ten years. Twelve years. I don't know how she did it. I don't know how she held on to me, through all of it. And she seems to have finally let go... And now I... I don't know. I don't know if I can make it. I never thought... This was never supposed to happen. Why couldn't I just be right? Why couldn't I be what I promised? Now she's gone and I... I feel more lost than I've ever been. The cracks are deepening. The demons never stop. I have to be strong for my son. He needs me... But all I want is my wife. I want to be what I was supposed to be, for her. I want to do everything I should have done. 

&amp;#x200B;

If this is permanent, that will never happen. I don't know if I'll recover. I don't know if I WANT to recover. If I could find the damn thing, I would rip the charity agreement she made for us in to shreds, because she is all I want. I could give up video games, smoking, weed... I could give up TV and netflix. Christ, I could even give up porn, if it only meant she would come home. With her gone, I can't do any of that anyways. I can't distract myself from this pain, so I can't focus on games or TV. I'm afraid of what will happen if I smoke weed like this. I haven't had 'release' since like 20 minutes before she left us. She was talking to the police, and I was jacking off in the other room to stupid hentai. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's only been a few days... And I... I can't imagine going the rest of my life like this. Knowing that I fucked up everything I ever wanted. Since I was barely a teenager, I wanted to be a good husband and a good father. My teenage self would probably murder me if he knew what I've done... Christ, I want to murder me for what I've done. But all that would accomplish is to spread my pain tenfold to everybody I care about. I told my mother-in-law I'm not a period. I told my mother that I wouldn't look for permanent solutions to temporary problems. I don't know if I can fix things between me and my wife... But it's all I want to do. 

&amp;#x200B;

This isn't a suicide note. This isn't me saying I'll kill myself if we can't get back together. If I somehow convinced you to read this, and you actually made it this far, you can still leave. I wont blame you. I know this is my fault. I'm not going to kill myself because you leave, even though I would probably like to. I was told to write down my feelings, and I've done it. I hope you read this. You said you still cared deeply for me... I just hope I can rekindle that in to love, again. Because I love you more than I love life. You are life, for me. I don't want anybody else. And I realise now that I've never wanted anybody else. I don't want you back for the amazing tea, or the awesome sex. I don't want you back because I think it would be best for James. I want you back because I love you. I love only you. And I think I can finally be what I should have been all this time. I think I can finally get you - get us - the help we need. I'm not afraid of the phone, anymore. I'm not afraid of people, any more. The only thing I'm afraid of is that I'll never get to make up for my mistakes. The only thing I'm afraid of is that I have lost you forever, that I'll never get to wake up and see your smiling face. I'll never get to hold your hand. Hug you tightly. Kiss you.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to pressure her in to thinking she MUST be with me. She is beautiful. She is easily one of the most intelligent people I know. She is Darkness, and she could have anybody she wanted. She is darkness, but she is my Light. I will live the rest of my life in darkness, if I must. Even if she doesn't want to be with me ever again... I just want her to be happy. If she can't be happy with me, then I hope she can find somebody she CAN be happy with..."

Bit of a read, right? Wrote a little more again, today;

"I am still in so much pain... I still can't believe it hurts so much. I've been trying to call people that could possibly help, councillors and the like. I look for their numbers and read what they're about online, and I start breaking down again. I try to call, and I start breaking down. James asks if I'm crying. I try to say I'm fine, but he knows. He walks over to me and tells me he's going to give me a hug, hugs me, and then goes back to what he was doing. I think he's worried that mommy might never come home. He asked about her, today. It almost seems like it's the first time he's noticed she's not always here, anymore. He thinks she's with her "friends" and making him a new blanket. She IS making him a new blanket, but she's at the abuse prevention shelter. Because of me. I know it's because of me. She told me that she wants to get her head right... I should've been trying to help her, not ignoring her or punishing her for daring to interrupt my video games. I used to yell at James almost once a day, sometimes more, just for being a kid. Playing, laughing, yelling, making sound effects, running around... Things I would get yelled at for as a kid. I never understood why I would get yelled at for it... I don't want him to have to go through that. I want to be better than my parents. They weren't terrible, but they certainly had their demons. Demons I inherited. I don't want to be like this. I don't want to be in pain. I don't want to wake up every day without her... Knowing I failed her... I failed my son. It's like there's screaming in my head. It doesn't stop. I keep reliving every bad thing I've done over the last nearly six years. From the moment we learned she was pregnant. Hell, I couldn't even react properly to that. I don't know if she remembers, but I'm pretty sure we kinda did a double-take type thing. She showed me the test, and my heart just dropped. Fear. Just... Fear. I was motionless. I couldn't respond. But she was happy about it. She saw my fear, and kind of... Recoiled a little. I immediately tried to correct it. Something like "Let's try that again..." She told me the news again, I smiled, hugged her, said that was awesome - or something along those lines. In her own words; we were sunshine and rainbows for the five+ years we were together before she got pregnant. It's fucked up. I need help but... I think I need help asking for help. And I don't know what to do. Writing hasn't helped this time. It hasn't stopped the tears. I just don't know what to do..."

That was a bit shorter, at least. After it all, I'm feeling a bit better. Actually, reading some of the other posts on here helped me a bit too. I don't really know why I felt the need to share this with complete strangers. I don't know if I'm just a fucking attention whore, or if I'm trying to reach out for support. Maybe I'm seeking judgement. I used to be afraid of going out in public because it felt like everyone was constantly starring and judging me based on my weight. I'm a large individual. Not so large that I belong on TV, mind you. But certainly obese. I think part of me wants to be judged. Part of me wants someone to analyze my mind and say; "Yeah, you should probably kill yourself. You're toxic, unlikely to change, and a terrible influence on those who look up to you." Maybe I'm hoping that by sharring this, it might help someone else going through an incredibly tough time. I don't know how or why it could, but it is what it is. All I know is that there is a woman out there who embodies everything I've ever wanted. She gave me everything she could. And over 10 years, I became every abusive Ex my mom had. I became my own father. I basically became exactly like my wife's previous Ex. I can safely say I was better than her first boyfriend, but when comparing garbage to shit, in the end, it's still just garbage and shit.
