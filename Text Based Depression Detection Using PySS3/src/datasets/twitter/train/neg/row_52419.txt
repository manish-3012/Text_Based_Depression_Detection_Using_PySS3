just wanna vent even if no one sees or cares idk what else to doi have been really depressed for over a year now and struggled with depression when I was younger. I got bullied for being gay and got told to kill myself etc etc. Iâ€™ve always been extremely shy and had trouble making friends. I didnâ€™t know why I was so scared till I started to realize I have social anxiety. Over a year ago one of my friends left public high school to do online school and I thought it seemed so fun so I did too. But holy fuck am i miserable. I do the same shit every single day so many of my old hobbies i canâ€™t do for more then five minutes cause I just get mentally tired and donâ€™t want to do anything. I never had a lot of friends but online school has seperated me even more and I now have like only two-three friends. My old best friend ran from home to live with a drug dealer and we act like things are okay. But they really arenâ€™t and I feel like I donâ€™t know who she is anymore sheâ€™s like a stranger to me. Iâ€™ve known her for over ten years and when she met this guy she acted like i didnâ€™t exsist and when i stopped trying I became the bad person. Iâ€™ve never had a job because Iâ€™m too scared of talking to people all day or messing up at work. I donâ€™t have my license and Iâ€™m 18 because Iâ€™m too scared due to being in multiple car accidents with friends driving and im terrified iâ€™m going to accidentally hit someone or an animal. Iâ€™ve tried multiple medications for anxiety and they havenâ€™t helped at all and I canâ€™t and donâ€™t want any benzodiazepines because I used to abuse them and Iâ€™m scared I wouldnâ€™t be able to control myself. Iâ€™m on prozac currently and its been the most helpful so far but its also very minimal. I was in a relationship for over a year with an amazing guy and he just broke it off a few days ago. Itâ€™s really weird because there was no particular reason why, we weâ€™re a healthy couple and I canâ€™t make myself feel better by saying hes shitty bc he was really great and idk. He was one of the only people that I knew truly cared for me and loved me. Itâ€™s crazy just a week ago we were best friends and wanted to spend every minute together and now suddenly were strangers. I think about death often and Iâ€™ve lost some pets this year and I sometimes with I wasnâ€™t so scared and would just do it already. I feel bad for my family and people blaming themselves but I am so sick of living like this. Iâ€™ve tried to tell my friend but he doesnâ€™t seem like he takes it seriously itâ€™s like im telling a joke or something. And after this breakup happened I relpased on drugs and have been doing lots of adderall cause itâ€™s the only
thing exciting anymore. Iâ€™m so behind in my school work from being so sad and just not having motivation and I know I should just do it and try and get caught up but itâ€™s so overwhelming and so much work I have less then a month left to do around 2-3months work of work per class and Iâ€™m in 7 classes . I feel like itâ€™s my fault for all of this and I shouldnâ€™t be complaining but I just donâ€™t know a lot of the times I donâ€™t even know why Iâ€™m sad I just will randomly start thinking about suicide and how Iâ€™d do it and a way for people not to see me when Iâ€™m dead. I have this medical condition where I can get really nauseated at anytime of day no matter whatâ€™s happening. That makes me even more nervous about getting a job and living a real life I always think about if I were to get nauseated and vomit during an interview or a meeting or talking to a customer. And having social anxiety just makes the nausea worse. I try to take things for anxiety like natural supplements and i got prescribed gabappentin and propanol and I always end up taking way more then Iâ€™m supposed to just because I donâ€™t care and feeling just a little euphoria or rush from a drug is better then continuing to be stuck in this loop. I have to graduate this year if I even get ahead Iâ€™m terrified because I have to go to a real school and itâ€™s so confusing. I fucking hate doing the same thing everyday and feeling like im in reruns of a tv show but at the same time I donâ€™t have to deal with strangers but then I get lonely and even when I do attempt to hang out with new people Iâ€™m extremely quiet and awkward and basically donâ€™t talk the whole time. Idk if anyone at all will read this and if so Iâ€™m sorry itâ€™s just this one confusing thick wall of text. I just have no idea what to do with myself anymore and I feel like everyday life just gets worse and worse. I donâ€™t know how much longer I can deal with it.
