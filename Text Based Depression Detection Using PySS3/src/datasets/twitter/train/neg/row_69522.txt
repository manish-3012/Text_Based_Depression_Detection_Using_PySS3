I'm a mentally ill straight/white/male with no money.Absolutely everyone hates me, the left, the right, the center, the nazis, the commies, the jews, the muslims, the christians, men, women, lgbt. Every race/gender/sexuality, every religion, every ideology. I see no reason to keep living in a world where I'm utterly hated by everyone. I see no reason to live when the only future I have to look forward to is constant abuse. I'm not writing this for sympathy, this is a throwaway account and I probably won't check replies, I just needed to write it.
