The end.i think iâ€™m gonna try and attempt in a month or two. iâ€™m honestly done. this life is shit. nobody needs or wants me. i have been having nonstop suicidal thoughts for weeks now. i see no reason to keep living when iâ€™m just gonna get worse and everything is just gonna keep tearing to shreds. life has just been getting worse and not improving for years but with this month being the worst month. idk what else to do. iâ€™m not welcome here. itâ€™s best if i leave now because i wonâ€™t hurt anyone else and i wonâ€™t be a problem in anyone elseâ€™s life or a burden to anyone else.
