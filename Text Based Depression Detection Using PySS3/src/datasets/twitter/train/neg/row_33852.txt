Here's me ventingI'm a teenager enrolled in his junior year of high school, and I often contemplate suicide.  It's not that I have a problem with popularity,  I feel my status in that department is up to par. I just never felt an actual connection to anyone,  not even my girlfriend of two years. Sex is monotonous already.  I've grown to see myself less as a person and more of an observer for other people. I resent everyone around me, except for my family. I know they care about me but I don't about myself.  My deadly sin is sloth.  No matter how much I research how to break it I end up ruining my life with procrastination. That's another thing.  Other kids. I think on a different plane than them. I have a constant need for knowledge and justice.  This is evident by my obsession with learning world politics. There kids don't care.  They see a headline on facebook and accept it as fact.  On top of all that is this girl. She's the only one I've ever felt to challenge me intellectually. I don't love her,  not a bit. But I'm still obsessed. My grades are trash, my view of the world is trash,  and my mind is caving in.  Suicide seems to be the only answer that will end the sleep paralysis/ pounding feeling in my chest. I just want to know even though I have horrible grades,  little chance of passing high school,  and no motivation to change it,  what do?
