Iâ€™m going to kill myself tonight.See my previous post for more details. Iâ€™m alone in this world and isolated. Iâ€™m tired of being so sad and alone. Tonight Iâ€™m going to overdose - I have a three month supply of antidepressants, a bottle of white rum, and many antiemetics. 

Iâ€™ve visited family and cleaned my belongings.
