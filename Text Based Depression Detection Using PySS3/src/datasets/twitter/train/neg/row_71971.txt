My GrandmotherMy grandmother is probably my closest family member, who I spend more time with than my parents. Recently in the past couple of years, her health's been getting worse. I been away for the past few years for college, and only meets her once in a while and over the summer/winter breaks.  And it's only now that I realize how feeble and vulnerable she is because she can no longer hold anything relatively heavy like 5lbs. 

It hate myself because I could have been better to her. It's these moments when sometimes I wish I didn't exist and they would have been better off without me. 

I have these suicidal idealizations, and never acted on them. But I'm afraid that might change in the future when she is gone. I'm scared that I might breakdown badly. I always try to repress my emotions and not get too close to anyone or anything. I'm so scared because my grandmother is probably the closest person to me.
