The common denominatorMy dad despises me. He constantly reminds me how worthless I am. He recently bought my sisters an iPad while refusing to help pay for my college. I get that there are other ways to pay for college but that's not the point. The point is that I'm undesirable. To him, my mom, my used-to-be-friends, and hell even my boyfriend. I keep being told that I'll find someone who loves me and that these so called friends are wrong but I'm the common denominator. It must be me. It's been this way my whole life. I've always been the burden. Friends have always run from me. Im the common denominator. I can't take it anymore. It would be different if it wasn't my fault. Maybe I could change it. But it's not. It's me. I can only blame myself. 

"For it was not your fault but mine. It was your heart on the line. I really fucked it up this time. Didn't I my dear? Didn't I my dear. "
