Run Away, or DieAt this point in my life I've come to terms with the fact that I'm just made to disappoint people, and that's okay. My parents aren't proud of me, and they shouldn't be. This is the 2nd high school program I've been in, and I can't even find the motivation to do it. I went from the normal high school to the online variant because I thought it would be easier, normal high school is brain numbing, this is even easier. I thought I'd just put a couple months into it and be done, but that's not the case. I haven't done any of it in 2 weeks, and now my mother thinks I've been manipulating her. She thinks I'm just trying to get out of the work. I go through out my day avoiding my thoughts, avoiding my parents, and avoiding my school. I'm tired of it. I'm honestly completely exhausted and it never stops. It never fucking stops. I just want to go away. I don't care how. I want to run away so I can have the relief that death promises without the finality of it. I'm just too scared to do either, so I keep digging myself a bigger hole. I'm just very tired of life as it is. I'm very, very tired.
