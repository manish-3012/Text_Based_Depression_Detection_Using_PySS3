Gonna kill myself by Monday but before that I just have one last dying request.I just want a girl to let me tell her how much I love her.

That's it.

I've never been able to tell a girl how beautiful and amazing she is. It's most of the reason why I'm killing myself. I just wish that some kind girl here would be sympathetic enough to let me love her for a few days, even if it's only via text. 

You don't even have to love me back. That's fine. I know I can't and never will be loved and fuck it I'm not gonna try to change that anymore. But please, I just want a girl in my life who I can get to know and then tell her how amazing she is for talking to me, how beautiful her hair looks, how pretty her eyes are and how compassionate her soul is. I just want to feel 0.001% of what it feels like for a girl to let you love her.

Please?
