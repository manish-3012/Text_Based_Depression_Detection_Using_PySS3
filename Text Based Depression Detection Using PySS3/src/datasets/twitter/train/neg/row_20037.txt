Need some adviceFor the past few months, I've had thoughts of shooting myself just about every day. I'm not THAT depressed (been much worse), and I've never considered actually acting on these thoughts, but the fact that I'm having them is disconcerting to me. I feel like if things ever got really bad, these thoughts could become a big problem. 

I've been under a lot of pressure in school recently, which has eliminated my social life and alienated me from most of my friends. I'm often anxious, self-consious, stressed out, and depressed (I had these problems as a teenager, but I've been doing a lot better the last few years until recently). I just don't want to feel anything, and the thought of completely silencing my brain is what appeals to me.

Anyone had any experience with these kinds of thoughts? I'll probably go into my university councilor soon to get a referral to a psychiatrist, but I'd like to hear what others have done in this kind of situation. Something tells me I need to just press the reset button my life, whether it's take a loooong vacation or start over in another part of the country. 

So glad I found this subreddit. I haven't been able to tell anyone about this, and I don't think my friends or housemates have any idea. I usually have a smile on my face =/
