Everyone would be better off without meI want to die. I donâ€™t want to be here anymore. Iâ€™m useless and everyone would be happier if I was gone. Iâ€™m a let down and worry to everyone around me. Better off without me in this world. I hate living like this and it would be better just to go for everyone.
