I'm just doneI really just am. I need this out there but can't tell anyone because they will try and stop me. So many mistakes. So much shut. I just can't anymore. I was trying so hard to hang on until my girls reached 18. 

But all in all I fail them. I fail at everything. There is nothing and no hope. I'm just tired. Tired of waiting and trying and failing. It's not gonna change. 

I am not meant for happiness or good. I am not meant for anything. I'm so tired of it just sucking. I got what I was dealt. I've done what I've done. I just can't.
