I can't do this anymore. I feel like I'm just incompatible with people.My family won't talk to me anymore  my partner keeps having trouble with me, friends are barely existing, I keep running into trouble at work  all because, I don't know. It seems I'm just an incredibly selfish person.

I want to end it so badly. My life has been this misery forever. I can't keep anybody around. I feel like I'm overly sensitive. Maybe I have BPD, but I wouldn't know. All I know is that, while I keep pretending that it's not just me, I am the teason why people keep hating me. It's so consistent that there's no other way. The problem is me.

So, here I am, crying in self-pity, sick of it all. I don't know how much longer I can do this.
