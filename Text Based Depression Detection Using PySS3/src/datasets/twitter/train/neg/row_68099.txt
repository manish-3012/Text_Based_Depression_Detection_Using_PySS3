Mentally ill and nothing worksAnd honestly I'm tired of trying. I have BPD and PTSD. I've been in therapy for a decade and have tried many medications. I was on six at once at one point. I can't handle it anymore. I lost my job and had to drop my classes because I couldn't leave my bedroom. I'm causing my boyfriend to lose his confidence in being able to help me and it's making him hate himself. He started cutting himself and says he hates that he can't do anything for me. I cause my family constant stress. My father went off on me this morning because I called to ask if anyone in my paternal family could help with bills at the end of the month. He said no and I needed to find a "fucking job" and that removed any shred of dignity I had left because I feel constantly guilty about asking for help and losing my job. I feel like a burden to everyone and he confirmed I was.

I tried exercising, eating healthy, yoga, meditation, all that bs. I wanted so much for those things to work but they didn't no matter how much I did them. Crying while jogging is difficult.

I can't afford ECT or anything similar. My insurance does not cover it and it would put me thousands of dollars in debt. Last time I was put on a 51/50 it took them three days to find me a place to stay and I couldn't sleep for almost the entire time. No one was able to visit me either because they had to send me far away.

I'm just tired of ruining everyone's life. My boyfriend is picking up my last refill. There's a bottle of vodka in the fridge I'm going to down the whole bottle with. I'm tired of getting progressively worse. I want to have control over myself once in my life, even if it only is once.
