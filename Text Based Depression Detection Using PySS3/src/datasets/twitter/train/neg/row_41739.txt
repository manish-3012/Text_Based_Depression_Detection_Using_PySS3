Itâ€™s getting closerI have been depressed &amp; self harming since I was 12 and Iâ€™m now 25. Life hasnâ€™t gotten better, and as time goes on I just have realized more and more how much of a waste of space I am. I have had suicidal thoughts  for 7 years now but keep putting it off for different reasons. I never wrote a note before, or had a genuine plan. But things are slowly coming together and I know how Iâ€™m going to do it, I just have a few loose ends to tie up and then I will be free. I canâ€™t wait to not feel anything anymore.
