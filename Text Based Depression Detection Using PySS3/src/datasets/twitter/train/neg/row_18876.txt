The Cycle (in America, anyway)You: "My life is awful. I want to kill myself."

Doctor (or family member, or friend): "No, you can't do that. I am going to have you forcibly detained in a hospital to save your life."

Hospital: "We're now going to make your life ten times worse by burying you with an insane amount of debt and ruining your credit when you can't pay up."
