Skip over this one, I'm not worth saving anywayI mean, why would I be?

I'm unattractive to the eyes of many people around me. Bitter to a fault. Afraid of conflict. Not even fucking worth sparing anytime for, really. Besides, at the rate I'm abusing my body, I'll probbly die of cardiac problems anyway. I might as well speed it up.

A burden to my family, a fake friend, not worthy of romantic love at all, *god*, just let me have that tiiiiiiiny bit of courage so I can finally fucking do it.
