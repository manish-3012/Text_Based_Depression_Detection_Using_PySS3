How do i know when to kill myself?I promised my self a year ago that I would try to survive until I am 21 im now 18. I have been depressed for about 3 years and the moment I think I am enjoying anything in my life I instantly get suicidal thoughts. My family doesnâ€™t care, I have never said to them that I dont want to live anymore, but I also start crying when eating dinner, watching tv or even in the middle of a conversation with family members. I sleep most of the day and the only time i can be productive is when doing school work, witch i rarely complete these days. I also have no intresest in anything anymore. I think these signs should be obvious enough for my family? Do they not care or? Im not saying i need them all to care for me all the time but i would like them to show somekind of emotion and not just ignore or say why im being so rude or lazy.

The only thing that has stopped me from killing my self is the fear of no â€after lifeâ€ Even though I often think my family doesnt care for me at all I do love them. I am scared that if i kill my self now I wonâ€™t ever meet them again. Does anybody else feel the same? Right now itâ€™s hard to try to survive but I am trying to atleast graduate in a few months and then maybe kill myself. I just think I am too big of a coward to do it this soon so it might be in a few months or three years idk.
