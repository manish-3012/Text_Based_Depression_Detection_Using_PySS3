Sister might be suicidal?so im a college student that is returning home in the next few days, and my mom is worried that my sister may be suicidal. she is a sophomore and had a rough academic semester juggling basketball (a big big passion of hers) and academics (that my mom stresses a lot). 

her friends at school have reported her to the counselor for trying to overdose on medication that wasn't prescribed to her, and my mom has found random pills in her room that aren't hers. a friend of ours also recently hosted a christmas party, that my sister didnt go to claiming she was 'sick.' aside from her basketball friends, she has shut herself off from the rest of the family and has my mom worried sick. for some reason, my dad keeps downplaying her fears though...

on top of this, she recently bought two books that both deal with dark topics like suicide and depression. she's reading It's Kind of a Funny Story and 13 Reasons Why - do you guys think these signs are enough to show suicidal thoughts or at least depression? 

ill be back home soon, but i dont know where to start in comforting my mom and consoling my sister. any advice would be nice!
