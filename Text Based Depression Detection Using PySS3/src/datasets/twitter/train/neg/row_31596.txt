Seroquel has lifted my mood.I feel energetic and interested in stuff right now. But I still think that killing myself is the most rational thing to do. I take up resources on an already overpopulated planet with no plans to give back in any way. Anyone else still suicidal when they aren't feeling low? Is this evidence that I should do it, since it isn't my depression talking?
