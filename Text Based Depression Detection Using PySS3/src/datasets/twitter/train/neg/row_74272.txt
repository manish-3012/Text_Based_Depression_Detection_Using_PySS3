I just want friends to talk to. What should a 19 year old be doing with their life?I don't know. Being good at school does nothing for me when I have severe nervousness and anxiety. People scare the shit out of me in real life because I feel like I'm doing something wrong. I know I shouldn't pay attention to what others think, but I can't help it. I feel like I have dead personality and can't feel emotions. It's utter bullshit. I feel like I live a fake life to try and fit in. I simply do not understand how people as I do not connect. I can't live like this, obviously I'm the fucked up one. I always think about the mountain to go to jump off. I sometimes get my heart beating by just looking at it. It might be my ticket to stop my thinking. I fucking hate thinking as I over-analyze stuff.
