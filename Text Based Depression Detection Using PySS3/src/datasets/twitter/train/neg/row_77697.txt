The hows and why nots of killing myselfDriving head on into traffic: what if someone else dies, ..my pain is not their problem

Pills: If I dont take enough I could just reek havoc on my body and cause medical professionals a lot of unnecessary work to keep me alive

Bleeding out through cuts: its messy and might stain the bathroom or carpets...who is going to have to clean that up

Gun: I dont own a gun, would have to procur one. The shop that sells it to me might see my face in the news. The shop keeper wonders what if he refused me the sale...would I still be alive.

Jumping off a bridge: who is going to have to drag the river, what if some kids find my body on the banks...

Then of course I think of how devastating it would be to my family, my grandmother is everything to me. 

Not today. Today I will be strong.
