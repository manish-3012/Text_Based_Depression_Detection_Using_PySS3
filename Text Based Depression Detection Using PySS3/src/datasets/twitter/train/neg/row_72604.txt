It's all for nothingI was a hermit for a long time. I thought finding human contact with people like me would help. I've met and loved other mentally ill people, other transgender people, other musicians, other poor people. I've enjoyed so much the time I've spent with them but it leaves me with this gaping sadness and bleakness because I know I'm weaker than all of them. I know they're all more beautiful than I am, with more love to give. It's all so hopeless. This life has nothing more for me. I just want to end it. Sometimes I look into the eyes of a truly beautiful person and it robs me of all my energy. I'll never love my body, or my voice, or my identity. My life has been lived in starvation for something to love about myself. All I see is a scarred body begging for release. I don't have a car but I have a moped. I was thinking of getting a shit job just to get enough money for a gun and some gas, it gets like 90 to the gallon. I could go very far for probably 300 bucks. I just want to die somewhere beatiful so whoever finds my body will not find it in a claustrophobic, dark room. They can at least find it in a forest, I can go back to the earth that birthed me. I can return to wherever we came from. I've lived my life as an individual and my heart isn't strong enough to keep going. I just want the bliss of infinity
