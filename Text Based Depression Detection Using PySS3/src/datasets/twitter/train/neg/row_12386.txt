I don't think I'm cut out for this world.It sounds stupid and dramatic, but I really don't know how other people do it. There must be someone who likes their job, likes their life, doesn't have to paste a face on every day. 

I feel like I'm acting through every day, all the stupid hoops you have to jump through just to interact with people. I smile and I try to say what people want to hear, and it's fucking exhausting. If that's what life is, then why bother to do it?

I don't know if that even makes sense. I'm just done with swimming upstream. I'm done trying things that don't change anything, that don't mean anything.
