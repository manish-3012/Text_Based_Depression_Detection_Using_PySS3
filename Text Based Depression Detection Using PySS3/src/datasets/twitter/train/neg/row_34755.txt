Something I did that helped meI have been depressed for the last few months now, and I would have episodes where I would break down and cry for one reason or another.  It was usually that I felt I was being treated like I didn't matter by people close to me despite my best efforts.  My most recent one was definitely the worst.
I was laying in bed trying to get to sleep and I just started thinking about how certain friends treated me and why.  Different memories in which I felt I was treated like I didn't matter started to pop up.  Eventually I couldn't take it anymore and decided now was the time to write a suicide note to see if I could go through with it.  I wrote a whole page expressing how I felt.  I wrote it with such passion and speed, I had never poured my heart out like that before.  However, it didn't feel right and I stopped.
I wondered, "What would my family and friends think about this?  Can I really put them through this?"  So I turned the paper around and wrote - Reasons Not to Kill Myself, and I just started to list every single person I could think of.  Family, friends, pets, anyone that I could have had some impact on in my life.  I was surprised how quickly I filled up the back of the paper and I ended up skipping a lot of people. I ended up with 48 spots, but some of those I filled with groups that would miss me, because I wouldn't have enough paper for all of them. I went back and tried to read every name aloud.  I got through like 5 or 6 before I started to cry again.
But this time I was happy.  It felt good to confirm with myself that I had to mean something in all these people's lives.  So if you are feeling like you don't mean anything to anybody please try it out, I hope you'll be as surprised as I was.
Not sure if this advice that has been given before.  I have never tried seeking help before, so I don't know what advice is normally given out.  I really felt like I needed to share so I created an account for the first so I could.
