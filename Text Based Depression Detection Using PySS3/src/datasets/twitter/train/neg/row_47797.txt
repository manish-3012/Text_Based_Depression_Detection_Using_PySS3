WhyIs the suicide hotline is supposed to help you not commit suicide. Why do a lot of them act like assholes and make you feel more bad for calling. Like thereâ€™s been a lot of times Iâ€™ve called and they had attitude problems. I liked the texting feature they had on Facebook messenger till they took it down. The crisis text line is okay but it feels like not a lot of people can help me.
