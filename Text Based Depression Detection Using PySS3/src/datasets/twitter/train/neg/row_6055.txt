Itâ€™s my birthday today and Iâ€™ve cried for the majority of it.My school had a few Covid cases so Iâ€™m stuck inside self isolating for 2 weeks. I was planning to go out with friends on this day, who are unaware of the state Iâ€™m in or how I feel most of the time. I donâ€™t like to share things with people, Iâ€™m quite selective when it comes to that. I had someone (an online person), I havenâ€™t really heard from them in a few days (not too sure why, it has worried me) and from this Iâ€™ve realised Iâ€™m fragile and incapable of operating correctly on my own. I tell myself that Iâ€™m coping but my ways of coping are just getting on whilst still carrying my heavy mind and having the urge to cry constantly. I was planning to do some work for school before the end of the week but I feel slightly unmotivated and every time I try and even think, I burst out into tears. I have many thoughts that plague my mind.

I have attempted previously, this shook my entire family, who were completely unaware about how I felt. They were devastated, made them cry. If they werenâ€™t here, I would have been gone a longgg time ago. A couple years after I thought I had improved so much, and boy was I wrong. I feel as though I know myself more and Iâ€™m in fact weak. Although I always crave to be gone, I hadnâ€™t made an effort in a long time until recently when I inhaled and swallowed some chemicals, it obviously wasnâ€™t enough. Clearly. And so Iâ€™m here.
