Literally doubting my suicidal thought and depressionWhen you read some other posts on this sub, you think "damn yeah i understand" but everyone i have talked to on this sub, were like "but have you done this and this?" And they come up with "solutions" so easily like i haven't thought about that before... they think about my life for 5 seconds and just come up with a solution like it's nothing and my life isn't so bad.

Can i not even properly want to die??? Do i seriously fail at being depressed too????
