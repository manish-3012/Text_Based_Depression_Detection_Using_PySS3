I should be happyI'm getting married soon. I have amazing friends. Amazing parents and my career is really getting going, but I'm always so anxious and scared all the time. But I'm also scared that I feel so numb.
Im scared that my friends, especially my best friend, don't care as much as I think they do. I'm scared I'm going to fail, and I honestly just want to give up. It doesn't make sense but I feel lonely and lost all the time.
What's depressing me alot is that I think im in love with my best friend. And he's not who I'm marrying. No matter what someone is getting hurt and it's mostly just me. I also feel incredibly guilty that I've developed feelings for someone who isn't my fiancÃ©.
I talk to my best friend alot about my feelings and my thoughts but lately he's been so worried about me that I just feel worse. I don't want to worry him, or my fiancÃ©, with my stupid problems. And I know if I die it would hurt them, but I'm pretty sure they'll be fine eventually.
Im scared of what I may do to myself. But I don't want to reach out to my friends anymore because I worry them to much.
And I don't want to keep asking if they care. I just want to be done.
