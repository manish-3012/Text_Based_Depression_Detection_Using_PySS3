I could have completely avoided the pain Im inI don't mean emotional pain. I mean physical pain. At the beginning of this year, I enrolled in a new college and such. I did not have my normal office chair, only a wooden chair provided by the dorm. When I set up my pc, I put my monitor up too high. 

When i sat down, i realized I had to crane my neck upwards at an extreme degree. Instead of lowering my monitor like a normal human being, I believed that "oh shit, if people get neck pain from hunching over all day, then i'll just do the opposite." I also fixated on my lack of proper seating as to why the position was uncomfortable.

So instead of changing my seating position to a comfortable one I continued in this position. For 8 hours for the rest of the year.

I am so stupid. My neck is never not in pain. The front of my neck is always in pain. My neck clicks. I don't understand why I continued like this.

Ive been to a doctor and started physical therapy, but that is only to correct the regular "poor posture" but this goes far fucking beyond simple poor posture.

Even if my neck feels somewhat better, I know that ill have to live with this for the rest of my life. There is a certain degree to what the human body can heal, and I fear that I have far exceeded it.

I think I'm gonna give it until the end of August to see if I feel any better but im not hopeful. I spend every hour of every day pacing around my house just thinking to myself of how I could be so incredibly stupid.

My life was just beginning. I had started to find friends that I really clicked with, I was getting good grades, and I was becoming a human being. But I fear that I may have ruined my life before it even began.

I either have two outcomes: I heal and the pain is gone, or the pain continues indefinitely. If I'm not feeling any better by the end of August, I don't think i will continue living.
