I don't know what could be wrong with me and it drives me crazy trying to live my lifeEverytime I try to figure out why I'm so fucked up I don't even seem to be able to know what my symptoms are any more. I've just deluded and I can't take it anymore. I don;t know how I can even bare to live a day more. I used to be something, have a future and what. Now I can't even bring myself to take care of myself. Everytime I think I find a way to deal with it it just blows up in my face. I just tried to turn my scooter motor on and put a noose round my neck but I pussied out. I don't even know who I am anymore. I'm so lost and confused I can't take another day of trying to be who I pretend to be. I feel great for a while then just come crashing back down to what ever the fuck this is. I want it all to end but I don't know how to do it and not wimp out
