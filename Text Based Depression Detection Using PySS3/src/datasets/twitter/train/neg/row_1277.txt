iâ€™ve given uphi iâ€™m an 18 year old black female and iâ€™ve given up. i canâ€™t take being alive anymore, every day is full of pain. i donâ€™t even know why iâ€™m bothering to write this post because i know the truth is... no one cares, no one truly cares any anyone who even does a tiny bit has someone else more  important or something else to worry about. who fucking cares truely about anyone else on this planet? obviously no one other wise we wouldnâ€™t be living in this capitalist hellhole. and if i canâ€™t care for myself then no one else will, if i donâ€™t kill myself today through suicide then iâ€™ll probably accidentally off myself through malnourishment or walking infront of a car or something because iâ€™m useless and stupid. i hate being alive and itâ€™s narcissistic of me to even be looking for a reason to live. at the end of the day my existence on this planet is meaningless and empty and pointless and pitiful. my life will be forgotten and all my hopes dreams, feelings and desires will no longer exist. goodbye.
