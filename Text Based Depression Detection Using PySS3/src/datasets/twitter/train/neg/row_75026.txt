I have a friend that's about to commit suicide, I know this might not be the right place for this post but I don't know where else to go.Hey everyone, I have an old friend that has claimed that he's going to commit suicide within the week. He was a friend of mine in high school, and I really haven't kept in touch. He moved across the country just after high school. The only reason I know about it is because another of my high school friends does keep in touch with him. 
He won't respond to any texts or calls, and he doesn't think that anyone cares about him anymore. How can we (those of us that knew him in high school) get him to talk to us? What do we say to him if he does respond to us?
