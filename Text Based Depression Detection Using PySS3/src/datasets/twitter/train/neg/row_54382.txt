How Bad is it to Die on Christmas?One of my best friends left me and I'm so fucking lonely. I can't stop thinking about it, it fucking sucks. My other friends completely ignore my messages unless they need a favor. I'm piss broke and will be evicted if I can't find $400 by the first.  I got laid off the first week of December and not a single company has responded to my job offers. Wtf do I have left at this point.
