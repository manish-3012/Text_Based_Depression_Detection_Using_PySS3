begging for deathi can't do this anymore. everyday is so just disappointing. i'm so alone. i just feel like i'm all alone in a dark room. i'm begging for just one light. but nothing. everyday i wish i had died. i just, i can't live like this. everyday, just nothing good happens. i can't even come here and talk about depressing stuff. its just always there. i feel empty like nothing will make me happy. i feel like no one will ever like me. thats i'm truly unlikable. everyday it keeps getting worse. everyday it just won't stop. i'm begging for it to stop. i feel like my only way out is suicide. everyday it just won't stop, please i just want to stop breathing.
