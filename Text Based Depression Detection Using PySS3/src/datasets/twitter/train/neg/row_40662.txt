One step at a timeI don't even know where to begin.  This mental health crap has been such a long road for me. 

Over the summer I had one of my worst bouts of depression and suicidality. I cut off all communication with every friend,  and even family members. I'm starting to get out of it,  but I'm still so far from being back on my feet. 

I got a job recently at a fast food chain,  which has been going well but I haven't been doing much of anything else besides spending time with my son when he's here. Like, I want to take classes next semester but that completely relies on getting my tuition reimbursed for the current semester (I was forced to drop classes due to being in the hospital for my mental health). I put in the request about a month ago and someone called me about it,  but I can't seem to care enough to call them back. There are other things like I need to make doctors' and dentist's appointments, but I just don't care. 

And so it starts.  I'm starting to feel like a failure all over again. Yeah, getting a job was a step,  but what about the rest of my life? 

I dunno. I guess I'm partially lonely as well.  Most of my friends don't live around me,  and even the ones I talk to also have mental health problems or are just stuck in life and we tell each other it's ok and we understand,  but in reality we both know it's not. 

Thanks for reading,  I guess.
