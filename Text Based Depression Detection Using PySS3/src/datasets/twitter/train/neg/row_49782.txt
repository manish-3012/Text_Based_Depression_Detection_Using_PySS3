I have bipolar disorder. I don't feel alive anymore.I had a fight with my mom. She blames me for my depression; somehow my depression, my illness, was all my fault. She even told me she didn't care.
Was bullied all my life. Attempted suicide. All year long, ive been wearing black...trying very hard to give life a chance. but now im numb and i dont feel alive anymore. im tired.
edit: sorry, i really dont want to go into details. im too tired.
