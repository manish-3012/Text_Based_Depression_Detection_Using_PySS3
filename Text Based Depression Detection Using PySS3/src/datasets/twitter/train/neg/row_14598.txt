Feeling like I HAVE to kill myself.Iâ€™m at a point where it just feels like something I need to do. Iâ€™ve been struggling for so long, and putting everyone through so much grief, that I have to do it. 

And I donâ€™t see why not, other than my fear of messing up. No one would really care (they wouldnâ€™t). My family would be sad, but they have had time to come to terms with it, and would be MUCH better off. 

Iâ€™m going to therapy. And that helps, but it doesnâ€™t help when itâ€™s night time and all I can think about is how horrible I am. 

Plus, any time I see any advice out there, all I can think is â€œfuck offâ€. NO ONE would be worse off with me gone. Exercise is bullshit and makes me feel so fucking shitty. Talking to people I donâ€™t have to makes me want to puke. 

Just, I donâ€™t know what to do and I think Iâ€™m somewhat looking for validation or at least for someone to listen. Because I donâ€™t have that.
