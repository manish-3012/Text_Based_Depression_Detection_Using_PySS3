I feel like i have no options leftThe basics of it are in the title. A million different reasons have brought me here, and now ive got nothing left. I spent 7 months holding my 5 year relationship togdmether after i moved out of her moms house only to find out she cheated the day i left. And i spent almost all winter saving enough money to buy my truck, the one thing i actually own which is lucky because now i live in it due to some major health complications making me unhirable. And that leads to today, i spent all day trying to make a dollar so i could move my truck, since i ran out of gas last wednesday, i walked all over town, ended up making $10 for mowing a lawn and came "home" to find my truck had been towed. Im sitting infront of walmart trying to figure out what to do and i feel like i have nothing left. Now i dont even have a roof to sleep under, the woman ive loved since the day i met her loves someone else, and i cant hold down a real job long enough to get out of this mess ive created.
