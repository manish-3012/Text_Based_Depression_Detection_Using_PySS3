How to get access to a gun?Iâ€™ve made some serious and irreparable mistakes in life. Iâ€™m essentially one big f*ck up, unable to forgive myself for past errors. Iâ€™ve been contemplating suicide, but one of my mistakes includes a felony for theft, which if found guilty, would impede me from buying a gun. I am unlikely to commit suicide any other way, so how would it be possible to access a gun further down the road? I want to have the option so itâ€™s important that I have access to a firearm.
