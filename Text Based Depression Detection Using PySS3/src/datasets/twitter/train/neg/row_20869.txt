Tomorrow morning is my hearing with the University... If they kick me out I don't know what I'm going to doLong story a k9 unit found the stash(weed/weed parefenalia only) in my room. They cop was ok he didn't even give me a ticket or anything but I'm reported to the University. I don't have any kind of record so I wouldn't be worried but I'm also on acedemic probation for having a 1.99 GPA instead of 2.0+ (fml right). 

So if tomorrow goes bad I don't have anything... I'll have 200$(more like -10,000 because of school) to my name, no place to stay, no job, hardly any skills and everything I've worked for will be gone... I don't know where life will take me... It might just be goodbye
