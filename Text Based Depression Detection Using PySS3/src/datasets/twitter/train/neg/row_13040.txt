Why not to do itKilling yourself doesnâ€™t stop or end the pain it just will transfer it to other people. Do you want to put it on other people. I decided I canâ€™t do bring this upon everyone else so Iâ€™m just gonna live with the pain. I walk through life every day emotionless like a zombie I have to sacrifice myself. I have to deal with the pain so others wonâ€™t.
