Today I realised that if I kill myself it will kill everyone around me and I donâ€™t want thatToday at work I fainted and then had chest pains so they called an ambulance and they took me away to the er. My manager was very worried, my coworkers were beside themselves and my phone was being flooded with supportive messages. I was planning to take my own life before Christmas. I had already ordered the chefs knife I was going to slit my wrists with. But now that I saw that when it looked like I was on the brink of death everyone stepped up and cared Iâ€™m reconsidering. If I died it would ruin about 70 peopleâ€™s Christmas. They would have had no idea and the guilt would have overshadowed them. Thank you heart palpitations for showing me that people care and that maybe Suicide is not the only option.
