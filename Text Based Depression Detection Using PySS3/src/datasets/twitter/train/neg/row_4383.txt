I don't think I can make it through thisSo my parents pushed me into cancelling my housing contract with my university and just doing my classes from home and I guess I never realized just how much I really considered going off to college the light at the end of the tunnel. And now my mom lost her job and money is tight again, and of course they won't let me work because of covid, so its not like I can change my mind and go anyways. I know I can't handle online classes either b/c I've tried taking them before, and the thought of just spending the next year, if not most or all of my college years, just stuck in my room trying to make it work somehow is making me want to kill myself more and more every day.

Like, sure, even if I get through this, than I'll have an education and that's literally it. I drifted apart from most of my friends after my parents decided to move across the state right before my junior year (an amazing way to fuck up your child's life, mental health, and ability to get letters of rec for college apps, btw) and I never really got close to anyone afterwards b/c they all knew each other and I have depression and anxiety instead of a personality. I never dated for the same reasons and because gay dating in hs is almost impossible. I already felt pretty lonely but now I never interact with anyone outside my immediate family.

I just feel like there's no way out, like even if I somehow manage to survive doing nothing but online coursework, I basically end up trying to play catch-up for the rest of my life. It feels like the thing I've been clinging to for the past few years, the thing that I hoped would make it worth it to stay alive, has just been a big lie and I can't do jack shit about anything in my life.
