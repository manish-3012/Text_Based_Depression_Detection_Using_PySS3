I donâ€™t want to die but I donâ€™t want to keep living eitherI was doing so good fighting suicidal thoughts these past couple months but today it just got to me. I looked at my life and realized no one would care if I died. Theyâ€™d act like they did but honestly itâ€™d be a relief for them.

My parents think Iâ€™m trash and a whore. I know this bc they tell me this all the time. They cut me out of their lives recently for the second time in six years. They do this as an act of punishment. They think itâ€™ll force me to change my life. Iâ€™m almost 30 completely financially independent live on my own but they donâ€™t like some of the people I hang out with. Some of my friends have felony records from their early 20s. They served their time, changed and havenâ€™t done it again but my parents are mad I wonâ€™t cut them out. Iâ€™m forgiving.   But they think Iâ€™m desperate and now my immediate family cut me out.

I have one female friend but sheâ€™s constantly disappointed in me. She thinks Iâ€™m too sensitive and make stupid choices. 

I admit I have very low self esteem. Iâ€™ve tried working on it with a therapist but it never really went away. I tend to attract really cruel guys who do or say awful things to me so Iâ€™ve stopped dating entirely.

Iâ€™m just sad all the time. I really do try to be happy. But all the time in the back of my head I hear the terrible things my family and friends think of me - that Iâ€™m stupid, lazy, fat, ugly, a slut, trash and I canâ€™t shut those voices up anymore. Iâ€™m really thinking of killing myself if anything ifâ€™ll bring some joy and peace to the people on my life.
