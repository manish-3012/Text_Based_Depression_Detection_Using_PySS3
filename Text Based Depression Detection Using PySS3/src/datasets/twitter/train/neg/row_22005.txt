I cant find a reason anymoreIve been miserable my whole life. I cant remember Last time i was happy or satisified. I have never truly felt happiness. I try to blame it on my parents divorce but that has happened to so many people i doubt it is it, ive never succeseed in ANYTHING and i know it is all my own doing. I thought getting a girlfriend would help but i think i just messed that girl up. I dont know what i should do. I dont know how a therapist would help me, ive tried it but it didnt help. I just feel like im truly alone. I feel like i have no friends who care about me i feel like im downing 24/7 i dont know what to do I just want to not exist please someone help me i dont know what to do anymore
