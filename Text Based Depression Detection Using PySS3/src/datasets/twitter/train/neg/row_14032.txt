I have to kill myselfi feel like i bring everyone down.. my family, husband, even my cat.. i wanted to kill myself when i was 18 but i'm 20 now.. i have no job, education, purpose, dream.. i've been like this for a very long time.. whenever i say i feel tired i get looks from my family asking me what i've done to get myself so tired knowing that i do nothing all day.. i know that they work very hard for us but i dont know.. i dont feel right these days. im losing so much hope. i literally can't see anything else. i cant stop thinking about killing myself and what will happen after. i just wish i could give everyone i love everything that they ever wanted and needed but i cant and i'm really sorry for that.. for causing so much trouble when i was young, for wasting so much money, for causing trauma to everyone.. i dont feel right anymore.. i dont even know why i'm writing this.. i dont know if i want help or i just want to say shit because i feel sad and angry right now.. i wish i was a better person than this.. i wanted to be like everyone else but i just cant.. i think i've suffered from adhd my whole life.. thats why i became like this.. and i dont know how to fix it.. i really hate myself.. im sorry for writing this down here..
