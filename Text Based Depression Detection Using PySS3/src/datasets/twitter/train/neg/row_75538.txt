I think Iâ€™m readyIs it possible for life to be over at 23? 

I havenâ€™t celebrated my own birthday since I was about 11, because it seems wrong to me to celebrate another year I shouldnâ€™t be living, if that makes sense? 

I just feel like I am constantly drowning. From finance stress, to relationships and self image I really cannot win and Iâ€™m exhausted of losing at my own life. 

I have a job with the military and and Iâ€™m lucky to have it but it meant I had to move away from my entire family and everything I knew.

I am surrounded by so much debt that even with a steady pay check sometimes I canâ€™t even feed myself. My mother opened up a few credit cards in my name when I was a child, and that has basically screwed me over since I was about 18. Recently got a letter from my power company saying that if they donâ€™t receive $500 that Iâ€™m getting disconnected. Iâ€™m so fucking useless that Iâ€™ve been trying to pay off everything and not eating and sleeping because of it and Iâ€™m STILL not able to catch up.

I had a boyfriend that I met after basic training, he turned out to be a wolf in sheeps clothing and ended up putting me in the hospital. He got an assault charge, but heâ€™s still in the military and I get to have panic attacks when I see him on the base they refuse to transfer me from.

Iâ€™m ashamed, I canâ€™t talk to my family about it because they either donâ€™t care or overreact, canâ€™t talk to my coworkers about it because itâ€™s humiliating. I tried a couple times recently to go to Mental Health on base, and all they did was schedule for a tentative appointment with a trauma specialist for July. 

I donâ€™t think the world will necessarily benefit from me not being in it, I literally donâ€™t think it will make a difference. 

I have friends, I go to the gym, I am a functioning person at work... I come  watch gore videos in the hopes that I can desensitize myself to blood enough to be fine and not chicken out when Iâ€™m ready to go. 


Iâ€™m just writing this so to get it off my chest before I take the plunge. At least I know my creditors will mourn me.
