[24M] Been depressed for 20 years, going to end it soon.,I just realised on New Year's Eve, How much I hated myself.
I'm a slow learner and went into college, very innocent and naive from a strict household. I tried to get laid but couldn't. College is easy for sex but I was struggling. I hate being a virgin. Now that college is done, I regret it and my wasted youth.

I'm slowly losing my sanity and I've had enough of being clueless. I don't know where to start I'm not getting any younger. I went from optimistic to very depressed, self hating, isolated.

Been going through abuse from my parents since 2, been depressed and numb for 20 years and bullying, I never had any friends, I got in an accident and permanently deformed. it got really bad the last 2 years, I had an autoimmune disorder. I don't want therapy, I can't afford it.

I'm in 40k debt with a shit grade. I've never been allowed to have fun or play anything, I can't live my own life. It's all wasted. I'm going to end it soon.
