Iâ€™m torn on whether or not I should leave a note.I canâ€™t decide if I should leave a note or not. Part of me wants to just unload on them all and tell them how itâ€™s their fault, but part of me feels like that would be really mean and it would upset them all a lot. 

I also donâ€™t know if suicide notes are helpful. Will it give them closure or will it make everything worse? Sorry if this doesnâ€™t make much sense. Iâ€™m feeling very scrambled at the moment.
