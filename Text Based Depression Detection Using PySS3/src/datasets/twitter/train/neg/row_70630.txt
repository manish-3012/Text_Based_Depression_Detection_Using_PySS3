Life is so tiringIâ€™m not that well physically and mentally. For the past year Iâ€™ve been trying to seek out answers to what Iâ€™ve experiencing and every single time I donâ€™t get answers. Iâ€™m tired of seeing all the doctors who tell me nothing is wrong, when I know my physical symptoms clearly show something is up. Idk iâ€™m just tired of it all. And it doesnâ€™t help that my mental health is shitty and I was suicidal before all of this and this is just amplifying it.
