I'm tired of everything.I don't feel like fighting to live anymore.

I left my house because my brother tried to kill me.
I'm living with my girlfriend who i don't really know why i love, if i do at all.
No friends, no care from my family.

I haven't accomplished anything meaningfull in my life, i have been fighting all my life alone.
Just want it to end here.
