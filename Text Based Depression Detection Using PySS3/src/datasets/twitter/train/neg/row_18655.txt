what am i doing wrongi've never meant anything to anyone except my family and my best friend and her sister. no guy i liked ever wanted me, no girls want me. people always say i'm cute or that i have a good personality but then they go and break me more. all i want is for people to like me and i can't even get that. they all fucking leave or they forget me. i'm a fuck up. my eyes burn from crying i just wish i could gather up the nerve to fucking do it. i'm tired of this pain
