Life just sucks and I might just try to kill me again.Eh, well things had been kinda okay the past month I made a few new friends cut off a few toxic people, but unfortunately I am not able to cut my parents off. And I miss those toxic people, even though well, they were toxic. But the thing that bothers me the most, that recently I started hating everything and I don't wanna be filled with so much hatred. Of course there were things I didn't like, but hate was something I wasn't capable of, but now it's like my whole being is just hatred and my mind wants to kill me off. 

I have severe OCD and once I'm in my thinking-spirale it just never stops with the thoughts and it's always some horror scenario.
