I just actually looked up how many pills I would need to take.That's the furthest I've ever gone with this kind of thinking.

I'm just so fucking tired. Too tired to even explain all the feelings. All this time feeling like this, all the effort I've given to snapping myself out of these mindsets, and it all just keeps coming back.

Right now, I just don't want anything. I don't care to try. I feel humiliated even being here, trying for anything at all in life. I'm starting to fail to see the point in anything. I don't know where I'm going, and I shame myself for it just as much as everyone around me does.

Right now, nothing sounds as relieving as death. For all of this to just be over.

EDIT:  Came close to driving into another car tonight.  Called a friend who told me to pull over and came to meet me.  I've kind of shocked myself, now wondering how I'll feel about having reached this point.  I'll try not to feel ashamed, but I feel like it'll be a challenge.
