I can't go on like this anymore.For the past 5 years I haven't known who to believe when it comes to my behavior. There are two people, one an ex boyfriend and one a current boyfriend, who I have always felt gaslighted me and made me out to be crazier than I am. They both have said I make things up, I perceive everything wrong based on the mood I'm in, and they both tell me things I've said or that I've done that I do not remember at all. I have never known if they are lying to me to further their "agenda" (being right and me being crazy). I feel like things that hurt me or bother me are not taken seriously when I say anything about them - it's always written off as me being crazy and irrational, even when I am calm and to the point about them. I don't know if I am crazier than I think. I've only been officially diagnosed with a depressive disorder (just clinical depression I guess?) but had a counselor basically tell me I have BPD and probably trichotillomania and the only other opinion on that is that of a really bad psychiatrist who I no longer see. My life feels like one big question mark shrouded in fog. I never know if what I'm feeling is real or if it's from something I made up. I don't know if my reactions are justified. Most people don't see that side of me because I'm very slow to warm to most people and I'm considered shy. I only ever argue with boyfriends so their opinions are the only ones I have. 

I had a big argument with him tonight and he told me something I said was really mean and to take him home so I did. Now I want to kill myself because this is too much. Nobody understands or cares about what I'm going through being un-treated for my problems. I'm trying so hard to find a new doctor to help me but everywhere is wait lists and "case-by-case basis" and I feel like the only way I'll get taken seriously is if I dive off the roof of my apartment complex or something. I don't know what to do anymore.
