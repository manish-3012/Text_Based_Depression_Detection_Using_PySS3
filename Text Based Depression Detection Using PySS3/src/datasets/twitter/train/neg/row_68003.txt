I just don't want to anymoreLiving life without a father was really hard and I really just can't stand knowing that he's out there probably enjoying his life while his family's rotting away somewhere, I never got any love and support from my family, just material things that would only make my life worse, the most I've probably gotten from my family was a short "congrats" for being top 1 in the grade for like 2-3 years, but after that my grades just slowly started getting worse and worse, my family got more aggresive and insensitive as time went on, to the point of mentally, physically and emotionally exhausting me, I've tried talking to them and it usually works for about 2-3 days before they come back to being what they were before, I only have like 2-3 friends I wholeheartedly trust and one of them is slowly drifting away, it hurts more because that person has been my friend for 17 years and has become the love of my life, I'm not that close with my other friends but I trust them enough, bad enough that I have trust issues too, doesn't help being physically abused throughout your childhood without fighting back, this whole thing is just so badly composed and I'm just so tired and I just don't want to do anything anymore, I wouldn't be able to afford therapy anyway, so I guess this is the end of the line for me
