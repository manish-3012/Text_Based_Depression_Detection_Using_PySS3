I think I beat suicide.I havenâ€™t had much of a reason to live. All of the reasons everyone else gives. Alone, depressed, giving up, all that.

I tried jumping off the climbing face of a local mountain. As I looked down, it wasnâ€™t as far as I had remembered it when I nearly fell off hiking five years ago. The drop only measured 170 feet. 

Tired of looking at other ways to die I went out and bought a big gun. I loaded it, set it to my head with my fingers on the trigger. I sat for about 30 minutes in that parking lot. 

After everything, I decided ending my life wasnâ€™t what I wanted to do. To seek treatment and to move past all the negative aspects of my life. I havenâ€™t had a suicidal thought since. I shot all my ammo in the desert. Iâ€™m pawning my gun tomorrow morning. I hope others would do the same.
