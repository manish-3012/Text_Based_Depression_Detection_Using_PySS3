A final goodbyeI have created a new account, so I donâ€™t post this on my main one.
I just wanted to say goodbye cause I am done. I am fucking sick of life, Iâ€™m sick of going nowhere, constantly being a failure, being so alone and lonely all the time. I am just absolutely done now and donâ€™t want to continue trying and failing anymore. Things are not only not getting better, they are faster and faster getting much worse for me. 

To my parents, if you are reading this, Iâ€™m sorry, itâ€™s not anything you did specifically. Iâ€™m just not cut out for this world, for life, for anything quite frankly. I know you always told me to keep going and keep trying cause things will get better for me. Well Iâ€™m just sorry to say that things are only getting worse for me. And Iâ€™m done trying and subsequently failing over and over, I canâ€™t put up with it anymore. 

And to Claire, if you are somehow reading this, I still love you and always will till my final moment. You were the best thing that ever happened to me, truly. I understand your reasons why you just had to be yourself when you told me that last year. You have to do what is best for you, and I would never stand in you way from doing what you felt was best for you, but that doesnâ€™t mean it hasnâ€™t killed me inside every day being apart from you. The time we spent together is truly one of the only thing I have in my life I can look back on and smile, because you did make me so happy! I know we wonâ€™t be together again, and that knowledge kills me. But no matter how long itâ€™s been since we last spoke or seen each other, I still think about you every day. I hope you are doing well, and I really hope you find true happiness in your life, because you really deserve it. I love you Claire, and always will. 

Iâ€™m sorry to everyone. I just cannot cope with life anymore. I donâ€™t want to carry on. The pain, the hurt, the failure, everything, itâ€™s all too much for me and I just donâ€™t want to deal with it anymore. 

Goodbye
