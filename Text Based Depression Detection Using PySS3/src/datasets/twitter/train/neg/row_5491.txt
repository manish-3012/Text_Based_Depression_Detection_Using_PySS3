I'm hating my existence.So, I've finally decided to share what I'm feeling with someone and that's why, here I am. Trying to write out the story of my life. Things have been really hard for me lately. I don't even know where to start so pardon me if it's all messy. So, I don't really hate my parents, but I'm really angry. I can't even explain this feeling. My parents want me to join their family business which I'm not really interested in. If I try telling them I wanna do something else, they tell me I'm not a good daughter and they might kill themselves someday if I continue behaving this way. The fact that they never even asked me what I want in my life and think that my life is theirs to decide, is what makes it worse. I'm basically feeling trapped. It's like I've got no way out of here. They won't even let me go out for my higher studies. And the worst part? They never saved any money for my higher studies. I don't want to hurt my parents by just running away or something. And let's get real, no matter what, you always need support. I don't even want to be a puppet to my parents, listening to every single order. I feel suffocated sometimes. Thinking there's no way out. It's like I'll be trapped here for forever. I seriously feel like this life is not worth living after all. I don't know what to do. As far as I can see, I don't think this will ever change in the future.
