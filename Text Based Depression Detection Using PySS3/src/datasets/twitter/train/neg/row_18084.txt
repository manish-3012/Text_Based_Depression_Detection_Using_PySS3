I want to destroy myselfI'm almost 30. I've accomplished nothing. Ruined a marriage. My mental illness has prevented me from doing anything worthwhile. The pain is too much, the ups and downs of my mood are too much. I just want to escape. I'm so tired. I'm so tired of fighting. I'm at the end of my rope. I can't do it anymore.

I want to destroy myself. I used to want a nice serene quiet suicide, but now I don't, I want something violent and angry. Because I'm angry. I'm angry that I was born with shitty genetics and I couldn't make life work. I'm angry that so many people have abandoned me and ignored me reaching out for help. I'm angry that no one freaking cares. I'm angry that I'm forced to be alive when I didn't ask for this.
