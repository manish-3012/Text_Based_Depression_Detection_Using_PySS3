Escaping abusive family seems hopeless. Feeling suicidal.So I'm an adult and I live with abusive family. They are physically and verbally abusive towards me. I've been trying to get a job to move but nowhere has hired me yet. I can't get financial aid because my parents won't allow me to get it. My mother even stole and hid my bank mail, so I had to open a new one and put down my friend's address instead. I have a tiny bit of retail experience and I just applied to volunteer to get cafÃ© experience too. 

I tried to move in with my best friend but her owner won't allow it because she wants to keep the spare room for relatives. I was offered a place to stay, but when I went to go check it out the guy was a insane and scary. So 2 separate plans to escape just failed on me today. 

I can't go live on the street either because I have a cat who I love. Anyway I literally can't see a reason to live at this point. Isn't it definite that I'll never escape? I swear people don't understand how much living with an abuser fucks with your mind, and how depressed it makes you on a daily basis. I honestly want to die.
