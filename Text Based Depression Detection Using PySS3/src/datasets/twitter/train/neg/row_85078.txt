Told my mother I wanted to kill myself she said she hope I won't survive.Hello,

Recently I decided to open up about how I felt and told it to my mother since I have no friends around me now. I wasn't expecting her to wish for me to not survive. To be exact she said if I survive my attempt she would not visit me at the hospital and act like I am not her daughter.

I really really wanted her to help me not to encourage me. I feel like. Now I have no choice but do it so I wouldn't let her down.

I've been crying for hours and to be honest I am really scared of myself right now.

I just wished.... For things to be different.

Not just why I am posting here. Sorry to have bothered anyone who read this.
