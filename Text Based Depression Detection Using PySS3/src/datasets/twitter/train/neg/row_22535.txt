Arctic cold or hot desert?I have had fatigue for the past couple of months and I'm ready to die basically. The question is whether I should go to the arctic cold or the hot desert in order to succumb. Which one makes more sense?

When the travel restriction is lifted I'm gonna book a flight to either one of those places and see what happens.
