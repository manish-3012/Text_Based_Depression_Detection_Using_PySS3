i am going to do itlife's too hard. i can't do it anymore. i tried so much, but nothing will ever work on in this life. not even when i admitted to you that before killing myself, that i never cheated on you. i believe that not even now you'd believe me. i can't even rest at peace in death. but before i die, please remember. i never cheated on you. and i will always love you. you're my soulmate.
