Very much lost. Mentally weak. Deteriorating physically.I just fell ill recently, but I'm positive I have CFS or ME (depending on country). I have at least one symptom for every criteria and some multiple. Also, mono which was my trigger is completely gone from my body. No active EBV titers.

I've resigned myself to the fact I have this illness. While I'm still able to work at the moment (struggle throughout entirety of day) and I know I could be much worse off, I've become very negative and honestly feel like giving up. I wouldn't want to go on with life feeling how I do now for another 50 odd years. My first 27 were rough as it is, but this is more than I feel able to take on.

I'm very much alone in all of this. Nearest family is 1500 miles away, but even if I was with them I'd still be sick. My little girl is here, but seeing her doesn't do much except make me want to breakdown. She's so happy, energetic and loving, but I'm a mess and seeing her only adds to my grief. Her mom, who I love dearly, has completely disappeared after months spent working on our relationship.

I'm alone, very much alone. And I'm lost. I feel like a child again who needs to be comforted by his parents. My daughter is the only reason I have to see this out, but then I think 'why? If I'm only going to get worse what good am I to her?'

I want a redo. I want another shot at the events that unfolded that led me here. But that's only in dreams and movies. This reality though is hell and I don't know what I'll decide.
