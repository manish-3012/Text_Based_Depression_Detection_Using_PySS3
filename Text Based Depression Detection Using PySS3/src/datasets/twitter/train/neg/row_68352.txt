How can I stop thinking about killing myself?I can not stop thinking about killing myself. I do anything in my power to stop thinking about including the one occasion the principle pulled me out of class because I was on youtube instead of what I was supposed to be doing. But even after all my attempts it's all just temporary and useless in the end. And last night when I had a scary thought. Society is corrupt if I could just remove the crooks I could make society perfect. Wait, there is no point in serving society only yourself. But then again everything is useless in the end. I should just end it since there's no point. I managed to scare myself.
