I don't know what to do anymore. I'm so tired.Title pretty much sums it up. I have psychotic depression and was hospitalized two months ago when I started losing my mind. I take 8 pills every day  before I go to bed. 

I've been getting paranoid again. Faces warping when i stare at them too long. Feeling like aliens are watching me in the shadows, around the corner, from the closet, at the foot of the bed. I know I need to up my dosage of antipsychotics again but they make me so fucking tired. I slept for 14 hours on the original dose and they cut it in half so I wouldn't be so tired. 

I'm still on the spectrum for schizophrenia and they're watching me closely to catch it early if I end up developing it. I'm scared.

I don't deserve my boyfriend,  his love, or his kindness. He wakes me up from nightmares every night. He holds me when I cry. He wants to marry me once he has more money. 

I don't deserve my parents and all they do for me. They put up with so much of my horseshit in high school. I almost destroyed my relationship with them and they still loved me when I came crawling back to them. I'm pathetic.

I'm tired of being a crazy person. I'm tired of this horrible, painful existence. I just want to fall asleep forever. I don't want to be mourned. I want to be celebrated. I fought for most of my life against a debilitating disease. I lost, but at least I fought.

I just want to down a bunch of sleeping pills and fall asleep in the mountains. It's winter anywho. If I fall asleep in the snow I won't have to wake up.

 I've already started writing my will.

Call it a cry for help, or reaching out to strangers for any excuse to stay alive, or maybe just airing my thoughts out before I die. I'm sorry.
