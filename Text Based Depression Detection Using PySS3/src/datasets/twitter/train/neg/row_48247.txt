Get me the fuck outta here!Not killing myself anytime soon but I plan on it eventually.  It's a matter of me getting the courage to do it.  Every second of every day is torture for me.  It's completely subjective to.  No one listens to me when I tell them about how I feel and what I believe is happening to me.  Fuck it...
