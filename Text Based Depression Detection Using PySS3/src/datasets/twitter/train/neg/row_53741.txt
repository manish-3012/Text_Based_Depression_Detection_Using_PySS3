Please help, on mushrooms currently.Greetings to you my fellow reddit perusers,

To anyone out there with relevant experience: Do any of you know whether joining the Peace Corps or similar volunteer organization is a viable option for someone with a moderate to serious drug problem, ~$20k student loan debt, no bachelor's degree, ~$1k of medical expenses and credit card debt each, no criminal record, and a near perfect on paper in every way resume.

I'm having a complete meltdown on ~3.5 of psilocybin cubensis mushrooms ingested on an empty stomach about 5 hours ago.

Basically I've reached the point in my life where its suicide or jail. Be forewarned I would never do anything to harm another human being, I am only a danger to myself and no one else.
So what options are there in terms of doing the least damage financially and emotionally to my friends and family. I have previous missionary experience (although I now consider myself religiously unaffiliated). I want to make take the plunge, kick the drugs, get out of my comfort zone, and pay off my debt. Please, if anyone reads this, honestly I'm at rock bottom right now, please try not to reprimand my use of illegal substances.



TLDR: Having nightmare mushroom trip right now. Can I join a volunteer group, or is rehab my only option?
