I can't take it any more.So I've had suicidal thoughts for an entire decade now. I've attempted suicide multiple times, although I wasn't sure if they were ever going to be feasible and they weren't. I've been researching suicide on and off for the past year. I've figured out a lot of things that are and aren't possible. I've had two voluntary periods in the inpatient unit at the hospital for being suicidal. Tomorrow morning I'm going to go look at some train tracks. I'm going to study what happens and see if I could kill myself. I'm going to figure out where to place my head and then come back and study online about the train. Then if I'm able to make it happen, I'm going to do it on Friday. I really don't even know if I'm seeking support from others any more. I can't really tell any more, but I guess if I'm not, then this could just be some kind of Reddit suicide documentary.
