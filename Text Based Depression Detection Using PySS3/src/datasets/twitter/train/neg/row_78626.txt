Iâ€™m running out of energy - Queen Beryl has taken it all.I feel like Iâ€™m running out of energy to keep trying. I feel like I constantly let everyone in my life walk all over me. Im perpetually paranoid and unable to calm my visceral anxiety that makes me feel like Iâ€™m going to die. The seroquel doesnâ€™t work, and Iâ€™m smoking so much my voice is fucked. I am surrounded by so many fucking problems and Iâ€™m still trying to hold it altogether. Iâ€™m still going out and doing things, Iâ€™m still working and achieving.. although it slips now and then. But I donâ€™t feel like I can keep on when I feel like I am worthless. When I keep on diminishing myself and also whilst Iâ€™m this fucking selfish.
