NightmareIm in my worst nightmare. I have PTSD from a lifetime of abuse and then from a year of homelessness at 17, after my mother suddenly died. every day was full of hunger, every day was full of terror, every day I didnt know if I would wake up the next morning to losing everything all over again. 

Im suddenly losing everything all over again. I cant stay here anymore. My friends are in situations where they cant help me. Im disabled and scik and I have to go. But I have nowhere to go. I may be homeless all over again. Oh god. Oh god. 

When do i wake up. When do i wake up. When do i wake up from this 6 year long nightmare. I want my mom. I want to go home. I just wnt to be sage. Oh god. Please. I want my mom. Im so terrified. When do i wake up. hlep me. help me
