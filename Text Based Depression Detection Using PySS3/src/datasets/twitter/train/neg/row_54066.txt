3 more weeks.I thought for a while that I'd never kill myself. Not because I didn't want to die, because believe me I did, but because I didn't have the courage to do it to myself. I'd always hope for some type of accident, whether I'd be hit by a car, die in a shooting, whatever. But now I realize that it is because it wasn't the right time. Now, I've found a time. It will be after my sister's birthday in 3 weeks. Then it will all be over. Then I will feel no more pain.
