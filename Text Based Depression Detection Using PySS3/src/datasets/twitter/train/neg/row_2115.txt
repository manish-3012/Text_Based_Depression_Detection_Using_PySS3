EndedThe only person who ever made me feel like I had a reason to live was my ex girlfriend, but she never knew about my problems. Sheâ€™s broken my heart and doesnâ€™t want to talk to me anymore. So Iâ€™ve sent her one final message saying goodbye now. I donâ€™t have any more reasons to live, and I donâ€™t have the energy to find anymore. I want to die, and thatâ€™s final. Itâ€™s been the right thing for me to do for a long time.
