I can't do this any moreI don't know what to say. 

I am reading up on ways to kill myself definitely with no possibility of surviving. I am a crap human being. My wife would rather I was dead. I have made her ill with the stress i have caused her over the years. I have basically wrecked her life with my lies about past relationships and lies about stupid little things that i should never have lied about. i have threatened suicide many times in front of her and driven her to illness with the stress.

she now would rather i was dead and has said so several times. i have often felt like this, then the feeling passes. i have watched videos about the effects of suicide and come to the conclusion that it's harmful to those left behind. but i'm not sure i feel like this any more.

not looking for the sort of "you're not crap" "you're a good person at heart" stuff people dish out. that won't wash with me because i have been really rubbish. everything i do turns to crap. i guess i'm just using this to vent my feelings somewhere and leave a message to the world. 

thanks for listening
