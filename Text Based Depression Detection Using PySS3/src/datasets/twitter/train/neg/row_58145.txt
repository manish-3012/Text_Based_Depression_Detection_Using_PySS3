Iâ€™m scaredI feel like Iâ€™m going crazy, everythingâ€™s falling apart and Iâ€™m so overwhelmed 
someone please help me, I donâ€™t want to have to hurt everyone I know
why canâ€™t I just feel better?? why is death the only way to be at peace
why do I have to fight, I just want to be okay
Iâ€™m so fucking tired, I want to be normal, I want this to end
how far is happiness? does it even really exist?
please please help me, what do I do?
