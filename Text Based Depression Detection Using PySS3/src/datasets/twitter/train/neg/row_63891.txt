I want to kill myself because of the body/life god gave me.I dont know if this is the right place to talk about this and if its not im sorry for wasting your time reading this... Where should i start... I hate myself. Im ugly i have a very bad eyesight which forces me to wear glasses, i have fucked up teeth they are yellow and look bad.. also i have braces ... Im 17 years old and only 5 ft 6 i dont think i will grow a beard aswell... my voice is so high pitched that when i talk with people in the internet they ask me if im a girl or a guy. I have really bad genetics i train since 1.5 years now hoping the only possible thing i would every like about myself are my muscles which i dont got. I train for a decent amount of time alrdy and i am still very weak and have very low muscle mass even tho i train good and do the exercises right and i eat good / the right stuff. THAT WAS ONLY ABOUT MY BODY. My psyche is rlly bad... I am an egoistic asshole who drags everyone down i talk to... im rlly dumb i got kicked out of school because i failed class 3 times which means 3 wastes years of my life with trying to do the school but im just too dumb ( not lazy, i learned a lot). I often wanted to kill myself but i just cant do it because im scared of what comes after death.... I really dont know what is left in my worthless life.
