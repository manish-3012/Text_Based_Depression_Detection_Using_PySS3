From the comments of a top post here.."I won't be the one to take my own life, either. Whenever I die, it will most likely be because something happened to me. My reasons for refusing to commit suicide are: 
1) too scared, 
2) do still genuinely enjoy some facets of life, and 
3) some kind of unbreakable force of strength guiding my life at the core that will not be silenced or squashed"


I want to believe there is a reason I feel incapable of concluding my life beyond that of instinctual self preservation or cowardice
