i sabotage myself every damn day and thereâ€™s nothing i can do about itwhat kind of thoughts are these? they tell me iâ€™m worthless, that iâ€™m stupid and no one cares about me. i have friends. both of my parents are alive.  i just twist shit in my head. i make everyone mad at me and i know it. i do it so i have an excuse to feel bad about myself. i know itâ€™s toxic but i just canâ€™t stop. no part of me wants to live to see me graduate, especially after failing last semester. iâ€™m smart. iâ€™m pretty. but iâ€™m worthless.
