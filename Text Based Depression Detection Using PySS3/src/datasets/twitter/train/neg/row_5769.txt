I can't progress, focus, or even try anymore. I'm crippled. And I feel like I just received the last blow I could handle.I'm not mentally healthy for a long time now, but I've always been able to keep myself up and try to power throught it all.

Now my 6+ years girlfriend is ending it with me for no "real" reason, she just don't feel like dating anymore. I can understand her, but it's very hard not to have anything to blame or to see as a reason to it ending, I've been the best boyfriend I could be for the entire time, in all senses, and now I see it going away. I have 24yo now, and I've been in this relationship for my entire adult life. I ain't a person outside of it. 

And now everything I had is getting so much worst because of this, I can't even try to get better since I can't focus on anything at all, even the stuff I use to procrastinate and kill time don't distract me anymore. I can't find anything to hold on to, and suicide is getting more and more real as a alternative. I don't want to talk about this to anybody since I just can't handle those cliche answers from then, and then they will just see me as the broken piece of person I am. So i'm putting this here. Thank you for reading it.
