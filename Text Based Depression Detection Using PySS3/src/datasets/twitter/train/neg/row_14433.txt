...When your mental health was already pooped and now you got to mourn a loss of a close friend whoâ€™s not actually dead but theyâ€™re acting like they are as they completely cut you off. 6 month you tried to keep them alive, just for them to completely cease contact with you and treat you like it all meant nothing. Now it all feels like they have passed, even though they havenâ€™t. And they donâ€™t care that it kills your heart to not know if theyâ€™re ok. Wish I could stop feeling and thinking. I was hurting before and now Iâ€™m hurting more and no one gets it. Pathetic as it is, I just want a hug and for someone to say itâ€™ll be ok. Even though I know it wonâ€™t be but for some reason it would still bring me some comfort. 

Iâ€™ve got no friends to open up to or even discuss things with. Iâ€™m alone, have been for years now. Been fighting all alone all this time. Iâ€™m so tired.
