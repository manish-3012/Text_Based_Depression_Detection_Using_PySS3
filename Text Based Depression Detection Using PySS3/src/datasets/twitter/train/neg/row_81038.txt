Need to help my suicidal coworker!!Hi everyone,

I am not immediately concerned for this woman (Fay 40s F) I work with, as we are both at work and I know while she is here she won't do anything. But I am worried for her after the work day is over.

She has a long list of past difficulties she's dealing with and has been alienated by her entire family and most of her friends. It sounds like she doesn't have (or doesn't think she has) any friends at all. She has therapists and, it sounds like, severe depression. I believe she is being medicated for it.

However, one of Fay's closest friends threatened suicide over the weekend. Fay called the police for a wellness check. Fay's friend was brought to the hospital, but released shortly after. Fay's friend was at work (not the same place Fay and I work) on Monday, but is not at work today. Fay's friend has blocked Fay and gone NC.

Fay is incredibly upset by this and has confided to me that she has a plan for suicide (she has made past attempts and has since modified her plan) and does not want to go home tonight because she will be alone. She said her previous attempts have been spur of the moment. She also said she has informed her therapist about said plan. (What I mean is that this isn't a new thing that has just come up today, it's always been there).

I am obviously very concerned for Fay. I got her to give me her phone number (confirmed it is real) and her home address. I'm thinking I need to call the police for a wellness check on her tonight, but I'm just not sure what to do!! Can anyone help me with some advice??

TL;DR: How to help suicidal coworker??
