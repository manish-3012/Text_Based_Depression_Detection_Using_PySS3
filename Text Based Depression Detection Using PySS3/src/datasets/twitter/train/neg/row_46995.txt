I can't think of many reasons not toLove of my life left me after 26y and got knocked up by a dude she knew for 3 months. He slept with 5 hookers the month before they met so that made me feel like I'm worse than him. After all she left me for something better right?ðŸ˜

I'm basically homeless except for my parents recliner, I have about 200k in debt I can't pay off. Lost 95% of my friends when she left because she made me out to be somone I'm not. 

The only reason I haven't is I tried before and failed. This was 2 years ago. 

Last year I got admitted to a mental health ward for 3 days and all they did was have us sing songs and watch youtubeðŸ‘. 

I don't ever care about what she did anymore really, I just have no reason to go on anymore besides not wanting to hurt anyone.
