It's just easier to kill myselfI just fucked over my best friend. Honestly, most of the time I don't really like her, but I did a shitty thing to her because I was being selfish. And then her boyfriend confronted me about it and called me a piece of trash and he said I was a worse friend than his old friend who sexually assaulted his sister, among other things. I've always thought I was a good person but maybe I'm just as bad as he says I am. I told him what he said made me suicidal and he laughed at me. He said I was just looking for someone to blame. I know I shouldn't put this on him but I really do feel suicidal. I don't think I'd actually do it but I really, really want to right now. I know people care about me and I don't want to make them sad but I just don't want to be alive anymore. Maybe the feeling will go away in a little bit. I mean what's the point in living? You go to school, you get a job, maybe start a family, and then you get old and die. Might as well just speed up the process a bit. I know it sounds stupid to kill myself over such a petty thing but maybe I'm just a bad person and I deserve to die.
