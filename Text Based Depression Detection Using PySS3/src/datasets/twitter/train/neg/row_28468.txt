Today is my birthday......and I just don't care anymore. I'm 21 years old and have never seen a point in living. The only reason I still haven't killed myself is my family and girlfriend. I see people around me who are happy and who have enough motivation to accomplish great things. I never felt that way in my entire life. I don't know why. I'm jealous of every single person who is happy. I'm not saying that I've never was happy, but my happiness usually lasts for a couple of days few times a year. I've never felt any long-term happiness. My dad just yesterday called me a life disaster...

Whenever I start doing something, I never finish it... I don't know why I have such an insane lack of motivation ever since I was little. I'm always anxious about everything, my heart is always pounding and looks like it's going to pop out through my chest. I'm never calm, probably have never been. I have memory issues. What has happened to me that triggered all these things? Can I ever be happy? I think I could, but I really need serious help... I'm scared to talk to anyone at all about how I feel every day. A friend of mine said that I should try visiting a doctor and telling him this all, but I just can't.

I started ignoring a lot of my friends, close friends - only because... I actually don't know why exactly. I'm just fucked up in my head. Help...
