I almost did itI almost did it 8 hours ago and I failed miserably again for the 5th time, and Iâ€™ll probably attempt it again but Iâ€™m too afraid my partner would think itâ€™s her fault when itâ€™s not. I wish I could just do it and get it over with. But Iâ€™m too scared for her I donâ€™t want her to think itâ€™s her fault that Iâ€™m doing this. She hasnâ€™t been but supportive and making me happy but I canâ€™t take this anymore I canâ€™t live anymore Iâ€™m not worth living.
