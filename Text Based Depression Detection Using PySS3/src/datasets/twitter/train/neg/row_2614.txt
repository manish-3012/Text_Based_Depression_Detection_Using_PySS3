I'm fourteen, and ready to dieto everyone i know I am a pretty normal 14 year old guy, my dad is a doctor my mom is a stay-at-home mom who homeschooled me and my three siblings through elementary school. Now I go to a small christian conservative private school, that thinks everyone who goes there is a little christian angel; and for the most part they are right, except for me. my parents are extremely strict, and have sheltered me and my siblings as much as they can from the real world, out of my three siblings i am the only one who seems at all awhere of this. my older brother was a perfect kid and student who has strait As and has never disobayed in his life. I am a different story. iv always been more social than the rest of my family, they dont seem to understand why i want to have and hangout with friends all the time. if i ever told them that i struggle with depression they would wave it off and say im just looking for attention, which is why i havent told them i feel like im in constant pain. and in the past few weeks when ive been home bc of coronavirus spring break and some phisical sickness that had me out of school for a week not a single one of my "friends" has even tried to text me. between that and the normal depression i am really considering trying to OD and end the pain if anyone has any advice can you please help me. i really just need to know there are other people who have delt with this and moved on with there lives.
