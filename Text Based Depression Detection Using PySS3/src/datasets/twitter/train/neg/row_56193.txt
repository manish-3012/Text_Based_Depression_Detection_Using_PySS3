Feeling so lostHere goes nothing,
I'm a recent college graduate dealing with what I suppose is undiagnosed chronic depression. I've dealt with on and off depression since my sophomore year of high school. It comes and goes in doses, but the constant theme is wishing I could fall asleep and not wake back up again. More than anything I feel a sense of guilt, burden, etc when why parents ask me if I am feeling down or if everything is ok. How can I possibly look them in the eyes and say"I can't remember the last time I went a full day without wishing I was dead". I'm a smart kid, in good shape, and have so much ahead of myself, yet for whatever reason I just can't shake this feeling of hopelessness. When I'm prescribed vyvanse, (and take it) I feel like I can do anything. Yet when I finally sober up I just can't help but think of how it's the medication saying that and not my own personal beliefs. I've never posted anything via Reddit so I guess I'm really throwing darts. Maybe someone else can relate to this. Sorry if you've just wasted your time reading it :/
