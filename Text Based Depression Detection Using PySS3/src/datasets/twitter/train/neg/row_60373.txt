If I have to earn my escape from Hell, then I don't deserve it.I'm just tired. Tired of being exhausted, tired if being alone, tired of working a shitty job. No one can do anything for me. Help is someone telling you to work harder than you currently are. I'd rather die at this point. Doctors just want to sell you pills and keep visits short. Your relationship with your family is what you give up for them. 

My life has been universally shit and I exist to work until I'm dead. I would rather be dead than continue on with this lie. Fuck me. I have no room in my heart for hope.
