Iâ€™m going to do it next Monday morningMy life is beyond recovery. I have failed beyond comprehension despite being given every opportunity and more to succeed. I canâ€™t go on I am worthless. I have failed. There is nothing that can be done at this point, I have disappointed my family, friends, and my department. 

I am going to visit home for Easter this weekend. While I am there I am going to purchase ammunition for the rifle I inherited from my uncle, itâ€™s an antique from the First World War but I spent two years restoring it and now it will finally get to be used for something besides target shooting. Iâ€™m going to load the rifle and ammo into the back of my car before I drive back down early Monday morning. I am going to wrap the case in towels so I wonâ€™t be stopped while I enter the hall housing the geology department that gave me the only reason I had to live. I will walk up to the office door of the professor who has been my guide and mentor for years and I have so miserably failed.  I will place the bit of the rifle on the ground and kneel in front of the door and pull the trigger.

This is not a cry for help, this is a shameful confession on a throwaway account. Allow me to be erased from history, that is my only request.
