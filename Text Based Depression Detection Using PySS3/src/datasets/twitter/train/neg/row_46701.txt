Suicide as I Understand itI know suicide quite well. I have come close many times. No have never actually hurt myself with the intention of ending my life nor have I swallowed an entire bottle of pills with the same aim, but I have stood alone on the rooftop on the tip of the edge willing myself to take one more step. Despite the desire of my mind I was never able to do so.

I believe people who contemplate suicide possess greater inner strength than those who do not. I believe they are much truer to themselves as people and are more aware of their wants, needs, and the inner most desires or their hearts. It is this longing for something greater that drives people like me into despair and those, like me, who possess great minds, are at even greater risk because the act itself can be more easily contemplated and in greater detail.

I believe the contemplation of suicide is a sort of inner journey every man worth his salt must take at some point. It was only by standing on the edge of that roof looking at the Philadelphia skyline, actually noticing its beauty, that I discovered a piece of myself. I did not realize it at the time but I see it in myself now as plain as day. Its hard to say who is stronger; the man who takes action and follows through with his plan to end himself because he doesnâ€™t see hope for his future or the man who sees no hope but decides to endure anyway.

It is because of my understanding of this condition that I no longer grieve for people who kill themselves. Much like the Japanese Shogunate, I see it as an honorable act. I do not pity those who go this route. I respect their decision in almost every way and I find myself loving them even more because of it.

Thank you for reading.
