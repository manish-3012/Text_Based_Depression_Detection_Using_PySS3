Just got to get through todayThis weekend is the worst my head has been for years. I have a nice life, comparatively. I have friends that say they care about me. But even on the good days it feels like I am just plodding forward into oblivion. 

My job isnâ€™t even that hard but Iâ€™m dreading going to it because Iâ€™ll have to speak to people, and smile. One of them called me cheerful the other day, the act is good but it takes so much energy.

I know Iâ€™ve got to focus on something small and positive. Just got to get through today then I can play Zelda. Just got to get through today then I can go the gym. Iâ€™ve been doing it for years. 

How many more times will I have to say to myself â€œJust got to get through todayâ€.  How many more times do I have to bargain with my own mind? I feel like I canâ€™t keep it up. Itâ€™s so draining. If I live an average amount of time I might have to say it thirty thousand more times. How does anybody not find that overwhelming?
