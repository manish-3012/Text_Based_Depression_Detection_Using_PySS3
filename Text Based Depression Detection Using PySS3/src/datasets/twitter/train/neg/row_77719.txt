I've been questioning itThis is a throw away account but.. I been having heavy thoughts of just checking out.   I'm just tired of the stress and the thoughts i've been dealing with and I won't be leaving a letter behind cause i have nothing to write down.  I have a plan on how it's going to happen and maybe let a single person know.  Almost thirty i've tried before when i was younger as stated im just tired of fighting to get back and being a burden and being the unhappy one.   I already tried to do what made me happy i have no interest in them or they are not providing the stress relief that they gave... just trying to turn the corner.  Its just getting tougher.
