I'm so tired of living. I'm so alone. I tried talking to a few friends today...and I just don't have the will to keep up the friendships. I want to die too badly.I'm tired. I'm alone. I have no hope, dreams, or loves. 

I wish I had never been born....or at leats, that I had the balls to kill myself now.

I even fail at that. 

To my friends....it'll be a while, but I'm sorry for when you hear. you'll be better off without me. M would understand that, at least.
