Life is literally getting darker every dayI dont know if this is the right sub, I just need a place to vent right now.

So, I dont know where to start. I have been depressed for over 6 years now, but always managed to see the good things in life. But for the last 2 months it got worse. I randomly have the urge to just cry all day long. I've just been holding it back, which probably isn't such a good idea. Also, I still live with my mom, and every time I get home, she just yells at me. In the last 3 weeks I got really tired. As soon as I get home I just lay down in bed and try to relax, and even my vision is getting darker I think. I dont know what's going on with me and i dont think I can keep going much longer.
