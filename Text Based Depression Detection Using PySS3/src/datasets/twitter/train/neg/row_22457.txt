No one cares and no one ever willI am sick and tired of people pretending they care about my achievements or creations. I'm giving up on my hobbies. I don't enjoy anything anymore and honestly enjoy staring at the wall more. No one cares about the time I put into stuff. "Good job" "looks great". Yeah right
