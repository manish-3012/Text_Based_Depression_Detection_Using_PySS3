If I die then I won't have to have responsibilities.I can't cope today, all the bad feelings are back and they're really heavy.

The house is a complete mess due to me having a bad week so far. My partner seems annoyed at me, I would be too. How pathetic is it to be "too sad" to keep a clean home? He said he is very tired from work and I need to do something to help.

My thoughts are stupid and completely irrational. I can't even sit with the idea of washing one cup let alone tidying the entire house.. I'm sitting here wishing I was dying or dead in order to stop thinking, to stop having responsibilities, to stop having to exist.

It's pathetic, no wonder he has no sympathy for me. I'm disgusting and lazy and selfish. I don't feel like I deserve to breathe anymore whilst other people are out working hard. 

I don't even want to leave the house to stock up on pills. My patheticness is that bad, I can't even get the energy to commit suicide.
