My brothers suicide attemptSo yesterday my older brother attempted suicide by overdose on paracetamol. Luckily it was caught before any damage had happened. He was taken to hospital and put on a drip.

He has been drinking and taking drugs everyday for about 3 months now. So has obviously developed an alcohol addiction and drug addiction and needs to go to rehab like the doctor in the hospital recommended but he refused to go.

Suffering from depression myself I completely understand why he done it so this isn't a question of how to understand him better.

I'm asking where do I go from here? Where can he get help? How can I help him?

We live in Scotland but he doesn't want to go down the road of prescription drugs so what would be best to do?
