I don't want to deal with any of thisI've been crying myself to sleep almost every night. I feel like I'm living in a constant state of agony. 

My mom spends all of our money. She's put us almost 2k dollars in debt. My dad is almost 60 and still works outside doing heavy labor. He's literally killing himself.

My mom is on SSI because of various health issues, and due to surgeries when I was younger, became an addict. I literally do not trust her anymore and when I hear even a little bit of a slur in her voice I feel like I'm falling apart. 

She doesn't take care of herself, she's overweight. She complains about how sick she is and just eats like shit all the time. 

I can't handle it anymore. I've blown up on her every day for the past 4 days because I don't know what to do anymore. I just burst into tears and asked her to please just stop spending money of bullshit. When I went into my room she asked if I was dead yet. 

I literally don't want to live anymore. My life is fucking hell.
