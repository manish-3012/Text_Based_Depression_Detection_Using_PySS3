its agony knowing i'll never be enoughI've spent almost my entire life feeling like I'm bottom tier. The last pick, the worst choice, the one nobody would ever want. I'm never anyone's preference, or first choice and I'm definitely not worth fighting for. No one has ever stuck around for the long haul not even my own family.

All I've ever dreamed of is to love somebody. to have just one best friend, at least, who would always be open and receptive of my love. But I guess that's too much to ask for, especially coming from someone as unattractive and worthless as me. I've found people who I *thought* cared about me before. People like my former best friends or my dad or even my (ex?) boyfriend. But they always leave. Why isn't my love good enough?

I've spent years trying to figure out the answer to that question and trying to fix it. but now I feel like the only thing to fix is my own existence. I wish I never existed in the first place, I feel like a waste of oxygen and I feel so sorry for every burdening anyone with my my feelings that don't matter anyway. I just have no reason to try anymore. I've asked the universe and it told me "you're not worth it". There are a lot of things I think I'll never understand like why i'm not good enough when so many people are.  But I  just didn't win the lottery and I can accept my fate without choosing to withstand it. 

thank you for reading and sharing this experience with me.
