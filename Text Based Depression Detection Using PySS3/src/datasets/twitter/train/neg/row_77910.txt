I can't make them suffer.I'm a 15 year old girl, a freshman in high school.  I have two friends who I've known since kindergarten, and they mean so much to me.  One of my friends is depressed and has a lot of problems within her family, and the other is going through a lot, even though she won't tell me anything about it.  Then there's my family, who has already gone through so much pain.  I can't stand the idea of hurting them, or putting them through more pain then they've already had to go through, but I'm suffering.

Every day is a living hell, and it's not getting any better.  So far, it's just gotten worse.  Suicide is on my mind the majority of the day, but I just can't do it.  I can't make them suffer like I've been suffering for so long.

It hurts, and I don't know how much longer I can bear the torture that is life.  I don't know what to do anymore.  It hurts so, so much.
