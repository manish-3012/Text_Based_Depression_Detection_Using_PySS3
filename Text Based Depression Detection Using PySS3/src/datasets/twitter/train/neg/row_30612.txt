No one even wants me around anymoreI'm 17 and I don't have a job. My education is down the shitter. I'm too stupid. Just a burden on everyone else. My mum almost told me today that I might as well kill myself she stopped half way through saying it. I miss being a kid. No one expected you to have a job. And school back then was just colours and shapes. Now if you fall behind they abandon you and leave you to rot. My mind is pretty much all rotted out. All that's left for me is to do is rid everyone of myself.
