How to be happyWho the hell knows. Drugs and alcohol don't work because the "happiness" they bring is just artificial, it isn't true happiness. And other people can't give real joy to you. You have to be able to love yourself before you can love someone else and you sure as hell have to love yourself before others will love you. I really wish I knew what it's like to have someone love me, I wish even more I could love myself. I just fucked up the only actual friendship I have because I'm too pathetic to be able to work out my own issues without drinking myself to death. I came so close to liking myself, too. Back to square one I guess, I gotta just keep trying different ways to be happy. I still am following my deadline of "happy by my next birthday or I kill myself" because otherwise what's the point. Once I sober up it's back to the drawing board
