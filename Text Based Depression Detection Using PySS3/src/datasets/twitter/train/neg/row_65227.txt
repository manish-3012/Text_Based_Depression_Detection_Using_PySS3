Please someone take me seriously. Train or lake in next hour.I'm not looking for attention, or manipulation of thrills. I've posted a few things here tonight. I'm just a person that is at a train station, looking over the lake. One of the is the best end. I have no, no, no idea how to handle this. Lake or train? Scared
