No one is awake to listen soTW: i dont feel like censoring anything so sh, suicidal thoughts, etc 

I have the absolute irresistible urge to kill myself right now, but I canâ€™t do shit because Iâ€™m terrified of dying alone. Or dying period. But the pain of living and the urge itself is too fucking excruciating. 

I tried cutting myself to curb the urge. I cut my arm for fucks sake, which in my 8ish years of struggling with sh Iâ€™ve never done. 

Im so fucking tired and everything hurts. I canâ€™t tell if itâ€™s 2017 or 2020 anymore because everything is going back to that time which it canâ€™t it canâ€™t I wonâ€™t survive it again I can hardly do so now 

Please... I just want this all to end
