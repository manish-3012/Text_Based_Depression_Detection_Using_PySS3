I'm gonna end my life.I've survived 4 years of depression and anxiety. School is not going good. I cry everyday and have a addiction. Teachers are so mad at me and I'm mad at them because I've depression and they don't help me and they say go to work but if I'm depressed I can't work anymore and the only thing I can think is: Try suicide, You don't deserve to life. How can I communicate when I'm locked in my own body? The body is prison, when you're dead then you're not locked anymore. I've damaged many things at school because I've autism and get really fast mad at everyone. 

I know nobody will help me out. I'm gonna try commit suicide soon. Wish me luck.
