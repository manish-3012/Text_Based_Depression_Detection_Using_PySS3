what ever who cares anymore Who cares about my grades? No one 
Who cares that I did something great with my life? No one 
Who cares about how I feel? No one
Why do I get out of bed in the morning? To see the only thing I have not ruined yet
Why do I not just pull the trigger and splatter my brains all over my room? Because I don't want to hurt anyone I want to die but I know I would hurt my family I know it doesn't make sense I just said they don't care about me but they would care if I died but I don't they wouldn't care 
Some other things I want to talk about: why does the color of my skin determine what group I can hang out with 
Why does it seam that no matter how good I am at something no one ever notices? 
I don't know what to do anymore I am fucking sick if being ignored and the only time I am not ignored is when people stop to tell me how fat I am or ugly I am or stupid I am or how much I fucked something up 
I just don't know how to put up with it anymore i just want to go to sleep and never wake up
