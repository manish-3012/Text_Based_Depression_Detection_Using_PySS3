I hate lifeI was unstable before 2020 but I started a therapy course this year that dug up a lot of shit for me. Memories have come flooding back about stuff that I had buried and I would be better off if they stayed that way. Now im dealing with the memory of being molested by my friends boyfriend while she watched and did nothing. I have tried talking to my parents but they always get mad and  tell me to choose happy so i've stopped sharing with them. I am only sad when im alone and the worst part is that all my dreams for a couple of months have been me reliving these moments over and over again. I have friends that support me but they can't always be there for me and this is when everything always comes up. I cried myself to sleep last night just wanting a hug. I don't know how to be happy or where to start the journey to being happy again.
