It should be amazingI've been in a major depressive episode since I lost my job in November of 2016.  It turns out that even though I'm just a year or so away from menopause and also taking birth control on the regular I'm somehow pregnant.  I found out yesterday &amp; I can't tell my husband.  Because of the morning sickness/depression combo even getting out of bed is not happening and he keeps saying 'You'd better not be pregnant'.  We terminated an unwanted pregnancy &gt;10 years ago and I don't think I could go through another but at the same time my life is worthless.  I can't find a job, I can't afford a child and every day I want to die a little more.  I tried to hang myself with a bath robe belt on New Years but it didn't work.  I just can't keep on like this and bringing a child into it would just make everything worse for us/me even though I've always wanted to be a mother.
