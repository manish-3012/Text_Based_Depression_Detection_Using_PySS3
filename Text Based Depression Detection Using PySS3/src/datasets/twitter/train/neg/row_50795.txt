When you ask for help, then get yelled at after an attempt with â€œwhy didnâ€™t you ask for help?â€I did. Explicitly. Literally hundreds of times. 

â€œI am suicidal and I could really use some support.â€

Having a therapist is fine and good, but sheâ€™s my only friend right now. Sheâ€™s the ONLY supportive human being out of the thousands of human beings with which Iâ€™ve ever interacted. And she gets paid to be supportive, soooo... is that the only way I can get humans to care about me? I guess Iâ€™m too poor to be loved.

I just want to end it. Iâ€™ve heard I could do a whole bottle of ZzzQuil and thatâ€™d be like falling asleep.  Idk, that sounds better than something like a gun. I could pass it off as just being stupid and accidentally overdosing (my family knows I have insomnia and I sometimes take two doses to get any sleep, so itâ€™s not that far out). 

Iâ€™m just so sick of going through hell and having no one. And I am mad as fuck at all the people who saw how much I was hurting and did nothing. Iâ€™ve even been blocked for asking for help/ support. So, tbh, Iâ€™m doing this because Iâ€™m angry, too. Why the fuck did the adults around me just do nothing? 

Tired of suffering. Iâ€™m not living for anything except my dog. But sheâ€™ll get over it.
