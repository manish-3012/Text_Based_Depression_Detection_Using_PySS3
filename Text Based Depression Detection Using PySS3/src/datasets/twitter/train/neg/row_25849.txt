Does anyone else fear of a possible afterlife?It's probably due to my parents, being religious and shit, and scaring the fuck out of me in the past, but noe that i'm getting older and stronger... that fear still remains in me.

Does anybody else kinda fear of a possible afterlife?
If not... could you tell me how to remove that shit out of my mind, so i could die easier.
