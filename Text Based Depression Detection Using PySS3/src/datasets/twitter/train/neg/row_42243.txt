a reason to not commit suicide?Hi, I just made a new account to write_x001B_ here. Anyways, I;ve been depressed for about 5 years, and I'm 15 years old right now. I tried committing suicide about 4 months ago but it failed, and after that got on medication and asked for help. 

But it didn't help, and it rather was just a waste of time and money.

I really dont want to live anymore. It seems like nothing else can help me out of my own self exept for killing myself. There's nothing quite wrong with my life, I think most of it was cleared away, but it;s my own brain and mind that is just constantly going me those thoughts and it feels like a habit now. 

Im thinking of commiting suicide again, but haven't decided yet. I think jumping off a building would be my best chance, but I dont know what to do. 

I have noone to talk to and I dont really think my friends are someone I can talk to. I had a person that I met online, but I think that I've been causing too much trouble for him, so I'm trying to keep my distance 

I'm just a total failure and I dont think my parents should support me anymore.
