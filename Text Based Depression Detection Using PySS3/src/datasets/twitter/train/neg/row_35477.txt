I'm scared of the afterlife and that's the only reason I'm still aliveI'm 15 btw in case you are wondering. 

The only thing stopping me from killing myself is the fact that I have no idea what'll happen to me after I die. Like, reincarnation, spirit, or just gone? I deserve death, if anyone does. I have so many narcissistic traits, I'm a liar, and everyone has given up on me. and don't tell me to make new friends because of that. I don't WANT new friends. I want the same friends I have now.

 I'm giving myself false hope by saying that they will talk to me again sometime. I go to a therapeutic school in which there are 2 high schools. One of my friends goes to school with me, and we talk all the time when were together. 

But we came back to school for ONE FUCKING WEEK before the whole school closed down for no reason. Now we don't talk. 

Why live if nobody needs me here?
