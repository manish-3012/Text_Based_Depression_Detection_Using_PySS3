Done with lifeLife is just getting me down. Existing is just about all I do. I don't have a job. I only have 2 grand and i live with my parents. I got my associate's degree in visual art and got into a good art school. I decided not to go because I started to feel like art school and art in general was not realistic and pursuing a degree in it felt like bullshit. So now I haven't made art or feel like it's even important. I'm confused as to why I ever thought it was a good idea. I just don't feel interested in it. So now I don't know what to do.  Suicide is always going through my head. I wake up irritated that I'm still alive. I've been in treatment recently for about 6 months for depression and nothing helps. I just don't find any joy in life. I don't know what I'm supposed to do I just don't give a fuck about anything and nothing appeals to me. I feel stupid and boring and confused as to who I really am because I don't enjoy anything. I'm Considering gambling to see if I can just hit it big
