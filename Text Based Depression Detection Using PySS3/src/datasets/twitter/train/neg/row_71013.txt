I donâ€™t know anymoreIâ€™ve written notes, I donâ€™t know anymore, at this point the littlest shit I do wrong makes me want to end it all, who even cares how, like when I was in school after a test once I just stared at my pencil and poked my eyelids, wanting to jab it in, I feel trapped, in my own stupidity, I know somewhere in there I have some sort of drive, reason Iâ€™m still here but I think Iâ€™m losing it. I genuinely donâ€™t even know what I was going to write anymore, I lose track of things, I donâ€™t remember things, sometimes important things, I know Iâ€™m intelligent, I can remember things when I need them and some of my class averages are over 100% but at the same time Iâ€™m retarded, book knowledge isnâ€™t necessarily the best knowledge, and if someone asks me what weâ€™re learning in school I have no idea. I have three different I dunno, filters. I hav the one at school with my guy friends, ya know, cursing and bad jokes and shit, when Iâ€™m with my female friends I donâ€™t curse, almost canâ€™t, and am decently polite, but around family but especially around strangers I act very polite, good posture, yes maâ€™amâ€™s and all that jazz, but when Iâ€™m with myself, alone with my thoughts and nothing to distract, I drift to think about suicide, and why I havenâ€™t ended it all. I guess thatâ€™s four but, why should I care. Iâ€™m too much of a wuss to do it too, even if I legitimately didnâ€™t have anything to live for I still might not pull the trigger, I just donâ€™t know.
