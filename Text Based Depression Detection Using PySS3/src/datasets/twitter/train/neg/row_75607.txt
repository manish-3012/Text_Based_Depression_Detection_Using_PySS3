I never thought Iâ€™d think of suicideBut I just probably hurt and devastated my most cherished friend, she didnâ€™t deserve it, I didnâ€™t deserve it, I always fuck up the best parts of my life itâ€™s becoming a pattern at this point, I donâ€™t know what sheâ€™s about to say Iâ€™m waiting for a response, but I donâ€™t know what to do if she says she doesnâ€™t want to talk to me anymore.
