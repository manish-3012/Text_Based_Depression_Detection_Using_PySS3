A warranted suicideI havenâ€™t been diagnosed with depression or any technical mental illness so this hasnâ€™t been an impulsive decision based on temporary feelings. I was diagnosed with crps 4 months ago. Itâ€™s a chronic pain condition that according to what Iâ€™ve been reading involves slow loss of function of all 4 limbs, potentially the entire body. So far mine is just in my right ankle bone, but I havenâ€™t walked since November. My case also appears to be treatment resistant and The doctor wonâ€™t prescribe me with pain medications or do any palliative care as Iâ€™m 27. 

I have decided that If the condition doesnâ€™t make any improvements by June 1, 2020 that Iâ€™m going to either commit suicide or just do a bunch of risky things with high fatalities and let nature take its course as thatâ€™s the date I will have move out of my apartment. Iâ€™ve tried taking up indoor hobbies like knitting and watching tv but thatâ€™s not the life that I want. I donâ€™t want to be disabled and I donâ€™t want to be dependent on those around me. I Want to just get a wheelchair and be permanently disabled, but the physical therapist and doctor wonâ€™t let me do that. So I basically have no quality of life with no potential for improvement. This disease is even nicknamed â€œsuicide disease.â€
