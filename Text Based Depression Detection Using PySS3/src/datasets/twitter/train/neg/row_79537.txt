I'm on a never ending guilt trip of a life, it's so frustrating.I've never told anyone my problems, ever. Guys don't do that. So to suppress my emotions I decided to eat. Instead of telling my parents or doctors about my emotional struggles I nod my head and agree whenever they tell me I need to lose weight. I've convinced my family that I'm fine, and that I just eat because I'm lazy. 

Truth is, I'm reaching 600 pounds at age 22 and totally wanna kill myself. I want to get better, but at the same time I don't.

If I kill myself suddenly I know my parents would be heartbroken. If I don't kill myself and ask for help, I would feel ashamed, they would still feel guilty, and I would feel like a bigger burden than I already am. Which would make me want to kill myself even more. 

Sorry for posting this, I'm having an episode. Probably not gonna kill myself, just airing it out. God I really hope there is no afterlife. Last thing I wanna do is die and have to confront my family like they do in anime.
