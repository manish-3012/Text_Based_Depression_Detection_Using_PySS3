I think I'm finally ready to kill myselfIn the last year alone, I've lost my dad, separated from my wife (who now says she doesn't want to bother to try anymore), racked up thousands upon thousands of dollars of debt and in the last two months have had two heart attacks. That was about a month ago and when I got out of the hospital they sent me home with a bunch of new prescriptions that I will now be on for the rest of my life. Within two weeks of being home from the hospital, I have received several thousands of dollars worth of bills from the hospitals and ambulance and to top it all off when I went to go get my prescriptions refilled today I found out it is over $500 a month just for the co-pays on my prescriptions. I have been suicidal for a very long time, on top of everything else I have spinal issues neck issues hip issues and just severe pain 24/7 which I'm also on medication for. I don't have any energy left in me to continue to try anymore and just get through life I don't really have anything left to live for and if it's just going to be racking up debt and wallowing in misery from my pain there's no point to try and continue. My birthday is on Friday, I think I'm going to do it then.
