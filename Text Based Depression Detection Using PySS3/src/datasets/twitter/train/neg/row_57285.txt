The thought of suicide calms meI fail so much. I am constantly overwhelmed bc I feel like Iâ€™m wasting life. I have no energy left to do things or to focus. Three months ago I had the best grades in all of my classes, I had friends, and I was successful at losing weight. And then I fucked it all up and donâ€™t even go to an actual school, I interact with no one, and somehow while eating less than ever Iâ€™m not losing enough. I wasnâ€™t happy at either times but at least I wasnâ€™t a disappointment back then. Now the future is so scary, that I have stop thinking of it as a reality. It calms me when I think I ending my life. I donâ€™t know when I would do it. I donâ€™t always feel the need. But knowing that I just stop it all gives me peace. Idk if thatâ€™s sick of me think. I find myself thinking that thought more and more. Itâ€™s the only thing that eases my mind anymore.
