I just fucking hate people"I missed you", they said. But then, if they really missed so much, why couldn't they just talk to me? Fucking asshole egoists, I hate them all, false friends

I always feel so bad and have suicidal thoughts because of others, because there's not even a single person careing about me and it really hurts.

Why does it have to be so hard to have even 1 true friend, who'll never leave you alone ;(
