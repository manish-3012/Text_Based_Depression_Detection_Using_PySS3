My best friend died today.She died instantly in a freak accident with an eighteen wheeler and slippery roads. They say it was painless for her, but for everyone else it's painful. It's the first time I'm dealing with the death of someone so close to me. She was the person you could talk to for hours about anything, and tell her anything without her judging. She was only 17. She was such a beautiful person, and I'm relapsing into depression and suicidal thoughts. I'm trying my hardest not to commit, but I'm starting to make plans and cut deeper and deeper. I loved her so much, and she was ripped out of everyone's lives too soon. I'll always love you Savannah â¤ï¸
