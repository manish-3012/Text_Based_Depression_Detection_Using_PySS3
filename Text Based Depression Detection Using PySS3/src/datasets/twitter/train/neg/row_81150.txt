I'm going to failI'm going to fail university. I can't go anymore. The thought of attempting paralyzes me. I can't find work, so I won't get any financial support if I fail or take a break or leave. I'll be homeless and worthless. 

I found a mole on the back of my head. Maybe I won't have to kill myself. Maybe it'll be a melanoma and I'll find myself terminal. I'll never have to worry about someone finding me dead by my own hand. I won't have to hurt anyone, and I won't hurt anymore. It's the best case scenario. I'll refuse treatment. I'll die. And they will mourn. But it will just be a medical issue. Not a suicide. So nobody can feel hurt by me choosing to go.
