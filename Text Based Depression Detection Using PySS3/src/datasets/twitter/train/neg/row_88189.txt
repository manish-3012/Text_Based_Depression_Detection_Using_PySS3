Best friend just revealed to me that he almost attempted suicideI was hanging out with my friend tonight just drinking a bit when he told me that he almost attempted suicide a week ago. He told me he was about to down all of his antidepressants when his girlfriend walked in and saw what he was about to do. I've personally experienced thoughts of suicide in the past. I don't think about it anymore, but I was really depressed a few years ago. I've put a .44 magnum into my mouth before. I Never put my finger on the trigger and I don't think I ever seriously considered killing myself. I used to have thoughts of suicide for a while though. What should I do? I'm thinking about just texting him and telling him that I've been in the same position as him before. I'm doing a lot better now and that wouldn't have happened if I killed myself. Is there anything more that I can or should do? He has told me that he thought about how his suicide would affect other people and he would never attempt it again. He also goes to a therapist every week and he has told them about the incident. Still, I can't say that I trust that he isn't going to try again. Should I leave my personal history out of it?
