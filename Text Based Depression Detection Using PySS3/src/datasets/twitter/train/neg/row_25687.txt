Sooner or later, I drive everyone awayI'm a bad person.  I try not to be, but I am.  I'm manipulative, insensitive, bitter, angry, sad, resentful, hateful, etc.  No girl will ever want anything to do with me.  I will drive all my friends away eventually.  I always do.  I will always end up in the same place eventually: alone, drunk, and angry.  Before that happens I'm preventing it once and for all.  There is no need to try and stop me.  I'm using this post as a note for my family.  I'm sorry.  Goodbye
