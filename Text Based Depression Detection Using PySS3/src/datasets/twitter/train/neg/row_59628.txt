Dark thoughts showed up last night, never actually had these beforeI'm currently going through a rough patch of life. I think I've been dealing with low levels of depression for a while, but I haven't gone to see anyone about it since it wasn't unbearable and I felt like I was working through things ok.

Anyway, so the gist of what's going on in my life has been chronic pain that puts me through an injury cycle of injury, recovery, rebuild and repeat. My husband and I have been going through some rough spots in our marriage, and he works so much that I don't see him very often. I know his work is overwhelming him and that's why he seems so disconnected. But I sometimes take it personally. I've also lost most of my friends, so I spend a large amount of my time alone. My job (massage therapist) is isolating as well as I don't work with other therapists, and many times my clients don't want to chit chat so I spend most of my working days working quietly in a dark room as well.

This weekend has been our biggest event of the year at work (country club, our biggest golf tournament) and I've been doing complimentary massage all weekend which is both physically and emotionally/energetically draining. Last night was the hardest of all the days and by the time I went home I was done. Husband worked late and then had agreed to meet up with a friend for drinks afterwards, so he came home around 2am way after I went to sleep. While I was laying in bed getting ready to go to sleep I suddenly had an urge to go to the bathroom and take all the naproxen I had left in the cabinet. The only thing that stopped me was knowing how upset my dog would be as he's very in tune with my emotions, and I'm his person.

I just looked up thoughts of suicide on google, as that urge has never been anything that I've ever experienced before and it was a little unsettling. The articles I found were all common sense, but I thought as someone in that state of mind, not very helpful. For example: you're not alone, you would cause grief to others, someone would miss you. Which, logically I know all this. But sometimes I wonder if anyone would even notice if I just disappeared. I'm not even close to actually doing anything to myself. And I think I might try to find myself a therapist and get some help. But it was so bizarre I needed to tell someone, and I have no one to tell.
