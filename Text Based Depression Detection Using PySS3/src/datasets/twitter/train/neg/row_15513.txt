Attempted June 22nd. Still here.Recently gone through some life changes that I was more or less making it through. I accidentally missed a couple of days of my antidepressants and tried to end my life by drinking half a bottle of codeine and polishing off large amounts of liquor and alcohol. I left a note but ended up waking up about 16 hours later. I feel disappointed that i got to that stage, and that it didnâ€™t work. Feeling closer and closer to that place again each day.
