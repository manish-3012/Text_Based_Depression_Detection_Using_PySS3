I like such a disappointment to everybody"Suicidal"
It's such a scary word, but the meaning behind it represents how I feel. 
I've always just wanted to be appreciated, to have someone feel proud about me.
I'm taking Duel Enrollment College (In the future, if there is one for me.) And my parents don't bat a single eye, but it feels like the second I mess something up or don't want to drop what I'm doing immediately, to go work on home improvement, then I'm just a lazy, selfish, disappointment. 
Day after day I listen to my parents complain to me about each other, "He doesn't realize how much I work" "she's lazy and wants me to do everything". It wears me away, the way I get screamed and yelled at for thing I have no control  over. 
Maybe I'm not "Suicidal enough", the fact that I'm not standing over a noose at this moment means my issues aren't worth being here. But for a few months now, the thought of ending it all just seems more and more present in my mind.

I can't tell anyone. I can't explain it but I just can't tell anyone in my life about this. I just need to say this, somewhere in someway. Maybe this will keep those thoughts at bay for a while.
