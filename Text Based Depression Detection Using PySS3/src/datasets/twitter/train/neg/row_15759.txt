So out of place here.Iâ€™m a 46 year old female and Iâ€™m hurting. Iâ€™m hurting a lot. Iâ€™m divorced twice. While I have a friend group, Iâ€™m frequently left out. 

Ie fb invites to events that they know I have no way of going to. Ex. Come to this party 4 hours away where you need a ride and a hotel. I ask for a ride. Crickets.   Moving on. . 

Iâ€™m over weight, balding for a female this is super fun. 

Iâ€™m in a slightly above minimum wage job, with no real room for advancement and at 46, I donâ€™t see any way to start over.  

Iâ€™ve been single for 3 years now, Iâ€™ve got what I thought were cute pics on the various dating apps, still, nothing. Iâ€™ve been on 1 date in 3 years. 

Again at 46, Iâ€™m just so lost and feel abandoned by everyone.   
I donâ€™t want to be taking up space anymore. 
I just feel done. Like I lived all I should.
