It happens tonighti live in a modest housefold, 2 brothers, a mother and a father. but tonight im going to end it. im in highschool, almost done with my senior year.
im just glad there is a way to get this off my chest.
i feel alot like the way im doing it isnt going to work. im just afraid i will wake up tomorrow.
my plan is to stap a gas mask to my mouth and nose and run a helium tank into it, i hope i can stand long enough to pass out before i resist too much, im thinking of duct taping my hands to stop me.
again, thanks
