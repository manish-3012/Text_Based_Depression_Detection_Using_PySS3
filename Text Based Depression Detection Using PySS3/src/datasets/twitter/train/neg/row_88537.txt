I turned down an offer to go hiking with my family todayThis post is an aimless mess, heads up. Anyway my sister is in town for today only so my mom and brother took her hiking. I could have gone too, but decided to stay at home and sleep instead. I got some drawing done at least, but -- bleh -- none of it looks right. 
 
Last year I made a plan to kill myself after going on a trip to somewhere I'd always wanted to go. But I didn't go through with the suicide. I just came back and moved in with my mom. Not a day has passed where I've felt confident that I made the right choice. 
 
Sometimes I wish that I weren't so irrationally afraid of death so that I could just get out of this useless goddamn body. But I am afraid, and I'm not gonna kill myself any time soon. So all you assholes who get your words of encouragement at CostCo just so you can feel good about yourselves need not respond. 
 
Actually no one should respond. Neither party will get anything of value out of it. I don't know what I'm looking for by posting this. I never do lol. 
 
Bleh
