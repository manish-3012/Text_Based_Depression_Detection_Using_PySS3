Survived a suicide attempt.I was born prematurely and I survived a stroke which caused a traumatic brain injury and I have a long list of mental health issues and physical health issues. I live in constant pain and I donâ€™t sleep. Itâ€™s been a long lonely road. Full of sadness and being lonely. So just know that you all matter. So donâ€™t you dare end your life. Because it ruins more than you think.
