I honestly hate my life, and I'm not sure I care.It's odd.  I think I've come to the conclusion that I hate my life.  Idk if I'm actually suicidal right now, so maybe this should go somewhere else but this is where I am so oh well.

I just don't enjoy my life, I know that there are people that I bring enjoyment to.  I know I'm changing lives with my work (literally making children happier)  I know my mother wants/needs me, and my wife may want me as well.  But I can't bring myself to actually have feelings toured these things in my life any more.

I'm not chrisitian, and I don't know if theres a higher being and I don't honestly care.  

I don't feel right in my body (I'm like 95% if not more I'm trans), and I HATE my self image.

I kinda just want someone to talk to, someone that I don't know. someone thats down to earth and will just talk about random shit with cause I'm so feed up with my life I just want an escape.

This isn't my main account, I have friends and fam who know my main account and I don't want them seeing this.
