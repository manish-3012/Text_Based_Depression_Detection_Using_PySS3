At the endIâ€™m sitting in a hospital wanting to be home.  I have surgery for cancer tomorrow and I donâ€™t want to do it.  I just want to move to Belize and just shut myself out from anyone and everyone.  I have felt so much pain and I have nothing.  I am struggling to find a reason to go through with it.  And people say you get to live.  And that is a terrible choice.  Because I donâ€™t.  I am so heart broken.   So lost.  And I feel like my life doesnâ€™t matter.  I am so goddamn lonely that my family wonâ€™t even come with me for life threaten surgery.  I just want to go.  And have peace my final days.
