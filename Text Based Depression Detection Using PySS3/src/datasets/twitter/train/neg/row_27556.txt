I keep fighting but the current carries me awayNo matter what I do Iâ€™m always drowning. But this time I want it to end. Tomorrow Is my last day in this life. Idk whatâ€™s on the other side but I donâ€™t care. Itâ€™s my time and Iâ€™m done fighting the voices in my head. Maybe theyâ€™re right. Maybe I should kill myself I know Iâ€™m worthless I know Iâ€™m heading nowhere. There is nothing for me
