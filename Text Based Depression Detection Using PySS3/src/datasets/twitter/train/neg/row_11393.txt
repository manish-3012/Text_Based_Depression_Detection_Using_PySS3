19 year old. Physics major. Wants to die.I have been depressed my whole life. I can't seem to get good grades in college, and even though I have "friends" and in a sorority, I feel so alone. I can't seem to do anything right, and after 19 years, it's hard to believe that things will ever get better. I really want to kill myself, but I know that would hurt my parents and brother so much. So now, I'm just wandering, hoping to somehow die. I don't care anymore, I can't find the motivation to do anything, and I just want to say, "fuck family, they should understand." If anyone could help me feel better, that would be nice.
