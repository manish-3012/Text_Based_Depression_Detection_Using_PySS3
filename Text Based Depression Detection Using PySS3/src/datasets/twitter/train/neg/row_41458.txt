I can't stand that nothing makes senseEven if I reached happiness people would still be killing themselves because they feel the opposite, being ok meanwhile others are going through hell seems horrible to me...

Other than that everything is just too messed up. I don't have a family, no education, no true friends, from a fucked up country and am broke. The only good things I got is good looks and youth, no anything else, what the fuck could I even expect from this shit? 

I'm a fucking pathetic joke, only worth of pity
