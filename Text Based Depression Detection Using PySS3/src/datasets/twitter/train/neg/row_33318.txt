I called the national suicide hotline number but they didn't help me at allI kept crying and stuff

its not fair ;______________;

its not fair ;____________________;

my bro already smokes me less weed than he does and my dad keeps telling me to only drink one beer at a bar very very slowly and just sip it and slowly sip it (easy for him to say, he drinks scotch all night and day at the house, I don't have any alcohol at the house.)

now the volume is loud for game of thrones and the bass is on I can hear it upstairs

and 

I told them I want the bass on and this volume this loud when I watch my show tonight (Toonami) and they said no they're sleeping then

its no fair ;___;

the person on the suicide hotline kept agreeing with me that it's "not fair" for like 45 minutes and then I just hang up cuz they weren't really saying anything new
