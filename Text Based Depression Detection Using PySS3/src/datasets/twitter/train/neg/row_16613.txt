Glad to know my life a jokeI don't have the best relationship with my mother.
     And we had yet another argument, where she expressed her real feelings towards me, calling me a "Huge disgrace" then she acted like nothing had happened and a few mins later proceeds to ask me what I wanted for my lunch. 
    So I decided to tell my close friends about the argument word for word. But all the could focus on was how she asked if I wanted food.
    I tried to explain again and tried to tell them that because it happens so often it's damaging and makes me feel lonely.
    And they just replied that I should write a book and that they would all buy it because all my "crazy stories" would be funny..
   So I'm currently in the worst placent mentally than ever before and now my life just one big joke. Awesome.
