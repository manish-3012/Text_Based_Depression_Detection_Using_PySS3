Is there someone that doesn't mind to chat a bit ?i'm a 17 years old male, and well, i've been like this for 5 years now, and it didn't get better at all, it's just gone worse and worse. And honestly, i'm at my lowest right now, well, i'm writing this while trying to hang myself with a belt. 

I really didn't have a rough life at all, i feel like i don't deserve to be here, that i don't deserve to complain about it. But well, i still do it, i'm such a worthless pathetic human being, i probably deserve to die, but if death mean happiness for me, then, do i really deserve to die ? Do i really deserve to be happy ? Probably not. 

It's been a while since i last posted here (not on this account), and well, posting here made me encounter plenty of helpful people. But well, i think that because i'm at my lowest, i need another one. 

Honestly, all i want to do is making the hanging successful, and i really see no other way out. I think that i'm just too deep into mental health problems that dying is the only way.
