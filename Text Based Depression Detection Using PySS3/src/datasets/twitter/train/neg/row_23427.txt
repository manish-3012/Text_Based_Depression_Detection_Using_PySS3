Drove on my own for the first time todayDrove on my own for the first time today. It was ok going there but I went back at night and I was very close to having a panic attack.

I was getting thoughts telling me to swerve the car on the freeway or speed up as fast as I can and then jump out the door. I was gripping the steering wheel as hard as I could kind of just making sure I didn't let go and open the door or swerve. Later on I got some really bad derealization and I almost convinced myself I was in a video game ðŸ˜¬.

And yeah. I would *love* to jump out of the car at 80 mph and die. But I don't want to try because I'm afraid I wouldn't die, and everything would be worse. I would be injured, I would lose my parents trust that I've spent so long trying to build up after they found out about... Everything.

I'm getting really close. I'm getting more control and more trust. Someday I'll be able to kill myself and be sure that it'll work. But until then, I can't afford to make any mistakes.
