What could bring someone to Suicide ?Hello, my name is Jed Im 17 years old and etc..

Im not really The kind to look at psychological problems,But i was really  wondering, i wanted to get educated about suicide , so i was thinking  "what could bring someone to suicide ?"

Is it Mostly Abuse?
Is it Society ?
Is it betrayals? 
Is it Depression?
Is it Sometimes delusions?
Is it Somekind of Phsychologic illness? or does it have Legit reasons for Someone mentally healthy to feel suicidal?
Is it Unfairness? And what kind of unfairness?
Is it only bad things that start it ? what about Stars that have way too much attention the ones that get into drugs and destroy themselves , is that some kind of suicidal deppression? Like having too much to handle?
And for the last question
I had sometimes the feeling of jumping out of a high place Exemple :
Like when i was on the roof of a tall building i just suddenly wanted to jump off, run a bit to the edge and suddenly stopped i don't know what really happened, i Was wondering if that is  my suicidal subconscient or just something that people feel just out of the blue?

Please excuse my horrible english,And hopefully this post doesn't seem like Half-hearted im really interested in suicide lately (Not that i want to suicide But mostly want to know how suicide works on someones Mind)
And mostly i really do want to help those people... 
But to do that i just need to understand them first, right?.

Thank You.
