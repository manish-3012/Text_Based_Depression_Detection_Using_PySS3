I'm a burden to everyoneI don't think I deserve to be alive but I don't have the willpower to kill myself. All I ever do is push away the people who care about me so that eventually I'll have nobody left to be hurt when I finally do it. 

I can't go a week without forgetting to pay a bill or missing an appointment or forgetting to finish something I was supposed to, and the people who care about me suffer because of it. They tell me I'm not a burden, but that's just objectively not true. My presence in people's lives leaves them worse off than better.

That's not to say I don't create anything positive, only that I create more negative. That makes it harder to deal with, because I give people just enough reason to think I'm redeemable and not a terrible person before I pull out the rug and fuck them over again.

My parents have supported me for so long, and all I've got to show for it is almost failing out of an amazing university. They're paying rent on an apartment at school, even though I probably won't be able to go back, and now they want to pay for a place for me to live here. WHY? Why on earth do they keep making these sacrifices? I'm not worth that. Eventually I'm just gonna fuck that up as well.
I have an interview Friday that I'm totally unprepared for, and never will be. Just another in a long series of disappointments. 

There's no good way for me to solve my life. 

If I kill myself, I'll hurt the people that care about me, so I can't, at least, not yet. All that's left for me to do is keep failing and burning the relationships I have left, until they all do what they should and give up on me. Then nobody will be left to feel hurt by my death. Hell, maybe they'll even be relieved I'm gone.
