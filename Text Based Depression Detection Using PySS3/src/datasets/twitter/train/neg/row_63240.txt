What reasons do I have to live?My girlfriend gets fucking angry at me every other day for being an incompetent useless annoying piece of shit, I have a handful of friends who I never get to see, in general I'm an ugly disgusting waste of life and I want to hurt myself constantly. Also I've done evil things in the past which no amount of redemption can make up for so essentially I am an evil person and I can never change that.

In every respect I deserve pain and death.
