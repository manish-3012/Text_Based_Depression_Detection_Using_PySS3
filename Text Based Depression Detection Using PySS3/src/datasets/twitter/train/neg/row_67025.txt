Someone I met online has a issuesSo about a month ago I met this girl named Ashley she lives in a different state is than I do. She was dating this guy when we met. But I figured out when she sent me a picture of her face, that there where bruises. We discussed this and I found out it was her boyfriend. I talked her into leaving him, but I can't talk her into getting help. He's the type of guy who will seriously hurt someone if not stopped. She told me that at school he came up to her and choked her and said "I love you, I'm sorry". He keeps hurting her and about 6 minutes ago he told her to put a bullet through her head. I can't convenience her to get help. I'm really afraid if she doesn't soon, something bad might happen to her. I told her to talk to her school councilor, but all she seems to do is tell me and only me(not even her parents). I'm in a lot of stress with school and valentines day and I need some help from you reddit people. Please if this is the wrong post please don't delete it and send me a link to the right one...
