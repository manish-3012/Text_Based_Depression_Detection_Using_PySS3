Does it really matter if I go?18f. Not good at anything. Spend most of my spare time in bed. Grades at school suck balls because I am horribly lazy. Never done a hard days work in my life and don't know how to change my work ethic because I think it's pointless. I feel annoyed that the cycle seems to be just push through depression, get an education so you have a better chance at a job in this stupid, shallow, consumerist society that probably causes depression in the first place. I'd be using up a lot less of the Earth's precious resources if I go.
Suggestions on how to get rid of feelings of worthlessness would be very much appreciated. I think it's great that so many of you are willing to listen to people's heavy depressing problems on here in order to help them &lt;3
