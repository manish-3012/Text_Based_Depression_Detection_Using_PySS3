Thank God for sleeping pills.I've been undergoing severe depression for about a year now. I've been in an abusive relationship and I've had to go to the hospital numerous times over his abuse. He broke my arm once and gave me more black eyes than I can count. He called me ugly all the time and that he was the only one who would ever tolerate me. He's in jail right now awaiting trail after he beat me in front of his parents. 

I don't want to live. I can't see the point. What the fuck is there to live for?
