Just doneI donâ€™t want to post in the thread about what exactly is going on in case someone I know in real life find this, but Iâ€™m pretty much just...done. No matter what I do or try I just make everything worse, everyone hates me and doesnâ€™t give a shit about me at all. Iâ€™ve pretty much have had no one outside of work talk to me in a month, Iâ€™ve tried to reach out to people and everyone just ignores me. All of this just makes my depression even worse, Iâ€™ve tried before to end it and at this point I just donâ€™t see the point in continuing to try and do anything. Nothing ever goes my way and I donâ€™t see any point to even trying anymore
