I just can't go on anymoreI'm 22 years old, lost my job in October, lost my health insurance in January. Lost my car last week. I've been suicidal for a long time, but now I know I want to go over the edge. My first attempt was when I was 12 and I tried to tape the other end of the noose to the ceiling of my room. I tried again when I was 16 with painkillers and alcohol but that didn't work, I just puked my brains out.

I have a girlfriend who would rather stream with her friends and goof off then talk to me. When I told her I was feeling depressed and was thinking about suicide in a call she hung up and told me she couldn't deal with that. My family doesn't fucking care about me, they never have. 

I sent my girlfriend a Valentine's gift while she's in college and I didn't get anything back, not even a fucking smiley face. Oh but she had plenty of time to draw personal valentines for her fucking friends.

Nobody fucking cares about me, I've already written up a will for when I do it. All my shit is to be burned. My suicide note is just a big middle finger on paper.

I'm tired of this shit, my anti depressants don't work and when I asked my doctor to change he laughed and said mine were fine. 

I'm a fucking joke. I'm the bad punchline.

I hope they can still laugh at me when I'm dead.
