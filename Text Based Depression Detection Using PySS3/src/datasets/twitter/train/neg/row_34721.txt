Goodbye.I'm going to go buy smokes now, go come and talk to my mom, walk back out, buy a rope and hang myself on a tree at a park. 

I'm not going to bother listing my reasons, I'm just not. Believe me, I wanted to live. But God and the Universe didn't intend for me to. 

Also, dont bother commenting or messaging me, I'm not going to read them anyways. I doubt anyone would even comment, considering all my calls for help have been ignored, but if you do. Just don't. 

Goodbye.
