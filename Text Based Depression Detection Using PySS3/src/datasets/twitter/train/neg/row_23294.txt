So i think it was camus who said that the meaning of life is whatever preventing you from killing yourself.The quote may not be correct word by word but the gist is there. Do whatever that makes you keep going instead of killing yourself.

I dont know about others, but my life has literally no meaning. Biologically, logically, economically, whatever-ly, zero meaning unless- im useful for others to generate profit. So i am just a modern day slave and a bag of meat and bones.

That is not the only reason, the lack of meaning of my life that is, why i am so inclined to killing myself rather than bettering my life.

Anyways, i dont know what im saying but recently like for the last few months, spending money has apparently become the meaning of my life. I am bleeding money. Hemorrhaging. I spent three months of salary to buy shits i dont need. And I bought a lot of them. And then destroy them and throw then away. Ha, i dont even use things i bought. 

One day i would run out and guess i can kill myself then? I dont know. I dont know what to live for.
