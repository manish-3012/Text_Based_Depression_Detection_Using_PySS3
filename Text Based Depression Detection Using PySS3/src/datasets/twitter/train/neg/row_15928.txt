That depressing little voice in my head has been telling me to kill myself all week.I also have a job interview tomorrow, and my overall mood just sucks... I'm unmotivated, exhausted, and not the most social I can be &amp; I can't shake these suicidal thoughts out of my head.... I tried a bunch of stuff this past week, like exercising, reading a book, and talking to family and yet I'm still torn by the idea of ending my life. I feel trapped in them and I don't know what to do about it. I'm nervous for this interview too, how can I perform well in this state? better yet, what happens if I do get the job, are these thoughts going to fuck with me all the time?
