Brain Injury and SuicideFirst, let me say I'm not using a throwaway. For all the the things I hate about myself, I still take pride in honesty.

I'm not going into detail about my TBI. We tend to over-share. I'll just say I suffered retrograde and anterograde amnesia and still feel the ripples a decade later. Even with medication, I can't curb the depression or the loneliness. I've never met anyone who has gone what I've gone through. Not in any of my support groups. Not anywhere. My given family is long dead. My wife might as well be from another planet. I'm only still here because of my kids. Each night, I ask if f that's enough. Can they do better than a broken father?

I have a long family history of suicide. I have an exit plan, however, I don't know what I can attribute to the TBI or perhaps to  bipolar. The result is the same.

TL:DR -There is something chemically or physically broken in my brain. Talking won't fix it.

Thanks for listening. Putting it in writing, sincerely helps.
