Which suicide is most lethal? And my plans for suicide (rant)I think that the guillotine is the most full proof method (unless it's not sharp) because you are basically headless so 99% chance you be dead with this. But personally I'd just lie on the tracks in front of incoming train and put my neck on the rail so it slices my head off, minimum pain almost instant death. Consider I live very near trainstation it won't be a problem to find a turn or part of the tracks that is hard to see. Probably just write a latter one leave at home other in my wallet. Thinking about it it's pretty easy, I even can think of a place, very long railroad with plenty of bushes. Just wait for a train and when it's close lie down on it and let it slice my neck and since it's gonna have some speed it won't be able to break that fast like in the turns where the trains go slower. Wow, this should be very easy.... Well, other one is just taking a backpack full of vodka and going to the woods with my butterfly knife or dagger, drinking some vodka to numb the pain and get myself to actually doing since sober I wouldn't have the guts, and just slice my neck at the artery and then keep stabbing into my throat as much as I could before loosing consciousness and passing out, this mothod might be better since I wouldn't make someone as traumatised like the driver and as I would decompose I would at least fertilise the forest a bit, the only useful thing I would do in my entire life. After all, I am just a parasite that cost a fortune to feed and only makes problems, everyone would be much better without me.
