Not sure what to doHi guys,

This is a throwaway account.

Iâ€™m a 30 yro, working at 6 digits annual income. When I was a teen I had a low moment in life (breakup) in which I thought of suicide and did some self harm, but these habits subsided with time.

Last year I was very close to a burnout (if not actually) and eventually changed to a new company. I moved back from abroad to my home country in the process too.

Things arenâ€™t good at work. Iâ€™m having lousy performance (my fault), destroyed the good rep I had with several peers and dislike the company Iâ€™m currently at 

Personally my life is in shambles. Iâ€™m out of touch with close family and friends, no SO for two years after a very toxic relationship of three yrs and donâ€™t even have a drive to change that.

Health wise Iâ€™m also at low point, consuming too much junk food and barely exercising. Also some other issues are on the back of my mind.

Following a bad week &amp; day at work, Iâ€™m feeling as if all of this came to a perfect storm and am questioning my role in life, society and itâ€™s usefulness. I tried reaching out to friends all week but everyone was busy - my only social interaction worth noting was with my psychologist. Donâ€™t get me wrong, Iâ€™m not a loner or an introvert, just poor luck this week.

On one hand I feel like quitting my job, taking a break in life, and starting fresh but am afraid of financial consequences. I donâ€™t want to go around unemployed begging for work nor to be financially stressed because I donâ€™t have money. Iâ€™m 30 and rent requires a job to get paid. The unemployment benefit id get e 1/5th of my salary (thatâ€™s how above average it is)

On the other hand, Iâ€™m feeling a lot of my old suicidal thoughts suddenly coming back as if something awoke them and made them real. I feel itâ€™s hard to live with myself due to my personality and donâ€™t see any point in life anymore. My work used to excite me but I find it dull; I used to care about having someone special but feel society and relationships in general are just not worth it anymore.

How to I make myself stop thinking this is the best way out?

Kind regards,
T
