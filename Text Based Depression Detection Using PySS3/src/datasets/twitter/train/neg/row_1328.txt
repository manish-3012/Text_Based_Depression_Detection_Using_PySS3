Goodbye everyone. ðŸ–¤Ive just swallowed my stash of oxycodone / xanax / valium. I've just taken 900mg dxm too. Surprisingly, I'm in a clear headspace for the first time in years. I've tried my hardest. I know nobody can see, but believe me I gave it everything. I just wanted to let my beautiful daughter and wife know how sorry I am for doing this.  I wouldn't wish this on anyone and I hope you know how sorry I am for doing this.

I hope that one day, when you are older, you will understand and be able to forgive me Melody. I know I wasn't the best father, husband, brother or son. I love you guys more than anything. You guys mean the world to me. Danielle, thank you for being there for me through thick and thin. There isn't a woman alive as strong as you, and I know you will get through this.

I'm beyond sorry, and I love you guys more than anything. I hope you know that. Goodbye ðŸ–¤
