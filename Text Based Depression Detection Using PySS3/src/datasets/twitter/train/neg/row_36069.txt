Suicide at 17I plan to commit suicide in these next few days, it's all planned out so hopefully I succeed this time. I just want to get away from my sick mind. No one believes me, I honestly don't think I'm real right now. No one listens, no one cares. My body feels o full of pressure, I need to break something, a bone or something... I don't know it just hurts. My heart hurts. I tried. I really tried. I'm not giving up mum, I'm just doing what's best for me. This isn't a good life for me, I'm sorry. I keep going in and out of a delusional state I just don't want live like this anymore. I feel so alone
