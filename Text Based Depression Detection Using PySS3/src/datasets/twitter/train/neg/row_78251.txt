I am close to suicide. Please listen and offer some adviceI have had terrible OCD recently, I'm losing my mind and I have gotten terrible depression because of it. It's a hard condition to explain so if you are curious just look it up. It has gotten to the point where I can't take it anymore and I want to kill myself. The only thing stopping me is lack of methods and I want some dignity if I do it. I could get medication for it but since I was four I have wanted to be a Marine. If I have any history of anxiety I'm instantly disqualified from service, even if I talk to a doctor. So the only thing I can do is suffer or give up on my dream. It leaves me in a bad position where I can't find out what to do. I pray every night for help and get nothing. My faith has been almost destroyed. I'm considering driving my bike for a 30 minute ride to my local Catholic church and beg for help. Or talk to a priest since I can seek no help. A large forrest and conservation is nearby, I've considered killing myself out there so to my family it's like I just disappeared one day to make it easier. Can I get some ideas and advice, maybe a word of comfort. I'd appreciate some peaceful suicide methods as well, sorry if that sounds dark. I'm in a bad position. Please help.
