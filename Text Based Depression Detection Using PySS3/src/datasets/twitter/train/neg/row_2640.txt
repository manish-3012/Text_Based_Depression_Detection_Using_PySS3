What do you do when you realize you are stuck and you wasted your entire life.Every night before work I realize how much I hate my life.  I can't change because I need the money, but many times I feel like I would rather be homeless.  I get ridiculed and harassed at work, while I carry their efficiency.  It is a small company and there is no HR department for me to express this to.  I make significantly more money here than I would at any other job that is easy to obtain.  I have wasted my life getting stuck at this place full of assholes, I often wish I had a gun to know that I won't have to go to work the next day.
