Boyfriend (23M) tried to kill himself after I ended our relationship today. He is unresponsive and has had surgeries. I (20F) feel empty and suicidal now. I canâ€™t live with myself anymore.Weâ€™re long distance. Iâ€™ve been trying to end it for a while (mostly not in healthy ways). Every time I tried to, he would tell me he would kill himself. He said it so many times I stopped believing him (he did cut sometimes) &amp; his words became meaningless. Breaking up with him is impossible, and I tried to. But he wouldnâ€™t let me, and I had to pretend we were okay so he would go back home to the paramedics to patch him up and his roomies. I talked to him just barely before he ended the call because I wanted to sleep and not talk. After that, I thought the only way to stop the relationship was by ghosting him and blocking everywhere. My mental health has been declining, and I needed to do whatâ€™s best for me. To try at least. Shortly after, he went missing; then, he tried to kill himself. I got emails, calls and texts saying he killed himself. I found out when I woke up by a bunch of people. Now he just finished three surgeries and is unresponsive. Donâ€™t know yet what will happen. I feel sick to my stomach. The past 13 hours have been hell. I canâ€™t handle this. I canâ€™t take it. I love him a lot. I didnâ€™t want this at all. Apart from me wants to end it and fuck it all with my life, but a lot of me wants to go and make sure heâ€™s okay and stay with him  (Iâ€™m in Canada, and heâ€™s in the US). 

I seriously donâ€™t think I can live with myself. I want to kill myself. I canâ€™t handle this. If he gets to, then I do too. I canâ€™t do this. I canâ€™t live with this. I hate myself. I seriously have nothing to live for. Iâ€™m the cruellest and insensitive person. I donâ€™t even deserve to live. I think Iâ€™m going to do it and I know-how. I hate myself. I have never hated myself more.
