Goodbye Cruel WorldHey! I lost both my parents in January and then got depressed. I started using a bunch of painkillers and tranquilizers and then one day I forgot my name. I spent 2 weeks in the hospital substance abuse program and then a few months later I had to spend 3 weeks there again for a relapse. I just want to escape this world once and for all. I donâ€™t understand why I have to be here when I donâ€™t want to be. I am in a relapse program now but Iâ€™m so depressed I canâ€™t stand it. Iâ€™m listening to REMâ€™s Everybody Hurts right now and itâ€™s not helping me. I just want to say goodbye once and for all. Iâ€™m tired of life.
