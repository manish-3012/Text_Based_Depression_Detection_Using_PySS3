The suicide helpline chat doesn't workI stayed in queue for half and hour snd answered the survey. The chat doesn't let you type. I need help. I got drunk alone to get the courage. Atleast I can finally cry now. I'm so drunk and scared

None of my friends or family get it. Everything is ok on the surface. Just need to end this
