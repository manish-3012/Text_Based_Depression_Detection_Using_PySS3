I just admitted to my brother that I have frequent suicidal thoughtsI'm not sure why I told him that earlier today. We're both adults and he's 3 years elder to me but I've always dealt with my issues on my own. 
I think about ending my life almost everyday,sometimes the urge is stronger than usual. I feel guilty for telling him about it because I feel like a burden and it also feels weird letting him in like that.  I try not to show my vulnerability especially to my family and revealing this to my brother has left me muddled . I think I regret it. 
Idk how I'm supposed to feel
