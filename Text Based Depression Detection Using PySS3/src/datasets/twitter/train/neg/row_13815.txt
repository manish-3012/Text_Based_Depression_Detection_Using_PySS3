Should I tell my boyfriend?I have been very depressed for the past few months now, and have been having frequent thoughts of hurting or killing myself. I am afraid to talk about this with my boyfriend, because I don't want to scare him. I feel like I have already put so much emotional weight on his shoulders...I don't have good reasons for these thoughts and cannot explain them.  I am getting professional help, and am not currently planning anything drastic, but I can't stop thinking about it. What should I do? I feel so stupid for feeling this way, but I can't help it.

EDIT: You are all right that I absolutely should tell him - I think I already knew that. Do you have any advice about how to bring it up?
