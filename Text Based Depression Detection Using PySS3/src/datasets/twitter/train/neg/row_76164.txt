A guy on r/morbidreality has me worried...so, I was browsing /r/morbidreality and I came across this [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/MorbidReality/comments/1dox3s/i_saw_my_mothers_suicide_attempt_and_how_it/) from a fellow redditor. I am worried for his safety, and I thought you guys here might be able to help, because I don't know what to do...

To summarize what is going on: He basically says he might kill himself in the next few weeks, and he seems to have a plan for carrying it out. He seems to have had a rough life, and I believe English is not his first language.

I hope we can help him out
