After an ugly fight, Iâ€™m debating between homelessness and suicide.To start things off, my life hasnâ€™t been the best. 

After being bullied as a kid, I was forced to move with my (abusive) mom to Missouri for middle school and high school. I was still bullied, still mentally ill, still disabled, etc. To make matters worse, we were homeless twice. 

A year ago, my mom got arrested. With me being underage, I was sent to live with my dad in my hometown. Itâ€™s been fine for the most part. Like any parent and child, we donâ€™t necessarily agree on everything, but our fights are definitely ugly. Tonight was probably the worst of them all. 

He flat out called me selfish, lazy, and all around stupid for not getting a job and allegedly spending his money. After that, he tried to guilt trip me by saying that he wonâ€™t be around forever, and that heâ€™s only â€œtoughening me upâ€ by yelling at me. After he caught me crying, he called me a crybaby and told me to man the fuck up.

During all of that, I had an anxiety attack. I initially started thinking about running away and being homeless again, living in the streets and stealing to survive. I also started to think about killing myself â€” if I did it, I wouldnâ€™t be an inconvenience to him or anyone, really. 

Iâ€™m seriously considering just taking his rifle and blowing my brains out.
