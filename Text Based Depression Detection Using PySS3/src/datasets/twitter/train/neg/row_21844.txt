I have a 2 yr old son. Help..please.I just posted in the subreddit depression,  but this is probably where i need to be. I want to die. I have too much to handle in my life and i can't ever see it really getting better. I find myself sabotaging the good things in my life lately...almost on purpose?  Or maybe for one desperate last cry for help? I only worry for my son, is he better off without a severly depressed mother?
