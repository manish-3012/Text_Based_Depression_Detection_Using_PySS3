I need a friend or something.Hi...I don't know how to start..Uhm...I guess I can say I'm 16 and female. I guess you can say I have a pretty nice life. I can't complain about much. I have a boyfriend(long distance) and my parents are still together. I used to have friends but they all found someone else better to hang with. Everybody around me says I'm to fat(which hurts a lot). My boyfriend just hung up on me saying I'm "fucking frustrating" b/c I wouldn't sleep...but that's b/c I just wanted to spend a little time with him. I guess he didn't want to spend time with me. I'm also a waitress and my uniform is short sleeve...I use to cut(a few years ago) most of my scars have healed just a few darker lines but those are barely noticeable. The other day my sister got me a cute little bunny...but her nails are a bit long and she scratched me on my arms(but I still love my bunny...she's so cute :))but today when I was giving my customer their food I noticed the scratches on my arms and it made me think about how I use to cut. And today after my bf hung up on me I started thinking...why am I still here? I can't do anything..I'm completely worthless..all people ever do is complain about everything I'm doing and call me fat. Nd now I'm frustrating...now I just feel like I should just die...but then I told myself that's not the way to think ur better then that bla bla bla...so I texted my friends...and no one replied back...and I don't know..I just want someone to talk to right now so I can get these feeling out of myself...I don't want to cut, I don't want to kill myself...well...I do...but I know it's wrong and I don't know...I really don't know anymore...I just need a friend....I feel so lonely....
