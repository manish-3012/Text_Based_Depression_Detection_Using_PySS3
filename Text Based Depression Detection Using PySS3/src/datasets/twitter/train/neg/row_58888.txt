I'm doing it tonightI'm tired of fighting everyone and everything. My health is getting worse, both mental and physical. I have zero support. My doctor said its going to be months before I can see a professional about my depression. I just cant fight anymore, I'm drained. I know the spot in going to end my suffering, I'll do it tonight when my family is asleep. I'm ready to die
