My anxiety and depression are getting so bad.Lately my anxiety has been so fucking bad, it's hard to leave my apartment, and on a lot of days where I don't have work it can be hard to leave my bed.  I've been trying to keep myself from calling out, because I don't want to leave my coworkers without someone, but it's been really hard not to lately.

I feel like everyone hates me, and when I step out of my apartment I feel like everyone's looking at me.  I'm worried that I've fucked up every relationship I have even though I know rationally that's not even remotely true, and I literally haven't done anything that would ruin my relationships.

I feel like I'm on the verge of suicide, and I know that I need to check myself into the hospital, but even then I have this constant sense of imposter syndrome telling me I'm not actually depressed and I'm just looking for attention.

I almost went to the hospital yesterday, but I was overwhelmed by anxiety about the smallest things like where am I going to leave my car when I'm there? My roommate doesn't get home from his trip for another few days, who's going to feed my cat?  I need to pay rent in a little bit, how am I going to do that if I'm in the hospital?  And even just the dumbest shit like whether or not I should comb my hair before going because if I comb my hair they'll think I'm functional enough to not be admitted, but if I don't comb my hair it'll look like I'm trying to play the part of a depressed person and they'll send me home.

I have to go to work in an hour, and just getting out of bed without crying is really hard right now, I'm not sure I can make it through a full eight hours.
