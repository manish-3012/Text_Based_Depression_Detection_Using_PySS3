Iâ€™m too much of a pussyIâ€™m alone, I could do it, I have every reason to. I canâ€™t. Iâ€™m too afraid of what comes after, of leaving what little I have behind.

I donâ€™t deserve to be alive. I have no future. Thereâ€™s nothing to stay for, anyways. Nobody loves me. My mother would rather keep her relationship with the man who molested me than keep her relationship with me. Iâ€™ve pissed all my friends off. My anxiety will prevent me from ever being able to hold down a job or be a productive member of society. The guy I was in love with blocked me from every source. I just want to talk to him; I just want to make things okay again. But nothing will ever be okay again.
