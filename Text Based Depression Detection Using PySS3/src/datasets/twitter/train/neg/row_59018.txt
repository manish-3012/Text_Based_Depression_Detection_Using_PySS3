Can't take it anymore. Don't want it anymore.Feel lame for posting what I feel like is just an attention seeking cry for help but I'm also feeling dangerously more depressed than usual and have no other outlet to go to.

I've been suffering with depression, anxiety, and mental illness for the better part of 20 years. Have been on almost every antidepressant, anti-anxiety, anti-psychotic and mood stabilizing medication you can think of, and endless combinations of them mixed and matched together. None have helped. Have been hospitalized five times in my life for suicide attempts, twice in the past six months at a state mental hospital. Only made me feel worse. Been in professional therapy for just as long and it's a waste of time for everyone involved.

I've been diagnosed with autism just recently at the age of 30 and have likely been struggling with it for years. I am consumed by stress, anger, and hatred, and am on the verge of being an alcoholic if I'm not one already. I'm in a large amount of debt and have a shitty unfulfilling job with no health insurance so my options are limited to cheap and often inefficient uncaring providers. I have no real friends and my very limited family understands nothing of mental illness and would only care if I was gone due to the inconveniences it would cause them. 

I don't want it anymore. I feel like I don't truly want to get better. I don't enjoy life, and I'm tired of the constant uphill struggle for no reward. I didn't ask for any of this and I just want out. I'm not equipped to deal with it anymore...I never was. I'm angry and hurt and scared and don't know what to do. I refuse to go back to the hospital, I will choose death any day of the week over that bullshit.

I'm sorry. I feel foolish to post this at all. I wish this on no one.
