The only thing that kept me happy is done after only a month. I want to die.Basically, I had a band. I went completely out of my comfort zone looking for people on Craigslist and when i found some we all got close and had fun playing together. One of my two friends doesnt want to be in a band anymore because it stresses her out and she thinks our styles are too different and I don't want to keep her there because I want her happy. Ive just really wanted to be in a band my whole life and I was really happy with these people. I wouldn't be happy forming a band with other people after how close I've gotten with these people and I'm just totally shattered. We wont hang out as often if at all since theres no more practice and I just can't go back to being alone. My happiness is always fucking temporary and I can't do this anymore. I'm sad because I was having fun and I think that's all that really kept me from wanting to die for the past month and I'm afraid of going back to being alone and sad all the time and I feel shitty because every time I think that Maybe things are looking up for me and going to work out and maybe I deserve to be happy something always ends up happening to ruin it and Now I'm back to being afraid that nobody will ever want to make music with me again and that I'll have to be alone again and trying to distract myself from how fucking upset I am and I never found anything that made me so happy before now and now its gone and I'm just completely done with even trying.
