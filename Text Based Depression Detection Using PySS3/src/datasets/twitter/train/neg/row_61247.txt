I think I'm ready.I think I'm at peace with the idea. I've lost all hope. I've tried to help myself, but I keep failing. I don't see a future for myself. I think some people just don't belong here. Does anyone here truly believe that everyone can be fixed? Aren't there some people who're completely ruined? As in, I'm sub-consciously ruining my life. I've started to block everyone out of my life and even though everyone thinks things are okay, I think I'm done here.

EDIT: I'm going to grab some coffee, do homework, and take more time to think this over. I probably won't reply anymore, but thank you for anyone who posted. I think this is just something I have to figure out on my own. I'm awaiting a reply from the Samaritans, so hopefully something good comes of that.
