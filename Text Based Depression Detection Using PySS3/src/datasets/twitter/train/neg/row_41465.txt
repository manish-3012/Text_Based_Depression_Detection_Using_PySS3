I think about suicide too muchIâ€™m not sure if this is the correct place to post in since Iâ€™m not exactly considering suicide but I thought this subreddit was convenient enough.

Iâ€™ve been thinking about suicide way too much. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m depressed and I donâ€™t want to claim to be. Iâ€™m well aware there are many many people that are suffering way more than me, but the thought just never leaves my mind. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll ever do it but it does affect me negatively. I tend to feel really guilty about it because it makes me feel like Iâ€™m ungrateful for the life I have. I live in a good home and my parents are really good to me most of the time at least, I have really close friends I could count on so I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m like this.
Iâ€™m 17, and Iâ€™ve been having these thoughts ever since I was 9. In the past, it was a more serious thing, as I wouldnâ€™t only consider it but I would do things like kind of pull my leg over a window or hold a knife in my hand and point it to myself before realizing â€œI donâ€™t actually want to do thisâ€ and stop.

Rbf, my life was trash as a kid so itâ€™s understandable I guess but as the years went on, I got better. My life has changed a lot and I became stronger and happier. 
Now I try my best to be a positive person. But these thoughts just never leave my mind. On worse days I would stand near the metro train tracks and have to walk back a little just because they look so tempting to jump out in front of. 
I know Iâ€™m not going to do it. Iâ€™ve recently become more religious and I wouldnâ€™t want to scar the people I care about, though thatâ€™s been more difficult as those people recently seriously shrunk in number and there werenâ€™t that many to begin with.
I donâ€™t know what the future is going to look like, I donâ€™t know how these thoughts will develop.  Iâ€™m fine for now at least.
I canâ€™t go see a doctor because my parents wouldnâ€™t believe thereâ€™s something wrong with me, so I canâ€™t be exactly sure why Iâ€™m having these thoughts so often. Maybe itâ€™s a result of exhaustion? Lack of sleep possibly? It does tend to occur on more stressful days.
Maybe this is more normal than I think it is, I donâ€™t know.
Since I canâ€™t see a professional. Reddit is always the next best option to vent in.
