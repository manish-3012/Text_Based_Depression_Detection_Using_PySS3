This is game over for me nowMy partner who I love dearly and is my bestfriend and my rock has been cheating on me and wants me out our apartment now. (Iâ€™m not on the least) I have nowhere to go. No friends no family and I work a shitty construction job 50+ hours a week and I still canâ€™t afford to even live on my own. Iâ€™m fucked. They were my world and they went out tonight and said theyâ€™re going to go fuck someone and Iâ€™m just here in the room drinking. I looked for rooms for rent on apps and everything thereâ€™s nothing even close to what I can afford. So Iâ€™m just going to kill myself. I have a gun I keep for protection and it feels weird to use it to end my life but thatâ€™s it. This world is cruel and not for people with kind hearts I understand now. Iâ€™m only posting this because I have no one else to tell it to so goodbye. I hope whoever reads this has a better live then me.
