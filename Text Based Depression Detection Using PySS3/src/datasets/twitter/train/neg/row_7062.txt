Iâ€™m constantly sad and I donâ€™t know what the problem isIt all seems hopeless. I canâ€™t think positive. Itâ€™s all negative. Everything is just tumbling down everyday. 

I canâ€™t send one small message to people from my school without wanting to unsend the message straight away or delete my account to start again. Itâ€™s all so fucked. 

I tell myself itâ€™s a small thing and that I donâ€™t care but my brain goes otherwise. I just want to be okay. Turn back time.
