I donâ€™t knowI was born without any motivation, nothing truly interests me I spend my life just barely getting by. I canâ€™t stop thinking about all the mistakes Iâ€™ve made. Most days I am in a state of constant panic attackâ€™s. I know from expierence that suicide messes with the people around you. Is it better then burdening them for the rest of my life?
