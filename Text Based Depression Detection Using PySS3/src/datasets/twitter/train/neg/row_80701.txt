I'm at the end of my ropeI've been going to counseling now for at least 8 months and it has done jack squat.
I graduated over 2 years ago with a bachelors degree and still have no permanent job. I am down to working 2 retail jobs to barely make ends meat and get health insurance and a 3rd so that I can live closer to my jobs and to my "friends" if you want to call them that. The main job makes me feel even more cruder then I already beat myself up to be. I just don't care anymore if I die because I can't afford my life-saving medicine from not having health insurance. There are so many smarter or more experienced people getting jobs that I am never gonna get a real career job.
I am so sick of feeling like shit all the time. All the people around me say "it will get better" but it's just been going downhill for years and not looking up at all. I am sick of seeing everyone else around me successful or in good relationships and me with a broken family because of my brother committing suicide 7 years ago and all my "friends" only give a crap about me when I am to the point of being suicidal and then once that's gone they go back to their happy lives and leave me in the dust.
I don't even know if God hears me anymore, I call myself a Christian but I don't see why I have to go through all this crap.
I just can't take it anymore. And I don't want just another pity party and then be forgotten about again. I am sick of this roller coaster of a life and want to just pull the plug since I am never gonna feel loved.

I just don't know what else to do. Counseling is no help, they can't give me happy pills because of other health conditions, and I have no good reason to live on miserably and just growing in debt with no more light at the end.
