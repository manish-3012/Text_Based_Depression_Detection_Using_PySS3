I'm not sure how to handle this pandemic.I've never seriously considered suicide before and I know that I would fuck up everybody around me, but I honestly don't know how long I can take this pandemic. Fauci is saying this is going to go till the fall, and the money is slowly draining out of my bank account since I'm in college and I technically qualify as a 'dependent' under my mom because of my car insurance. I just want to go back to my job and I want to be able to see my girlfriend again, and I'm tired of being in the house all day.

I was supposed to transfer schools to the university I've been waiting to get into for the past 2 years( I did the A+ scholarship at a CC), but I doubt that is going to happen now that this is all happening. I hate online classes because I can't focus for shit and I can't motivate myself to write music or anything and i just don't know what to do. I don't think I'm actively suicidal, I just don't know what to do.
