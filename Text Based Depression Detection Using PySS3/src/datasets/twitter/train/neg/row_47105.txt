My friend claims (lied?) she ODed on pills to kill herself and went to the hospital. She's now refusing help, please tell me what to do.My friend Anna (changed names) is 18 and we're both seniors in high school. She is incredibly unstable. She tells me she's in a terribly emotionally abusive relationship w/ a guy who's 25 or so who lives in another country and met once in person. Today we were hanging out and she casually mentioned in passing that she got her stomach pumped two days ago for trying to OD on pills and vodka.

When I asked what happened and why they didn't give her a social worker or therapy she said her brother's girlfriend is an ER nurse and snuck her in, pumped her stomach and snuck her back out without signing her in. Which sounds pretty unrealistic, and her story has switched a couple of times.

She has a history about making stuff up, and her poetry/writing has always had stories about a girl getting her stomach pumped after being saved by a brother or male figure. 

Now she's refusing to seek help, and I feel morally and probably legally obligated to tell a school counselor- even if she didn't actually get her stomach pumped, she talks about suicide.. A LOT.

She's begged me not to tell because she doesn't want the school to tell her parents but I know she won't get it herself.

What do I do?!?!
