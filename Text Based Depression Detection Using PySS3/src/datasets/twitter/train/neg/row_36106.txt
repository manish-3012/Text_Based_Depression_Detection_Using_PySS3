Let me count the waysOver the last few days I've imagined my suicide more than a dozen times. I even had a dream that someone gave me a bottle of pills and I swallowed them all without a second thought. I've imagined hanging from a noose, slitting my throat, stepping in front of a train, drowning in the tub, etc... I'm not even scared or sad anymore, I'm just waiting for a time when I can kill myself in a way that no one will find my body.
