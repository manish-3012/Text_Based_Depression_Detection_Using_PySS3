What do you do when the people who are supposed to love you the most make you want to die?I feel pathetic doing this. I should have support, and it's making be feel worse. I'm feel like my husband hates me, resents me, think's I'm stupid, etc. I feel like I beg him for affection and to take my thoughts and feelings seriously. I tell him I can't live like this, that he makes my depression spiral when he makes jabs at me for having a day off or something like that. I'm recovering, I really am, but he never fails to make me feel like shit about myself. It's heartbreaking and unbearable. I don't have any friends, I honestly don't know why. I can't maintain constant meaningful relationships with anyone. I'm worthy, I know I am. I know inside all these feelings aren't right, but I don't have any evidence otherwise... I honestly feel like a worthwhile humanbeing, I'm not self loathing...but no one else seems to think so. Good god what can I do??? :(((((
