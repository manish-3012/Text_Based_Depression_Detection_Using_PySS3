Just a venture into my thoughts..againLately when I see stuff on the news regarding shootings...I honestly wish that I was the victim instead. I find myself thinking, "Why wasn't that me?" Why do people who likely want to live, are probably spending time with their families in a quality way, and have something to look forward to subjected to a sudden end when I actually DON'T want to live and wish for death every day? Why am I the "lucky" one? After all I contribute absolutely nothing to the world anymore and go around like a zombie without a personality, if there's a God they should know I deserve it. All I bring is sadness because I can't keep up with faking laughter anymore, I can't hold a meaningful conversation anymore to save my life. I'm dead inside emotionally, even more than when I was arguably more of an "obvious" mess in my teens, I feel like I'm at my worst now. Just a hollow shell fantasizing about my end. I'm dead inside emotionally, so I may as well be dead physically.

I just can't bring myself to do it because I hate pain and heights. But I always secretly, silently hope that someone else will just end it for me.
