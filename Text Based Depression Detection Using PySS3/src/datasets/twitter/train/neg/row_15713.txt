Social anxiety has destroyed my life    Iâ€™m often seen as the quit kid ever since I can remember Iâ€™ve always kept to my self never feeling the need to talk to people. It wasnâ€™t until middle school I realized how different I was. I found my self extremely nervous in some environments but I was still able to complete the task at hand without letting my nerves get to me. It wasnâ€™t till 7th or 8th grade. I was in my music class(which my crush was also in which might be an important factor idk) and the director announced that we had a playing test. It made me nervous just like anyone but it wasnâ€™t a difficult or long piece of music so I wasnâ€™t to worried and put it off. Now we come to the day of the test Iâ€™m familiar with it but still donâ€™t want to do it. So one by one alphabetical order each persons plays. My hands are beyond sweaty as we approach the letter before mine. And we finally reach me I go to play and I just canâ€™t, itâ€™s like I forgot everything I knew and just froze still trying to keep it together I laugh it off little did I know how much that moment has affected me now. 

    Iâ€™m in my sophomore year now and moments like this still haunt me. I can barely talk to new people I have no social skills. Every time I have to do something solo I breakdown and can barely function. I hate it. I fear every social interaction now. Itâ€™s halted my life I canâ€™t find anyone new or get a girlfriend. Every night itâ€™s the same question plaguing my mind â€œwhy choose me when you can have someone normalâ€. 
    Itâ€™s hard to see any light when your at war with your head. I canâ€™t imagine living my whole life like this.
