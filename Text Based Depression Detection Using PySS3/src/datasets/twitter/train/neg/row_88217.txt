So depressed it physically hurts.I have absolutely nothing to get up for in the morning and no reason to want to go home at night.  There's is absolutely nothing for me when I go home, I have no SO, no friends, and no pets.  I have no hobbies, interests, skills, or passion in a life, I have nothing to look forward to going home to.

My psychologist seems to think my depression and anxiety are only very mild and I leave every session feeling empty handed.  I get to work and I'm so depressed that people avoid me.  I recently cancelled a few days off that I had because I realised it would just be another day of sitting around on my own drinking all day.  My life is so empty that sometimes all I can do is sit and cry, at work and at home.

I'm also a trans girl, and whenever I talk to a coworker or my psychologist about being depressed they just assume it's hormones or lack of social acceptance, and that it'll all come to pass, but I know it won't.

I don't know what I'm hoping to get from this, but I have nobody to talk to, and everyone who does, doesn't seem to get it.  I've never felt this suicidal in my life, and it scares me.  Help.
