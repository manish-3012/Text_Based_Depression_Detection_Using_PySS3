TemazepamI'm not actively suicidal but I was just wondering if anyone knew this answer.

My stepdad has hoarded many, MANY boxes of Temazepam over the years. He had/still has many health problems but he does not take these pills anymore. They just stay stacked in a bookcase.

How many Temazepam would you need to take in order to die?
