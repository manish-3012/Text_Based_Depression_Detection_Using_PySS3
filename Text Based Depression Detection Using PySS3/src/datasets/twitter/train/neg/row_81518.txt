English isnâ€™t my first language so this isnâ€™t very good but I wrote something clear my headIf Iâ€™m alive than why is my heart not beating enough?
Why air feels like water and love is pulling me down?
Do I need to wear a space suit to breath what you breath,
Or go to the moon to see what you see.
If I should stay than why canâ€™t I find something to hold on?
