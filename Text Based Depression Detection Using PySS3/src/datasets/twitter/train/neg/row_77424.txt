I've done horrible things and I think I should kill myselfI've done some horrible things in my past. Every now and again what I've done will come back to haunt me. Do I even deserve to live? or should I just end it all? Would that be the "good" thing to do?

These thoughts don't ever leave me for long. Something will always come up to remind me of what I did. I was about 11 or 12, but I still knew better and feel like I don't deserve to live.
