I just want to give up but Iâ€™m not strong enough. I have a family and kids.Iâ€™m struggling with postpartum depression and anxiety. I want to feel better. Itâ€™s hard to get in an therapy appt with all the limited covid staffing. My appt is in December. I want to keep holding on... but I keep thinking of horrible suicidal thoughts.
