So, objectively, the best decision I could make is to end my own life... what?I'm ~$250,000 deep in student loan debt, unemployed, and no job prospects are opening up any time soon... HOWEVER! My student loans are forgiven in the event of my death...  So... at best right now I could hope to break even by offing myself... how does this make sense?

I'll admit, I've had a few too many to drink tonight, but I've got a loaded gun sitting within arms reach and I could totally do it, no problem...

My goal in life is to help people... that's why I spent so much fucking money on my education... but looking at things the way they are now, I think the best option for my future is to just call it quits...  Someone talk to me?
