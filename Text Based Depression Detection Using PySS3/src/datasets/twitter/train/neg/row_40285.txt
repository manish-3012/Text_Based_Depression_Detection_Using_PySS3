I love a girl that doesn't love me back and I just can't bear the painI had terrible depression since I was 19, but earlier this year, I met one girl that literally changed my world, but it's not like I wish it was and I just can't stand this feeling. I never met anyone like her and I'm sure I never will again, I don't even want to, she's literally the only thing I care about in my life. She doesn't feel the same about me and I'm sure I will die because of it
