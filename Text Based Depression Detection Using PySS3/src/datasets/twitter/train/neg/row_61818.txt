There is no fucking pointI try to cling to something to stay afloat. But it just takes me further and further away from the shore. I am tired of mending something irreparably broken.
Some days I feel like I just need to fake it till I make it, to keep going, and eventually things will turn out right.
Some days I secretly wish something really fucked up happened so I could finally be so done with life I muster the courage to kill myself.
Truth is, some people know what this feels like, to be slowly dragged into the bottomless pit, and they'll never undo this knowledge, they're doomed â€“ and some others just don't know, maybe never will. The oh so kind and blessed folks who say "everything will be alright".
They will probably never understand. Bless them, bless their ignorance.
And yet it's them who's right, in more ways than one. It's them who will go on to do right.
Sometimes I despise them, but deep down, I just wish I had always belonged to their side.
But I don't. I'm broken. I'm depressed. I'm too aware and too numb, at the same time. So attached that I hurt, but too detached to do anything about it. You know how it is, guys.
This can't be undone.
It can't, and it's just fucking useless to try and stay afloat.
