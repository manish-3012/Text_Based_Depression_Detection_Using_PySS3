Why should I continue suffering?I have a eating disorder, specifically OSFED/EDNOS.

I ate half a pumpkin pie.

I wanna die.

I will never lose weight.  I will never get skinny.  I will never be a real anorexic.

I wish I had a bottle of Nembutal so I could go to sleep forever. 

But no.  I am stuck living against my will.
