those small moments of happiness that make me think life is worth living always get crushedevery single time i feel like something has happened that pokes at my will to live, something else comes along to crush it.

 it doesnt matter whether they are the small acts of good overshadowed by humanity's endless greed and violence, or if it's me hanging out with my friends and having a good time just for them to unknowingly make a comment that crushes me. its in how i feel pretty for a moment and then the next i find ten more flaws to analyze. it's in how i make a piece of work im proud of and then make fifty more i despise. it's  in how i feel like im making steps to changing myself to what is hopefully a better person just to see others talk down on the changes i was proud of moments before.

i wish i didn't care so much about other people's opinions; i wish i didn't care so much about how disgusting i feel everyday when i wake up and think about who i am. sometimes i wish that my existence would end; sometimes i wish it never began in the first place. at least that way i would've never hurt.
