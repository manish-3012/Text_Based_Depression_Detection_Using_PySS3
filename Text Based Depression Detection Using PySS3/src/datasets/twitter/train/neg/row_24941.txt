Incredibly lonely.I was surprised when someone actually texted me today. It turned out to be an automated message from my dentist. 

That got me looking through my messages. I haven't talked to anyone in months. I'm isolated, I'm not doing anything with my life, I'm tired. If I don't want to be here, and there isn't anyone who cares, then what is the point? Why am I still here?
