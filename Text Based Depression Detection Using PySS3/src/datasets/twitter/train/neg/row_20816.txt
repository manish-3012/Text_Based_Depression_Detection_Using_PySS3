I want to dieNothing seems real. I just go on living in case life is real although it's probably not. Life feels like a dream to me. I have DPDR plus other ridiculous diagnoses. I dislike people for the most part because they are mean and evil. I really don't see the point in living anymore. I live in fear. I hate this.
