Friend is in a poor family stateThis is a developing topic right now, but my friend has just told me that   his current living situation is extremely stressful where his mother the other family members to extreme lengths. I can't describe in detail, but recently he has been feeling depressed, resulting in low performance in school after years of perfection. He informed me that his mom has been taking away many of his privileges (which he has been using to keep himself going through depression) such as his laptop, phone, curfew. Upon confrontation to tell his parents how he feels, things escalated resulting in his mom hitting him for the first time in his life. He describes that the family is completely disjointed and dysfunctional where he cannot reason with anyone to seek help. I've advised him to seek help of the school guidance counselor in order to bring these massive issues to higher levels, including his doctor (whom he cannot access through means of his parents) and a family counselor. What he is worried about is that guidance (as mandatory reporters) will report his mom to the police, which is not what he wants as he believes it will destroy the family beyond recovery and he believes she will not touch him again. He tells me that he has no relatives or family friends reasonably close. Some of the closest members of our group live very close to him with whom he could physically run to for help if it came to that (which I wanted for him to do tonight), but he wants to keep this between the two of us unless worst comes to worst. I have made myself and my home an availability to him, but again this would require me telling my parents, something he doesn't want to happen.

As of now, he feels safe inside his home, but I am worried for him still and am seeking advice to give him as he is not comfortable/ able to advocate for himself in person.
