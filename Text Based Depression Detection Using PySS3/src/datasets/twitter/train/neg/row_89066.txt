No motivation, scared every day. Strongly considering going.Hello. 19 year old male. Extreme hypochondriac with severe anxiety. I sleep all day. When I wake up I literally have to try really hard to eat. I feel sick and weak every single day. The things that used to bring me joy no longer do. I'm convinced I have some terminal illness but the doctor tells me I'm "fine" and that it's all anxiety. I can't believe that. I'm dragging myself around every day and it's getting to the point that I can't take it anymore. I don't know what to do. There hasn't been one day recently where I've felt calm and healthy. Please help me.
