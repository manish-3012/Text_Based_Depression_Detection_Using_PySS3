Need To Talk To SomeoneI'm having a very terrible few days. I have health problems, am in pain, and have been sleeping shitty. I met a new friend online, we've known each other for 6 months, things have been fine, we were growing close until yesterday morning I had a panic attack and they didn't know how to handle it. They started criticizing me and I said "Fuck You." For the last two days we are fighting, my friend says I am acting childish and that I shouldn't have said "Fuck You" to them. I apologized, but explained I was in a weak moment and also brought up that I felt like I didn't want to live, but they ignored me. They continued to send me long e-mails of all of my faults, and that because I don't push myself enough I'm being childish. I am disabled and in pain 24/7, they know this and they themselves have a chronic condition, but they continued criticizing me. They then said people who don't go to college are trash and worth nothing to the world. I said I disagreed and now they are mad at me that I won't do what they want! Anything I try to say or explain they tell me it is an excuse.



Despite all of this, I really care for them, but I'm torn between my emotions for them and anger for what they have said. I have tried to work things out, but they refuse. I tried calling them, but they refused to pick up. And then I get a text saying they aren't well and doing to lay down. 



I need to fucking talk, even if it's a stranger! I have no motivation and I no longer have a desire to live. I just want to die. But I just want someone to talk to me! Please! I'm hanging by a fucking thread here! I don't deserve to be treated like shit. I am doing all I can, but it's never enough for anyone! I'm sick of being hit when I'm down!
