Am I a creepy guy?What would you feel when you see a video of someone you don't know committing suicide?

I often imagine what streaming my suicide would be like. Yeah, exactly, just sharing the scenery of my death on YouTube, Twitch, Facebook or whatsoever. Haven't decided what suicide method I am going to use, but I feel that I want people to watch my death. They would be happy. They would. Because in their viewpoint, watching my death is looking at the disappearance of a factor that feels terrible. Yep, nobody loves me so even I don't love myself. My death will be entertainment for people who really hated me.

What would be the appropriate suicide method for filming? The painless method is preferred. The platforms I am planning to use are YouTube and Twitter... For now. Ready to share entertainment? I'm still being ready.
