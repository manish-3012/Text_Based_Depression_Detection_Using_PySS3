Very hard days20 years suffering like this. I'm 40. Half my life. Cannot seem to make a friend.  Never have.  People like me.  Think I'm funny. Smart.  Doesn't matter. Something in me is missing. 

Alot of anxiety.  Like a wave. Everyday. All day.  Strong. 

When on occasion I feel ok. It's just ok. Then a wave can swollow me   Feel it coming on. Clouding my brain. 

Been on nearly every medicine.  Basically out of pharmaceutical options.  

I suffer
