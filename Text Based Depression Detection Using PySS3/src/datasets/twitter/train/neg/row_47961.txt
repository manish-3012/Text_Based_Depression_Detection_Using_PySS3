Feeling DownI've been going through so much lately and my minds constantly going and going and all I can do is think. I am thankful for the friends that I am surrounded by and how supportive they are. 
I have a lot of drama going on. With friends and sometimes family. There's a boy who has caused me more pain than happiness and made me feel like I don't have a place in this world. 
I don't know why I am here, I just feel like a burden on everyone I talk to. And I do not know what to do anymore. I don't know if I should be here.
