Bad outweighs the good.I feel worthless right now. Nothing is going my way. It seems the world is trying to target me specifically. I am part of a community with awful people and I get little to no respect there. The people who are nice try to support me but nothing works. I've tried sleeping on it but it only takes a couple hours for these depressing thoughts to return. It seems everything I used to enjoy either doesn't make me happy or is too much of a burden.

Real life is a bit different. I have friends but only 2 close ones. Those 2 make me a third wheel (not on purpose, I think). I've been seeking advice from others and it's sort of working, yet I still have depressing thoughts.

**TL;DR** Life is shit and I don't know how to deal with it other than that one way.
