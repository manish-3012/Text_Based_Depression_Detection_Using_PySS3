Honestly at my worst.I dislike posting long rants, but here goes an exception:

I can honestly say I have never been so stressed in my life.

My mother just goes on and on without listening to me. God only knows how I want to work and support, and there are many ways for me to do that, but she doesn't understand how difficult it is for me to go with the one I have. I don't enjoy it, it causes me to have a breakdown, on top of everything else that's going on in my life. I would be overjoyed to be able to bring money home doing something I at least enjoy a little more. But I took it because we barely have anything to life off of most days. I try explaining this to her, but the need for money presses more at her consciousness than my voice does.

I have a pending public college enrollment because the school I'm planning on attending messed up my process and I'm starting all over with it and I truly need some sort of therapy, although I admit I have tried to go without it, namely due to finances.

I've been through similar experiences before, but this one hits harder because I want to do these things with my whole being, but I also feel misunderstood.

I really feel as though everything is crashing down on me at once and it's taking a toll on me, even physically, where I don't feel myself. At all.

I'm 18 right now and I feel like suicide is the way I will die ultimately, within the next few months, if not sooner.
