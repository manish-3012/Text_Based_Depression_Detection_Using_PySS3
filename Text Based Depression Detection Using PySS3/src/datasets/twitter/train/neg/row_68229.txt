Fucking flat tire!Are you fucking kidding me?!? Im on the brink of leaving one of these days to once again try and put an end to my suffering. Just got informed a second ago that my tire is flat now. Wtf no money left to fix the piece of shit and I just want out of this bullshit already! And no, this isnâ€™t a sign that I should be alive. Itâ€™s a sign that my life is fucking trash even when I sit around trying to avoid trouble and pain in life, doing what I can to get healthy, staying sober. Fml canâ€™t wait til Iâ€™m dead. fuck this!
