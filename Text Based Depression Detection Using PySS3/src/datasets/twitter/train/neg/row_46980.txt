Whatâ€™s messed up about mental health treatmentWe live in a world of scientific advancement. Targeted treatments for so many things, from diabetes to cancer to infertility. Doctors can give you a medicine, look at your scans, and definitely say â€œyes, this is working,â€ or â€œ no improvement, letâ€™s try something else.â€ 

But mental health treatment doesnâ€™t fall under the same trajectory. 

I am recently really really struggling. I added a new med a little over a month ago, and I am unsure if the medication is making me worse or if itâ€™s just not working enough. 

And the scary thing is, my doctor isnâ€™t sure either. 

So today he doubled the dose of the medication Iâ€™m taking. 

And thereâ€™s no telling if itâ€™s going to make things better or worse.
