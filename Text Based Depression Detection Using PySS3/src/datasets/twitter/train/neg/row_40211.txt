I got diagnosed with alopecia areata and Iâ€™ve lost almost all the hair on my body.Iâ€™m on medication. Iâ€™ve been pouring steroid lotion on my scalp along with fenastopic (fenasteride spray mix). I am so miserable. I used to be depressed anyway because of being gay and how my dad and many others spoke about gays I had suicidal thoughts for a long time because I am gay. Im 19 but I look 30 itâ€™s every time I try to push through I get pushed back so much. I canâ€™t keep pushing any more. I just need my life back. Please help me
