17 years in the makingI turned 25 this week and I have been depressed since I was 9 - maybe even earlier but I donâ€™t remember. Tonight iâ€™m finally broken. I canâ€™t carry on anymore. I just want to overdose and be gone. Iâ€™m fed up of hurting and I just want to die now. I really donâ€™t see any way out of this overwhelming depression.
