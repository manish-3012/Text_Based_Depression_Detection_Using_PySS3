I work &amp; drink a lotI'm a 25 year old male. For the past 2 years I have done nothing but work 7 day weeks, drink, and play video games. Prior to that I messed around in College for 4 years and only ended up with an AA.

It got to the point that I no longer felt any feelings. Frowning all the time was the only thing I had the strength for. I could smile if I tried but I felt nothing from it.

Well some time in May I was on the bus home from work and all my co-workers were talking about going to the local bar. I ran home showered and showed up. Turns out every one but 1 girl and 1 other guy went downtown instead. I walked in saw them and almost turned around and left if they did not wave me over. We had a few drinks than went our separate ways. As I was walking home the girl drove past me. She stopped her car and begged me to get in so she could drive me home. I let her and after that things really kicked off. We had a lot in common and enjoyed each others company. After that we went to baseball games, bars, clubs, hikes, had a lot of sex.

This was my First sexual experience and I have to say I am a big fan. Well I guess she got sick of me because the sex died off the past month. I started drinking like I used to and made a fool of my self a few times.

Well long story short she is going to break up with me tomorrow at work and I am scared of going back to my old life. Feeling happy is amazing, but for the past 3 days I have been very sad and unable to eat. My plan is to call in sick the next 3 days. realistically my job is heavy labor and if I go any longer it will become a safety problem. After that I'm going on a week vacation. I think it would be cool to end it all on a high note.
