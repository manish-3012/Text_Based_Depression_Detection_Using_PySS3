Following up todayI havenâ€™t left my room in another 24 hours no bathroom no water no food again just drugs and alcohol Iâ€™ve been up with no sleep for awhile
Now , everything is moving so fast now by the time I stop and take a breAth another 8 hours have gone by and I literally peel my soaking wet body off my bed sit up and watch everything dance and wave around me I feel like I canâ€™t see anything anymore until look at myself in the mirror and know how the rest of today tonight ia gonna go but Iâ€™m so uplifted by these psychotic ideas and fantasies that are going on in my head and I know they are crazy but itâ€™s nice right now and just I keep reminding myself the walls and
Floors arenâ€™t really moving and I start to panic and wish I had someone here but I know Iâ€™m alone for now and there is no better way you know I would have called you by now and too be honest I wish anyone would have called me last but making sure everyone else is ok and safe is always more
Important. Iâ€™m done or any nuisance this time I wanna be peaceful Iâ€™m never stressed or angry like Iâ€™ve been these past few months but Iâ€™m just 
So calm and quiet and Iâ€™ve honestly never felt like this before but I dreamt you were given some money and went to China and a bunch of countries to work and travel 
Makes 
Me happy right now thinking about it Iâ€™d rather still feel like Im in a fantasy ,Iâ€™d rather think I still had a chance with you instead of the reality, when I realize itâ€™s been months and your already gone. wrote a will out when I was upset a month ago but I didnâ€™t rip it up or anything I know Iâ€™ll be able to make
You smile one more time and you may even  be pissed and honestly 
Iâ€™m gonna keep
Smiling about it because I know someday ur gonna get it. Talk tomorow ðŸ–¤
