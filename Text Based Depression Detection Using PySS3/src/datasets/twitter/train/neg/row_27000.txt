I don't have a mother anymore.I'm done with the evil person who gave birth to me. She, once again, was mad because of someone else and lashed out at me, telling me for the 5th time that she doesn't love me.   
She knows I'm suicidal. She knows I have social phobia. she knows i think nobody loves me. So, even if she has the tiniest of brains, she understands how much she hurts me.   
And she never said sorry. Her entire life, she never said it. Her ego is literally more important than the life of her suicidal daughter.   
I'm done calling her my mother. I'm done caring about her and taking care of her.   
She's the one who will make my kill myself, I swear.
