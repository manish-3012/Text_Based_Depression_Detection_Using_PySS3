I was going to commit suicide thursdayWell there are many reasons i was going to do it. Really it was a rough point in my life. I am seventeen guy btw.

Mainly i haven't been feeling the best around these days idk what it is. Stress maybe? Maybe i am just another spolied teen. whatever it was i dont like doing school work and i have been coasting along on c's. Well i didnt do a project for school and was going to do it after it was due except the fact my teacher decided to call my parents. Well knowing full well my parents were going to ground me because not only did i get an F in english but the week before i crashed the car into a ditch. Wasn't too big of damage but my parents were still angry of course. i fuck up way too much lately. 

So I went back to my seat and just thought of ways to kill myself. I really dont know why my first thoughts was killing myself. Its not like my life is shitty. I have lots of friends, i smoke weed when i want, and i am pretty creative i think. I knew how to plan it too my suicide that is. I really was going to do it too. I was gonna use vicoden and some rum in the basement. I had it all out while my parents went for a walk. But i didnt do it, i just put it back. 

Idk whats what right now. i really dont want to do it but i am still just kinda whatever if i do. 

my friend didnt even know how depressed i was yesterday and he sent me [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2yeNzL7rTU&amp;feature=related) just because of the song kinda made my spirits go up a little
