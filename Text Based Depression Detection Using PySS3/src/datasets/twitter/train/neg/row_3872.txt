I'm just done. Can't bear any more suffering.I've been depressed and things for years now, and I really can't take it anymore. I can't bear another week, and I just have no hope in my future whatsoever. I honestly think that I'm better off dead than keep alive much longer. If you want to help, you may, but it is not required.
