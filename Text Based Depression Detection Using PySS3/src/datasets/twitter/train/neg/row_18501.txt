Parents took away my car that I boughtI worked all summer and spent almost all of my money at the end to buy one of my dream cars. I was hesitant because it was out of my price range but my dad and step mom insured that they would help pay for it and I would owe them and could pay it off. We did that and when we got home from buying it, they told me I didnâ€™t have to worry about paying them back and the car was mine. I payed 5,000 for it and payed for every ounce of gas In it and I pay the insurance. But when my step mom told me I donâ€™t deserve respect I blew up at her and screamed at her (this did not look good as I am 6â€™3 and she is 5â€™7). The next day I asked my dad what would happen to my car if I wanted to live with my mom. They havenâ€™t answered the question and took away the keys and Iâ€™m not allowed to drive anywhere. This feels like theft and it feels like theyâ€™re spitting in my face. I spent hundreds of hours working for that car and they just took it away. That car is everything to me and represents a lifetime of work and dedication to school, work, and cars. I canâ€™t take it and everyday the idea of taking my dads 9mm and just blowing my head off is in me from the moment I wake up to when I go to sleep. When I walk to school and I see the buses drive by I think of jumping in front of them. I walk to work and cross a bridge over water and think of jumping. I donâ€™t know what stops me. I donâ€™t want to be here. Everything I care about is slipping away from me and it feels like the only way someone will care about me is when Iâ€™m gone. Everyday is just gets worse and I honestly think my chances of making it another year are low.
