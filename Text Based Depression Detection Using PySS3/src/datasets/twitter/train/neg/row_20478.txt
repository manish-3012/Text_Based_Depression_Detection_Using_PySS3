Should I tell my counsellor about my intrusive suicidal thoughts?I went to see the personal counsellor at my university (free counselling sessions come with tuition) pretty regularly but last semester my counsellor told me that I should try going without it for a while. Which was actually, fine. I had no major problems.

Now I haven't ever told her about about my suicidal ideation, but it's getting worse now, to the point that even minor grievances have me contemplating it. I have attacks of suicidal thoughts.

I made an appointment on Tuesday to talk to her again, but should I mention it? At the beginning I was told that she would only share details of our conversation *if* I was seen as a danger to myself and others. Does this count?

Being hospitalized would be the worst, and I could see that being the thing that turns me from sort of suicidal to actually suicidal.
