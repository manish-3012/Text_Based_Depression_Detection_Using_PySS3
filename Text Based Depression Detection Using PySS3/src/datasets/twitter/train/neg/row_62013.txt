I tried to kill myself today.Today I tried to kill myself. Obviously it didn't work out due to the fact of me writing this. While I was there half conscious I managed to claw myself out of it though I really wish I had the balls to do it to till the end. This is because I really do want to end my own life but just am not able to do it due to the subconscious instinct that we humans have to stay alive.

My life isn't as bad as a lot of those on this subject however I still just am not satisfied with myself and feel that I just disappoint all those around me. I feel as though I am hated by my family and friends. I feel as though I am not adequate to live anymore but just am not able to end it.
