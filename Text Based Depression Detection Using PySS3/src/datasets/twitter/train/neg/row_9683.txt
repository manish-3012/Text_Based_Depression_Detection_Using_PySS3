"If you were REALLY suicidal, you wouldn't tell anyone about it. You'd just do it."Those words were said to me hours after I attempted suicide and was recovering in the hospital, trying to get my kidneys to work. 
I called 911 on myself because I knew I wasn't gonna die anyway. At least, not for days and days after the overdose of the medication I chose. I was told by my guardian that I did it for attention. Totally not true, for the record. Instead of supporting me like I really needed it, most people turned their back on me or punished me in some way. I spent 2 weeks in a psychiatric hospital. That was my 8th inpatient hospitalization for the same reason.
I was really suicidal. I still kind of am, just not as strongly as I was then. I've tried to move on and not attempt again. I haven't told anyone I'm feeling this way again because I don't want them to think negatively of me again. I'm so tired of being alone.
Sorry if this makes no sense. Depressive episodes usually don't.
