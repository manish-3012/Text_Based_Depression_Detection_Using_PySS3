I dunnoI always waited for things to get better. I always waited for things to improve and people to change and for myself to be happy. Iâ€™m so tired of waiting. Nothing is going to get better for me anyways. My family is still gonna be shitty tomorrow. My past isnâ€™t gonna change tomorrow. My brain isnâ€™t going to change tomorrow. The way Iâ€™m so extremely defective and unloveable isnâ€™t going to change tomorrow. And the tomorrowâ€™s are interchangeable for any range of time as Iâ€™ve been waiting for all of this for years now. I canâ€™t remember a time where I didnâ€™t want to give up. I just am so sick of this. I donâ€™t know what I did to deserve it all. No matter what I do itâ€™s not good enough and Iâ€™m not gonna be okay ever. I canâ€™t see myself ever being older than this. I donâ€™t want to do it anymore.
