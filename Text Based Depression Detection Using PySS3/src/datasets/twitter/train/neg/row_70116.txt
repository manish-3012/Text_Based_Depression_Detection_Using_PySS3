I can't do itI'm 20 years old and I have no hobbies or skills. No fucking license, I'm only taking 2 community college classes that are basically easy a's. I don't have friends since I moved and I ostracize myself everywhere I go and I should die. There's no god to save me and there's no science to cure bipolar disorder. I'm just a crazy useless fuck who is a burden on an otherwise normal family. I'm not smart, gifted or anything. No redeeming qualities. I'm just a 1st world fuck up with endless negativity.

My life consists of barely eating, barely taking care of myself, jerking off and nothing else. I suck at gaming and that's the only thing I do besides surf the web. There's no justification for my life or reason not to kill myself. I'm a lonely useless spoiled person and I shouldn't be here. The only reason I still am is because I know I'd hurt my family when I'm dead but we aren't exactly tight either. You can probably guess why, I'm a source of negativity and stress despite trying not to be. Pills don't work, online forums are useless unless you are Xxd4rkbutt3rflyxX or some old christian nutjob who thinks god is making you suffer to learn.

I don't even know why I'm typing this, it's a horrible attitude to have. I just don't know what the fuck to do. I suck and I'm horrible and I want to die. No more bipolar disorder, no longer a social outcast, no longer would I have suicidal thoughts. No more fucking therapists and psychiatrists. Just an end to an insignificant speck in the universe.
