Why do you act like you care? I might as well off myselfPeople in this subreddit act like they care and say supportive things, blah, blah, blah. I don't understand why you think i would believe what you are typing? If I kill myself, yea my family will be devastated, not a problem I'm really disconnected from them, don't even feel love towards them. Do you know what i love? I love being some people during sometimes, I love the thought of hurting people and I love doing drugs and drinking alcohol. Problem is, most of the stuff I love is shunned by society or is illegal. So I have to pursue a normal lifestyle that I thought I loved. Computer Science. Turns out, I hate Web Development which is 99.9% of the market. So if I can't do what I love and not be forced to put a facade to make my family think I love them, why live? Isn't life about doing what you love? If you can't do that stuff whats the point of life? I'll never be able to kill people and/or hurt them cause that's gonna land me in prison and I certainly don't want to go to prison. Drugs are expensive and I'm kinda tight with cash. And the people I like/appreciate/love don't reciprocate. I live on the fourth floor and im gonna jump tommorow morning probably. I take my chances with the possibility of an after life than with this life. Bye bye guys
