Iâ€™ve finally decidedToday was my breaking point. Iâ€™ve been thinking about suicide for the longest but now itâ€™s becoming pretty realistic. I canâ€™t go on anymore. Everything hurts but I feel numb at the same time. I have nothing to live for. Today I made the terrible mistake of admitting to my sister that I want to die, sometimes. She seemed to care but seeing as everything Iâ€™ve caused thereâ€™s no point. She said that depressed people cant take care of themselves and need someone else to make decisions for them. It hurt more than it should. Iâ€™m worthless. 

Iâ€™m not going anywhere in life and I truly donâ€™t want to. I want to escape and I know this will be forever. I have a sense of calmness and I know itâ€™s going to suck because I keep thinking about my family but for the first time, Iâ€™m thinking about myself. All the pain is going to be over and I canâ€™t wait for it. Iâ€™ll probably do it over the weekend, when no one is around. I feel relieved.
