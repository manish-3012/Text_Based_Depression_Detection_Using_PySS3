I feel like I have no reason to exist anymore.I've just been feeling useless for a while now. I've felt useless for years. I keep feeling like I keep amounting to nothing. I feel like I always mistreat people and then complain when I get cut out. I always feel like shit.

Every day, I struggle to find reason to go to sleep. And when I wake up, I have no motivation to get out of bed. I'm so jaded that I don't think I'd care anymore if I mysteriously died in my sleep.

Life has been feeling very empty for me. Nothing feels like it matters. I don't feel like I matter. I only have one friend in real life and they're always busy with their job, or when they're free - they have other friends they can go out with and spend time with. I'm too afraid to reach out to anyone from my online circle and talk because I just don't want to drop my problems onto other people.

Worst part? I can't even get help even if I wanted to now. At this point I'd just be happy if I stopped existing. If I disappeared and everyone would forget my existence entirely.
