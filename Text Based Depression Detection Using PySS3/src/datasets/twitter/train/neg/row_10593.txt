i feel like I'm the "girl who cried wolf"Ever since I've struggled with depression, I've felt a constant state of suicidal ideation. I felt a small taste of recovery with the right medicine, but since I graduated and was forced to move back home, I've started to slip back into my depression and now I'm feeling closer and closer to *actually* following through. But, because I've felt this awful before, I feel like I can't reach out cuz that's when I'll become a burden, someone who isn't actually going to die so why bother helping her. My brother shouted at me that he doesn't think I'm going to die because I've always been suicidal and haven't followed through, so now I'm just down and I'm afraid of reaching out because everyone either won't take me seriously or will just think I'm being negative. But I have a method and I have a plan, I just don't have a date. I really want to die. I just have to go through the final depressive episode alone.
