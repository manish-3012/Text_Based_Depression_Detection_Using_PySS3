Am I just an odd ducking, or am I the only person that is actually excited and happy to commit suicide?I donâ€™t want to sound odd, but I plan to commit suicide in my 30â€™s after Iâ€™ve done all that I wanted to do. I feel that, looking at possibly 70+ years of life with layers upon layers of responsibility doesnâ€™t appeal to me. I find that (at least for me) suicide is a way for me to life live happily and recklessly, and to an extent its fullest. Itâ€™s been kinda awkward around my friends who donâ€™t take the topic as light heartedly or as hopefully as I do, but I hope that one day they will understand. Is it really that uncommon to be happy and want to commit suicide?
