Extremely Paranoid i'm really paranoid all the time and i dont know what to do. For the past few years I have been increasingly paranoid about everything, such as how I look, how I eat, how I act, what I say, and I think that everyone is watching me and judging me all the time and it's to the point where I don't  even feel safe in my own house. I have been increasingly dreading going to school or any other places in public places. I have considered suicide as an option but am not ready to leave my family with the after affects of it. Does anyone know what could help me? please don't say that I "shouldn't listen to those thoughts" because i am very beyond that point where I can just brush it off.
