All the sameHey,
don't know why i write this but i guess it's hard to keep all it in for so long. I think my first depressive episode happened when I went to high school (16 yo). Since then I've been struggling with a sense of emptiness, meaninglessness of life, suicidal thoughts and suicide ideation. Every day I've been waking up hoping to die and never planned anything for the future as I've always thoughts that in no time I will finally kill myself. I've been numbing myself with alcohol getting blackout drunk almost every time I went out and eventually even my emotional reaction to suicidal thoughts became numbed as they became familiar, I got used to them and decided that soon I will surely do it.  
I passed my high schools finals with good marks, went to college, recently resigned from it and know i feel more lost than ever, have no direction in life, feel a great void inside of me and feel extremely loneliness as despite being 21 I've never been in a relationship. I act as if I'm okay, barely anyone knows that I'm depressed and extremely disappointed with myself, I go to therapist but it's hard to talk with her openly as i'm afraid of being locked in a hospital if I tell her what's going on.   
I just don't know if it makes sense to keep going. If I've been feeling like that for so long maybe it's time to stop it. Hell I don't know.  
I wrote it quite quickly hope it makes sense.
