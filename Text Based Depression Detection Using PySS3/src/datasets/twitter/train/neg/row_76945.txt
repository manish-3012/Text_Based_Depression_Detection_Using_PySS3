Happy On OutsideIâ€™m fed up, I cheer myself up, I handle issues by myself. No one cares. No one truly asks. I make myself indispensable so Iâ€™m used only to make people happy, provide help. But no one stops and asks me how Iâ€™m truly doing. I keep messing up and no one looks at the good Iâ€™ve done only on that one issue where I said the wrong thing or did the wrong action. My heart beats so quickly when I think of no one for me to talk to. I never thought Iâ€™d be here writing this but hey thatâ€™s life right. I stress easy, I say the wrong shit, I do the wrong thing. Well guess what! Thatâ€™s fucking me.  Thatâ€™s everyone. So why do those moments shine brighter then the help, support or countless hours of selfishness I provide. That shit doesnâ€™t matter when shit goes south. I donâ€™t matter when I donâ€™t do right.
