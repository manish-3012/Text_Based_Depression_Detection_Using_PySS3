I wish I was never bornI am 27 y.o. female who suffers from severe social phobia,  I am afraid of people.  After graduation I worked only 4 month in my life and it almost gave nervous breakdown.  Because people always saying shit about me and asking why r u so weird and quiet.  I don't have any friends or close family.  The only person  I have is my husband,  who supports me for all 7 years of our marriage.  I am trying to find a job,  but nobody wants to hire me, because I am weird awkward and ugly looking girl.  I really hate my life and my husband starting to get annoyed with the fact that I can't find a job for 2 years .  I have law degree  ( in my country Half of the  population  have law degree, and competition is pretty strong  )but I can't work with people or even find  another job.  I hate myself so much,  always crying and wishing I was never born in my poor family in this shitty town.  I am not lazy  person who just don't want to work. I Have serious anxiety issues and I feel trapped.  I just didn't know what to do Anymore.  P. S sorry  for my English.
