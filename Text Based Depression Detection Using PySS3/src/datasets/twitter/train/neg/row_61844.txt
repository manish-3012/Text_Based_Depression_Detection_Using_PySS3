It's timeno one will miss me, i will no longer need to worry and plan myself to death for an utterly bleak future. I forget what i ever enjoyed doing on earth anyway. I just tried everything hoping something would stick and all that was permanent is my depression. I just don't function. 

I have a ghetto contraption with a cloth taped two a plastic sarayn wrap. I'm dabbing chloroform ln the cloth then put it over my head so i will asphyxiate easier. Bye internet strangers, this SW place on reddit is the cesspool i have fallen into, which i have only myself to blame, for i had alienated myself from reality a long time ago. There isn't even a 'they' anymore that will miss me. 

Here's to the next life. I hope it is a pleasant nothingness.
