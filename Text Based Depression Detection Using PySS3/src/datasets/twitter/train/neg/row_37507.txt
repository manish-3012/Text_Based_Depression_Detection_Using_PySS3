I keep forgetting my place...I'm not adopted...

But eversince I was young, I would cry in the corner of the room mumbling, âRemember your place... You're not their family... You were adopted.âž 

For as long as I could remember, I've been mumbling those words. 

Sometimes, I wonder what's wrong with me ? 

Seeing bloody stuffs calms me down and by touching blood, I would unconsciously smile.

I always scratched my hand without realising as if it was already made as a habit. 

As the youngest, the expectation placed upon me and the pressure is beyond my control. I should be doing well academically but my stupid stuff can't do a thing. I am simply useless and not needed. My heart can be used for someone who really needs it.
