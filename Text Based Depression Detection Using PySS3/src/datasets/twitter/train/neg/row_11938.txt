And here I am again. My meds stopped working. Iâ€™m lost. I need help and support.I canâ€™t stop thinking about ending it all. Nothing works anymore. I wanna go to the ER tomorrow but Iâ€™m scared to be hospitalized. Thereâ€™s also drugs in my system and even though Iâ€™m 21 I donâ€™t want my parents to find out and be even more disappointed. I donâ€™t know if I want to get better or let this get me. But I want to talk to a doctor. Iâ€™m lost. Iâ€™m very very lost.
