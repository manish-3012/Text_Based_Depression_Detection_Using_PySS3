Whatâ€™s the last song youâ€™d want to hear before you kill yourself?Just interested in hearing the music preferences of fellow depressed beings lol. Iâ€™d hear Hard Feelings by Lorde. I love her but idk what it is about this song that just makes me so addicted to it. I can just listen to it over and over and over again and love it more and more every time.
