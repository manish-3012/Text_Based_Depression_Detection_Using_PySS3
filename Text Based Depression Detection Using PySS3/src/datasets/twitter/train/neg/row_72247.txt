So sick of laying here in heaving, sickening sobsI'm so overwhelmed by college I'm about to give up, even though I'm 2 weeks from graduating.

I have zero ambition or drive for any career, hobby, or future.

I miss my grandpa everyday, he passed in December.

The guy I love left me and is now happy with someone else- someone better and completely gorgeous.

I hate every part of the way I look. 

I hate being such a failure and disappointment to my parents. They have tried so hard.

This sounds like such a pity party. But I just have nobody. And it is so painful to lay here every night in fetal position, sobbing and wishing I wouldn't wake up the next day.
Don't know how much longer I will be able to go on.

I would ask if anyone here ever feels the same, but I know that some do, or else they wouldn't be here.
