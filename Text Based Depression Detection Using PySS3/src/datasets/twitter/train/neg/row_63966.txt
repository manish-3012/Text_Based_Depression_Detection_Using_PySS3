I have a constant welt of sadness in my chest. Itâ€™s starting to become unbearable. I donâ€™t know how much longer I can carry this.My parents are dead, Iâ€™m alone and unlovable. I read something earlier today about how people arenâ€™t entitled to love and it just broke me. It broke me because I know Iâ€™m the type of person unworthy of love. Itâ€™s upsetting that most of the people who say things like that are lovable. Iâ€™m so alone. My life is pointless, Iâ€™m worthless and unloved. Iâ€™m only 24 but I donâ€™t know if I can take much more heartbreak. I ready to die.
