I don't know how much longer I can.It just feels like the right time, Reddit. I have been wanting this for so long. 

'You have so much to live for'.....I can't see it that way. I have tried, I don't even know how to ask for help. 

I feel like my insides are this giant, writhing mass of hate and anger and sorrow and hopelessness, even the good things make little difference. 

I sit here and I need to run, to break things, to rip off pieces of my own skin or tear out my hair, and all I can do is sit and shake, and the longer I sit, the worse it gets. I feel like I am going to explode and I just want it to happen already, I am so tired of everything, I am tired of trying to be ok, it never seems to make a difference.

I have no idea what to do, but I know I want to go, and I've lost the ability to find a reason to stay.
