hiI highly doubt anyone's going to read this or care but here goes;

I'm 15, from a 3rd world country and genuinely want to die. I don't think anyone has or ever will care about me, wouldn't be surprised if my parents wouldn't come to my funeral honestly. They seemingly want me to do nothing but study all day and be perfect no matter what. The tiniest fuck up gets me a 2 hour lecture about how I'm a failure for not studying during my summer break (I still do for ~2 hours a day, evidently not enough). Doesn't seem to matter that I get As and A*s in nearly everything. I have very few friends and do nothing all day but sit at home playing games, watching stuff online or doing things related to academics. I feel like I'm stuck in a rut with no change at all, and I'm sick of it. I could probably go on further but I don't think anyone would read this far anyway.
