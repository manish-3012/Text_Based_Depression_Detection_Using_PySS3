I just have one more thing to finish. Then I'm leaving. It'd be nice to have someone to keep me company in the end.I've already been paid to finish something I'm working on, so I need to finish that before I go. It might take a couple hours, so I have until then if anyone wants to be kind enough to keep my company.
