Tried to commit suicide last night. Now I can't decide whether or not I want help, what can I expect if I do seek help?Title says it all. Tried for several hours last night trying to commit suicide, I came close several times but then chickened out. Before last night I didn't want any help. Now a part of me wants help, but I'm afraid. Afraid of the costs, afraid that it'll be a waste of time, that it won't help me, that it'll just leave me feeling worse for myself and ashamed. I have no clue what to expect. What do you do to a suicidal person? How long will I be at the hospital or whatever? Is this support actually helpful?
