My friends suicide followed by a raid by policeOne of my closes friends killed himself on Sunday morning i was one of the people that found him and conducted CPR on him. This morning i was raided by police for drug offences and i now have a court date in a few weeks. I'm really not taking this well I'm not actively suicidal but it has passed my mind, I really need someone to talk to.
