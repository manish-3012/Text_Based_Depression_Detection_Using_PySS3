My suicidal friendMy friend is currently in a very dark place, but she has been for as long as I can remember. Sometimes she says graphic stuff about how she wants to end her life. I don't know how to help her or what to say to her, because I'm suicidal myself.

What can you say? It feels wrong of me to say.. "things will get better, try to get some help" if I don't believe in it myself. But I don't want her to end her life. The only thing keeping her  alive is her parents and friends, she doesn't want to hurt them.
