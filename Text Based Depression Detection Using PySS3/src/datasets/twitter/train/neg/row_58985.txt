I tried to kill myself last weekend.I was discharged from a psych hospital today. I'm feeling somewhat hopeful for the future for once but it's always going to be a struggle. I'm on meds that work finally and I hope they keep me off this subreddit for a while. Good luck to anyone still struggling I hope you get better.
