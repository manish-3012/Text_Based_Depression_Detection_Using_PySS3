..."Things like this are common, everyone goes through them"

"You're being ridiculous"

"I felt like that once too, but I'm fine now"

"Maybe you're just too distracted"

How many mistakes have I actually made

Why are you looking at me with disappointment

Rather than actually listening to what I have to say

Maybe I'm just not cut out for what I'm supposed to be


I've just gotten lucky too many times
