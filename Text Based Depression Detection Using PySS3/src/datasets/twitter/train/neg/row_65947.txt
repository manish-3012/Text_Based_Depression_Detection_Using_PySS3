I have thoughts of suicide almost every nightDuring the day, I'm okay, just a little depressed depending on the day. But every night I deal with extreme suicidal ideation. I try to put on a movie or some music or some stupid youtube videos and I can distract myself for a bit, but my mind wanders into suicide again. I have thoughts of self-harm too. The last couple of day it hasn't been so easy during daytime, yesterday I knew I was gonna be alone and I had to drink alcohol and take some melatonin to sleep the day away because I didn't want to hurt myself but I know I would have. The worst part is like there is something inside my head forbidding me from telling people. I have a therapist and a psychiatrist. I take my meds. Yet I can never tell either of them how truly awful I can feel sometimes. When I see them, I just feel numb, so when they ask how I am I just say OK because I can't really figure out my own emotions and put them into words.

I don't even know why I want to kill myself so badly. I don't think I am worthless or stupid and I think I have a future. I have a lot of anxiety but I don't know where it comes from. My family life is OK. I'm really only unhappy about my appearance, but deep down I know that doesn't matter and when I think about ending my life that topic is never the center of attention.

I have been getting 3-6 hours of sleep a night because I need to stay up watching/reading something pretty much until I pass out. I have reasons to believe I won't actually do it, but the thoughts are unbearable. I just want to go to sleep with a calm mind for once.
