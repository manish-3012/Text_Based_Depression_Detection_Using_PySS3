A useless dudeI'm sorry if I haven't been too active in this subreddit lately, sorry if I haven't been able to help people lately, been going through some stuff for the past 2 weeks now. Just need to get these things off my chest before I decide to end it all.

I was a very suicidal person, and I've been like that since I was 14 years old. I'm a very weak and emotional person, and I give up very easily with some of the challenges that I'm going through. It feels like I don't have the passion and perseverance to get up when I'm down, I just wished that I'd be laying down for a long time. 

And now I'm feeling useless again, I feel like everything that I do is a mistake. Right now I'm having some problems with my girlfriend, I don't know but I'm really jealous about a certain 'friend' of her. I don't know if it's right to be feeling this way, but I really hate seeing their picture together, their chats, it really hurts me a lot. Makes me feel really useless and boring, and right now I don't know what to do, if I should just continue crying or I'll go to sleep, I don't really know what to do. 

I've been fighting this depression for almost 5 years now, and I feel really tired
