Stuck in loopNot sure what I'm feeling, not sure if anyone cares. I want to be healthy. I want to be happy. High school I was depressed, surely college will be different. It wasn't, surely when I live on campus I will make friends and meet people. Didn't. Surely when I get on my own I'll be happy right? I'm not so sure anymore. Get up at 1 pm. No reason to get out of bed. No one to call mine. No one to hold me anymore and tell me it will be alright. When will I be better. When will this pain end. Why was I born. I scream out to god to no avail.  I see people I went to high school with happy and healthy. I regret so much. The only thing I loved in this world I fucked up, why am I like this. Why am I a terrible person. I think " I'll start eating healthy, clean my room, work out and dress nice". I never stay with it, not even for a day.  I just make plans when I'm sad on how to fix everything, helps for a minute. Then back to the reality that I won't do it. Why can't I. It's this endless loop I'm in. I'm beginning to think there is only one way out. How can I do it, I think of how my brother, sister and parents with feel, but is this life really worth it. I can't be happy. I used to think it was just teenage hormones. Now I know it's just who I am. I hate it, I hate myself. I dread looking in the mirror, I hate the person looking back, I hate the person that did ruined the best thing I have ever had. What you did to her is unforgivable. I deserve this. I deserve the worst. I can't do it anymore.
