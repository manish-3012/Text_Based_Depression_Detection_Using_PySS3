Wish he'd just kill me alreadyI'm to much of a pussy to do it myself. Only family that gives a shit about me(my grandma and her sister(my aunt)) are covered and probably anemic from bed bug bites that they got a few months ago. They're also hoarders. When I'm over there I can actively see them crawl around without even looking for them it's so bad. They're the ones that raised me and I feel like trash for not being able to help more.


 I have no time to help them clean despite using bfs last paycheck to get supplies to get rid of them.
 They Gave them to us , boyfriend lost his job so I got one, and his bipolar has been spiraling out of control and he beat the shit out of me 2 weeks ago. Police didn't do shit about it. Becoming alcoholic.

We're facing shut off on our gas, and I broke down and cried at the heap appointment because they couldn't do anything for me unless I find my ID, And I can't get afford to buy another ID, don't have a birth certificate, AND even if I could it takes over a week to send via mail. I picked up a job and within the few weeks of starting had to take off and tell them how I got beat on.  I don't fucking know what to do. I really just don't. I have no support, no one. Nothing but problem stacked on problem and I've been handling it but now I just don't know? I just wish he'd kill me
