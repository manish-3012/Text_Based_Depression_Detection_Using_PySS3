I need encouragement pleaseIts 8:22am and I am at work. I'm having lots of health issues and trial and error with meds to see what helps. I'm 21 and really scared. All I can think about this morning is how I really dont want to do this anymore. I really dont want to die but I dont want to live like this. I dont know how to get through this. I dont feel like I'm strong enough
