I'm so unhappy.Things have been so stressful lately. No one understands how unhappy I am; they think my life is perfect but it's not. I have so many expectations piled on top of me, I'm ugly as hell, Im tired all the time, and I honestly want to die.

I act happy, so I know it's my fault that no one knows I'm depressed and suicidal, but I just wish someone would see through my act and help me feel better...
