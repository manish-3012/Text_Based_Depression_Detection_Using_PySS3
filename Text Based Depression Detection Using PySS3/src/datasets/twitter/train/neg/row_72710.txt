I think more about my death than I do my future. I have a history of depression and suicidal thoughts. I have already thought about it three times this year and I actually attempted it back in May. Now that feeling is back. Everything at school is going fine and nothing bad has happened yet but I just feel like dying. I find myself thinking about my death all the time. I find myself wishing my cancer would come back and give me the slow &amp; painful death I probably deserve for being such a worthless waste of space. A couple weeks ago when I was driving to school, I found myself stopped on a bridge over the interstate sitting on the side. I was seriously considering jumping but I reconsidered after a kind Minnesota state trooper stopped and asked if I was okay. 

I look around at everyone else around me (not just at my school either), they are all tall and attractive and are really athletic, an incredible student, have a special talent, or are really social. I am just me, unattractive, short, nonathletic, a mediocre student at best, talentless, and a social failure. All of those qualities add up against me, I find it hard to believe that anyone would ever like me when there are so many better options out there.
