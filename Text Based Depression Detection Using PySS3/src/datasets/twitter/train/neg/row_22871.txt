I had a great weekend and I still wish I was dead.I had an amazing weekend. I went to a kinky sex party and hooked up with multiple people of both genders, then after therapy Saturday, I had a great date with a wonderful woman who even made me breakfast this morning. 

And yet as I am on my way home all of my dark thoughts and bad feelings quickly rush back. My s. ideation and fantasizing about death stirs right back to the surface. I felt it as soon as I saw a news story about the family research council wanting to eradicate transgender people and the feelings of doom and self-hatred overtake me.
