Invisible girl.Iâ€™m so tired of being treated as if I donâ€™t exist. People walk past me and bump me without seeing me, people will bully me while Iâ€™m standing next to them, people have zero regard for me. I have dedicated my life to be as kind and selfless as I can and Iâ€™m repaid by being treated like the worlds door mat. When does it end? Iâ€™m a senior in uni and even still Iâ€™m facing this. Iâ€™m your standard run of the mill fat white girl but does that mean Iâ€™m unworthy of love or attention? Even just acknowledgement? Last year, I was pushed down the stairs by someone I didnâ€™t even know. As I fell, I looked at their face and they looked me square in the eyes as I hit myself head in the concrete, causing me to lose consciousness and spend days in the hospital. But not a single person helped me. People walked past me. One girl even went as far as to step over me when she saw me. 

A student died due to a heart attack on campus a few months back. I wondered if I had died, would people hold a vigil for me? Would people cry for me? Would I die and people STILL wouldnâ€™t notice me? Would the only tears come from my mother? Would she be relieved that I didnâ€™t have to live the way I have been? Being a Buddhist; would she be relived that I could come back as something non human? Would she be at ease knowing I would be with her mom? Would I be making her life easier? Would it be less burden for her than being a single mother trying to get her daughter through college? Would I be making everyone elseâ€™s lives better? Because thatâ€™s what I have dedicated my life to, right? So why stop there?

Would people see me then?
