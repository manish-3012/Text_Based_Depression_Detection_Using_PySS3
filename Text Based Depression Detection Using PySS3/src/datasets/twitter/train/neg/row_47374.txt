Can't deal with it anymore.I hate myself so bad... i found myself searching for method to kill myself. I don't to suffer anymore. I'm not me anymore. I try to reach for people but i feel like i'm invisible. No one have the decency to call or talk to me or even just ask how i am. 

I don't want to go to the hospital either, i already been there before and look where i am now? How can a breakup do that to me? I was better... i had project... now i only see darkness, solitude. Can't deal with it anymore. I've had enough. 

I'm done
