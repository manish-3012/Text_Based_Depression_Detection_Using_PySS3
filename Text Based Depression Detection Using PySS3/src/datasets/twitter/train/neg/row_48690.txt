trying not to kill myselfi feel obsessed. my reasons for staying alive have been my roommates and my cats but I literally csnt stop thinking about it like i was driving yesterday and didnt do it bc I remembered that i loved them but i almost drove us right into the middle of oncoming traffic on purpose

im sitting here typing this at work right now unable to focus all day just feeling like I want to be dead. my mom said drinking sugary lemonaide was going to kill me faster and all I could think was good. my stupid little goals list feels meaningless and ridiculous 

I just feel like I want to die s o bad like I crave it
I think im going to call my doctor because im terrified of meds but im sure being numb will at least be nicer for everyone else around me vs me being dead I jsut cant take feeling like this anymore
