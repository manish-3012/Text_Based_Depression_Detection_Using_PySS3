Not sure I can do it anymore.I have no job, I dropped out of high school, my girlfriend (who I am certain is the love of my life) is drifting away slowly and I just overall have no future. I'm terrified of dying but I don't know what to do anymore. I tried getting my GED, passed all the tests except one and then quit that too. I don't have anything going for me in any way. I'm 20 and I live with my parents, unintentionally leeching off them. I would give anything to start over or be given a chance.
