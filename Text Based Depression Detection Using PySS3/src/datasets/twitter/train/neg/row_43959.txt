Slipping Through the Cracks: Testimony of a Subhuman in their Early Twenties  

# Slipping Through the Cracks

## Introduction

I have a First Class degree in a STEM subject. I have a Merit Masters degree in a practical engineering subject. Whilst at university, I served on the committee of the Chess Society as treasurer for one year and president for another, and I co-founded another society. I also completed a work placement as part of a module specifically tailored towards career development. 

Throughout my four years at university, I diversified my academic and personal interests significantly, and developed a host of transferable skills. I chose modules that gave me a broad understanding of different issues, so I wasnâ€™t over-specialised and could maintain a holistic academic perspective. I developed practical laboratory and field skills. I took modules on statistics. In my spare time, I read deeply into philosophy (specifically, moral philosophy, epistemology and the philosophy of science) and history. I studied physics and mathematics to the best of my amateur ability. I learned how to code in and designed, from scratch, a model to simulate the life cycle of stars. I even began learning another language, but had to stop taking lessons as it became too expensive to maintain. 

Alongside this, I obtained a job so far beyond my comfort zone I cannot sensibly quantify the distance between where I was and what I chose to do: retail customer service. I spent around 20 hours a week working in this job whilst doing my MSc and running two societies to boot. Whilst working here, I significantly developed my interpersonal skills and gained experience working with non-academics in a â€œreal worldâ€ environment. I gained a small amount of supervisory experience during my time here as well.  

To recap: two degrees, two societies, one completely alien job, a new language, a new coding language and work experience â€“ all organised and integrated so that each pursuit was successful (occurring against the backdrop of a turbulent personal life to boot). Sacrifices were made: I attended zero social events whilst at university because I was too busy working, I have never consumed alcohol or attended any parties, or indulged in anything people normally indulge in during their university years. I truly believed the lie of â€œwork hard, itâ€™ll all pay off in the endâ€.

What was the result of all of this?

**Nothing.**

No graduate job. Passed over for promotion many times in my retail job, so I am still on minimum wage. No post-graduate opportunities at the university. Continuing rejection and ignoration in the quest for a job.

## Deceived and Denied

The few jobs that are available in my field (despite being repeatedly assured this was a thriving field throughout my time at university by academics and industry leaders alike) all require 2 to 5 years of experience â€“ they donâ€™t even entertain new graduates. This is a catch-22 many graduates are familiar with: the experience loop. How can you get experience if you need experience to get experience in the first place? 

After dozens of job applications over two years, I have had a number of interviews, all over the country. Most places didnâ€™t bother getting back to me. I was justifiably pipped to the post in another job by another candidate, and for that I harbour no ill will. A role I would have been hired for was no longer available after the business was forced into restructuring. Another company offered me minimum wage to clean factory chimneys.

## Carrot and Stick, Except Thereâ€™s No Carrot

Retail is a notoriously brutal industry, especially for those at the bottom of the ladder. There are often two sources of frustration for retail workers: internal problems (being the structure, role and rewards of the job itself) and the external problems (namely, the treatment you receive from customers and the complete lack of structure in your life). Letâ€™s address these in turn.

### Internal Problems

To my surprise, Iâ€™m good at my retail job. Iâ€™m too good at it, in fact. I am not saying this to brag â€“ I am simply stating objective facts. I was ahead of every single one of my co-workers in every single measurable key performance indicator in store. Sales value, customer response scores and other metrics â€“ in each and every single field, I was ahead of the rest of the pack by a considerable margin. In many areas, including sales, I was sitting on double of what second place had. **This is despite the fact I only worked up to 30 hours a week as opposed to the 30+ worked by other workers.** I was never offered a full-time contract, because the company was focused on bringing in school-leavers on apprenticeship schemes.

I applied myself in this job. I excelled. I worked far, far harder than I should have done. I voluntarily worked through my breaks to signal dedication and industriousness. I swapped and covered shifts whenever asked to make life as convenient as possible for my co-workers and managers. I never asked to change shifts myself so as not to inconvenience anybody. I never took my holidays unless forced to, against to signal sincerity and dedication. I alone generated at least Â£250,000 on a yearly basis (10% of its annual turnover) for the store on a part-time contract through sheer hard work.

What was my reward for this hard work? 

**Nothing, or more hard work.** 

In the entire year after my MSc concluded, I was never even offered a full-time contract, no matter how hard I worked. I was never offered a promotion, or invited to an interview for a promotion. Whilst I was there, working twice as hard as everybody else around me, two of my co-workers were promoted into management despite being less industrious and less efficient than me. But thatâ€™s okay, they have been there longer and they deserve it on their own merits. In another instance, when one manager left and they were short, instead of putting me onto a training program, *they hired a person* ***younger than me*** *who had never worked for the company before*. My reward for my excellence is that I get to remain on the bottom rung, on minimum wage, with no real responsibility or reward. 

In my absence, a child who has worked for the company for roughly one year was promoted into management. Is this some kind of sick, twisted joke? Not only is she inexperienced and immature, when she was on the bottom rung she was a slacker: she neglected her duties, meaning others had to life her share of the load. She regularly took 5 or 10 minutes extra on all of her breaks. She ostentatiously avoided shop-floor duties, with the burden again falling to other people. She would spend substantial periods of time talking in the stockroom avoiding floor duties. What was her reward for this? Fast-track into management. How did this happen? She was doing a basic Level 3 retail apprenticeship, equivalent to a single A Level. When I was her age, I was doing 4 A Levels, two in STEM and two in humanities to diversify my knowledge and skills, alongside a fifth Level 3 extended project. 

Unfortunately for me, I made the mistake of a) working hard at work and b) working hard at university to get excellent results in **two** STEM degrees â€“ so I donâ€™t get anything. My reward for aiming high and pushing myself, which I have been assured repeatedly are the paths to success, is to remain on the bottom rung, while people less intelligent, less industrious, less honest and less capable than me get fast-tracked into authority because they chose an easier path, and now she is my boss. Work is a daily humiliation, being bossed around by her.

So thatâ€™s where I am now: taking orders from kids and layabouts whilst getting paid minimum wage to thanklessly generate 6 figure sums of profit for the store singlehandedly, with absolutely no prospect of ascension or proportional reward for my effort. Perhaps the thing that stings the most is that people who work less diligently than I do get rewarded. The simple fact is I am more valuable to my company as pond life rather than in management. (Or so they think. Iâ€™m not saying Iâ€™d be the best manager, but I think Iâ€™d be a good one.)

When you are consistently excellent, excellence becomes the expected norm, and with it, the extra effort you put in. If you take your foot off the pedal and fall short of your usual standards whilst still far exceeding those of the people around you, your ethic will be called into question. There is almost no greater cosmic injustice than this, and the rage and spite it induces are almost beyond compare.

Oh yeah, I forgot to mention I spent two weeks of my free time constructing, from scratch, a mathematical model that ensured the company could meet its company-wide targets in key KPIs based on data painstakingly mined from scattered archives. The result? One manager took a cursory glance at it and never looked at it again, despite its extremely powerful utilitarian potential. 

What, exactly, do I need to do to succeed and climb the ranks? People who are less hardworking and less capable than me and who have been there for less time than me are telling ME what to do. How does that make sense? In what universe is any of this justifiable or sensible?

I canâ€™t think of any word other than â€œ**exploitation**â€.

### External Problems Part I: Terminal Misanthropy

If youâ€™ve ever worked in retail, or if youâ€™re close to somebody else who has, you will be familiar with the deep, deep disdain for humankind developed in this line of work. The degree of misanthropy you succumb to varies from person to person. A few people donâ€™t experience any such misanthropy at all. In the middle of the distribution curve, most people range from minor disdain to actively avoiding people unless necessary. At the tail end of the spectrum, some people develop a pristine, fundamental hatred for all humanity and begin to treat exposure to other humans in any capacity as they treat exposure to radioactive substances: deeply unpleasant and bad for your health. 

Personally, I exist somewhere beyond that at this moment in time. When I say I am terminally misanthropic, I mean it in the sincerest sense. I spend every waking moment of every day apoplectically, murderously enraged, wallowing in abyssal despair, hatred and disdain felt towards almost everybody around me. I have a constant headache because of this, and I feel perpetually exhausted, both physical and mentally. I canâ€™t even escape by indulging in sleep â€“ not only is sleep a luxury in retail (it is possible to have 8 hours between shifts â€“ yes, 8 hours in which to travel from and to work, sleep, eat and clean), the few hours of sleep I do get are beset with violent, genocidal dreams and frankly tiresome displays of egregious violence and manifestations of pure, evil hate. I bore myself â€“ even I donâ€™t escape from my pervading misanthropy. Navigating life with this worldview is the metaphysical equivalent of swimming through hot tar.

This is how being exposed to the general public for 9 hours a day makes you feel, given enough time. This is the final destination for you all. If youâ€™re not there yet, keep working in retail, and inevitably, inexorably, you will arrive.

People are **terrible.** Perhaps theyâ€™re not all terrible all of the time, but the service environment and the relationship dynamic of customer â€“ service provider brings out the worst traits in almost everybody and magnifies them by a factor of a trillion. 

The foundations of the monuments of human misgivings that constitute the average person are that most people donâ€™t even see me as a human, as an actual person with feelings, thoughts and interests. They treat me worse than they would treat a dog. To them, I am nothing more than an automaton made of meat that exists to serve their every whim. Thatâ€™s it. The various expressions of this belief grate on you immensely. 

First of all, people donâ€™t even deign to *look* at you when speaking to you, or when youâ€™re speaking to them. They donâ€™t even look at you. Looking at you validates your existence too much. Youâ€™re not even important or meaningful enough to be *looked at* when being spoken to. This is such a small thing, but it is aggravating because it is universal, consistent and predictable. Quite often, I will ask people for help, and they donâ€™t even turn around. They just hold out the item they want, specify size or colour whilst looking at the wall and just expect me to summon it into their hands. Thatâ€™s how much respect people have for me. 

Secondly, people continually interrupt me when talking to them. Quite often, I am explaining relevant information to them, such as how to return items, how to order items, how I can do x, y and z for them and just interrupt me, asking a question whose answer I have literally just provided. Quite often they will dismissively wave their hand in agitation when youâ€™re answering a question theyâ€™ve asked, silencing you like youâ€™re a belligerent animal. By what right do they treat me like this?

Thirdly, oftentimes they just ignore you outright. If you intrude upon their experience of consciousness after forcibly making your existence known to them, it is common for them just to look at you in *disgust*. Your very existence is an affront to their conceited sensibilities. Theyâ€™ll often snap something at you or outright tell you to go away. One example is: I can say to people â€œJust give me a shout if you want any help,â€ and then Iâ€™ll walk away and they can call me if they need me. I wonâ€™t be pushy or overbearing with them. I invite them to conduct their shopping experience on their terms. Oftentimes, I will say â€œJust give me a sh-â€œ before they interrupt with â€œYES Iâ€™M FINE THANK YOUâ€. They donâ€™t even listen to what I say to them. â€œFine, thanks,â€ is not a coherent response to â€œHello.â€

As far as people are concerned, Iâ€™m not even a human being. And consequently, because this is effectively the only experience I have with people, I stop seeing them as humans and begin seeing them as cattle. I see them as tatty chickens pecking barren dirt for scraps of refuse. Thatâ€™s what they are. They are just meat stock. They are things that move around and make noise. They are non-entities, they are just temporary delays in a universal slide toward entropy, and their meaningless, fleeting existences will be deservedly extinguished long before they can comprehend the pointless conditions of their own pathetic existence. They are vermin. They are disgusting parasites that deserve to suffer eternally and agonisingly for their arrogance and conceit. 

The fundamental, universal and cosmic injustice of this customer-provider relationship cannot be captured by words. It can only be experienced, and it can only be experienced if youâ€™ve slipped through the cracks and are working a customer service based job.

I could find this treatment more palatable if I was an idiot who was capable of doing nothing else, but Iâ€™m not. I am not fulfilling 1% of my potential here. The only reason why I am not in a well-paying, impactful STEM job is because Iâ€™m unlucky and that I donâ€™t have family in the industry, or family who have contacts in industry. 

I get treated like a fucking subhuman by inferiors for minimum wage despite all of my hard work and sacrifices over the course of my life.

### External Problems Part II: Non-existent Work/Life Balance

The nature of retail makes it impossible to maintain anything resembling a work/life balance. You get two days off a week, but it is a rarity for those days to be consecutive. The days off change each week. Shifts ordinarily range anywhere from 7am through to 10pm, increasing to 11pm over Christmas and New Year. It is possible to work 10 days in a row, and to finish at 10pm one night only to start again at 7am the next morning. Nothing about this is conducive to a structured or organisable life. 

Free time is functionally non-existent. While although you only spend 9 hours a day at the workplace, and an additional 1.5 hours travelling to and from, the corruptive tendrils of retail slither around every other aspect of your life. Most often, your free time is split into two uselessly small fragments at the beginning and end of the day. For example, a 10-7 shift leaves you with, arguably, 4 free hours: 2 from 6-8, and 2 from 8-10. This is absolutely useless. These are anti-social hours. Little to no social clubs convene at these times. Two hours is not enough time to get invested in any given activity or recreational session, not to mention you will be tired in both of these two hour segments, further limiting your options.

What does this mean?

It means that your life has no structure. It means that you canâ€™t plan ahead, or commit to any clubs or activities. It means that you canâ€™t go to the gym regularly, because youâ€™ll either be too tired or not have enough time to go. Itâ€™s common knowledge that routine the most important building block of an exercise regime, and retail permits none at all. You canâ€™t say â€œon Monday I will go to the gym, on Tuesday I will have a piano lesson, on Wednesday I will go to chess clubâ€. None of these options are available to you. I understand that other jobs have time demands as well, but very few jobs indeed prohibit you from doing anything all in the same pervasive way that retail does. Even when youâ€™re not at work, youâ€™re still trapped within its confines. 

What are the consequences of this? 

Being unable to commit to an exercise regime leaves you feeling perpetually unhappy with your body. I want to be able to work on my physical fitness and to look better than I do now, but I cannot. On top of all of the other psychological tribulations of the retail industry, you also get to feel uncomfortable unconfident in your own skin 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. 

I want to be able to dedicate time to learning more piano, to reading and writing and possibly even to creating a YouTube channel. None of these things are possible because, as previously mentioned, the little free time that is afforded me is too fragmented, too inconsistently distributed and besmirched by exhaustion stemming from the job and its radioactive fallout.

So how do you get to spend your spare time when working in retail?

You get to sit, often alone, and wait for the day to end so you can go to sleep and go back to work. Thatâ€™s it. You canâ€™t spend time with loved ones for friends, if you somehow manage to have either of these things. You can watch some mindless shit on TV, eat some subpar food because you donâ€™t have the time to cook properly, let alone cultivate cooking skills in the first place. To say that this existence is depressing is like saying the surface of the sun is warm. This isnâ€™t life. Itâ€™s a living death. If you while away every hour of your life, you while away your life. Youâ€™re just waiting to die. That is the retail life. If I had the courage to kill myself, I would do it.

## Failure

I am complete failure. Being aware of the nature and scale of this fact about myself is shattering. I feel unworthy to be around anybody. I am ashamed to exist. I canâ€™t look people in the eye because Iâ€™m embarrassed by what other people might see behind my own. I donâ€™t want to vocalise my thoughts on anything because they have no justification in being sprung forth from a poisoned spring. Nothing I say or think is important or interesting to others, and by revealing the contents of my mind I expose myself to invasion and observation, therefore giving others an opportunity to see what a corrupted, hopeless and resentful wretch I am. If they havenâ€™t left me by the wayside yet, they surely will should they ever peek behind the veil.

I have accomplished nothing. I have failed to fulfil the smallest fraction of my potential. I feel like I am a jack-of-all-trades, but master of none. I can write, work, calculate, deduce and argue to an above-average standard, and yet nothing has come to fruition from any of these gifts. I have systematically failed to apply them in any constructive way over the course of my entire life, through a combination of laziness, a lack of confidence, and a lack of a work/life balance. I have used these gifts to navigate through an undergraduate and postgraduate degree that are ultimately meaningless. I have squandered them, and for that I feel nothing but shame. In many ways, I deserve my fate. 

Somehow, despite my vast potential, I have landed in my mid-twenties in a negative-status, minimum wage job with absolutely zero prospects for the future, both personally and professionally. I have passed my physical peak and have not been in shape since I was about 9 years old, spending my entire adolescence and prime as a fat, dumpy, doughy dollop of a man. 

As a male, I am acutely aware of my place in the hierarchy wherever I go, partially as a result of my own evolutionary psychology and partially because women, especially, are attuned to hierarchies to a very high resolution, again an evolutionary psychological adaptation to weed out the unworthy men from the worthy. I am at the bottom of every hierarchy. I am at the bottom of the hierarchy in my workplace. Women are not kind to men who are at the bottom of any hierarchy, doubly so when they themselves occupy a higher place in the hierarchy, which is why my female superiors at work scarcely miss an opportunity to swing their proverbial dicks around. I face humiliation and dehumanisation wherever I go. 

I still live with my parents. This is another source of shame and humiliation. I am a parasite and a burden. What kind of man lives with his parents? How can a man in his mid-twenties, the prime of his life, still be living with his parents? The answer is I would love to move out. I crave the independence and responsibility. But I keep getting rejected for tenancy by landlords because my job isnâ€™t good enough. The minimum salary requirements are 2.5x your monthly rent, which I meet for all of the places I would like to live in, but I am continually out-competed by men and women who are surely less intelligent and industrious than me nonetheless. This is another example of me being a failure. 

I have cultivated no hobbies or skills. I canâ€™t cook properly. I canâ€™t make art or make music to anything resembling a respectable standard. The only thing I can do is play video games to a better-than-average standard because I have sought refuge in them my entire life. They were valuable but harmful form of escapism during my difficult childhood, and continue to be so today, but they lost their lustre long ago: I no longer feel like Edmund Pevensie venturing into Narnia when I load up my Xbox, but like Wladislaw Spilman guzzling rancid, foetid water from a filthy mop bucket in a long-abandoned hospital. Video games â€“ so what? Who cares? This is the trait of a pathetic and failed man. 

I am an undignified misfire of a man. At this stage, I am a black hole of human happiness. I just sap the colour from every room, I strip music from sound and taste from food. I have nothing positive to say. If something does come out of my mouth, it is normally a violently retributive remark that, I know, far exceeds the apparent limit of sentiment caused by the occasion. Adam Smith identified this as being the mark of a brute, and he was right, and this is me. I feel guilty for being around people because I just make things worse for them. Everybody is better off without me being around on this basis. I cause them nothing but hardship and misery. I wish they could realise that I am mould on the bread and cut me off and cast me aside, because I do not have the strength to do it myself.

I am absolutely useless and pointless. I desperately want to repay my family for the help they have given me. I want to be able to take them on holiday, get them a new car, just do nice things for them. I canâ€™t. And I never will be able to. 

I have nothing to live for. I have sacrificed my youth on the altar of false promises and deceptions. All of my hard work has been for nothing. It seems that nothing I can do can ever change anything. Iâ€™ve tried as hard as I can and things just keep getting worse.

Perhaps the most stinging aspect of my failure is that I have tried. I have tried as hard as possibly can. I have thrown myself against this wall with all of my might for as long as I possibly can and it isnâ€™t even enough to make the smallest of dents. This is how pathetic and feeble I am. I would feel consoled if I knew I hadnâ€™t tried to hard to make a success of my life or my talents, but that is a mercy that escapes me. I have tried everything and I am unable to get away from square one. This speaks brutally to a fundamental deficiency in my own being.

## Anon: (Birthday â€“ 1st April 2020)

As of the 28th of November 2019, I have thought about death, suicide or being dead on a daily basis for roughly 3 years. There have been ups and downs across this three-year period. There are a few weeks where I only think about death for a couple of minutes of every day, often in bed at night before sleeping. There are periods of time where I sit in my room in the dark, alone, and think intensely about different methods of suicide, what the experience will be like for myself and those who find me afterwards, and what it will be like to be dead. 

Over the three years, I have tended, unfortunately, toward increasing morbidity and hopelessness. For the past 12 months, I have thought about death almost constantly over the course of each day, from the moment I wake up to the moment I go to sleep. Even if Iâ€™m with friends, family or loved ones, Iâ€™m thinking about death. Whether weâ€™re watching a film together, having a meal together or doing anything together, the chances are Iâ€™m thinking about death.

Iâ€™m driving on the road, and I think about driving into oncoming traffic at 100km/h. Iâ€™m at the top of a stairwell, I think about jumping off it. Iâ€™m having a meal, I think about slitting my throat with the knife Iâ€™m using. Iâ€™m in bed, I think about suffocating myself with my pillow. Iâ€™m sitting doing nothing, I fantasise about hanging myself, shooting myself, or exit-bagging myself, thinking about what it will feel like and what will happen when people find me.

People often tell me I seem quiet, or distant, or tired. Sometimes, increasingly, they tell me Iâ€™m not my â€œusual selfâ€, whatever my usual self is. There appears to be a vague, distant awareness among people around me that something isnâ€™t quite right about me. Some of them genuinely have no idea what is going on because they arenâ€™t perceptive enough. Some of them know something is seriously wrong but they lack the courage or the requisite care for me to do anything about it. Nobody knows how deep and pervasive these feelings really are. I was recently shocked to learn that my colleagues perceive me as a happy, upbeat and positive person. Few things surprise me, but this most certainly did. I find it hard to believe that almost everybody has no inkling at all of what is going on beneath the surface. I am not merely just quiet or serious in nature.

I am a corrupted, broken caricature of who I should be. I am bitter, hopeless, angry and jealous. I have nothing but disdain to everybody and everything in this world. I used to be so happy, hopeful and loving. I know that I am irreparably broken because I know if a golden olive branch was extended to me, I would bat it away out of spite. Psychologically, I am beyond salvation. Nothing can make me happy. I donâ€™t know whether this is because I am aware of some objective truths about the nature of life in general and the conditions of my own life, or if I am trapped in subjective thought processes that donâ€™t hold up, or if the proportion of regret and resentment as a function of a life that has simply passed me by is too much for one person to bear. Either way, these knots simply cannot be disentangled. This is who I am. 

At a guess, it was around the beginning of September that my plans to pull the plug finally began to crystallise. Since then, the thoughts of death and suicide have been constant, almost 24 hours a day. I dream about dying, killing myself or getting revenge on those who have wronged me. When I am awake, I am paralysed into lethargy, magnetised to my bed or the sofa, unable to summon the motivation to do something so basic as get a drink because I am crippled by thoughts of death and avalanches of hopelessness. 

My plan, I have decided, is to check out on April Foolâ€™s Day 2020. It seems like an appropriate day to do it, to check out of a life that is darkly hysterical on a day of jokes and japes in a world that is inside out and upside down, increasingly resembling a planet-sized freak show. 

In the end, I have decided to quietly and graciously exit stage, alone. This life has been a mistake. Nothing about it has been enjoyable. Grew up in poverty with violent, alcoholic parents. Mercilessly bullied every day at school from the age of 11, by pupils and teachers alike â€“ all of who went on to have better lives than me, lives that they donâ€™t deserve. Overcame my demons to excel at university and at work. All for nothing. 

On the 1st of April 2020, April Foolâ€™s Day, I will get up early, around 6am. I will cycle to a cafÃ© near the sea front and have a cup of tea and scrambled egg on toast. I will take myself to a bay where I used to play as a child, when I was filled with nothing except boundless optimism and joy for life and people. I will climb up those rocks for the first and last time in my adult life. I will listen to a piece of music, probably Chopin.

When this music has finished playing, I will dive head first off the cliff onto the rocks below and end this abortion of an existence once and for all.
