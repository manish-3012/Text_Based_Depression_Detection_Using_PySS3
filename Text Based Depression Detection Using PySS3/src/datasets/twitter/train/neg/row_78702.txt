Before graduationI'm a junior in high school. I'm going to kill myself before I graduate. I have nothing to live for. I have a severe stutter and I'm very shy so I don't have any friends. My boyfriend just dumped me because of it. My grades aren't good enough for university and not getting a degree will upset my parents. I have depression and I'm constantly sad. I feel selfish stating my reasons because so many other people have more serious reasons. I just feel like my life won't get any better. I'm a burden on everyone. I'm just so annoying, I don't understand how others can be around me. I don't feel like I'll achieve anything in life or be happy.
