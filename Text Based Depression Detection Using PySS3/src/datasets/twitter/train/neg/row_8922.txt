I made someone I love cut me off todayI am a very toxic person. There was this person that was nice to me for 2 weeks, and I fell in extreme love with her. She didn't like me because of my look and also because of my issues. But she still talked to me and we became close friends. She then liked someone else, and she trusted me and shared with that after I said I would be okay if she wanted to share anything with me. Well she gave up on that person and in the end, she went with someone else. I could never really get over my feelings as long as I was around her. So I would often have bursts where I would be really toxic and mean to her. I would do it so she can delete me so I stop feeling that way, cause I didnt want to abandon her. I loved her too much and way too much, like really too much. I was obsessed crazy, I would think about her all day, I would always have her in my thoughts, thinking of how she is doing, feeling insecure and stuff. She dealt with my shit always. But I kept pushing it and going far, in the end I got what I "wanted" and got deleted by her. But now I feel so sad and down. I feel so bad. I feel so shit. I wish I could beg and go back. But I would be a burden and it would be a repeat. I cannot handle my jealousy. She has someone. She isnt lonely. She will be fine. She will be okay. I hope all of that. I will never have her. I will never mean anything much to her. I got deleted mainly because I mentioned bad about her boyfriend at the end, I never thought the thing that would make her delete me would be that. Over her boyfriend and what I said was just a fact related to a game. I hate her as well. I love her as well. It was just 2 weeks that she made me feel so good. So why do I feel so shit?
