I had the perfect chance to do it, and now I regret I didn't take it.I've been thinking about the best to make it  seem like a natural death, because my mother is very religious and would accept isas god's will, and I finally decided on something (I'm not sure how explicit I can be) . I just needed to be home alone to make it look like I didn't notice the stove on. Yesterday I had the perfect chance, everyone was out and I knew I had plenty of time before they came back, but I kept overthinking it and ended up on my bed staring a my ceiling for hours. I feel so stupid now, the chance of me being home alone again, for long enough is very rare. And there's a wedding next month, so I'll have to wait until after because I don't want to ruin the mood. 

Edit; I just noticed that I mentioned the method anyway, if that's against the policy, feel free to tell me or report/delete my post.
