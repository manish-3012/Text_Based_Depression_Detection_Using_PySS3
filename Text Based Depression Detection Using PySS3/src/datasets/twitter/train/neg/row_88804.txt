I am depressed but i can't tell my parents soSo i've been getting sadder and sadder with every day and i can't find reasons to get out of bed anymore and i feel like if i tell my parents they're gonna be really worried about me and i don't want that i keep myself from suicide only by thinking "your friends are gonna be maybe sad about that"
