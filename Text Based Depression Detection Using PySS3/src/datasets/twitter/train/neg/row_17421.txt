I don't knowI never thought it would get to this. It feels pretty strange to want to die. I used to be scared of death but right now, it just seems comforting. I have one very good friend and it would fuck her up if I went through with it. Any tips on how I can push her away? I can't stand the thought of her going through hell because of me.
