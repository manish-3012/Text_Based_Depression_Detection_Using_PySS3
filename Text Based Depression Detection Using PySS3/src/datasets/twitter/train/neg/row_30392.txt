So I thought university will be better, but... HELL NOOk so first of all, sorry for my English.

I'm a 22yo/M living in Hungary. I was diagnosed with Asperger like 5 years ago.
I think that my only purpose to live is to give others somebody to hate.

I finished a post-secondary school this summer. I had a few people to speak with, but I was a target to bullying without even doing something.

In this summer we went to holiday with my family, and nearly everytime when they spoke with me, it was for something I did wrong (even when I didn't do anything). This was the time when I had a suicide attempt. Since then my family didn't tell me anything negative (and now they are overreacting so much) and my relationship with them is nearly perfect.

In the past week I started a university. I thought there are some more mature people so maybe somebody who would not bully me. OK, the first 2 days was OK, my roommates were wery friendly... Then I met with my studying group. OK, they were partying like everybody and I wasn't in to that, but when I tried to speak with them, they were OK.

But today...
The dormitory has a pub. We (with my roommates) discussed we should go to it. The first 10 minutes were good, but one of them were bring two girls and they were like... I don't know what... They discussed that I'm an asshole and like that before we even met. And this was not the end. When my roomates saw what they think about me, they started to humiliate me... So the whole evening was about how a little sh*t I am.
