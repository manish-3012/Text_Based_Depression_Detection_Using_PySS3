Itâ€™s getting so much worseFor a while after I dug myself out of a hole I felt great but just recently Iâ€™ve found myself slipping into an even deeper hole. I really canâ€™t go on like this and I canâ€™t tell anyone irl because nobody I know will take me seriously and nobody I know really gives a fuck. The only thing stopping me is the possibility of it failing and a fear of having to live on fucked up and even more miserable. Donâ€™t know what to do rn. Guess I just wanted to rant here since it helps at least a bit.
