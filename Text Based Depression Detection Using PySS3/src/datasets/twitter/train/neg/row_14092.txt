I am sane, and not delusional, and I am currently being ongoingly tortured by the most modern form of torture in history, I truly cannot wait to be on the other end of my removal surgery of the small metal foreign object that is inside of my brain/skull, that functions exactly as described. 

Title,

I am sane, and not delusional, and I am currently being ongoingly tortured by the most modern form of torture in history

I am being actively harmed with absolute impunity against my human will, through the continual use of a lowtech milestone of Neural Engineering, that is a radiowave-to-electricity converting interactive implant that is surgically installed inside of my brain/skull, that allows practical interaction with the actual subvocalizations, mind's eye, and nervous system.

Here's my removal surgery effort reddit post with additional outlining details, and a little public-facing diary of sorts in the comments. (this also includes a 'Why me?' section, within which I only guess as to why I was so fortunate to have this bestowed on me)
