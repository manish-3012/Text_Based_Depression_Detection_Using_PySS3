Extraordinary self loathingI have been depressed my whole life but it only seems to be getting worse, and the worst part is that I have a pretty cool life and people tell me how jealous they are all the time, which makes me feel worse.
I have two family members that I talk to. One mentally handicapped sister, not serious, just incapable of a real relationship,  and my mom who abandoned me when I was 13 to the state and I wish I didn't talk to. I travel full time and have no home base and only see my friends every few years, rarely ever see or talk to them online,  they all have kids or their own issues.  
Every day I beat myself up and tell myself how stupid I am, say way too many times that I want to die, and I know it's getting to my SO. There are some days where I struggle to not throw myself out the car door on the freeway and I regularly just want to stab myself over and over til I don't exist. I used to tell myself I didn't kill myelf because I was single and my poor diabetic dog didn't have anyone else but she died...I have my SO now to care for our pets,  I don't know why I don't kill myself but it's on my mind most of the day, every day. I see potential in life but I hate being me, feeling stupid all the time, being ugly, talentless,  unloved (my SO doesn't tell me nice things or that he cares really). Everyone in my life has always abandoned me so it's hard to just feel special because I have an SO btw, it proves nothing of my worth. I just want to enjoy my cool life for one fucking day. Pills make me feel like a zombie....any brainwashing camps out there?
