I'm scared.I'm very scared. I'm sad , I hate myself , I feel so disappointed in myself. I've been contemplating suicide for two years and I was happy for about half a year until recently . 
I'm so sad , I'm so scared . 
I want be okay and I want to be happy but I'm so afraid that I might fall back to deep and do something to hurt myself.. I hate it , I know I could do something , I know I want to do something , but I hate that I do.
