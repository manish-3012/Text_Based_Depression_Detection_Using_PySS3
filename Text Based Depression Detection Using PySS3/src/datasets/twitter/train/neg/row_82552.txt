What the hell am i supposed to do?I have nowhere to turn to, I'm 16 and i live with my parents and i have nowhere to go for my depression, any therapist is completely unhelpful and won't even see me, the medication I'm taking is not helping at all, and if i talk to my parents they just guilt trip me to stay quiet, so what am i supposed to do?
