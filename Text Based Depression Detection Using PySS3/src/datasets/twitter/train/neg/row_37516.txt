I really want to dieI don't want to be here anymore. I literally have nothing to live for I literally only have 3 friends of whom only 2 can actually stand talking to me regularly. I used to have 5 but 2 others dropped me.

I'm a 20 year old woman who will be 21 in November and I've done nothing with my life.

I've never ever been to a party. Ever. 

I've never been out past 12.

I've never been drunk and don't drink. 

I've never done anything fun. 

I've been bullied on and off all throughout my life which has fucked me up mentally. 

I have nothing and I can't do anything. I can't keep a job, it takes me hours to get the courage to just leave the house, and I'm going to fail at education for the third time in a row. That was the only thing that would break the cycle of misery but I'm very behind and there's no possible way I could catch up. 

I'm just done. I'm tired. I'm fed up. I don't want to be here anymore. I really want to jump off the top of a car park but I want to be sure that it will kill me.

I'm miserable all day everyday. 

I've had enough.
