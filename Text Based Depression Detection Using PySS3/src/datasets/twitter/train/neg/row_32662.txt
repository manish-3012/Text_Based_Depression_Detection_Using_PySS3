I don't know.I'm a failure. I hate myself. I've nobody anymore. I live in constant pain from a chronic illness. I don't know anymore. I try to stay strong, but lately that's been a losing battle. I feel that soon it might just be time to end it. I don't really care about any replies. I just had to get that off my chest.
