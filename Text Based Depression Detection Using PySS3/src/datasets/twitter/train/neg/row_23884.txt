Suicide is an option for meI  hate myself and I really do mean that. I hate my appearance and I hate my personality. I hate the fact that I'm still alive. I hate my situation.

I feel so lonely. Somehow I'm able to annoy every new person I meet.

There's no reason to why I'm still here.

Suicide is an option and I've been thinking about it ever since I was 11. 

 I'm glad that I've finally found my answer.
