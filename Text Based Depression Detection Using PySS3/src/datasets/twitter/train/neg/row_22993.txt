Goodbye and good luckLong story short , got my heart broken by the girl I love. I think about her every day and it hurts too much now. I don't want to move on and get another girl I just want her. I want to hold her and make everything okay and I can't because she doesn't care about me. I've been taking daily antidepressants for a year now and it's not helping. I try anti anxiety and that can't last forever. I'm scared of the pain or discomfort I'm going to feel when I kill myself . I haven't decided to od or cut yet. Maybe I can find narcotics and take that way out. There may be future girls but they won't be her. Life hurts too much now. So goodbye everyone , I don't think I want to live another month. It would have been our four month anniversary on Tuesday. I love her so much. I'm sorry
