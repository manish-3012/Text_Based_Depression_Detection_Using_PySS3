I am not leaving tonight.Itâ€™s not my time, yet. It will come, eventually. Just not tonight. 

Tonight I momentarily rest. 

Tonight marks another night where I donâ€™t attempt anything crazy. Tonight I take deep breaths and rationalize things properly. Tonight I stick to the plan. Tonight is another night I prove to myself that I donâ€™t really need to take the easy way out. â€œTonightâ€ is redundant. So is my existence. Just not tonight. 

Goodnight.
