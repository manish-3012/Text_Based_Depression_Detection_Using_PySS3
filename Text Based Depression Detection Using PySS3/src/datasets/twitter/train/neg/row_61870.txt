I genuinely hate that other people careI want to kill myself. Iâ€™m horribly fucking unhappy and I have no interest in being happy anymore. The love of my life left me, Iâ€™ve lost all interest in my goals, Iâ€™m developing an alcohol problem, and no matter how much I pray I donâ€™t think Godâ€™s listening. It genuinely makes me angry that people care, so I cant just fucking kill myself. Itâ€™s too selfish. I canâ€™t do anything for myself and Iâ€™ve never been able to. Everything I do is for other people, and I wish I could fucking paint a Jackson Pollock on the wall with my brains for myself. I canâ€™t keep doing this but I canâ€™t end it. So what the fuck are my options.
