How I avoid suicide and suicidal thoughts.I found myself using substances frequently to escape reality. I blamed the world for being fucked up and blamed myself for being a POS. 

I quit the substances. I then quickly realized the world isn't fucked up, but rather, I allowed my situation to devolve into a fucked up situation. I mean, how do you fix reality when you escape it frequently?

From here I developed a routine. Everyday I do the same few things with some variation. I wake up, I go to work, I diligently do my job as to avoid mistakes. I then come home, study for an hour or two. I then exercise. I then clean up as needed. Then I cook my meal for the day (OMAD). Then I meditate. If time allows, I play some games. I shower, I go to bed, I repeat. 

Developing this routine has brought me from the brink of suicide. It has given the mindset of "I'm not the best, I'm not where I want to be, but dammit I'm at least a little bit better than who I was yesterday". 

I share this in hopes that someone else in a similar boat may find their routine, and hopefully find a sense of value, and therefore a goal that drives them to make themselves better.
