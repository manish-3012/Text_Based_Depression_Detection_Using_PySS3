I ruined my family.(I have no idea of where to post this) 
It started around 1 year ago. My dad started texting regularly with this woman and after a while I got suspicious, maybe from too much movies or something, and asked my dad wether he was in an affair with another lady based on him texting her every single day. He denied it and said not to tell my mom saying my mom would misunderstand. 

After that incident a year passes, my mom tells me of her suspicion that my dad has been doing some suspicious "things" outside the family. I then tell her about the suspicion on my dads affair. My mom was shocked and she cried. 

After that, my mom hired a private detective to spy on him thus getting more info on said lady. My mom finds out and she gets extremely pissed off, telling me that she wants a divorce but in the end she dismisses this due to her lack of confidence on paying off me and my sister's fees in school. 

During last month or so, my grandmother passed away and the "affair lady" attended the funeral. My mom took this chance to tell this lady to "watch out". This lady was scared in awe and proceeds to make a police report. However, the police did nothing due to a lack of evidence. 

Because of this my dad finds out that my mother knows of this, he blames me entirely for it. He says that im to blame for the despair my family is in right now (my dad and mom fights every single day now) and boycotts me everyday. They might one day get a divorce.

The once happy family is no more. All because of me..... ( Sorry for bad English )

Edit: Thank you everyone for the support you've given me. Means the world. ðŸ’“
