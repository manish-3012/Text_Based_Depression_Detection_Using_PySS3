Why do I care about my health and wealth when I want to die anyway?It's weird, but I often worry about eating healthy and not contracting diseases. Also I worry about my finances. Why? I suppose the health thing may be anxiety/hypochondria. And finances may be about affording food so I don't starve because starving is a terrible feeling. I honestly don't know. Why can't I just walk into some empty void that will painlessly erase me from existence?
