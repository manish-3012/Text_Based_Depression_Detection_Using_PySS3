Do you ever get the feeling that it's only a matter of time before you do it?For me, every time I ever get even the slightest bit hopeful about something- every time I start to think that my life might turn around and something good will happen for once- it all comes crashing down in flames. Jobs, opportunities, girls, you name it. 

In the past I have told myself the old line about how "it gets better," but 20 years or so later it's not any better than it was back then. If anything, it's much worse. In 1997 you could say "hey, I bet that things will be great by 2017." Now I don;t even have that luxury.

There's talk of layoffs around here, and with that comes the end of health insurance, the end of meds and doctors. I figure that might be the best time to finally just put an end to this stupidity.
