I need someone new in my lifeSo I attempted to kill myself last night and have been debating on doing it today. My ex just told me after about two months that she doesnâ€™t even want to try and be friends anymore and has blocked me on everything. I want to do it so bad just to see if she even cares. Because it seems like she doesnâ€™t. But the more I think the more I realize that itâ€™s also because I feel like I have no friends. My work friends just donâ€™t seem to care enough about me and my old high school friends donâ€™t even try to stay in contact. I need someone in my life that actually care and actually wants to talk to me. I donâ€™t know where to go or how to find someone like that. Itâ€™s horrible and isnâ€™t helping my feeling of being alone and forgotten
