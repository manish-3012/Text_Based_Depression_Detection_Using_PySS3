No positive job or economic prospects , hate where I live and hate my life . Why shouldnâ€™t I die ?The reasons I have to live are few, and the only thing stopping me is I know my parents would be devastated when theyâ€™d find out  and my mother would feel guilty the rest of her life because Iâ€™ve been so depressed lately and she keeps on saying whatâ€™s wrong . I couldnâ€™t do that to her when sheâ€™s been kind to me in this very very very cruel world you people have made. If it werenâ€™t for them Iâ€™d be a goner and I wouldnâ€™t feel bad about it  , and every day I think of a new way to die painlessly and quickly and I feel so alone and unhappy
