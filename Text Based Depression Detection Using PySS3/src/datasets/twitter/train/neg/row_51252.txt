Have a butcher knife on my lap, about to drink a lot of cough syrup; I'm doneSomeone might argue that posting here obviously means that I'm not done. Maybe you're right. I just have no one to tell me differently. No one loves me, I'm an unattractive female, and I know for a fact that ending my life will only actually benefit others. Can anyone tell me what the point is? I really just don't want to be alive anymore.
