The last daysThe last days I felt so bad I could barely eat, I was on a good way the months before but now I feel like my life is over. I dont know what to do. I'm trying my best to also "fight" against my diseases I have. If I can't eat I will get the physical pain from the diseases soon as well. I dont know if its worth taking all this pain just in case it could get better one day
