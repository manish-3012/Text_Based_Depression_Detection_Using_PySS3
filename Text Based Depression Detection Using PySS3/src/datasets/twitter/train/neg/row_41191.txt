Nothing is really funI'm not sure how the formats work here if there is any, so I'll just complain. I haven't found anything fun for the longest time, and if I do, it usually doesn't last longer than 30 minutes before it'll never be fun again. I'm only 16 so I haven't seen much of anything, but I've just been waiting for anything to happen. I'm should be doing my homework right now, but I just don't see what anything is done for anymore. I've been having gender identity issues for my whole life, waited years to finally tell someone, and now that I did, I would have to wait even longer unless I want to tell my parents, who I don't want to bother with anything, especially my life. I'm nothing, but a bother and annoyance to everyone, not of any use. I apparently have a "text book case of depression", but I don't want to go bother someone with it. And even more, I can't bother to go to some person, taking away my free time of trying to find something fun to do to get anti-depression drugs, I mean I would try them if I just could get them without having to do anything, because I'm personally not interested in using them, but apparently they would help me. I waited 3 years to get into a school where I could speak more English and less Finnish, since that language is so fucking annoying, depressing and gives me a headache, and now I have no interested in being in the school, I don't want to learn things, I just want to know things, but of course life can't be that easy. Every other week I think constantly about just killing myself, and the other weeks is just me being depressed and stressed out by school which I see no point in attending, I just want to lay down and wait until I die, which I want to do more and more every passing second, will probably do it this week. This post is probably even too long for anyone to be bothered to read. I don't even care so I'm posting on my main account.
