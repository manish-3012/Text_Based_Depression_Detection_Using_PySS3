Its best this wayThis is the end.
I have drowned and dreamt this moment 
When it all started , I knew it was gone end , when I can't keep on going anymore , out of choices... , 
When I have to do healing before I sleep in order to don't get fucked to hell in my teeths , and you know what ? I CANT do the fucking healing anymore due to the sleep shocks that destroyed my brain energy , I can't do the healing and I'm gone sleep eventually so I would be fucked down to lowest Imaginable hell and then it's gone get worse , I just hate life cuz of low much fucked up it really was to live every second of this shit show , I'm disgusted from everything and everyone , and even though I knew it was gone end me up in here , I couldn't fucking stop it , it was a chain ,you wouldn't understand,,
This is the end
