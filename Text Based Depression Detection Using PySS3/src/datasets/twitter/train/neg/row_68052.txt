School is making me suicidalI almost jumped off my roof tonight. 

I was diagnosed with depression last year and I have been despising school since about 8th grade. I'm a junior in high school now. I barely made it through sophomore year. I considered getting a GED this summer before switching to online alternative school this fall. I have over 50 overdue assignments and the thought of dealing with them makes me sick. I hate everything about school. It's the main reason my life is miserable. And it feels like there's no way to escape it. 

On top of that, my passion is music. My band is crumbling. Something that I once had so many hopes for is falling apart before my eyes, and I don't even seem to care. I have no idea what I want to do with my life. I have no reason to live. Small things like friends and good times don't even help, because they're nothing compared to my immense, looming depression. My parents act like they understand, but they don't. My mom doesn't let me do anything that makes me happy unless I work on school. Simply not killing myself is an accomplishment to me, but she doesn't see it that way. 

School, the thing that depresses me the most, is inescapable.
