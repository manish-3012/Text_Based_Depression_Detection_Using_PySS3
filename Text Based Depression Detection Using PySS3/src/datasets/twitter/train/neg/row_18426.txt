Suicide isnâ€™t selfish, asking me to stay is.A letter my stepparents will never read:

Asking me to stay, suffering with no end in sight, until the mighty hammer of fate drops down on my head, is fucking selfish.

Trust me- I will try every fucking coping mechanism before I commit suicide. Therapy, hospitalization, hobbies, antidepressants, please know I truly and genuinely want to live.

But I donâ€™t want to live feeling like this. Everyday is empty. Everything is bland. Meaningless. Hopeless. Fleeting. Please donâ€™t guilt me into a lifetime of this.

I know even the thought of me leaving on my own terms angers you, confuses you, and ultimately- breaks you. I would never want to put my pain onto you. I will use all of my strength to stay if it means not hurting you. Because I love you more than Iâ€™ve ever loved myself.

But please donâ€™t call me selfish. Itâ€™s not like I want to feel this way. I hope if the day ever comes that I leave before you, youâ€™ll forgive me, and know that I lived this long for you.

Love, your daughter in pain.
