10 Months Later....It has been 10 months later and things that started to get slightly better became worse. Every time I make my mind up that I am going to follow through I think about my child and for some GD reason continue to feel like I have something to offer them... I want to protect them and be a positive influence and impact. I would do anything at all for them. They are the only one who don't look at me as a monster or predator and I feel like I am being a good parent to them.

Other people see me as less than human. To them I am worthless, sick, disgusting, stupid, trash, a waste. I am not a human but a thing that looks like them and cannot be trusted or lived with. Most generalize me into a group and don't say things to my face but to others. I don't care about that, I give no shits what others think, however, it does hurt my family...my child... and for that I want to ask how they think they are better than me. 

I always wonder if all the worry from my family would go away if I did. I would have to assume that it would based on common sense so I continually think of ways to go out. I want to help others and make a positive impact but is it even possible with my status? Maybe if I would go out for a good reason and doing something positive it would help? Who the fuck knows, but I am not going to lay down and let others words and actions negatively affect my family while I'm not dead.
