Don't Do ItI am one of only 34 people to survive the jump off of the golden gate bridge. At the time I was pretty young and struggling with severe depression. My family was talking a trip to San Francisco and  I decided to jump. I asked my parents if I could take a walk on the bridge by myself, they said yes. I walked to the middle of the bridge. The amount of physical and mental pain that I was feeling at that moment was crippling. I jumped. As soon as my feet left the railing I regretted it. There was a horrible feeling of regret. the 3 second drop felt like forever. I hit the water and at first there was nothing, then the shock came. I went over 70 meters under water. I did't know wich way was up and wich was down. I was running out of air. I felt something against my body. Then I blacked out. I woke up in a hospital, I had broken my spine and my neck was messed up but I was too confused to care. When I got released from the hospital I heard the story I was found on the beach barely breathing with a sea otter lying next to me. I am still depressed but I never consider suicide. I have nightmares and flashbacks of the moment when i jumped and that crippling feeling of regret. I will never forget how it feels I am haunted by the feeling of guilt it is a gut wrenching sense of hopelessness. What I am trying to say is don't do it don't commit suicide. It isn't worth it. I am still depressed but I don't want to die because there is always something to live for!
