Just need a little bit of helpMy friend and I (ex) were good friends but now we aren't talking anymore because all we did was fight.

I'm in the middle of a job hunt going awful, and the thoughts are coming back.

I wasn't asked to be brought into this world, if I wanted to kill myself, I should be able to. I know I'm being selfish, but man it's so rough and it would be so much easier.

Thanks for listening.
