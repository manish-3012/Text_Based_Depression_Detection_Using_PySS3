Hate myself, hate peopleNo one really wants to help anyone, they just want to say a few words to feel good about themselves. Especially those who have fallen so far they don't have the ability to help themselves. What then? People are disgusted by those who plead for help, who are desperate. Point me to a hotline, pills that do nothing, spewed out platitudes, condescending psychologists...Entry level jobs, what kind of entry level requires 3 years experience, sick of hoping for calls back, sick of the interviews that don't really look at skill, but how fake and cool you can be. Sick of giving my all to make others happy and receiving nothing in return. Sick of being the outsider, sick of being lonely, sick of caring about people who don't put a modicum of effort in even pretending to care. Sick of myself. Sick of crying.

No one is really going to help, not in a way that matters. The people who post publicly "feel free to pm me, blahblah I'm there" and get up voted and praised for being "good people" balk when they actually receive a pm. They give an awkward, sheepish reply and you never hear from them again.

No one will take my hand. They say I'm pretty, and nice. But no one goes out of their way to help the person who does everything to help them.
