Why should I be forced to live?As everyone and their dog knows, life has no meaning, this is a concept that literally every fucking millennial parrots all damn day. I wonder why this generation is fucking suicidal, I wonder why this generation's suicide rates have been climbing. Maybe its because so many of us see the lights, see the rails, but don't get off the fucking tracks. Heres the issue, at our current state in society, having a job is the way to survive, you are commonly working for someone else, who will make more than you all the time, hoping one day you will be able to enjoy that money later in life. Most of the time, to earn a living, you have to go to college, which racks you up around 50-60k in debt at minimum, so you start off with this goal of living life after you retire, with some money saved up, you are old, you are at your worst, your best years are flushed away, while also paying for debt. This is seen as normal. 

You need to work for food, bills, housing, you get it. The way I see it, its enslavement, and once you get enough money to leave it, you are now free. Problem is this doesn't happen to everyone, or if it doesn't happen tell they are in their 60s. Why should I be forced to go to college, get a job, work, and die early? Why should I be forced to do any of this? It feels like a fucking rat race. Trying to buy your freedom. I mean yeah, you could avoid all of this and just be homeless, but then you open yourself to a ton of danger and miserable shit. 

Tell me, why would anyone want to live life if all you are is a revenue generator for your employer and state? Why live a life where you have to worry and watch yourself on everything just to remain in a decent position? 
All woe is me aside, I can't see how it shouldn't be a persons choice or not to keep doing this.
