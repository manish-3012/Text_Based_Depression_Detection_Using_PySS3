Really having a hard time finding a reason not to just end it...I'm not necessarily suicidal, i don't feel the urge to hurt or kill myself, i don't want to hurt myself...

But i just want to die so badly it hurts :(

I just want it to be over already, I'm so tired of living just because "you have to keep trying until it gets better" and it's not getting better, it's doing the opposite...

I'm not suicidal...but honestly i really can't find a reason to not just kill myself, even without the urge to do it... 

:(
