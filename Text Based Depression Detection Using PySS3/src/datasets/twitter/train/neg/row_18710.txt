I don't know where to turn nowOn paper my life is fantastic. I have a good job, friends that care for me, and experiences that many would love to have. I'm not happy though; I haven't been happy for a long time now. I've lived my life thinking things would always get better; that life will work out eventually. It's been 24 years and while things have gotten better I feel like this might be the best it gets. I've spent this entire year just trying new things and hoping for dear god that something will make me feel like life has some worth.

I'm so tired now and currently in a tumble down towards drugs and periodic over-drinking. I don't want to see myself fall into this so maybe it's best to just end it now. I don't know. Life feels incredibly lonely though.
