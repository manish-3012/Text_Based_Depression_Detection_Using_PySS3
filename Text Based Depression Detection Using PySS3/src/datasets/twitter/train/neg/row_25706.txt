Am so uninterested in life without what I hadWas completely in love and he broke up with me. Feel like I've not only lost my best friend and my boyfriend but I've lost my mind. I'm not who I used to be anymore, I have no drive, no focus. It's been a month and I'm still faking my way through conversations and distracting myself with what were the distractions I used until I got to talk to him again. The love consumed me whole and now the only time I feel happy is when I'm lying to myself.
