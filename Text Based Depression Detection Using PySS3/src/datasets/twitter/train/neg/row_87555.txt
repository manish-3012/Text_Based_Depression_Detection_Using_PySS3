What am I even still doing here?I'm a 34 divorced female with no plans of ever having children.  I have made one suicide attempt in my life and have pretty much thought about it every day since.  I'm basically still here because of my parents, which is a pathetic way to exist.  I don't even feel like I am doing anything but existing.  I cannot believe I have made it this far in life without trying harder to end my life, I just see my mother crying every time I tell her I want to die.  I have suicide notes typed up on my computer, I am starting to pull away from people and things, closing up unnecessary accounts.  I'm disappointed every morning that I wake up.  Every night when I fall asleep, I pray I have something happen to quietly kill me while I sleep.  I've told many people about this and most don't get it.  I hate this country.  I hate this life, this generation where everyone does everything electronically.  I have lost touch with life.  I've lost myself along a painfully long journey and I don't see how it can improve.  I'm safe for now but as I approach 35, it seems like I'm approaching the end.  I don't see a future in my career.  I don't see a future with certain people in my life.  I just don't see a future in general.  Can anyone relate?
