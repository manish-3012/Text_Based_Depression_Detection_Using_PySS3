I don't know what I'm doing anymore. I'm hurt and confused. The one person I thought liked me, hates me. I don't want to live anymore and everything I've done has been pointless.Why does it hurt so much. I'm on the edge it's so goddamn tempting. No one cares, I'm only hanging on because I fear physical pain.
