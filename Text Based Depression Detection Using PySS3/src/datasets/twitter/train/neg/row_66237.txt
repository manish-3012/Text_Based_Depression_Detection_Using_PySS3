I have a date, but also gave myself a last chance to try.Things have been going bad for many years. Honestly, I desire the ability to vanish like I had never been born. Doctor Who planted this idea in my mind; in the show this concept was described as an terrible way to go, but to me its sounds freeing and peaceful. I resent this world denying me the choice to exist in the first place.

I know I don't have this option, and the alternative is way more...unpleasent. Not so much for me, but for the ones left behind. But I haven't felt alive for too long for me to care. I gave myself a last chance: a very reasonable time window to make changes in my life and get my shit together. If things work out, great, but if they don't at least I can say that I tried.

I am posting this as a reminder of how I am today, so I can look back when the day comes.
