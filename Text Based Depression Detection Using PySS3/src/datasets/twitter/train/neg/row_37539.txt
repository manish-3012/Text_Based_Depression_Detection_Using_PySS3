I want this to stopI feel so worthless i feel like killing myself most of the time. The feeling builds until I almost go through with it. When i finally decide that today is the day I'll do it I have a good day and decide to live, but the depression always comes back stronger. I'm so tired of this cycle. I just want to fade away and not have to feel anything ever again.
