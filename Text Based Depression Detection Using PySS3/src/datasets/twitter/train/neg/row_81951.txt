I'm struggling to get past each minute.I live by a idea (or whatever) of "Just get through the night and start anew tomorrow", well I honestly am struggling to continue through each and every minute. I have music on so I can't hear my own thoughts.

I'm struggling to articulate my feelings into words, there are no words to explain *this* right now. 

I live with a relative who was kind enough to take me in, but never wants to talk to me. I spend each week barely speaking, I feel like I'm going insane as the months drag by, over few months I've begun having conversations out loud just so I can have a conversation, even if nobody is there.  

I have a psychiatrist, it's not helping. I have been in all kinds of different therapies with all kinds of different people, nothing is helping. I don't date, I can't seem to make friends with people and I know it's my fault, but I'm clueless. I don't know how to cope this night, I don't know how I'm going to cope tomorow at college. I don't think I can do this anymore, years like this and I can't even get a job, I can't even make friends, I'm fighting for a life, fighting against the agoraphobia, against the anxiety, against the depression, only to have my life like this, empty, devoid of anything. This is it isn't it, this is the limit, this is the rest of my life, struggling to get through each day, feeling like I'm going insane, trying to not slice my throat open every day or overdose.
