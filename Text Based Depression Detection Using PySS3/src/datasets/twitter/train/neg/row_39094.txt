Logically, why shouldn't I do it?There's no reason for me not to commit suicide.

I am hated. My parents don't love me and they've proven it to me. They make me feel worse when I'm already at my lowest. My mom openly talks about how shitty I am and what a failure I'll be. She takes out her anger on me and yells at me for the tiniest things and makes me want to die.

It's fine though, since I don't love my parents. I'm not in a place to move out (I'm 16, and have nowhere to go). The one person I truly love is a girl who doesn't know how I feel. She's just a friend but I feel like she's so much more to me. I know I'll never be with her. We're incompatible beyond belief. She's as far as she can get from available. I'm trapped in a situation where I can't even feel attraction to anyone else. 

I'm too distant from my friends now, too. I've lost hope in any happiness for myself. There's no logical reason I shouldn't do this. I am a failure.
