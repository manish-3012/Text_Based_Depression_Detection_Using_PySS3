Idk whatâ€™s wrong with me..19(M). First post, heard people spread love here, never the type to vent but here it goes..Some days Iâ€™m myself, some days I wanna die peacefully, some days Iâ€™m angry at the world, some days Iâ€™m not motivated and donâ€™t wanna do anything and sometimes Iâ€™m up and energetic and ready to start the day. No Iâ€™m not bipolar, I wasnâ€™t diagnosed nor do I see any crucial signs but my doctor said this could be signs of upcoming depression and I donâ€™t wanna just throw that word out there, but I believe it. Iâ€™ve lost a handful of people in my life, dead or still alive, but I walk around like everything is all peachy, Iâ€™m numb to it. I never got the chance to be a kid when I was young, I had to see and handle grown man things so I still do childish and kid stuff here and there, who doesnâ€™t? I canâ€™t help it. I feel like I annoy everyone I get around, so Iâ€™m always quiet and my anxiety starts to act up. I canâ€™t even talk to my parents without being slammed, my â€œfriendsâ€ donâ€™t really listen, I only hear â€œthatâ€™s crazyâ€ or they switch the topic to themselves so Iâ€™m left with an unheard voice and a pained heart. My outside family such as â€œcousinsâ€ and all, they all hate each other and my family is basically segregated with one side not messing with that side over something dumb, so no help there either. Weed seems to be the only thing that keep me calmed from flipping out and finally raging but sometimes it doesnâ€™t and I feel like upgrading to something harder like cough syrup and xans, but I know whatâ€™ll Iâ€™ll turn into. Someone mentioned maybe Iâ€™ve only ever experienced tough love and maybe I just need affectionate love, idk, please I just need to know whatâ€™s going on, I just wanna be in a better place than this, what it feels to be at peace and happy for once, I just wanna know Iâ€™m cared for you know? cuz if Iâ€™m not, what am I doing here? Advice isnâ€™t needed if you donâ€™t want to, ive been wanting to let out how I felt for years.. doing so is doing something already &lt;3, stay blessed everyone.
