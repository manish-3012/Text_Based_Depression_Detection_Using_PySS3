Today is supposed to be the dayI planned to do it as soon as I had everything I needed to go through with it. I didn't think it would be so soon. Now I'm hesitating. Not because I don't want to die but because it's sooner than expected. I expected to have at least another month, not for the last item on my list to just drop into my lap so easily. It probably won't be happening tonight. I hate myself for it but I don't think I can do it a month sooner than I expected
