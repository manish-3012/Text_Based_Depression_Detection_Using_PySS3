Completely detachedI see a therapist and a psychiatrist. I get at least an hour of light exercise everyday. I go to sleep fairly early. I meditate. I journal. I express my feelings. If I had any real-life friends that I felt comfortable around, I'd tell them about what I was going through. 

I live with my parents. I'm unemployed, I have Neuroendocrine cancer, and I got brain damage in a hospital accident that permanently crippled my sensory processing abilities. I can't enjoy life anymore. In fact, life causes me a hell of a lot of physical pain now. Light and sound don't abide me like they used to.

And I do everything people tell me to do. Everything I mentioned in the first paragraph, and even more on recommendation from what few doctors are qualified to help me. And I'm only getting worse.

This'll be the hundredth time that I've posted here. I've tried helping other people out with their struggles, and even when I succeed, I feel nothing. I can't get a job, I can't get into a relationship, I can't get into anything. I'm stuck in my room all day.

I don't know what to live for anymore.
