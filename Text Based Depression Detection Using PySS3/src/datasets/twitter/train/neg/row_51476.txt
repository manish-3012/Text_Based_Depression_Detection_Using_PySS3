Idk what to doEveryday  I remember all the promises and things we said and how they never came true. 

I've already tried to drown myself but midway through when the water was filling me up I got out. 

I've tried walking in front of busy traffic downtown but they keep stopping.

I've tried hanging my self with my patch cable but it snapped 

The only thing keeping me here is when I play bass in front of people, I just want it to end already I wasn't good enough no matter what she says I did something wrong I lost her I fucked up somehow and now she's gone despite what she's said. Just make it stop, I want to make it stop I'm not fit for living if I can't keep her
