I don't know if I can keep goingThere doesn't seem to be anything to live for. I've worked so hard to find some way to connect, or even feel remotely safe and comfortable around another person, but somehow I always get knocked back to square one.

My way of coping when things get rough is to completely disconnect from the wants, needs, and hopes that define what it is to be a person. And without those, there doesn't seem to be a point of being.

I'm overwhelmed. I don't know where to go. I feel terminally alone and abjectly alienated. I haven't so much as shaken a hand since December. I haven't felt really heard or seen or safe in years, and it's something I experienced only briefly.

I just want to be present with someone. I want to hold on to someone. I want to be able to express how much I love people. I want to be loved. 

Maybe I'll die having never had a real relationship, having never really communicated what I am feeling, having never really had a place in someone's heart. And then, what difference is it if I die tomorrow or decades from now? Only decades of suffering?

I know it could be different, but I don't know how to find my way. And I don't know how to keep myself going.
