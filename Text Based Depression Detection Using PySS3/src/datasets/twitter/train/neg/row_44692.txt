Every second I fantasize about putting a gun in my mouthI can't help it. No matter what I can't shake the feeling of putting a pistol in my mouth,pulling the trigger and bam! No more problems. Does that make me an asshole?

Maybe, but so much ofmy life has been dedicated to others,why can't I just let that be past and die
