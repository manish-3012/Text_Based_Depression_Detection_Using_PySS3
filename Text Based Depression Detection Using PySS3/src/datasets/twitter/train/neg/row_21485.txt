My sister saved me from suicide without even realizing itTitle. This happened last night. Iâ€™ve lost hope, am incredibly stressed out, and have lost a will to live, so I decided to hang myself (after months of wanting to). I had everything ready: the noose hanging from the ceiling, the chair to kick out from under me, although I didnâ€™t write any suicide notes. However, just as I was about to, my sister knocks on my door saying sheâ€™s tired. I quickly scramble to put everything away and I say she can come in and hang out for a bit. After that was done I had lost the will to try again. Now Iâ€™m really struggling with wanting to try again and Iâ€™m really not sure what to do. I told one person about this irl
