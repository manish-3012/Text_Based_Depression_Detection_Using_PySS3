Ive done something really bad thatâ€™s making me want to just end it.I havenâ€™t tried to kill my self since I was 16 Iâ€™m 22 now. I was doing well. But I fucked up everything. I cheated on my Bf of 7 years with his best friend since he was a child. Iâ€™m a monster. We all hang out all the time and since this pandemic we all literally stayed together for 11 days straight. One night we were drinking with my family  and my Bf went to bed early. I donâ€™t remember how it happened or much but me and our friend were the last ones up, I know what happened. I know I have to tell him but Iâ€™ve been putting it off. I told my sister and she said I should talk to the best friend to see what he says. I truly am a horrible person I donâ€™t see any other way out. I feel sick.
