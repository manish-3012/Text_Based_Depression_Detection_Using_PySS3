I need to talk.I'm wondering about suicide. I'm wondering about my options. I'm wondering about the consequences of it. 

Telling my friends has the effect of driving them away. Telling my family has the effect of making life harder. I just want to tell somebody I'm thinking about suicide. 

It would be cool if I could swap stories with somebody else who needs to talk. I guess PM me, or post a story and I'll reply with mine. Just not sure the specifics would be interesting.

Help.
