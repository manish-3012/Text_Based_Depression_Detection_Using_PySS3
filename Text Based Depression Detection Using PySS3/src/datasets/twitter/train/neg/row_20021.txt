Just another guy rambling might as well skip it.Hello, hope your day/night is great!
They say the kindest people have the most sadness that in them and I so far believe this. 
I know that ending ones life will hurt the ones around me. That is why I try to live as much as possible I do hate myself I do want to die. Each day I think about how Iâ€™d like to do it. I had someone I loved so much and it hurt so much when losing her. I miss her daily and wish I could turn back time to be with her again or to have her say I love you once more.
I cry each morning from the loneliness that is what I am and I then wipe away the tears and start my day of a nightmare. Throughout the day I tell myself I am worthless and donâ€™t deserve to eat or have anyone. I take a shower and cry from missing the one I love so much. I play games and try to take my mind of the pain. I eventually go to bed and cry before bed. 
I cannot just let her go, she is engraved in my heart. My mind is broken and I can feel myself slowly dying. I shanâ€™t die yet. I have my father to live for. Maybe after he dies so shall I. 

Sorry for my random talking I basically just said whatever was on my mind.
