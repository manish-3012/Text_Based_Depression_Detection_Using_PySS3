Fucked my life up something fierceWon't bore you with the details; I'm really a fairly average case here: Dysfunctional, abusive family, multiple mental illnesses, wasted academic potential, and the like. Tried to take my leave of it all when I was 13 but could't follow through. It looks like antidepressants can only do so much for me, as my father and his brother have never really been able to overcome their problems either. I've already decided against ever having kids because I could never live with myself if they inherited all this from me, so it's not like I have the idyll of domestic bliss holding me back.

I'm so sorry to my family. I have such bone-deep regret. I could have -should have- been a better son. Sometimes I dream of another life, or really another me, a me who wasnâ€™t at war with myself, and all the things I could've achieved then. But ultimately it's just that: a dream.

I'm not sure why I'm writing this. If anyone reads it, I hope it motivates you to attend closely to your own mental health, as well as that of your loved ones. Maybe this could've been prevented if I took action sooner.

Be cheerful. Strive to be happy.
