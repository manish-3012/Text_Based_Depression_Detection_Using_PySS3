intrusive thoughtsHello all! It's the first time I'm on this subreddit. I've been dealing with a lot of intrusive thoughts. I'm a very abstract thinker (I don't have an inner monologue) but I distinctly think the words "I want to kill myself" whenever I see a picture of myself or think about something I've done.

I don't really think I'll kill myself but I do fantasize about being *gone.* My parents would be okay -- or not, but maybe then they'd feel bad for making me this way. My brother and his partner would be better off. My friends from my hometown and my friends from uni would probably be temporarily upset. But, they'd know at least-- how depressed I was. Maybe then they would forgive me for everything I've done and realize it was just because I am a fundamentally *off* person. My boyfriend would probably be traumatized but he'd be better off in the long run. He could finally be with one of the girls he has desired while we've been together.

I don't know if it's just COVID or what but man, I'm struggling. I've been practicing good mental health hygiene (working out, eating well, water, sleep, showering) but alas I am still dealing with fantasies of being gone. I just wanted to share. If you're reading this, I think we can both get to a better place. We are in the middle of a pandemic but it will pass and we will find joy. Right?
