ClassmateI was sleepy af, but couldn't fall asleep so I've been scrolling thru Youtube. This one song from Yung Lean showed up on the main card. I just played it to listen a bit while looking for something more interesting to watch. My heart felt a dagger going straight thru it when the first few notes played. All the memories of him came back - from the day we've met to the day I found out about his death. He showed me Lean's music and it'll always remind me of him. When I think about it, just for a moment it makes me wanna live just not to hurt anyone. 'Cause we weren't even close, just classmates, and it hit me so much anyway.
