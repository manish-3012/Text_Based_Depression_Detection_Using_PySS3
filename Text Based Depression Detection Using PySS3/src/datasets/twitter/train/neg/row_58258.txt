Hello there?I really didn't wanted to write here, and to be really honest I don't even now right now why am I doing it. Afterall this is a suicide related sub, and I don't have the guts to do it finally. But I swear that's the only thing that I really want, since a very long time. In the last months, I haven't done anything mentionable, just drink (yeah I became an alcoholic), smoke (cancer is near I can feel it) and make the people who love me hate me (and it worked so well, that I'm more lonely than ever) .So yeah, my goal is certainly to die finally, but I just can't do it. I'm empty inside, and I feel that nothing can help me anymore. I also deleted every social media accounts I had, I kept only the good old reddit. If you feel like that you have a word or two for me, I really want to listen to it, since I havent spoken any words in the last two days (I mean it: nothing).
