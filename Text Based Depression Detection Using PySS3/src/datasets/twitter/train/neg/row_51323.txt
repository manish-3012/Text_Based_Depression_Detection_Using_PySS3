I donâ€™t know anymoreAt this point, I am just too tired to do anything. I want to disappear. I donâ€™t see any reason for me to live because no one cares about me and I am useless at everything. I recently had a fight with my best friend and I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m the toxic one. I donâ€™t mean to be... Itâ€™s as if everyone in my life has someone that they can go to and genuinely enjoy life with together, but for me I donâ€™t have any friends, just people I am â€œacquaintancesâ€ with and only talk to because Iâ€™m forced to through school. I donâ€™t know how else to put this, but at times, I feel so dumb. Iâ€™ve been trying to improve myself socially and educationally, but Iâ€™m just going no where. People tell me it gets better, but Iâ€™ll always be the person that no one wants to talk to and is looked down upon. 

Sometimes I feel like Iâ€™ve lost my personality. I donâ€™t feel any emotion towards anything anymore, and Iâ€™ve been told by others that I act like a robot. I just want to find myself again.
