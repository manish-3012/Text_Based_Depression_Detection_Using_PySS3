Why does this subreddit have the upvote/downvote system?I find it quite strange, it's as if some people's thoughts on the matter are more important that those of others. It also implies that some suicidal people are more important than others, that some people's sufferings are more important. Am I right? If not, then why is it here? Does this place really need it?
