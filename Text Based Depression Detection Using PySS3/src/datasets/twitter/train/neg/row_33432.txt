My mental health has dipped lower than ever beforeIve never been this depressed in my life. After past attempts at suicide and after crying for hours and not leaving bed for days I can't be more depressed than now. My feelings from the moment I wake up until I got bed I'm just sad. People can do things that improve my mood slightly but I'm still just a broken person.

I've tried anti depressants in the past but they made me feel no emotion at all and that was almost worse than how it is now. I work 5 days a week and go-to school full time the other 2 days I have free. I can't take a mental health day, and whenever I try to surround myself with people that make me feel better now they tell me how much of a burden it is that I'm sad all the time. My girlfriend said a couple weeks ago if I didn't stop then she wouldn't want to be with me anymore and that obviously didn't help. I'm about to start class 2/4 for the day today and hope I can manage the other 2.

Heres to hoping I'm not a ghost by the end of the night :')
