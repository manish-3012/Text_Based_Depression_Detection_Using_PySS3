I'm Tired.I'm tired of it all. 

I'm tired of waking up each day. I'm tired of going to sleep. I'm tired of devoting every day to shoving down my issues with unproductive distractions.. I'm tired of living my life, or lack of life, because I really don't have a life. 

I'm also tired of hearing questions. I'm tired of people's suggestions. I'm tired of hearing the same things again "You should do this", "You should do that" "It gets better". I'm going to snap.

Most of all, I'm tired of myself. Tired of being. And I know what you would say, "I'm here for you" "I wish I could help" "Let's talk about it" there's no point. I've done it all before. There is no reason. There is no rhyme. The more time I spend, the more I see, being alive's just a waste of time.
