doneso, i dont know if anyone even saw my other post, but i have basically lost interest in living. i have always sort of planned out ways to die in my head, but never really planned on doing them. but im scaring myself right now because i am actually thinking of doing these things. i actually want to die. posting here has been more of a venting process than a call for help like most people... only place i can really post this stuff without getting my posts taken down for "bad etiquette". so i dont know when im gonna do it. it could be tomorrow, could be 14 years from now. but it will happen.
