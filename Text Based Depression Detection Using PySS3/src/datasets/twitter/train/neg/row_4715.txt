I'm gonna give myself a monthI've been depressed since I was 10 years old. And so far it's only gotten worse. I can't even feel anything but pain or numbness. After a month I'm going to decide whether I'm dead or not. I kept telling myself it would get better for over a decade and things have only gotten worse. Please don't tell me it'll get better. Tell me something might be true...
