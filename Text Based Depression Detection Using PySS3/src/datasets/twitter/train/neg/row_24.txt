revenge suicideDoes the thought ever cross your mind? Do you ever alone, isolated, uncared for? Do you feel like youve reached out over, and over, and over, and yet no one hears you or takes you seriously? Do you ever feel like everyone in your life has given up on you?

I feel like jumping off this roof right now is the only way anyone will ever notice, or care, about how much pain I feel. No onewill care until Im dead, and then people will finally hear me. they'll understand I was serious. theyll understand how much pain Im in right now. Theyll wish they would have tried harder to listen every time I spoke about hurting myself, or ending my life, over the past twelve months.

I may be dead, I may never be here to see it, butpeople will finally care. Peop'e will finally notice my pain. And itll be okay, because ill be dead, and because there wont be any more pain. there wont be any more anything. and thats really really okay.

im a coward. im an enormou fucking coward. but im sitting up here, on this roof, slowly dosing up on medication. i hope that if i wIt long enough, if i take enough ativan, i wont be coherent enough to feel fear, or regret, or second thoughts. ill be dead near instanstly when i jump. Its finally gokng to be over, and I feel so happy
