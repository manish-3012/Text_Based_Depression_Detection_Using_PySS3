Lost humanity?Anyone else feel like an insect from kafka's metamorphosis, for example? Dehumanized and emotionless with insect-like needs and behaviors, sheerly existing for whatever selfish base needs and desires must be fulfilled, to be a harmless docile fiend on the hamster wheels that power the capitalist machine? I realize that philosophically I'm no longer a whole person, from meds, isolation, and apathy, but I don't give a shit. This makes me an extremely bad person and I don't give a shit, I don't wnat to change in fact I'm getting worse, but I no longer have the empathy or feelings to be compelled to chnage my situation as this fiendish metamorphosized shell of a person.
