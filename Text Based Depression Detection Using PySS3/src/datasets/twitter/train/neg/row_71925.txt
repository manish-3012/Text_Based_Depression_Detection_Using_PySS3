I killed my gfThis is pretty much it, I'm going to go to prison for life and I guess I'm trying to find the energy to turn myself in. I killed her 5 days ago and people are starting to look for her, her body is cold and I don't even know if it's better to just kill myself as well or turn myself in. 

I got mad at her because she kept going out for longer than 9 PM which I don't allow her to do, she left with her friends and came back at 2, I got carried away, I tried to scare her with my gun that if she ever left I would kill her, I pulled the trigger and killed her. 

I honestly don't know what to do.
