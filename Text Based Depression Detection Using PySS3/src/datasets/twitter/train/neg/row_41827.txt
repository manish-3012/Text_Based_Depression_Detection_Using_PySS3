being a healthy, functional person feels so impossible.(i put the nsfw tag on as a CW for sexual assault)
itâ€™s the day after christmas and iâ€™m in bed with my new fuzzy throw blanket, with my new candle lit and smelling up the room, listening to music on my new speaker and i should be grateful. i mean i am, for those things, but they should be making me happy. i shouldnâ€™t have had to force myself to look excited yesterday when i opened them, but i did. iâ€™ll have to look at these things every day and be reminded of the christmas i got drugged and raped 3 days prior to it. 

itâ€™s not even anywhere close to the first time for this to happen to me, and i canâ€™t even say itâ€™s not my fault. iâ€™m an alcoholic, i make bad decisions, i risk things. i donâ€™t feel good enough or accepted by anyone other than older men who want to get into my pants, and then iâ€™m surprised and hurt when they decided to force that. iâ€™m literally fucking stupid.

i have so much resentment towards my family for how i turned out as a person. if they had actually raised me, i would have a chance at a real life. iâ€™m not killing myself, theyâ€™ve already done that for me in every instance of neglect. i was a child being touched by the men my family let into our homes and no one listened to me. i was scared of everything, and instead of walking me thru the fear, they ignored it and let it manifest into panic disorder and agoraphobia. i didnâ€™t want to go to school so they didnâ€™t make me and now i donâ€™t have an education. i was depressed and didnâ€™t leave my bed for years and now iâ€™m overweight, in physical pain, and consequently canâ€™t hold a job that requires me to stand for 8 hours (aka the only job i can get as someone with an 8th grade education). and now iâ€™m stuck here, in the same house with the same people, my mom will pay for my whole life out of guilt but sheâ€™s going to die one day and iâ€™ll be fucked. 

all iâ€™m good at is drinking and getting raped and being a nuisance. i have no idea how to be an adult, and neither do the other adults in my family. why did i have to be forced onto this sinking ship? i couldâ€™ve been anything but this. iâ€™m too old to be here.
