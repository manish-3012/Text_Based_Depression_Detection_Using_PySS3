I've lost all hopeLife is terrible. It's boring, its difficult, and it's pointless. The only things that make me happy, I cant have. And even then, the happiness is fleeting....but it was something. My bf and I had it in common, and it destroyed us, but also kept us afloat. I can't function without it, and I hardly function with it. I think I'm finally ready to go. I just wanted to say goodbye. Nobody will care, but I still wanted some sort of...note? 


I dont have much else to say. I'm finally going to be at peace. I can finally exist as I should.
