It felt wonderfulIt felt so wonderful. I lost control of my limbs and fell down onto my bed on the pillows I had lined up. It's so wonderful to give up all control and obligations, in a matter of seconds. My body kept tingling even a while after my brain started to get its blood back. I felt every pulse. Every painful pulse of this fucking life. I'm training myself for the moment. One beautiful day I'll make it, I'll die. I'll try to tie a little bit harder every time. Guess I posted here to get some motivation to stay alive. Thanks for reading.
