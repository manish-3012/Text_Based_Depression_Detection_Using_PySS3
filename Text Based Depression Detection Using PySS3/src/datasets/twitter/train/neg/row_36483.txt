Today I feel aloneToday I feel alone and I feel pain. I donâ€™t want to move off this couch. I donâ€™t want to text back my friend or boyfriend. I donâ€™t want to watch this show anymore, but I donâ€™t want to grab the remote. I donâ€™t want to go into the kitchen to put away the food I left you because thereâ€™s a knife lying there and Iâ€™m afraid that if I pick it up I wonâ€™t put it down. I have mono. I canâ€™t go see my friends on my Rowing team. I canâ€™t tell classmates or they wonâ€™t want to be around me. I canâ€™t kiss my boyfriend. I have no other friends in college. I am alone. I feel drained physically and mentally. All I crave is some physical love. One that isnâ€™t afraid to touch me for fear of getting sick. Iâ€™m not death. Iâ€™m not broken and I donâ€™t need to be fixed. I have to give my friends and boyfriend space, but days where I try to I feel like thatâ€™s when I need them the most. I want someone to talk to who will understand. Who knows what it feels like to have a hand and their throat. Or to be held down and feel the claustrophobic weight. To know how to describe the way an ice cube melting in a cup looks exactly. Where sitting in a certain position makes you feel like a slut. Or feeling that dizzy confusion you felt that night. Hating the feeling of stubble on a chin because it reminds you of how it felt scraping against your face. Feeling like itâ€™s my fault knowing itâ€™s my fault. Maybe I shouldnâ€™t have walked down that hallway alone and he wouldâ€™ve never been able to pin me against that wall. Maybe if I wouldâ€™ve told him in his truck that I wanted to go home. Maybe if I wouldâ€™ve told him I didnâ€™t feel comfortable. Or keeping his secret for 9 years only for him to die. Itâ€™s him. Itâ€™s all of him that fires this to me. That makes my veins crave the knife on the counter that Iâ€™ve been using to cut up salmon that I need to put away but I canâ€™t. Why am I the way that I am? Why did he take what little I had? Why canâ€™t anybody save me? Why canâ€™t I save myself? Iâ€™m not strong. Iâ€™m not great. Iâ€™m not fearless. Iâ€™m so afraid and so alone and nothing has or will help. I receive so love but I donâ€™t feel okay. Maybe Iâ€™m selfish, but today I feel alone.
