I thought I figured out my shitGot bad grades consistently , talked with a few people and now I'm back to square one , studied as much as I could still got a bad total , I couldn't finish chemistry but thought I'd make up for it through zoology , turns out I totally forgot about a chapter so I still get a shitty grade despite getting good in physics and botany , I thought 'okay at least now I know how I can try to get something better that 360/700 because now I can overcome my weakness in physics (just like I did)'.                         


Went home ,                                                                                                 

initially was happy                                                                                                                

I talked to parents , they say I'm making excuses for a bad grade , that it is my fault that I got shit marks here , I mean it is my fault , while I am increasing my performance in my weak subject , I somehow forgot a chapter in another subject so my total was shit , they say I am just wasting their money and time , that if things go on like this I will become a failure , fuck it.                                                                                                    


The pressure if just too much . I thought I was happy to at least get good marks in one area , turns out they are infact right , I am good for nothing , I can't get a 550/700, I am wasting time and money .                       


Today I had an extreme urge to kill myself , I am not supposed to be sad today. , I am supposed to be happy that another exam is over , that I can  take this one day Off till shit hits the fan again and the madness continues ......                                                                                                      


I just wasted 3 hours crying and thinking about my life and reflecting on myself , time in which I was supposed to be studying .                                     


It fucking hurts I am indeed wasting time and money                                                              

Why the fuck am I even posting here ? The only solution to my problem is getting good grades ...... To do that I need to study and to study I need to stop feeling like a piece of shit
