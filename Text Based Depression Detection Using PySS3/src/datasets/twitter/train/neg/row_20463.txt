LostI have never had so much stress in my life. Everything just seems to be crashing down on me. I feel the weight of 10 men on my chest. I donâ€™t know what to do. I know I have to trust god, but that doesnâ€™t take the feelings away. I just failed the mess out of ECE and Iâ€™m scared to do the same for statistics. I studied so much only to get nowhere. Everything is just piling up. I need a job so bad and Iâ€™m scared that I wonâ€™t find one. How will I afford school? My sister is going through a really tough time. She might have cancer. High probability that she wonâ€™t be able to have kids. Living in pain for the rest of her life â€“ oh and her best friend is being stupid too. Crashing and burning. This school year itself just a big ball of stress and I donâ€™t feel like I am understand what my friends are. I canâ€™t focus. My mind just races everywhere. Everything just seems..different. Something that I canâ€™t explain I donâ€™t know whats going on, I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s what anymore. The person closest to me is no longer there and I have no one that I trust. Friends are there for me, but I am scared to trust anyone but God. Who will turn on me next? Nobody understands. They try but they donâ€™t. Whatâ€™s next in life. What does god want. Everyday I wake up with more questions. I have learned to trust God through them but I get no answers. It all seems hopeless.
