About a year ago, I commited Suicide. Here's my experience.Idk if I can post this. Please remove and tell me which subreddit to post to.

Aug 21, 2019 I jumped from 5th floor. Very Crtitical for 3 days. But, after 3 months of extensive treatment and post health care, I am now doing fine.

There were many reasons why I did that, But almost All of them involved something , some WORST POSSIBLE OUTCOME to not happen. Literally every second, every day of my life prior to that, I lived in Fear. Every second. Nope, didn't want to live like that.

My hospitalization was not smooth. Critical case, eh? You know all poop stuff. wow. Not Cool. But here's something that I experienced for that first time in my life. "Facing your Fear."

There is something about "Facing your absolute fucking God Awful Fear". I mean we don't just feel fear for fun right? There is always a reason, a Very Worst Possible Outcome. Am I saying the worst outcome will not happen and everything just magic into good if You face you Fears?  **NO**. But, Whatever the fucking outcome is, ONCE THE WHOLE THING IS DONE. GOOD OR BAD OR NEAUTRAL. *The amount of relief, or weight being lifted of you. or You finally able to Breathe Properly for the first time and..wiredly, an iirresistable small smile that your face makes? **HolyFuckingShit**. ***That is worth Living the Life for***.

I don't regret my decision. I don't beat myself for what I did. It wasn't my fault. People say suicide is "coward way out" Idk about this, I have never did anything in my life of  *that sorts of courage*, idk if its right word. My only tiny regret is if I used this amount of courage to actually my fears, atleast ONE, maybe I would have thought different.

One at a time. I don't give a flying fuck if you take Two Full years just to form a habit of 'waking up early'. You did it. You are already making progress. I don't care if the progress is Slow. As long as you are trying, even a little bit, That's Good. You can sleep with content. Just give shit time, ALOT of time if it demands. 

Sorry for this mess of a writing, english is not my first language.

Just, i just want to say, this sounds CLICHE AS FUCK but, man, there actually is really nice side of life, too. It was worth living for.
