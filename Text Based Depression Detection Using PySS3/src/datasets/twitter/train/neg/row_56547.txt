I was banned from /r/Anarchism. The reason I don't kill myself is because I hope to help Anarchism.Two days ago, I was banned from /r/Anarchism due to a comment from 5 months ago: 

Title: Ban happysmash27 for fascist apologia, advocacy for CP

&gt;&gt;I think that peadophiles are fine, just not child abusers. I even think that the distribution of child pornography is fine, provided that no more is produced and that the producers get no money or any other benefits from it. Arguments saying that people can chose to not be pedophiles just sound too much like old arguments against gay people to meâ€¦
&gt;
&gt;&gt;I also think that our extreme rivals (e.g. fascists) should have free speech, although to be honest there isn't much reason for them to be on somewhere like Raddle, so I don't mind the rules against them there too much.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;I also think that our minor rivals (e.g. ancaps (of the anarcho-"capitalism" veriety) and slightly more authoritarean communists) have pretty decent ideas which may or may not work, and shouldn't be mocked so much. A more libertarian capitalism, especially without property taxes (since they stop one from producing things from raw resources without requiring money) could probably make it easier to make anarcho-communism, after all.
&gt;
&gt;Essentially liberal "fascists should have free speech" and terrible "we should distribute child pornography", as well as problematic comparisons of pedophiles to gay people

My most recent response comment:

&gt;What do I need to change in order to get support for me being unbanned? My opinions have changed since my original comment, and since I was banned too, since I am trying to change them ASAP so I don't go insane from social isolation. I was already taken out of school due to mentioning suicide, and am in the nurses office right nowâ€¦ Being 100% honest, I still feel slightly uncomfortable banning free speech of fascists (although it's almost certainly a good idea) as well as in banning CP. The reason for this is that I'm worried that pedophiles may not have an outlet, and may abuse children *more* rather than less. Plus, saying that CP enables pedophiles sounds like the argument that violent video games cause violence to me. Does anyone have anything to refute this? I guess one could say that it is a good idea just in case it really does more good than harm, but I have a really hard time criticizing something someone does in their own home, at least to the extent of imprisoning them for years. Please note that I am only talking about animated/simulated CP or the distribution of existing CP where those exploited in it have later consented after the age of consent, and not the production of new non-simulated CP, which most certainly is evil. I was never trying to say otherwise about *that*. 
&gt;
&gt;I will roughly copy and paste this comment to a few places in this thread. Please pardon the spam! And please, someone respond, I am very lonely and was even extremely lonely before I was banned for my lone 5-month-old highly controversial commentâ€¦ I mean yes, I may have said some of what is in the comment before, but I don't believe I ever have on Reddit in anywhere other than this thread. Please have mercy on me, and please, correct everything wrong with what I currently believe. The only reason I live is to help Anarchism, and I'll be much worse at that if I can't participate in the subreddit. 

This was the top-level version of a response I made to many users. This is a response I got for one of the non-top-level ones:

&gt;Oh my fucking God stop. Right now. Your opinions have not changed because you are still here spamming about how we should think about the pedophiles. You throwing around suicidal tendencies and being on the spectrum in order to guilt trip us into letting you not be banned is abusive.
&gt;
&gt;/u/faolinbean, /u/Voltairinede, /u/MsLoveShacker, can we ban this dude from meta. He has been harassing me and other members via pm as well as in their comments here. 

These are the responses I got on Raddle when I posted about this, asking for help changing my opinion:

People are saying I should do my own research on this, but I can't actually find anything which is against pedophiles themselves or child porn (of the type I described earlier), only things against actual child abuse. Even when I look on Wikipedia, I only find evidence against persecuting non-abusive pedophiles: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedophilia?wprov=sfla1. 

I have no idea what to do, and don't know who else to contact. I have gone through so many threads asking for help with this, that most of this post is copy/pasted (which is why it may not flow super well). I was going to post this in /r/needadvice, but according to the rules anything related to suicide should go here instead. Can someone please, please help me?
