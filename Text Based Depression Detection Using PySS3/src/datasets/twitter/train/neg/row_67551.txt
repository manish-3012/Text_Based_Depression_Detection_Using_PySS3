Anyone think they wonâ€™t make it past 30?Iâ€™m already 23 and feel like a mom of three kids. Life only gets more challenging. Itâ€™s burn out and the emotional drain from childhood to actual adult life. The solution to those problems stop coming. Prayers are getting unanswered. At some point, its tiresome not being able to be happy for one minute of your life. 

Everytime I want life to get better someone or something has to remind me itâ€™s the opposite. The dreams you have start getting less believable as you grow older. Itâ€™s an endless loop  of broken promises.
