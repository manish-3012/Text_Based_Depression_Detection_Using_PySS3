set up for failureI don't understand the point of living for someone like me. Don't compare me to Einstein or some poor foreign kid. I don't have the motivation to live like them. I'm stupid, have depression, social anxiety, and physically unattractive. I've spent 12 years studying so hard but with nothing in return. I had to drop 2 subjects chemistry and physics and have no backup. It's 4.36am right now. Adults really need to make up their minds they say high school isn't everything then they say it's the best yrs or your life and a better atar will make your life easier. I didn't past any of my half yearlies and other tests. I'm talking lowest rank and 36% as my average in all subjects. I can't focus, I'm mentally sick and only have my HSC left. I don't think I can study anymore after high school, I don't handle failure and stress well. Who would even hire me for a job, I'm a scrawny female.
My parents both admitted to me being a burden. My siblings call me moody and pessimistic. I won't get out of this phase, its been with me for my whole life. Pls don't tell me about your golden story of breaking out of your shell. I feel like vomitting and start crying and shaking near ppl. 
At this point, I'm not waiting for an opportunity like a tall building, train or deep water. The physical pain of cutting myself will only last a moment then I can stop existing forever. Nothing's holding me back, I do feel bad about wasting all my family's time and money on me.  I hate living, it's not a gift for me. I'm not waiting for death by old age to come, I want to check out now before it gets worse
