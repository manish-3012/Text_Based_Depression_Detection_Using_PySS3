How do I just work up the courage.I just wanna let go, I just wanna be able to let go and not worry about anything anymore, what other people think of me, this never ending feeling of loneliness, the feeling that no one understands these jumbled thoughts. I just want it to all be over, but I keep chickening out hoping that maybe if I just give it another alway that something, anything will give me a reason to keep going forward but there never is one. No one cares enough to even talk to me without me initiating the conversation anymore, itâ€™s my fault, all of it is, Iâ€™m not worth their attention anymore, Im a waste, not worth talking to. Maybe Iâ€™ll get to see my grandfather again, probably not. I just need it to be done. I just canâ€™t.
