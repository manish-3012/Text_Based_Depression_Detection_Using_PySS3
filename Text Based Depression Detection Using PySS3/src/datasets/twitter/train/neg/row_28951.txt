Iâ€™m ready to die but afraid of deathI just want to die I canâ€™t take the pain anymore but Iâ€™m afraid of death. Iâ€™m slowly but surely at the point where I donâ€™t have any faith in god because thereâ€™s no way I could be in this much pain and not be spared even a little bit. Iâ€™m not afraid of a heaven/hell afterlife Iâ€™m afraid there is no afterlife and there is nothing but nothingness and loneliness. That terrifies me but so does living life. Iâ€™m at a point where I just feel like going crazy. I just know I canâ€™t do it anymore. Itâ€™s a matter of days though when Iâ€™ll stop caring and just  go for it anyway.
