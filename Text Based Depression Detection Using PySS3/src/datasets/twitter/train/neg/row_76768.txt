I'm awful, why shouldn't I?I am not fully comfortable yet with saying why I'm awful on here, but I will one day. If you have seen me before, there is a reason I haven't commit suicide yet, but it is one that contributes to me being awful, and I'm not ready to share that reason. I'm not an axe murderer or anything, but not only am I worthless, I'm awful. This is vague and I'm sorry, I just can't fully explain, not yet. I can easily rat off a long list of people who would be happy I was gone, and all for good reasons, so I can't blame them. I have wronged them, why not do something nice for them for once?
