White-knuckling.I'm on a waiting list to see a therapist now, but it's a very long list. I'm in a rural area, so there aren't many (read: any) other options than to go through this organization. 

I've been in patient hospitalized three times before. I'm considering going back but it'd be hard on my job. I'm the only one in my department besides my boss. He's in charge of two other, way more important departments. No one else could pick up my work in the short term. I also don't want them to know about my mental health issues - I feel like I'd been seen as unreliable, more so than I already am. 

Also no one could care for my cats. One is getting older. I fear when he passes because that will be one less thing holding me back. 

I have a chronic pain disorder that is almost unmanageable. It has hindered my life in so many ways. 

My mom killed herself five years ago this month. That's been on my mind. I've been living in the past for about 7-8 years. 

I really have more passive suicidal ideation than an active desire, but I'm worried that will all change in a moment. 

I resent the obstacles in my way. I don't know how much longer I can white knuckle my way through. 

I've been depressed for 15 years. I've been actively working on it for 10. It always comes back to this. I'm exhausted from managing and barely achieving the minimum level of self care. 

Something has to give. I can't do this for much longer.
