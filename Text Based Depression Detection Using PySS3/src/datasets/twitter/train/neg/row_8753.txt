I'm a burdenAll I do is hurt the people around me. The ones that know I'm not okay mainly. They don't know everything. They don't know that I write suicide notes in my head at night when I'm crying and I can't sleep. I don't want to die but I don't know how to live. Tonight they told me that my depression hurts them too much for them to be around me anymore. I'm alone like always, but more alone now than ever. Why is it that when my head is the clearest everyone else is sleeping? Why don't they want me? Why does nobody want me? I don't want to die, but I am tired of hurting.
