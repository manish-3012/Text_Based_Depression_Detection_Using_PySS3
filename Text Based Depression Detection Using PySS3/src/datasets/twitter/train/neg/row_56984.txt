I am ready to die.My life has plummeted the past few months. It feels like the world is telling me to die already. Everything has become a disaster. Every time I feel like it's the lowest point of my life, it just seems to get lower. I've tried countless times to bounce back, but every time I just fall in deeper into this abyss of unfortunate events. It has lead me to believe that this world doesn't want me anymore and it is my time. I remember how people say "everyone is destined for something" or "each individual has a purpose"... maybe it's my purpose to die early. Who knows. I have been clinging on to life for so long. I have been fighting for so long. All alone in this world. And I finally feel like it is time. Every single effort I have put in for myself to keep on living and to keep on pushing in life has been returned with a "fuck you" to the face. I am at my limit now. I no longer have nothing left. Literally nothing. I think it's my time to say goodbye.
