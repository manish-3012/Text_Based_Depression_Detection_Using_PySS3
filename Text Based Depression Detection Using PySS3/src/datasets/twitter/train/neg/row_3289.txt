I'm doneMy parents aren't at home, and I think this is a great opportunity to do it. I'm tired. I'm tired of hearing voices in my head. I've always had these thoughts. My mom hates me, and I think that she never wanted me. I just know she wants me dead. Everyone hates me, and I'm just a clown to everyone. Maybe in another world, I will be happy. My thoughts won, and everyone won. If this is what they wanted then I will do it.
