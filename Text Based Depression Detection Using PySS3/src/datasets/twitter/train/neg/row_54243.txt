Are you disappointed with how your life ended up? Me too, come get it off your chestAll I wanted, when I was thinking of adulthood when I was younger, was a stable job that I didn't hate.  I did everything right.  I went to a good school and got a good degree.  

I have worked in very rough workplaces and I have struggled with employment for 2 years.  I am losing confidence in myself and I am starting to think I might not be high functioning enough to maintain even a meager lifestyle.

Thanks for hearing me 

I am ready to hear you

This isn't a competition &lt;3
