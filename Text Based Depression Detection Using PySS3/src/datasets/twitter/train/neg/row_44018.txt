Just waiting for the right timeI think it's time
All I need is to wait for my family to go away for a few days like they do ocassionally. Could be whenever. 
I just... Really cant do this anymore. 
It's too much to put into satisfying words. 
I just want to die and be reborn as something other than a pathetic untalented disappointment. 
See ya on the other side, guys!
