I want to die but somethingâ€™s is holding meIâ€™ve taking depression medication for 2 going on 3 years now and although it help with the chemical side of things, the sadness is still on my thoughts.
I just want to go off my meds so i become sad enough to kill myself with a purpose.
If i do it now, iâ€™d be dying yeah but i feel like iâ€™m not *sad* enough to do it, so by stopping my medication iâ€™ll be getting worse and then iâ€™ll have a big enough of a motivation.
It is too much and itâ€™s not worth the fight.
