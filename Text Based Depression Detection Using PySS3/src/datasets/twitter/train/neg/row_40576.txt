Is there any reason not to self harm?I don't see an issue. I'm four months clean of self harm now. I don't see the point of keeping it up. I have no friends. I'm careful, I won't bleed out or get infected. No one notices. And I like it. I've already been put in a mental hospital so they won't put me in again because now it's a "pre-existing condition". There's no point. I can't keep doing this. Something happened today that really hurt me and the only thing I can do to make it better is cut myself. Is there any logical reason not to self harm?
