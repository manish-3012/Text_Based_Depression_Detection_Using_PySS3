Please let it happen...I finally have more than enough meds to kill me, I think. It's a good couple handfuls of benzos and all the SSRIs I had left. Cost quite a bit but I think this might be it.

I truly hope this is the last moment I spend as this abhorrent, disgusting, unlovable, perennially lonely creature. If this doesn't work then I really seriously have to look at more effective methods. Please let this be it. Please.
