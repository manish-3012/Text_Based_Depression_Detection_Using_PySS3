If coronavirus stays, I'm goingI'm sick of this, just when everything was looking up coronavirus hits and everything comes crashing down. Now seeing all the nihilism and all hopes dashed makes me feel like what's the fucking point. I'm overweight and I'm probably going to die if I get it anyway, so if it sticks around who fucking cares if I die, I'll probably die anyway from it.

Since all I'm hearing about is the possibility of vaccines not working and shit like that, if in 2 years this is still here, I'm out.

I can't live like this anymore. I'm sick of the fucking hopelessness of looking at the corona subreddit, I'm sick of the fucking idiots outside not wearing masks not taking it seriously.

I'm done with it, I can't live like this anymore, it's not living. How the fuck do I get healthy enough to survive if I can't go outside because I might die anyway.

Fucking bullshit
