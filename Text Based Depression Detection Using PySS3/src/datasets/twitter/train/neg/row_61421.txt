Good news in all this BSI know that no one probably gives a shit. That's cool, I dont expect anyone to. This is more for me. I've been doing my best to help everyone on this subreddit, especially since my post, when this subreddit literally saved my life. Well, despite how many people hate quarantine, I love it. (Mostly). I hat when my sister is annoying, and mom whines, but otherwise, I'm good. I'm introverted so less interaction, and little schedule is awesome. I've also been working out and building muscle. So me, and my introverted friends and comrades, are doing good. Yeehaw!
