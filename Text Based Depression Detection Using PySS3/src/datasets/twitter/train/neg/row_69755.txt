I can't help myself (sorry for this vent, it makes no sense but I'm just ruminating)I can't help myself, because I can't convince myself I want to get better.
Just, always hopeless.
Nothing's going to get better, living will never be for me, you know? Most people enjoy it, but something was just wired wrong at birth + didn't develop properly and now, it's just like this. Fixed, inflexible, maladaptive way I perceive/react to the world.

Personality disorders have a pretty bad prognosis; avoidant personality disorder, at least. Tends to be there for life, is what I've read. Asked a psychiatrist about PDs in passing and he said it's actually relatively treatable and over half get better w treatment or something along those lines (though he was talking more about BPD) which was nice to hear I guess but. Ha, really doesn't help hearing the way the offhanded way some psychiatrists/nurses talk about some of their patients with PD behind their backs. Not to mention in multiple lectures we've had they've all been pretty pessimistic about it. Just sat there, kept my mouth shut thinking well yeah I guess I knew I was fucked.

What even is this. I hate it. I can't kill myself. I keep telling myself to. Logical thing to do. End it, end it. Can't do it. Humans don't die that easy, with overdoses especially I think. I'm too neurotic to actually formulate a plan because no method is foolproof, of course. But the main issue is that I know there's a lot of 'hope', technically, it's not 'all that bad, could be a lot worse, could still enjoy shit. I can't talk myself into it, when it comes down to it. But I can't talk myself into trying to feel better either. Every moment I'm not dead, I want to be. Me, a coward, just shirks away from the idea when I'm on the brink of really doing something.
