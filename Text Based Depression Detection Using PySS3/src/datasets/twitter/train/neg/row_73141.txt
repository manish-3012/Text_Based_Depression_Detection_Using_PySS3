Ive never had a relationship in my life and I only have one person id call a real friend.Im so bad at talking to others and every interaction makes me feel horrible. I feel like even adults around me at my school hate me and dont accept me for how I act socially. I want to die to escape the life around me I cant deal with it anymore. I feel like everyone is kicking me while im down. I want to stab myself right now.
