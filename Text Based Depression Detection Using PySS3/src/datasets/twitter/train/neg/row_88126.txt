30 days on, no change.I posted here a little over a month ago, asking how I could go on. Somehow 30 days has passed and I feel just the same, perhaps even a bit worse. 

I am living in a now freezing and illegal van. I lost my job due to my depression and anxiety and have little to no income for the essentials. Together with my partner we have approached the local council, the county council, the local MP, the housing department and so many others I've lost count. All for nothing. All I want is somewhere safe and warm to live without being constantly made to feel like the scum at the bottom of a barrel that no one wants to deal with. Somewhere I might be able to heal, to feel a bit better about my worthless self and this pathetic excuse for a life that I have.

My feelings and thoughts about suicide haven't changed, it's a comforting thought, one of a few. I think about having the ultimate control over the way I feel. I know that if it carries on hurting like this, I can take away all the pain, forever. 

I have visited a mental health professional, who promised I would be receiving care by now, and still nothing. I feel so abandoned, so utterly despondent and above all I just feel empty. I'm not a person worth helping, just another number trying to sponge from the system. At the moment, I have nothing except what's in the van, there's no heating and no food. 

Because of how awful I've been feeling I've put off talking to friends and family. I don't want anyone to know just how bad the situation is, and just how much of a failure I am. Thanks for reading, if you did.
