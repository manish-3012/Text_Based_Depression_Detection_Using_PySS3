Depression, Suicide, LifeIâ€™ve been depressed for years and itâ€™s steadily getting worse. Iâ€™m not sure if the meds work, but Iâ€™m still taking them. I always feel a sense of isolation, loneliness and a sense that no one cares. So called friends that rarely reach out and the friendships just seem completely one sided. I almost got committed last week and Iâ€™m glad I didnâ€™t. I feel as though I have no purpose, there really is no reason for me to be here. I often have suicidal ideation, but I feel like I canâ€™t kill myself because of what itâ€™ll do to my parents. I really hope things get better for me, but I seriously doubt it.
