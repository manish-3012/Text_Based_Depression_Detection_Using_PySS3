I'm so exhaustedI'm so tired of life. Every day is getting more and more of a struggle. I'm feel so alone and have no one to talk to and certainly no one that will ever love me because I'm ugly and a mess. I have no goals in life. I've lost interest in everything. Everything feels so draining. I thought going to college would give me a goal, but it just feels pointless. Please just let me sleep forever.
