HelloI'm a 20F, but i've already tried to kill myself before when i was 15. Even 2 days ago i tried to drown myself, while taking a bath. I don't know what to do, it doesn't hurt anymore i just feel this numbness. My close friends have isolated me for unrelated reasons, but now i have no one i can talk to. I always think i'm not that bad, so much to call a hotline or something, because in my mind i won't ever do it. But i keep trying, and backing out at the last second. The worst part for me is i have no proper reason, i'm considered attractive, i'm not failing my uni work and i have friends i go clubbing with, just not close ones. theres nothing seriously wrong with my life. 

Theres nothing wrong with my life, why do i always feel alone and that i want it to end?
