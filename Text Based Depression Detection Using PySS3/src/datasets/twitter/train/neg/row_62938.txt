I just want to be done (not urgent)Iâ€™m not sure what Iâ€™m doing posting this. Iâ€™m only vaguely suicidal but after so many attempts I feel...different...about this.

I havenâ€™t done anything yet, and honestly Iâ€™m waiting until the hospital is more safe. I donâ€™t want to be saved only to end up with covid-19 and on a ventilator or something with people wasting their time trying to save me when I donâ€™t want to be saved.

I donâ€™t even have a complete plan yet. Itâ€™s starting to form but itâ€™s still out of focus, hazy like my mind. Iâ€™m considering using multiple methods all at once, to make it less likely that I will survive. I have it narrowed down to my top three but I donâ€™t have a date or location. Canâ€™t do it at home because I live with my mom who works from home. I donâ€™t want her to be the one to find me.

I guess I just wanted to tell someone who canâ€™t lock me up in a psychiatric facility. 

Maybe I should talk about why?

Been struggling with mental illness since age 12/13. Some doctors claim that I am schizoaffective, others say that I am bipolar, and still others have written me off as BPD. So many words to say Iâ€™ve been primarily depressed for about 18 years, have experienced delusions, and used to have a desperate fear of abandonment. One thing everyone agrees on is that I have severe anxiety to the point of being on disability. Thatâ€™s why I live with my mom at age 30. I canâ€™t work or hardly even go out without a person with me.
I also have an eating disorder that has come and gone for around 15 years now. I use substances to get out of my head, mostly over the counter stuff, and drink when I can afford to. Used to be extremely promiscuous and feel disgusting about my past. I was molested and raped as a child by a neighbor, and sexually assaulted by a friend in college. 

I just found out that I have polyps and a uterine fibroid. I need surgery. I hope that I am dead before then or that there will be anesthesia complications and I will die during surgery. Iâ€™ve been bleeding since middle of March and it just wonâ€™t stop. Iâ€™m anemic and Iâ€™m tired and cold and weak. I just...Iâ€™m a fucking mess.

Iâ€™m ready to give up, I just need to make sure it will work.
