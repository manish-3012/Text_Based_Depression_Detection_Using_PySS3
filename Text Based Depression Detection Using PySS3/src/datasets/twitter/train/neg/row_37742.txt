My boyfriend is on the edge (sorry this is written while i was manic)Me and my boyfriend have had a rocky relationship for years. We've broken up and got back together 3 times now (over the span of 5-6 years). In January of this year we got back together, because he told me that everything had changed (it had been 2 years since i had seen him, so i believed him). Everything seemed great in the beginning, but one day he opened up to me about his thoughts of hurting others and himself. I'd never heard him talk like this before, and it does scare me.

Leaving him isn't an option, because i don't want to push him over the edge. I suffer with my own mental illnesses and dealing with him is becoming very hard. I couldn't live with myself if he killed himself, the pain would be too great to deal with. I need help or advice. He mentions wanting to get help and trying medications, but then his negative side takes over. Please can someone be 100% real with me and honest? I need to know what to do. I can't just allow him to kill himself, i can't.
