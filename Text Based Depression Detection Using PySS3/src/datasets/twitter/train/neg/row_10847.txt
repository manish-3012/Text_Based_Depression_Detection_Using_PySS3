I'm so sick of living for other people's sakeNot even going to bother using a throwaway, I just don't care.

I have **zero** motivation to keep on living. I don't enjoy anything. I used to play video games, but they aren't fun anymore, I used to watch TV shows and films, but they don't interest me anymore. All I do now, is sleep, because I have nothing better to do, and then go to work, because I have to.

The only reason I haven't topped myself, is because my dad told me that he'd kill himself if anything ever happened to me, so I can't die knowing his death is on me.
