This MaskFor the past year or so I've been feeling like a piece of shit. Whenever I think I'm up and my life is going well, something bad happens and it goes to shit and all my confidence and happiness is destroyed. I feel like God is playing tricks on me, that he hates my guts for reasons I don't know. It's gotten to the point where I can predict when something bad is going to happen, and even then I can't prepare for it well. The life I want to live is so far away. I have stuff that people would kill for in their lives, yet it's not enough to fill the void I have. There's just one thing I don't have and can't seem to get no matter how hard I try. Everybody thinks I'm so fucking happy, and that my life is perfect and that I have nothing to complain about. But in reality, everything is shit and I fucking hate myself. I have all these demons and nobody knows about them. I don't even know who to go to, as I feel like my problems will seem petty to a lot of people and they would just tell me to brush it off. But I can't. I'm tired of wearing this fucking mask, and I just don't understand why my life has to be like this. I almost want to just kill myself so people would actually realize how much they'd miss me.
