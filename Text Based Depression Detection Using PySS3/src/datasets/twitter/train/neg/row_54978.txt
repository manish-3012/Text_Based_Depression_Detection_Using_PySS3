I've tried to be so strong for so longI don't know how long I can still be so strong any more. All of my lifeline people are vanish from my life, my sister recently took her own life (I thought I would be the first of my siblings to be buried) , I think my girlfriend hates me and I don't think I have one anymore, my lifeline friends have all abandoned me over the past few years. I don't feel like I can go to my parents as I just don't trust them.

I don't feel like I'm likely to take myself soon, but I've always seen it as inevitable and it feels really bleak now.
