No point going on if you're forever aloneI'm just haunted by times when life was bearable before family died when I was young. It's a given that life gets worse as you age if you're forever alone. I've become more isolated from old friends as they've progressed and formed families of their own. 

I'm now a trolley pushing forever alone 31 year old that constantly thinks of suicide and has no hope for the future. I've become bitter and hateful about my circumstances, and I'd rather put myself out of my misery then go on living a shitty life and despising myself for it. I pray I get the courage to end it soon.
