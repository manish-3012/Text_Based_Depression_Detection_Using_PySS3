My mom is in the hospital for attempted suicide what do I do?I got a call from her friend at 2am using my moms phone telling me the news She was drunk and cutting her rist her friend stoped her and pined her down till the ambulance arrived I dont know how bad her cuts were other then her friend im the only one that knows

We dont have the best relationship mostly due to her drinking (I have ptsd from it bad) I know its a lie but I feel at fault because she was finally trying to get better and I was still bitter towards her and ignoring her knowing she was going threw this mostly because I acting like that to her I feel like If I supported her more this wouldn't of happen 

I dont want to lose my mom I just want her to get better im about to go to the hospital to see her I just don't know what to say to when im there what to do or if she even wants me there

Im too young for this shit
