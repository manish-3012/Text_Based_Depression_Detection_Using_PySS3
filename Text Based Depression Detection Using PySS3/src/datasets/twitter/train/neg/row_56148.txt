Being bullied and this week has been the worst week of my life.I have been bullied for years at work about my disability. But this week has been the worst. The two men I work with have given me hell. One guy is because I won't fuck him. The other is just an idiot that doesn't understand, so whatever he doesn't understand he attacks and mocks. 

I feel so bad. 

I just can't take crap anymore. 

"Stand up for yourself." 

I've tried. Nothing phases them at all. 

"Oh, they don't do that. You are just being silly. They are nice guys." 

Do you seriously think for one fucking moment that they would mock and abuse a co worker in front of you, with you being the boss? Are you that fucking stupid? 

"You should take legal action." 

Who cares. I'm better off dead.
