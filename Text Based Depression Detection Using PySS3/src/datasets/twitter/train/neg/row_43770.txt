The 15 minutes a difference can makeMy friend is bipolar crazy fuck but he is my crazy bipolar fiend.
We didn't hear from him in a while and we where joking we would see him come spring time.
Fast forward today.. I went bye work he wasn't there he wasn't at home. We got the spair key  and we where 15 minutes on time a little later I would have lost a friend.
Take care guy's
