I'm gonna be dead in a week and a half.I can't pay for college and even if I could they wouldn't let me back after failing classes so many times. I basically stole my laptop from them today so I'm a criminal too. If I'm not at college I can't get medicine, if I can't get medicine I might as well be dead, because I am not going back to being a guy.

In the meantime I'm just pretending like everything is fine. Pretending to my family, to my roommate, who's gonna have to deal with me being dead in the apartment, and pretending to my best friend in the whole world who deserves better than a failure like me. 

It's really fucking weird, talking to people you know, acting normally when you know you're gonna be dead in a matter of days. You can't really say anything to them, even if you want to, because they might notice something's up. So until that day, I'll just keep pretending. I'll go out to eat with people. I'll spend Christmas with my family. Act like someone who isn't a colossal fuckup. But then it will all finally end.
