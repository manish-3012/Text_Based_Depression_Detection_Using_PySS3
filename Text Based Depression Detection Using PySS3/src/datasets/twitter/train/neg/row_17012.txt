I think I'm going to die by suicide.I don't know when, and I don't know how. But I think I'm going to die one day by killing myself. I have a lot of goals, I'm ok successful, I do well in school. 

I don't know why. I'm just lonely. I like spending time with friends, and I like being successful. I know I'll be successful in the future: I'll be in a good, high-paying job, and it'll appear that I'm the furthest away from poverty as possible. I have hobbies I like. But I'm just sad. I've been sad for a long time. 

I'm a teenager. A third of my life, I've been sad. It goes away sometimes, and I forget about it. But it always comes back. I can be successful. I can accomplish all of my goals. I can do everything that I thought would make me happy, And I will still be sad. 

I just want to leave the punishment of life as soon as possible. Just sleep forever. I can understand Hindu and Buddhist philosophy: to leave this world, the suffering of life. 

Don't say that I will be happy one day. Happiness is fleeting. Being content breeds unhappiness for me. I'm ambitious. My goals are what keeps me alive. Don't say that I should be less ambitious. If I tried to be less ambitious, my unhappiness will take overâ€”striving for something is what gives me joy in my life. I can accomplish my goals perfectly well even though there's this lingering sadness in my head. 

Please don't try to change my viewpoint; don't try to make me let go of my goals. I've had therapists try to do that. I'm a stubborn person, and I'm a lonely person. When people try to make me achieve less than I desire to be, I become more lonely, and I want to die more. 

Has anyone ever felt like this? Does the sadness ever go away? Or will I continue to accomplish my goals, feeling sad during those quiet moments? I'll continue to live as long as I have goals to accomplish, but the moment I don't see a reason to live, I will die, happily. It may be 5 or 30 years in the future. But I will kill myself one day.
