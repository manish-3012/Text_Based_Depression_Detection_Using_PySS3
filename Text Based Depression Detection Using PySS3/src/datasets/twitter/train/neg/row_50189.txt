Starving Myself to Death: Day OneI suppose this is technically Day *Two*, since I didn't eat yesterday either, but I couldn't make to a library terminal to write about that in time, so today gets written up as if it were Day One.  

Anyway, [you don't like me](http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/19enna/a_week_from_tomorrow_i_will_most_likely_be/) -- and I mean [you REALLY don't like me](http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1a7xi1/after_the_vacation_im_dead_broke_even_sooner_than/) -- so I'm not even going to bother trying to be likable.

So [like I said last week](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1a8zgh/update_leaving_on_vacation_tomorrow_coming_back/), I'm dead broke, can't afford my, well, *anything*, and rather than be a leech I'm just going to crawl off under a bridge and die.  Over the weekend I sold everything I had that anyone would consider worth buying, and threw away the rest.  That left me with the princely sum of $839.48 to my name, which was enough for one last student loan payment (plus a little extra, to keep working on that principle).  I sent that payment off today and had a ~~satisfying~~ **tortuous and shameful** cry over my failure to do anything useful with my life, and how the world is actually worse off for me ever having lived (if for no other reason than I will die with my student loans in default).  I mailed my keys to my landlord, left my apartment *spotless*, shredded my credit cards, and smashed my phone.  I have the clothes on my back, my library card, a backpack with two interview suits (because I'm an idiot and have hope), and just under three weeks before I finally, mercifully die.

I'll keep you posted.
