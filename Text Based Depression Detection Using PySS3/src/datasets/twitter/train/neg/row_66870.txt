I don't wanna live like thisI'm a pointless piece of shit
my life isn't worth anything. I deserve to suffer. everyone hates me. I'm a disappointment to everyone I know. I want to split my throat so bad. I want to stop breathing. I'm so jealous when I see others fucking happy. I want to feel something I want to feel alive
