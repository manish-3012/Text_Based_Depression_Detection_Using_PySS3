I don't have any rights, any control over my lifeI'm 13 years old and I have no control of anything. I might live in America which people call a free country but that's a joke. Because if you're not 18, you have no rights at all.

I'm a mtf transgender girl. And I'll never be able to act on it until I'm 18. And sadly, I'll never see 18. My parents force me to get monthly haircuts. They push Christianity on me and say that my thoughts are from the Devil.

I asked them if they would rather have a dead son or a living daughter. They replied by guilting me and calling me selfish. They said that if I killed myself I would go to hell. Well, I'm going to do it.

And I know my grave will have my birth name on it. But I'm tired of living and having no freedom whatsoever. So let this message show who I really am.
