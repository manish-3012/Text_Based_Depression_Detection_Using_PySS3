There is no point to life.There is no point.  There is no grand, transcendent morality that makes life of value.  There is nothing redeeming in this existence.  There is nothing.  And I cannot take consciously take the nothingness anymore.  I want to be embraced y the void, and the only way to achieve that is to end it.  To end my life, to cease to be.

I want to die.  I need to die.  I have to die.  In life I am an invisible entity that barely affects the corporeal plane, a piece of trash in a landfill.  I am insignificant and inherently worthless.  And I'm done.  This will be my last day on earth.
