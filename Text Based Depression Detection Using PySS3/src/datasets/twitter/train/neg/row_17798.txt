I'm going to end it, I can't take the torment of psychosis and isolation anymoreI have no job and can't hold one because I hate being around people and have severe depression and anxiety, so I live off assistance. I don't have a future at all because there's nothing I'm good at and I wouldn't last a day in college. I am completely isolated and have no friends. The few that I had have all stopped talking to me, I suppose I wasn't good enough for them. I can't make any new friends because of my differences from other people. I just don't ever fit in with anyone. I feel so unlikeable.

I live with a roommate and he's completely disrespectful towards me. I'd move back to my parent's place, but I'd never be able to move back out and my parents are thinking of selling their house and moving into 55+ housing, so I couldn't come with them and I'd be left homeless.

My severe depression and chronic isolation has developed into psychosis. It's hard to describe in words what kind of feeling it is but I'm basically a prisoner of my own mind. I am damned. I wish I had a gun so I could blow my brains out. I need to die and escape this hell. Goodbye. I don't matter.
