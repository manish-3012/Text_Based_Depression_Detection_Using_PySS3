nobody gives a shit about memy only friend doesnt give a shit about me. everything in my life is fucking shit since she ghosted me (we were together before) and now she couldnt care less about me. the only thing i could do to get her to at least care about me a little bit is kill myself but i know i wont do it because everytime i try i just spit the fucking bleach back out again and then my room smells like bleach which makes me puke. i just want to be in a coma for the rest of my life.
