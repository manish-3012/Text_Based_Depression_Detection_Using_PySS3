Things don't get better. They just get.     I was going to post this on a throw away but I really don't care. 

     I started typing out everything that was making feel the way I do but it went on and on for 100s of words and that's not worth reading. Looking at all the flavours of fucked I am has just made me feel worse and affirmed my intentions.

    I can't sleep, most food makes me sick to my stomach, I don't want to draw or paint or write like I used to love. I've lost all my friends ages ago because I'm more trouble then I'm worth. The only ones that stuck around where the ones I fucked.

    The branch I'm holding on to over the edge of this cliff is my girlfriend. She loves me and cares about me. I know killing myself wouldn't be fair to her. I've thought about breaking up with her so I could just get it over with and she'll be less sad. I want to talk to her more about it but you absolutely cannot say to someone "if we broke up I would kill myself" which wouldn't be my preferred spin but ya know. 

     Every day just feels like the next, I don't feel anything much anymore except angry all of the sudden for no reason or an insidious lingering dread. 

     I'm not sure why I'm posting to here, it's silly and a plea for attention really. To mix my metaphors I'm just hoping the void I scream into will take a second to look back at me. 

     I know on here I'm not supposed to talk about methods but I keep a little will updated every few weeks and most of my affairs are in order.
