Last night I wrote a suicide note.First of all, Iâ€™m on mobile so sorry if the formatting isnâ€™t right. But I wrote a letter to one of the main professional supports I have, to say goodbye. I wanted to kill myself today, but I couldnâ€™t do it without saying thank you/goodbye first. 

She ended up sending me to the hospital. And while I didnâ€™t want to go, Iâ€™m glad I did. So many people have showed me that they care today and Iâ€™m feeling a lot better.


The letter I wrote was
 

Dear [name]

Over the last five and a half years you have done so much for me. Youâ€™ve gone above and beyond to help me, and youâ€™ve always had faith in me. Youâ€™ve fought my battles for me when I couldnâ€™t fight them myself. You were my voice when I couldnâ€™t speak up. Words cant even begin to describe how grateful i am. I just hope you can understand that this has been a 10 year long battle for me, and Iâ€™m ready for it to end. I donâ€™t belong in this world. I have a dark stormy cloud that follows me everywhere, and i just cant get rid of it. Please donâ€™t be sad, ill finally be at peace. No more demons, no more suffering. It has been wonderful working with you, and i truly do appreciate everything youâ€™ve done for me. I hope youâ€™ll continue making a difference in peoples lives. You really are one of the best.


I decided to take that letter and turn it around in to a thank you letter. 



Dear [name]

Over the last five and a half years you have done so much for me. Youâ€™ve gone above and beyond to help me, and youâ€™ve always had faith in me. Youâ€™ve fought my battles for me when I couldnâ€™t fight them myself, and you were my voice when I couldnâ€™t speak up. For so long Iâ€™ve had a dark stormy cloud following me around everywhere. I still do. And I know it makes things difficult sometimes because itâ€™s the only thing I can focus on. I canâ€™t see any of the good in my life when this cloud takes over and I donâ€™t have much control over what I say or do. But youâ€™ve always understood that itâ€™s not me, and youâ€™ve always made things okay again. You make such a huge difference in your patients lives and I know Iâ€™m not the only one who appreciates having someone like you working in the medical field. You really are one of the best. 


Iâ€™m giving it to her tomorrow. I really hope she likes it.
