Tired.I'm sick of not being good enough. I'm sick of having to justify my feelings to myself. I've dealt with this for over ten years and I'm still just hanging around.

No-one has successfully convinced me to stay (therapists have been distinctly useless for the most part), and there's no-one that wouldn't be able to cope with my being dead. Every time things get bad I just sit around like a fucking lump until I feel less shit and then start all over again, or I try to hang myself and either fail or back out. Now, what's more likely to be the problem here: other people, or me?

Where the fuck do you get the courage to end it? I'm stuck dragging myself along in limbo because I'm a coward. Fuck anyone who says suicide is the easy way out. If it was I'd have succeeded ages ago.
