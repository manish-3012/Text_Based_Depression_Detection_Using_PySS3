I Keep Messing Up and Now it is WorseI am sober for the first time in twenty years, I've lost my job, I'm hopelessly in debt, and I am not the same crazy person I used to be. In my new state I keep failing at job interviews and I suck at the jobs I have held in the past. I am trying to put together a presentation for yet another interview and it is going really badly. I know I am going to mess up and it will be awful, all of this prep will be for nothing. I got another rejection today as well. I want to end it all instead of continuing this charade. I feel awful, I've already lost everything and it is too late. I'm not looking for people to talk to, I need a way out, I want to cancel this interview that is worthless and I will fail and it will make me feel worse, and I want to stop living. I am really tired of myself and this reality.
