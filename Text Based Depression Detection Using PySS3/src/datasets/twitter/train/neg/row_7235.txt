Im so sorryDear reddit, i dont know what to do anymore.
My father has died, my family is broken, my mother has no regard for me anymore. My oldest brother has no care to even talk to me. Ive pissed off everyone i know. i have no friends because im considered the "weird girl" at school so i made none. Its summer now, im alone and by myself. I dont know who i am anymore. My dad understood, and what did i do when he was alive? we argued. i was a bitch. i could have hugged him, we could have done more. i didnt know he was going to die that night, we had gotten into an argument and i was at my friends house. i got a call that he was shot. i was still so mad and angry and upset that i was joking with my friend that i hoped he did die. and he did. im sorry. im so sorry for everything ive ever done. i cant hold down relationships, i cant hold down friendships. im just a worthless physchopath. i dont know if tonight's going to be the last night you guys
