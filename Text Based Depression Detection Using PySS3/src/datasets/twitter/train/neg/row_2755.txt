Itâ€™s just a napA lot of the times when I think about killing my self, I think about people finding me, me dangling there, how everyone would react.. but really, my reality would just be blackness. Everyone in my life would definitely be able to move on. But I would be free! I would just slip into darkness and be gone forever. 

If I lived, I wouldnâ€™t amount to anything or have anyone, so I think this is a good idea, apart from the initial grief.
