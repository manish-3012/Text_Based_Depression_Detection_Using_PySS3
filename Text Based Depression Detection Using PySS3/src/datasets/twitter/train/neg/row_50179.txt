Well I tried to end my life todayI had the house to myself today, I attempted to hang myself with a belt since I didnâ€™t have a rope. I had it all set up and for some reason I just couldnâ€™t kick the the stool out from under me. I tried to do it multiple times and each time I just couldnâ€™t make myself do it. Iâ€™m disappointed to say the least. Iâ€™m stuck having to keep living as the failure that I am. Which is even more disappointing then failing to hang. I donâ€™t know what I expect from posting this, but it seemed like the right thing to do since Iâ€™ve lurked this sub for a while now.
