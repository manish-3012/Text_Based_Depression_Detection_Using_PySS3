Stop rating the quality of my life for meIt's not always about how good I have it, how privileged I am. I'm not all that btw, but I am white and I am off the streets with money for food for the next few weeks. I'm not complaining about that sort of thing. The problem isn't that life isn't good enough for me, it's that I am *psychologically unable to feel the good things like other people* . I'm sick of being told that life is worth it, it gets better, you don't know how good you have it. People who say stuff like that are dealing with a whole other kind of privilege, a mental one. I simply can't mentally comprehend good things in my life, that doesn't make me selfish or stupid, it makes me broken. I get how to other people that doesn't make sense, but I can't change it
