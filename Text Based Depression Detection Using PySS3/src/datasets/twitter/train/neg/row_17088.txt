I just dont know anymoreI am a 25 year old male. I was recently fired from my job and not told why, a pattern that has repeated itself with every job I have ever had. I am just stuck in this cycle of getting a job, getting fired, not being able to find a job and becoming homeless. Rinse and repeat. I just cant do it anymore. I dont know what I did to deserve this. My family has nothing to do with me. I just dont know. I cant even think anymore. I give up
