i was in fourth grade when i first felt suicidal.my parents didn't give a damn then and they don't give a damn now, either.

i have literally no one anymore. someone who i thought was my closest friend is just using me and likely couldn't care less about me. my relationship with my entire family is so broken.

i'm so tired. i fucking hate my life so much. it hurts so much. every single day hurts so much.
