Someone CaredIve been planning my exit for a little while now. Im really not coping and im using alcohol as an escape. Other than to go to work im always drunk lately, and if i didnt drive to work id be drunk there too. 

One of my plan notes was to take note of anyone who reaches out to me without wanting something from/of me. For awhile no one has, im always messaging them first. Tonight a friend texted me saying she missed me and asking how im doing.

Now im left mixed. Im glad she did this, but i had decided i was leaving. it was just when/where/how. Now she has done this its adding a aura of doubt. fuck
