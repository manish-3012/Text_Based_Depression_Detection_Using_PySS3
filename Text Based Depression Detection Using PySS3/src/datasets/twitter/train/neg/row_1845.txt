Iâ€™m so fucking scared...Itâ€™s gotten to the point where I feel so afraid that everyone in my life is planning to abandon me whenever I least expect it. My friends all probably hate me. Iâ€™m a disappointment to my mom. Iâ€™m so fucking annoying to everyone who even interacts with me. 

Iâ€™m pretty sure the reason I havenâ€™t killed myself is because I donâ€™t want to put my family through that sort of emotional trauma.

Iâ€™m 15 ffs. I should be enjoying life, going out with my friends and actually doing something worthwhile. But instead, I keep myself cooped up in my room, hating myself.

My friends know that I have terribly low self esteem but they donâ€™t seem to care. One of them jokes about me being worthless. I understand that heâ€™s joking around with me but I always believe him whenever he says that.

I just want to be held by someone who doesnâ€™t absolutely despise my very being. I really want to ask this one girl out but I keep thinking that Iâ€™ll fuck it up like I always do with everything.

I donâ€™t want to be alone.


Someone, please, help me...
