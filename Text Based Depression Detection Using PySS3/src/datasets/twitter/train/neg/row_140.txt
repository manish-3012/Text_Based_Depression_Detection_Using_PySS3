Can't think clearly anymoreI've just lost my grandfather only a week after another family member suddenly passed as well. I've had suicidal thoughts for the longest time yet haven't talked to anyone about it because I could lose my job. Every day I try to look positively at everything but I don't know how much longer I can put up the act. I'm sick of hurting people and sick of all of my lies.
