I didnt think I wanted to dieIm a 21 year old male who normally doesn't think about this kind of thing... im so young. Looking at the news and seeing a 21 year old hung themselves would make me so sad. Why don't I feel that way for myself.

I just learned about partial suspension hanging. It looks... Comforting. I feel alone and empty. Id just have to let go

It looks so easy. Just. Let. Go.

I want to let go.
