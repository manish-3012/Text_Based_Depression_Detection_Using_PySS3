easyIt is now a trigger word that means so much with only 4 letters. It was so easy for him to move on. It was so easy for everyone to not care. It was so easy for me to forget what happiness felt like. "Easy," my therapist says when I can't breathe. "It just takes time." It was so easy to be forgotten like I meant absolutely nothing to anyone. It's so easy for people to not take accountability in how others feel. It was so easy to be lied to, stepped on, used, taken advantaged of, gaslighted, abused, tore down, disrespected. It was so easy for me to decide that the only thing left to do is to take the pills, pull the trigger, tie the noose because all of this is so fucking hard, too fucking hard for me to go another day in this shitty ass life with absolutely no one by my side. It's that easy.
