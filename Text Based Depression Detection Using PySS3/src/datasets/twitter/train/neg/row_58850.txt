I think my friend is absolutely set to commit suicideThis morning when I woke up, I saw that my friend sent me and our group of friends a message saying that he'll see us in the next life and that he has a note for us if something does happen. 

I feel really lost because me and my group of friends want to help him, yet we think that he's already accepted it. We're not really sure what has happened to him since he hangs out with other people, but he's still one of our close friends. He doesn't want this getting out of our group, but I don't think there's any other way that I could get help. 

I'm really worried...
