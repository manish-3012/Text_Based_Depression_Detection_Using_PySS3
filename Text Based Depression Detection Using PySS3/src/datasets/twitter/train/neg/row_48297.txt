Wanting to end it all soon in a week or so because of what happened.I fucking almost got myself and dad in an accident while I was practicing driving. I can't handle driving anymore it's too dangerous for me and I'm a whimp. I also tried self harming and attempted to scratch my arms but there was little white marks that had minor pain because of I was a pussy of doing so. one of the scariest shit happened to me when I was driving so the light turned yellow then to red and i stopped in the middle of an intersection luckily the car packed up and then I hit park, got all nervous and hit drive my dad got so pissed and said "you stupid you shouldn't have stopped" in punjabi for stupid I am not stupid though, I legit panicked. I'm sorry for posting here again, all these mistakes are killing me. It's best if I don't drive at all, it's not very safe for me and risky. I'm really selfish in this, and lately I've been giving people attitude, I don't deserve to live. I want to end it soon. Some of the posts here unanswered makes me feel really sad :(.
