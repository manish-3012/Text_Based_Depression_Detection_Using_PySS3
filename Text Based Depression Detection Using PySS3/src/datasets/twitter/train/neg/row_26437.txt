HelpSo I'm not complaining I never have, in fact I have been told I'm too happy for my life...
But...here goes....I was beaten, tortured, and demoralized (broken bones burns) by my biological parents. I was taken away when I was 2.  27 foster homes later I was adopted by a child molester, and raped every day.  Taken again and put into an orphanage, again raped by other boys who were bigger......adopted again and told I was just a tax credit will never be lived by "parents"...joined military and thought I found a family, but was combat wounded.  Found out ex wife cheated while I was on deployment, my son is not mine.  Courts used a fake salary for child support that I never had, upping my payments now living in on the street.....this is just a brief synopsis of some crap I've been through, even a psychiatrist told me to kill myself before, I've tried.. ..I need help
