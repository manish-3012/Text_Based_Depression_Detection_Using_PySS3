"Just seek help!" "Seek God" "Stop thinking about it"Title is the responses I get when I open up about my suicidal thoughts, urges of suicide/homicide/self harm

How do you guys deal with unhelpful advice? Im so lost. Please. Help

"Seek help" I AM THATS WHY IM OPENING UP!!! IM ON FUCKING MEDICATION AND SEE A COUNSELOR &amp; A PSYCHOLOGIST!!! ON TOP OF THAT IM SEEKING SUPPORT FROM 'FRIENDS' BY **OPENING UP**. YOU TELL ME I CAN OPEN UP TO YOU BUT YOU DO NOTHING!!!!!!!!! YOU JUST CAST WHAT I SAY ASIDE AND SAY "Oh, just get help" ITS DRIVING ME FUCKING CRAZIER THAN I ALREADY AM 

WE TELL PEOPLE TO OPEN UP BUT WHEN WE DO *WE GET* ***NOTHING***

"Seek God" This would be mighty helpful if I **wasn't a closet atheist.** It sounds like They can't deal with me and want me to stop talking. Which hurts.

"Stop thinking about it and do something with your life" Oh! Geez! **Why didn't I think of that?** Thank you so much, Dr Helpful! Im so sorry my depression fucks my ass every day and I can barely function, thank you truly!
