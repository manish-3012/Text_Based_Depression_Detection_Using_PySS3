Last day of 2019Huge shoutout to everyone who survived their own suicidal thoughts this year. Know that I am proud of you and I am glad youâ€™re still here. I read this subreddit quite often and I want you guys to know that I genuinely love and care for you. I hope 2020 isa great year! You really deserve the world for all the struggle you deal with on a daily basis. Your bravery shines through when you wake up every morning to deal with the same demons that tore you down yesterday. There are many words you can use to describe life but easy isnâ€™t even close.
