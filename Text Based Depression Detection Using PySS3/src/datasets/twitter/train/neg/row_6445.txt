rant/thoughtsI just have this urge to kill myself. I'm just trying to stay alive long enough to keep this image for my parents that I'm doing well. Right now it just feels like a marathon to me, I just need to stay alive long enough to make it across the finish line. Then just make my death look like an accident. I mean I have it all planned out. I guess the reason I'm posting this here is just trying to get it off my chest, and hopefully I can stop thinking about it until the time comes. So for the time being I just need to be the best I can be, and before I know it I can finally exit. Then I can finally say my job is done here.
