I have no more energy left in meI'm almost thirty, since I graduated high school I have fucked everything up in my life. Job to job to job, moving in and out over and over, one fucked up relationship after another. I have been very depressed lately, but today my latest relationship disintegrated and Im out if steam. And the thought of ending everything seems like such a relief and so freeing.
