I don't know what do toHello. My name is Jon. I just had a talk with an ex who we'll call, Jasmine. A couple weeks after we broke up I started talking to this girl who I thought was interesting and I was beginning to develop feelings for her. When I told her this she was immediately upset, and told me that she still loved me so I called it off with girl and tried to rekindle my relationship with my ex. Ever since then, she told has told me a multitude of times that she loved me even when we broke up. I thought these would've been signs that she wanted to be back together with me but when she told me that she was seeing someone else during our time together, I was sad. When she told me that she was talking to a guy during our time together as a couple, and was interested in him then, I was heartbroken. I told her how I felt and she called me selfish.. said I didn't care about her at all, said I wasn't a real man and even told me that how pathetic I was..


We've had problems before and unfortunately we had a roller coaster relationship.. I thought that no matter how much we argued we'd still love each other dearly.


I just don't know what to do anymore guys.. she was seriously one of the few people that made me happy in my life. She made me feel special and that I truly mattered to someone. I think if those words came from almost anyone else I would be alright but coming from her.. they hurt an incredible amount. Starting to believe she was right about me.


She was the only one to have seemed to care about me.. maybe this is all my fault and I really did deserve this. I can't help but feel terrible thinking this is all my fault. I didn't want to hurt her I never wanted to hurt her. 

I wanted to marry her, we always talked about the family that we'd make and she even told me how much she loved me and how great I was. 

I just think that maybe if I died she won't feel sorry for me anymore.
