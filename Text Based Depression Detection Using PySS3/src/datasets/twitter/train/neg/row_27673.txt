To the edge and backI was 16, fell in love with a wonderful girl who I drove away 8 years later due to alcoholism. The bottle flushed away my aspirations of being an attorney. Then, 24 dated around and started on a new path.  Found something else I was good at and found a wonderful woman. Got married. Drank on occasion but never over-indulged. I was done with that. Life was good. New job, higher pay - "American Dream". 

Then one evening she comes into the living room and proceeds with "I want a divorce, I'm not attracted to you, I hate it here". 

That shattering moment drove me back to the bottle. Before I knew it, the hammer was cocked and I was sobbing uncontrollably in front of her. I wanted to die. I'll never forget the feeling of a cocked gun pointed towards my head. When everything felt out of control, I regained it.

It was a liberating feeling to feel that much control. I'll never forget how cold the steel felt pressed against the side of my head. Something inside of me decided to let go.

I can tell you, it gets better. I'm 27 and quite lonely. I grew up middle class and had a yearning for life. I went to college and enjoyed it immensely. Went on to grad school where I lost myself. Embarked on a new career path. Found myself. 1.5 years later, I lost myself. 

Whatever you're going through isn't easy. I'm 27, newly single, going through a wicked divorce. I reflect on what happened two weeks ago and think how great it feels knowing that the Glock didn't fail when they went with the lowest bidder for a spring.
