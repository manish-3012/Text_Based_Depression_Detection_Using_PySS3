Fuck it. Fuck it all.When it comes down to it, there is really nothing more left for me to do. I can't make friends I don't belong in any group. Even at work people get frustrated because they have to teach me things I learned over the course of 18 weeks. I'm stupid, I can't keep my family afloat. There's just no reason to keep fighting anymore.
