If I know it's all in my head then why cant I stop thinking I want to die??Like everyone I've had my fair share of shit in my short 24 years on this planet, but unlike everyone I am entirely aware of the fact that what I think I become. I dont live in the past, I've learnt from it and grown, but with knowing all that why is it so hard to want to stay here? I know life can be beautiful and all that but I still dont want it. My mum always said if I wanted to die then that's my decision, and I always choose death regardless. Even on a good day I think of how much easier it would all be if I just ended it. I know it's not just me, I don't want to be told others feel the same because I know they do but that doesn't help me or hearing about how they helped themselves like cool that's you but I know what will work for me and that's dying.
