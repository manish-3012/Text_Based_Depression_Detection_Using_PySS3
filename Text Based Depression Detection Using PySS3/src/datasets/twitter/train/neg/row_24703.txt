Reached out and got nothing backThey always tell you to ask for help, I've sent my 3 closest friends messages over the past couple days asking for advice and support, and I've simply been left on read. 
Sick of people's empty words and promises that amount to nothing in reality, what right have they to ask me to continue through the pain and to try and live just to alleviate their discomfort.
I didn't even want to do this, so much easier to hide everything
