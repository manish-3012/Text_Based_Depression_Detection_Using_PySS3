I had run out of money; I was overloaded with debt, and then something happened yesterday that changed everything...Donâ€™t give up. I almost did. My story:About a week ago, in the evening, I sat alone in my apartment, trying figure out where I went wrong. I was broke, my friends mostly lived far away, and I was suffering from a rather severe depressive episode, as I am bipolar. 

I wasnâ€™t always this way. I used to be in the military, and I used to have a lot of money invested and in savings. Something traumatic happened three years into my enlistment, but I gritted my teeth and pressed onward. Two years later, I left the military and settled into a new apartment. The depression and anxiety had consumed me, but again I pressed onward.

Even with medication, my mood episodes became worse and deep down I didnâ€™t want to live. I kept hoping things would get better. But they didnâ€™t.

Fast forward to last summer: the HVAC in my place was leaking fiberglass; I didnâ€™t know what it was, and as it got in my eyes and cut into my skin. I thought I was going crazy. I thought there were insects stinging me. I sounded crazy. No one believed me, and I again wanted to die. 

After discovering the fiberglass dust on my things, I moved, but it took a long time to clean it off of my things. 

Then, the pandemic hit. I was having some problems with substance abuse intermittently, and trying to forget the pain experienced throughout my life. I stopped using the drugs, and the depression returned. Luckily, I wasnâ€™t dependent, but I felt like I usually do: shitty. 

I ran out of money this past month. I put my rent on the credit card, and had a plan in place for that same day. I knew I had hit my breaking point. I was likely going to be evicted in a few months, and I became so paranoid and depressed that I could not keep doing this. 

Yesterday, I decided to check my mail. It had been weeks since Iâ€™d been to my mailbox. I grabbed the letters and shut the door behind me. 

I noticed a letter, from the government and wondered what it could be. I reached inside and pulled out a check! Its sum was large, and initially I was confused until I read the letter. It stated the disability claim I had forgotten filing months prior had been approved. The Veteranâ€™s Administration was sending me checks.

I was elated, and even though Iâ€™m still depressed, Iâ€™m not going to be homeless. The reason Iâ€™m telling this story is because no matter how bad things seem one moment, they can always change around the next without warning. Donâ€™t give up because you donâ€™t know what the next day might bring or who you might meet. Iâ€™m still depressed, but I feel like I can make it for now.
