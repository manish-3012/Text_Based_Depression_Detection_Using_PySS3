It was suggested I post againWhat better time than from the office parking lot because I don't have the ability to keep my shit together right now. I had a breakdown and had to go hide.


I don't have the energy to retype my last post 

Cliff notes is that I'm tired of everything. It's been years it never gets better for long. Sure I've had people say they care of they will be my friend but honestly, people lose interest or just get tired of me. It's exhausting dealing with someone who is melancholy all the time.

I know I'm damaged and that a lot of it has to do with how is was raised. I have complex PTSD and my therapist said I defiantly had a disorganized attachment style and she suspected RAD as well.

Growing up being threatened and told that the devil must have me to be such a wicked child from a toddler... What have I done in a past life it must have been horrid to have you as my punishment.

I've had loss, down to my identity.

And I think what breaks my heart is knowing that there is no hope, looking at my own child and knowing that he would be better off all around. Psychologically, emotionally, physically if he were raised by my so without me.

And yet I'm still sad and still looking around one last time. I mean I figure I can off myself anytime I choose.. Might as well be sure of it 100% 

It's over 90 degrees outside and I am tempted to just go to sleep in the car.
