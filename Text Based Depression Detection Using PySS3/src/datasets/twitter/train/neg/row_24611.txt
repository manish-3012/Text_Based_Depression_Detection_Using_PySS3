why am I this wayItâ€™s my birthday today and the first thought i have is that I want to be dead. Why does it feel like Iâ€™m suffering just existing and putting in so much effort to go through the daily motions yet everyone doesnâ€™t think itâ€™s good enough. Iâ€™m trying I really am but I am so tired in my soul. 

I honestly want to do it today. It seems fitting.
