Unexplained sadness / depressionI have been battling depression and anxiety for several years.  I have no reason to feel like this.  I have a great marriage (27 years) great kids.  I have a good job that is low stress.  I take my meds and see my dr. On a regular basis.

I can't seem to shake this unhappiness.  I have changed jobs 3 times since 2013 blaming my work.  I know now it can't be my work.  It's me

I don't know what to do.  I have been hospitalized twice in the last 12 years.  I don't feel it helped at all.  Just made me feel like a criminal then get released when insurance stops paying.

Just accepting the fact that I'm not going to be happy doesn't sound like an option.
