I donâ€™t want to die. I just want it to end.I know Iâ€™m not in a terrible place. I still have a house. I still have a car. I still have my boyfriend. I still have a future. I have not ruined my life. 

I still donâ€™t want to be here. 

The anxiety I feel all day long about everything is just is so tiring that my brain thinks about suicide and even though I know I could never do it, I canâ€™t help but hope something will kill me just by coincidence.

I drive my car and hope that other people will hit me with theirs by accident. I have side pains and hope something is so wrong in me that it kills me. I wish to bump into the wrong person and set them off so they murder me. 

Iâ€™ve lost a lot this year. And every time I feel like itâ€™s going better, it gets worse. One step forward, three steps back. 

I donâ€™t like being alone, but I donâ€™t want to be around people. I donâ€™t like being unhappy, but itâ€™s all I know. I try to shut off the voices that tell me to worry, but they yell louder in my head. 

I donâ€™t know how to fix me. Iâ€™ve tried counseling but I donâ€™t have insurance anymore. 

I donâ€™t want to kill myself. I just want to die.
