My mum just tried to overdose herselfI heard a commotion in the kitchen and she was trying to take alot of co-codamol - luckily my stepdad was able to stop her and I was able to call 999 quickly, but I'm really shaken and my friends are all asleep and I really need someone to talk to.
If this is the wrong place to talk please link a different place, I really need to talk
