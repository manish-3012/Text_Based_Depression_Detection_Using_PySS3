I can't go on without help.I have written this three times my phone has crashed and deleted my paragraph three times I am not writing this again, basicly I am super depressed it is consuming my life and I am scared of social interaction, I'm a freshman in highschool. I asked my mom about councling or medication and she told me no that's only for crazy people and that I'm not mentally challenged like people who need therapy. this is absolutely insane every night for the past month I have thought about suicide and I have attempted it twice and this sucks because I just want to take medication to feel better but I'm not allowed to and I can't go on suffering like this for much longer. plus my mom is a mentally abusive jerk and my father is a hot head and they both like to blame their problems on me. I just... need advice I guess? how do you get through depression without medication? how do you make friends? 
in don't know if I can deal with this knowing it isn't going to get better.
