Last month i've lost everything that mattered to me and now i just can't keep going on like this.A few weeks ago i lost everything that was important to me. 
To set up a little background i frew up mostly alone with my grandma and my cat because my parents had left me alone. 

So i didn't have much support while growing up but i did love my cat more than anything,every time i'd want to die i'd stop myself because i couldn't leave her alone in life. 

In the span of a single week i've confessed my feelings to a friend and got rejected. I've lost my cat due to liver failures and i've lost my job without warning. 

Ever since then i've stopped caring about everything,i just can't anymore. I'm tired of all this.
