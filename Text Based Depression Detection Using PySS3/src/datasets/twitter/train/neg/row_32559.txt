Rectifying a mistakeI did not make the original mistake, but I made so many since. I have made so many different mistakes, but there is one that I have made over and over again and continue to make it. I am making it right now, with every letter I type, and with every breath I take. You think I would have learned by now. You think I would have realized my errors and corrected them, but I have not. Apparently I have not learned from my mistakes. I have not learned my lesson, because if I had, I wouldn't keep repeating them.  They say those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it, and that is exactly what I have been doing, repeating history over and over again and doing worse each time. However that all ends tonight. Tonight I rectify my mistakes. Tonight I show what I've learned from my history and correct all my mistakes. I AM THE MISTAKE,  AND TONIGHT I RECTIFY MYSELF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
