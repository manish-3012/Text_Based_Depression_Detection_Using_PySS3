I failed, now there's no going backI am an university student on a scholarship. The way this scholarship works is, if you fail a class you lose all financial benefits + you have to pay back every benefit you've been given.  
  
Last semester I got really ill and had to be operated. I was out of class for three weeks and when I came back I felt completely lost. I had a class I thought I'd pass but when the finals came I completely failed. Shortly after the grades were posted, I was called in to the office and told my case would go to an academic committee who would decide if I kept the scholarship or not. I saved myself by handing in my medical papers. That was strike one.  
  
This semester is almost over and I just got the results of one of my classes. I needed a 50% on the final to pass the class... I scored 36%. With this surely my scholarship will get annuled.   
  
I haven't yet talked to anyone about it. My parents and friends think everything is OK and that I'm doing well. I can't face them. Today for the first time of my life I'm considering killing myself... if only to save myself the shame of bankrupting my parents.
