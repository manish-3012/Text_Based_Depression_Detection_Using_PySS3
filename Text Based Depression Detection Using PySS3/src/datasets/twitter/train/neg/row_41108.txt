I should have killed myself today.I should have gone through with instead of listening to that tiny voice of reason and hope. This life isn't worth living. All I want to do is die. I don't care about living a full life. I'd gladly give the rest of my life to someone that wants to live. 

Maybe I'll try tomorrow.
