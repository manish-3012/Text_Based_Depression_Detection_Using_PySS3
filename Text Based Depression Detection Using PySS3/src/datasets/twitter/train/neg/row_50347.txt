Tired of people's bs adviceNobody's advice ever leads anywhere. I can't make anywhere hire me no matter how upbeat I am in interviews. And if I get a job, hello minimum wage and pt hours with no future. It's an endless cycle of shit. I'm told to go back to school, but that isn't a gamble I can financially make. People don't want to hire you without experience after all. I can't join the military or peace corps BC of anxiety, depression, and panic attacks. All I'm look forward to in life is future homelessness. I live with my parents in a rented apartment BC my dad threw away our nearly paid for house, my mom doesn't work and refuses to get her disability, so if dies or leaves, I have about 4 month's of rent before we're in the street. I don't have simple, middle class problems. I will never have a respectable job and be able to vacation 'proving respectability thru travel is so important' or buy a home. I'll always be the scumbag who is either working a shitty job or be homeless. And now, considering I can't even get a pt cleaning job with no future, why should I not commit suicide?
