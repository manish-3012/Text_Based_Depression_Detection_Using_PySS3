SmilePostpartum depression here for anyone who's been there.  So sorry ya'll for the downer. Not to grand an experience to be going through. There's nothing like wide spread depression and loneliness to make you hate yourself and how much of a failure you feel as a mom. But hey, you're expected to put on a brave face because others are watching. You're a mom after all-- there are expectations. What? You aren't all-loving, well-put together, cleaning, and cook-aholic? Smile, have pose, look the part, and for God-sake look through those rose-colored glasses and pretend it's all good. Can't tell you how many OBs I've watched in the medical profession talk down women who have even said they've wanted to hurt themselves. Sleep aids. Finally, I could sleep. Maybe then, finally, I could give up the endless fight. I could give up the regrets, the love never given and the love never gotten. What is the point to things, honestly? I've seen wealthy oil families in disarray, lonely ex-pats drowning in alcohol, and the backbone farmer wasting away in steel-trap stoic loneliness. Do any of you seriously care? Does anyone look around and die to their own pride and say "Shit, I am so sorry. I am here for you because I too am broken." Instead, the endless pseudo-smiles persist.  So here I sit among the rest, smiling. Wish me luck that it sticks, ya'll!
