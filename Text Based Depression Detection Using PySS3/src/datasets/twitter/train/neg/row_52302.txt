i miss having things to live fori miss enjoying life. i miss having hobbies to take my mind off of the pain. now i can't take pleasure in anything except sleep. i wish i had the courage to take the permanent sleep. life is devoid of meaning. don't tell me to "try something new"; i've spent plenty of time in nature, i've tried to play music, i've tried sports/exercise, i've tried art, sex means nothing to me if it's not with someone i love, i dropped out of school, i have no future filled with anything but mediocrity and existential anguish and ennui.
