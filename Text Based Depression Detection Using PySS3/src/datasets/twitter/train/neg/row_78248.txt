I want to die (venting even tho no one really gives a shit)I've been thinking about killing myself for the past few days and tonight might be it bc I'm sick of waking up and remembering that everything is going to shit. I'm tired of feeling happy but then a split second later feeling like the scum of the earth. Im done with the heartbreak, I'm don't with the cutting, I'm done with starving myself, im done with it all. I don't want to feel anything anymore and i don't want to live knowing that I'll always be stuck in the wrong body. I'm finished with knowing that I'll never be able to start cross hormone therapy bc my parents don't want me to. I'm done with being the only guy in my class that hasn't started peuberty. I'm sick of the mountains of homework that I know will never bring my grades up. I'm tired of people advertising that they want to kill themselves as if it's something to be proud of. I'm sick of these empty promises, empty "I love you" empty "you matter" that come out of people you know don't give a shit about you. I'm done with people that only care about you once they notice that you have scars on your wrists or are skipping meals. All this fake bullshit is driving me insane and I just want to be rid of it all. I know that suicide is selfish, but at this point I don't care anymore.
