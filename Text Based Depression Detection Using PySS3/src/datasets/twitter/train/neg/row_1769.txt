Suicide is a vicious, wild animal. Never turn your back on itI hadn't thought about suicide in months until today. I thought I beat it. Fuck, man. Just a couple months ago I was thinking about how weak I was to consider suicide in the past. I was on top of the fucking world! I thought I had cleared myself of all suicidal temptations. But today, out of absolutely nowhere, I got extremely emotional while driving. I almost had it in me to swerve into the concrete on the highway. I've got it so good right now, but this is the strongest episode I've ever had. Who knows how long it will last. Appreciate your emotions because they'll tear you apart the second you let your guard down.
