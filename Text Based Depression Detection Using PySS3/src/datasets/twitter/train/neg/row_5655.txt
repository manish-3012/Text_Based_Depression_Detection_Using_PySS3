My boyfriend dumped me and I want to kill myself.No idea if this is being posted right as I've never posted on reddit before but I just need to put this out there.

A few days ago my boyfriend and I broke up out of nowhere, since then he won't even speak to me or give me a real reason for just cutting me off and in all honesty I really can't cope or handle it. I've never felt this bad, I just want to die. It's not as basic as people may think, I literally can't handle my emotions right now I just don't want to wake up and I don't really have anyone to talk to, I think would be happier dead as sad as that sounds. Anyways yeah. No idea.
