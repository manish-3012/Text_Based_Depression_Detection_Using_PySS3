Why was / am I so stupid...?Iâ€™ll start by saying im a 24f. This week has been hell. Saturday my dad which he calls helping by coming to my apartment and getting rid of my junk food and then he brought me back home.  Sunday - Today ive been doing 2 workouts which is good cause im losing weight but im not doing good enough... itâ€™s NEVER GOOD ENOUGH. Anyway, I brought some of my stuff from my apartment to the house so i can be comfortable. So today my dad thinks itâ€™s helping by throwing away something important to me then proceeded to passively aggressively make fun of me. I always hated being around my family cause what they think is helping is hurting me. Ive already had to give up food and now they are trying to take away my comfort. 

Now im here. Ive been wanting to kill my self for a VERY long time but Iâ€™ve been so weak so pathetic and worthless to do anything GOOD to get closer to that goal. This is the ONLY way Iâ€™m going to fix a problem that been going on for too long. They tell me to be more adult so i am. By getting out of their life for good. Love never existed or will exist other than my love for my dog. I have to kill my self its for the betterment of everyone around me which isnt a lot cause I donâ€™t have any friends.
