I'm just so tired.I don't want to be alive anymore. I'm a woman in my mid 20s in between jobs and I have no useful skills and contribute nothing to society. I see myself as a parasite leeching off of the world and I think it would be an improvement if I wasn't around anymore.

One of my close relatives shot themselves in the head a while back, and I'm just realizing now that I'm actually jealous of the strength they had to go through with it. 

I can't find it in me to look forward to anything anymore. I see the things that used to make me happy as little soap bubbles; they look pretty, but once I get a hold of them they disappear and I realize they were empty the whole time. 

When I think about the future, all I feel is a shitty sort of exhaustion. I just don't know if I have the energy to keep it up.
