My friends last giftI've been thinking about killing myself for the last few months.I mean its not that I have a one big problem,more like many smaller ones that just keep piling up. Here is a few of them just for reference:
 1. I always wanted to be the opposite sex,but I'm living with my father and he's against such things

 2. My dreams keep crumbling. Whether its my band that I've dreamed of ever since I started playing the drums 11 years ago or me failing at school even though I'm trying as hard as I can.

 3. I think I might actually be mentally ill. A few years ago my perception of the world has started to change. I dont feel like Im myself anymore,its like Im watching my life on a screen,and Im not the one in control.

Last week,my friend jumped under a train becouse his gf broke up with him. Me and my friends were actually looking for him becouse his gf told us that he said he's going to kill himself. Well,as you might've guessed, we didn't make it in time.I told myself that I should probably be crying,but I was unable to do that. For a part of me,it felt like any other day,while the other part kept screaming at me that I'm a horrible human being.But that was not the case for my friends. I saw the suffering,anger and sadness in their eyes for the whole week. I dont want my family to suffer like that. And I dont want my friends to go through such a thing a again. But Im afraid that one day I'm actually going to do it.

My friend helped me realise what the people around you go through,and if anything,he at least made me reconsider for now.
