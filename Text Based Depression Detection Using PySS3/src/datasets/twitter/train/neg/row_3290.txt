I don't think there's enough reason to stay alive anymore.All I wanted was someone to listen to me for once, since childhood. But nobody did. I know I'm ugly and I lack huge ambitions in life and I probably am not interested in the mainstream topics people like to talk about. I don't have a greed to discover the world or taste all the food or visit all the nice places or anything because as I said I'm not ambitious by nature. Honestly I think I'll be the same amount of happy if I were a billionaire as that if I was homeless and broke. I don't think anything is worth the pain of living through every day all alone. Nobody would care even and anyway overpopulation is a problem. So yeah, I think I'll take an early retirement from life pretty soon.
