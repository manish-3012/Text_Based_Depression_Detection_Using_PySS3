Hi, I have multiple mental illnesses and am currently going through a relapse. I just want people to listen and understand me.Hello. Iâ€™m a 19 y/o female and when I was 7, doctors put me on ADHD medication because the school told them I have â€œbehavioral issuesâ€ and some type of learning disability and later that year my first suicide attempt was made. From being on intense medication like that I later devolved severe anxiety at 9 and was put on medication for that, then later severe depression at 10. My doctor at that time put me on antidepressants so I was already taking 3 meds by the age of 10 to â€œfix meâ€. All Iâ€™ve known my whole life is mental illness and medication. I donâ€™t feel Iâ€™ve ever been stable, to be honest. Many suicide attempts and many in patients, php, and out patients later and I feel like Iâ€™ve just been over medicated my whole life and only gotten worse. Last year when I was 18 I went to in patient yet again and this time I was diagnosed with bipolar with psychosis and borderline personality disorder along with severe ptsd. So now Iâ€™ve managed to rack up 5 mental illnesses and I just feel defeated. I had a relapse a week ago and another attempt after almost a year. I had stopped taking my meds because I just wanted to be free of them, but Iâ€™ve learned my brain canâ€™t function without them anymore. I feel trapped and alone. Iâ€™m not looking for sympathy I just want to know if anyone is going through anything similar? Does anyone know how this feels? Does anyone have a few of these mental illnesses? Please help. I feel alone and lost. Iâ€™m scared and going through so many medication changes in a short amount of time and I refuse to go back to the hospital due to trauma from it. 
I hope people see this. Thank you.
