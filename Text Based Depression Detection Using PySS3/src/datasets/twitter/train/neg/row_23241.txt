A good friend of mine just passed away at his own hand. He was a beautiful person.For those of you wishing for the same fate, please reconsider. I wish I had more to say right now but I am too sad and shocked.

For those of you providing support to those in need, thank you so much for your kindness. You are helping to bring light to a seemingly unyielding darkness.
