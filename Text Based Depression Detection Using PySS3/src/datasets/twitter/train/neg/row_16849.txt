I wanna end itIdk what to really write here I just kinda need some help, Iâ€™ve been diagnosed with manic depression and Iâ€™ve been off my meds for awhile now, maybe I should start taking them again but they donâ€™t seem to help they are the second ones I have tried but nothing seems to help me I always end up getting super depressed, Iâ€™ve been in and out of the hospital for trying to kill myself since I was probably 13-14 I am now 17 and life just seems pointless I have no friends because they always seem to backstab me, I really like this boy and he said he liked me to but my now ex bestfriend started hitting him up behind my back and he now has feelings for her but also some how still has feelings for me, idk super confusing anyways I told him to choose because Iâ€™m ainâ€™t down for all of this and he told me he needs space and idk Iâ€™m just super depressed and this made it worse, Iâ€™m pathetic I know.
