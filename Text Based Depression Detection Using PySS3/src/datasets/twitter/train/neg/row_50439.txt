Newfound hopeIâ€™d been so numb for years and years and years and really felt like it was impossible for me to feel anything anymore. Therapy didnâ€™t work, meds didnâ€™t work, I was losing hope. I recently tried out MDMA and it made me so incredibly happy that it motivated me to keep trying. I donâ€™t want to try it ever again because it feels dangerously addictive, but I now know I can feel which means Iâ€™m not a lost cause after all. Thank you guys for being here.
