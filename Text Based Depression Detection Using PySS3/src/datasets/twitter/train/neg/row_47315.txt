now what?welp I tried to jump off a bridge only to be hospitalized and freak out everyone around me. Iâ€™m still depressed, still anxious, still dealing with all the same shit except now Iâ€™ve hurt everyone around me like a true attention whore. I canâ€™t even motivate myself with the belief that I only have to hang on for a little while longer anymore. I have nothing. nothingâ€™s gonna change. now what am I expected to do?
