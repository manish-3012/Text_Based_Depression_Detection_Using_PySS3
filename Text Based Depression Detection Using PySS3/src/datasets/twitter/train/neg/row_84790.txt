How to move onI was playing a game and just randomly remembered her and how she was interested in someone else and is problably having similar moments that we had.

Meanwhile all I have is stupid games and my shitty life. This random thought made me want to kill myself, because I know I wont experience the pleasure of being with her again. 

I have tried to stop this, but she just randomly pops up in my head and I can't stop it.
