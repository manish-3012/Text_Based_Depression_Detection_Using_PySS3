Weâ€™re all depressed.I hope Iâ€˜ll be guilty of murder!

Heâ€™s depressed, sheâ€™s depressed. 

He hides his pain and anger.

She cries at night with sadness and alcohol.

Yeah. I feel bad. Sorry to my parents for raising me for more than 15 years. I feel bad. But guilt doesnâ€™t stop me. What am I doing? Iâ€™m not even that depressed. My mind is crystal clear. What am I doing? This is stupid. Iâ€™m their only chance to help them get retired early and what the hell am I doing... I want them proud but canâ€™t. Why am I doing this to myself and them.
