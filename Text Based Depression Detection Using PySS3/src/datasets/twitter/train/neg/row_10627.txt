The void is coming for meIts been a week now and every night it gets louder and louder. It started off as a very quiet rumbling in my head but it's getting louder and louder every night. I can hear my own heartbeat with the rumbling.

What is this feeling? Is it all in my head or is there a reasonable explanation for this. One thing is for sure, something is coming for me during the night and I'm not sure what it is. It gets closer and  closer everyday. I'm scared.

A midnight stroll sounds nice right about now. My  head hurts but I can't fall asleep. Life is a pain. Its 1 am and I can feel it looming right behind me ready to grab me and drag me to God knows where. I just want to go to bed and not wake up in the morning. 

How do I make the void go away?
