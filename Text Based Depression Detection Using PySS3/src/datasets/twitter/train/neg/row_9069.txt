The closest Iâ€™ve ever been.It feels like Iâ€™m doing everything that Iâ€™m supposed to be doing. I moved out of my parentâ€™s place, Iâ€™m seeing a therapist, Iâ€™m being more open with friends and family. Iâ€™m eating better, Iâ€™m losing weight, Iâ€™m doing stuff that I want to do. Most days, Iâ€™m ok. 
But then it also feels like those days Iâ€™m just ignoring the problem. And then thereâ€™s the days, like today, when it becomes too much and I canâ€™t ignore it anymore. My friends have been nothing but supportive and understanding, but I fear the day when their patience runs out. I donâ€™t get over stuff easily or normally or in any reasonable amount of time, I never have. 

I have my therapist but every time I have a session, things are fine. Itâ€™s like my mind knows when a session is coming up and makes me feel great around then so that when she asks how Iâ€™ve been doing, I just focus on that and say â€œIâ€™ve been greatâ€. I get this weird anxiety about mentioning the times I havenâ€™t been great because Iâ€™m like â€œoh that was last week, it doesnâ€™t make sense to bug her about it nowâ€. 

I just donâ€™t actually know what Iâ€™m doing anymore, or why. Iâ€™ve spent most of the last decade focusing on the wrong person and things and now that I donâ€™t have that focus, I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m supposed to do. I donâ€™t have a goal. It feels like everyone my age is already way ahead of me, and I have so much catching up to do that it almost feels pointless.

I have a thing with someone new and heâ€™s wonderful but every sweet and kind thing he does scares me because Iâ€™m not used to it. It feels like my last relationship left me too broken to ever really succeed in another one, and sometimes I find myself wondering when his patience will run out and heâ€™ll decide Iâ€™m not worth it either. 

Because I just moved I have about a year before I can think about going to school. Thereâ€™s already this pressure that once that year is up, I HAVE to go to school and do something and I just donâ€™t know what that is supposed to be, and I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m gonna figure it out by then. Iâ€™m just treading water, and Iâ€™m getting tired, and the more I think about just stopping and letting myself sink, the more soothing that idea sounds. Iâ€™ve never really fantasized about it, and now I am, and itâ€™s scaring me. I donâ€™t know what else to do.

I initially posted this a bit ago and deleted it after because I felt silly doing it. But itâ€™s still a problem, and I still donâ€™t know what to do about it. So I guess it doesnâ€™t matter if itâ€™s silly or not.
