i wish i'd be goneeverybody tells me how good i have it in life.
that i'm the lucky one.

i have everything but nothing.

they don't know shit.
how hard it's been, is, and continues to be.

going to bed every night hoping it'll be the last, waking up and realizing im still there.
they think it's easy for me because i don't have to go to work, because i'm still living at home with my fucking dad, because nobody even expects me to do something.

it's a fucking nightmare i'm not waking up from.
nothing i do matters.

i'm a 20 years old college dropout, living with my dad and my two siblings, freelancing from time to time just to give almost everything to my dad to pay the rent.

i used to have a hobby, i used to enjoy listening to music, i used to have fun with my friends.

i don't even know when things started to go wrong.
im just absolutely hollow.
worthless to society, the people around me, the people i really care for.
i just don't want to be a burden to anyone anymore.

i fell in love half a year ago, knowing beforehand it's never going to happen; i'll never tell her. i'll just give up again because i don't want to bother her anymore.

nothing really motivates me, because i have absolutely no goals in life. i've done everything i can imagine myself doing. i don't need more, i just want to disappear, nobody giving a shit about it and just forget about me would be my greatest pleasure.

i don't care about anything, i just don't want to bother anyone anymore.

i want to silently disappear, but how?
please, no fucking bull about anything else.
i've had enough.
