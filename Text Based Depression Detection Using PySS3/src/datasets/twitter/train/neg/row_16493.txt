I feel like a failureEvery few years I come back to this exact spot and itâ€™s like nothing has changed. I want to die. I feel like nobody loves me. 

My boyfriend said that he needs time to consider our relationship. This just feels like one more on the pile of failed relationships and friendships. I am a failure. I want to pack all of my things and never be seen again. I want to die but I donâ€™t want to leave a body behind or any kind of mess to clean up. I just want to disappear. 

Iâ€™m so afraid of myself but I think Iâ€™m more afraid of life and the pain that it brings. Isnâ€™t it better to just die and get it over with? I wish it was easy.
