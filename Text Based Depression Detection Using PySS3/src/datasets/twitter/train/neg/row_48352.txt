By staying alive, I am an inherently bad person.I am a waste of this planet's limited resources and a burden to everyone who has to tolerate my existence. I am rude, an eyesore, and completely useless. I was kicked out of the 12th grade due to "triggering" other students, and I can't get a job because I cry during interviews.

I am worth nothing. I have no skills, no hobbies. I do nothing in my daily life. I am housebound. I don't know how to socialize, so I refrain from doing so at every given chance. I believe that I am at the age where I am too old to learn how to socialize. It seems to be a skill that one is required to understand by childhood. I sometimes believe that I am autistic, but no one takes me seriously, and I'm probably incorrect anyway. I don't fit enough of the symptoms. I'm just stupid.

I will never find love. I greatly despise everyone who makes the claim that "anyone can find love". This is a lie. I am going to die alone. I am an objectively hideous person, and I'm horribly afraid of other people. I know for a fact that I will never be able to fully trust another person. That's been robbed from me. I wish I was able to repress my sexuality. I try to convince myself that I am asexual, but I know way too well that that isn't true.

It seems as though relationships have a "deadline". That there's a certain age where one is expect to have had at least one partner by. By the way people describe it, I've passed that age.

My death would mean nothing. Don't dare say otherwise. You don't know me, and if I were to die today, you wouldn't know. It would have no affect on you. You know nothing of me. Not what I look like, where I live. I can only promise that whatever you're imagining, I look much worse.
