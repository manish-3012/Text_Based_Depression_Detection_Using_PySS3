Suicide if I'm not pregnantI've suffered anxiety and depression throughout my life.  Ive tried many medications, along with therapy, self improvement, etc.  I'm usually very careful when it comes to sex, but I recently had unprotected sex for the first time in my decades of sexual activity.  I am so miserable, day in and day out, with no one who depends on me or needs me.  My parent and my long distance partner would miss me, but I think they might both be better without me.  My partner has a very busy, full life and I'm sure I only bring them down.  My parent holds off on living their life due to having to watch over me during my bad times.

If I take a pregnancy test and it's negative, I think I might kill myself.  No one needs me.  Anyone who misses me would get over it quickly.  I know a child doesn't need a fucked up parent, but at least I would feel like I have a reason to live, someone who I can take care of, someone who needs me - someone whose life I can better.  I didn't think of this before unprotected sex, but as time goes on, I see my life is basically forfeit due to mental illness.  If I am not pregnant, I think it might finally be a safe and secure time to end my life.  If I am pregnant, I feel like I would finally have the motivation, something to live for, someone who will love and need me.

I'm not sure how I'll do it.  I'd like to see my partner one last time, but maybe not.  Maybe it is just best this way.

It's sad.  No one would guess this about me.  I have a good education and I can usually fake happiness.  I just can't stand this pain.  With the psychologists and physicians, psychiatrists.. nothing is getting better.  I'm exhausted and only okay when I'm asleep.
