Will I be happier if I lower my expectations?I've been dealing with self esteem issues recently and it's been seriously fucking with my mental health. 

I used to be really ambitious and hopeful as a kid, then life did what it does and made me realize that nothing will happen the way that I want it to. That nothing will be easy. That everything and everyone will disappoint me at some point, and I won't even always be able to be mad at them because it's not always their fault. It's just the way things are.

I used to have a lot of hopes and dreams for myself and my life and I'm at the age where I'm seeing more and more doors close but not a lot open. I'm looking around at everyone else my age and they're all so hard working with plans for their future and I'm just not like that at all. 

I want to improve but I feel like it's just not going to happen. I'm not as great as I or anybody else thought I was. I can't help but wonder if I just accept that I'm a piece of shit and that life itself is garbage, my expectations will be so low that I'll be able to cope with the shittier aspects of life better and whatever sliver of good that does happen will actually make me happy, if even minutely.
