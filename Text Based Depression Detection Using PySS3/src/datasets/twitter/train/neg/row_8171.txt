Even if I did it, there wouldnâ€™t be anything remarkable people would say about me.In notable tragic young suicides, people say oh this person was brilliant and had so much talent and was able to accomplish so much in their short time on earth blah blah blah tortured artist, if only we could have seen their full potential it would have been great.

I donâ€™t even know what people would say about me. I have nothing to show for my time on earth.

â€œ[Lolipopp] was a nice person and fun to go to bars with. [Lolipopp] held down an office job and paid rent every month was but was never promoted at work. [Lolipopp] had an organized Netflix queue and always made plans to work on projects but never started them.â€

I feel like thatâ€™s the only reason Iâ€™m still here still. I donâ€™t feel like I can leave until my obituary at least has one goddamn accomplishment on it. I need to give people something to talk about me after Iâ€™m gone besides my alcoholism and mental health issues.
