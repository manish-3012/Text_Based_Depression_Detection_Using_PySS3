My anxiety is unbearable. I feel like I'd be better off gone.I have yet to tell anyone of my problems. I want to tell my family but my anxiety is telling me not to. All of the extra attention isn't necessarily something I want to deal with. And it'd make things so much more difficult. I think offing myself is the best choice and the urge is becoming stronger. I know I need help but I'm too afraid to get it. Depression and anxiety sure are a bitch.
