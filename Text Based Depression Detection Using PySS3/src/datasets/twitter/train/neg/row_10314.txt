Maybe Iâ€™ll actually get the help I needWe all know how shorty health care in USA is let alone mental health. First time in 10 years I felt a doctor really listened to me. I went to a walk in crisis center. I e been asking for weeks for help. My current doctor abandoned me (move out of state but said I could fly or drive back and they like â€œnoâ€). The place I was doing therapy out here canâ€™t get me a doctor until August. Iâ€™ll be dead or hospitalized by then

For once I have some hope. These doctors really spent tine to know me. Didnâ€™t rush me. Set up a new therapist and found a psychiatrist and made my appointments for a week and a half from now. 

My parents have been working so hard to help me. I donâ€™t want to end up in the psych ward again - Iâ€™ll make sure my next attempt works. Figured the police could help me with that pewpewpew. 

My mom found a recovery center that takes my insurance. Iâ€™m in such crisis I need to be hospitalized but the hospital is trauma in itself. This is like a house with all sorts of therapy that theyâ€™ll let me pick and choose. Iâ€™m supposed to go for 30-45 days. Iâ€™m intimidated. Overwhelmed. Scared. I can leave at anytime though. Itâ€™s not an institution.

10 years of medications and bullshit. Nothing works. I am going to kill myself if I donâ€™t get help. I think this will help. 

Iâ€™m scared. I donâ€™t want to be separated from my service dog (yes, they are in their legal right to not allow him to stay but heâ€™s allowed to come visit)

I canâ€™t stop crying. My service dog is going to think I abandoned him ðŸ˜­

Meds got me sedated right now. My brother has all my extra meds so I canâ€™t OD again. 

Thereâ€™s a flicker of hope but Iâ€™m scared. But if I donâ€™t do this Iâ€™m dead.
