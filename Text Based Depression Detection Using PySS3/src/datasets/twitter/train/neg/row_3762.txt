anyone else fantasizing about suicide?iâ€™m kinda drunk to cope but is anyone else thinking about intense and action packed ways theyâ€™ll commit suicide, like evading the law type shit, and the thrillingly depressing effect it will have on everyone. Idk probably just me but im insanely lonely. love you guys. we will get through this one way or another, and thats the truth. literally. we either get over it and get our life together, or we sewer slide.
