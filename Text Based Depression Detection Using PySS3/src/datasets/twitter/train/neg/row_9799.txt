I'm feeling the lowest I've felt in a while, and for a stupid reasonFeel like a two year old. I'm just jealous. You know why? I can't play a video game I want, because I don't have any money. All my friends have it.

If you read my past posts here, I was upset for fairly legitimate reasons. But not this time. I think I'm actually losing it. Why am I upset over something so stupid? I don't even understand my own brain. I just opened up the pill cabinet but there was nothing I could kill myself with.

I'm tired of me and my family never having any money. I can't pursue my hobbies. I'm tired of the job search. I'm tired my parents having to live paycheck to paycheck. Probably only because they have to support my dumb ass.

I'm fucking done, I'm gonna find something I can off myself with, if I'm this upset over something so stupid then I deserve to die
