Why is it considered wrong to want to opt out of life at a young age?Iâ€™m 19 years old and I have decided that this will be the last year I will be alive. I wonâ€™t live to see the year 2020. Why do others want me to prolong my suffering by wanting me to continue to stay alive? 

Iâ€™m killing myself and thatâ€™s final.
