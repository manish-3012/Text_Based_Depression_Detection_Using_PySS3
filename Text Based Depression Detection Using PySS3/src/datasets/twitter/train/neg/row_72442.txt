I don't know why I feel like thisI don't have enough trauma to really feel this bad,my siblings had it worse and they all got over it.My Trauna isn't all that bad,it's just some emotional stuff or things that I was too young to remember.I just dont see a point in living when you're either lonely or anxious about the person your with leaving you.When you feel like your unimportant and never growing up to be something.Im the reason my live is like that because I don't know how to act like a normal person.That box cutter has nearly been living in my mind and I've been seriously  considering finally doing it,writing a testament(sort of?),googling how to do it.I feel like just killing myself would hurt my family less than watching me grow up to be a disappointment.I just don't want to live like this anymore.
