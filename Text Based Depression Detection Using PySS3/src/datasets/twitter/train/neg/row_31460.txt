Was my birthday the other dayAnd all I did was lie, alone, in the floor all day and write a suicide note, on my phone. 

It was short and devoid of drama. Just some basic information. Not even really a goodbye. There's no point, anymore.

It's not my first. I've followed through before, but I never even got that right. 

I deleted the note. I tried to be happy. To make everyone else happy.

My arm's freshly bleeding, again. Like it so often is. It's not enough. I'm hollow and empty. Like I've always been. I feel nothing. Except that's not true. I feel something, I just can't describe it. Disappointment? Disgust? Sadness that I couldn't change and I couldn't fix things. That I could fix so many problems but never myself. 

But some things are too broken to ever put back together. And sometimes, it's just not worth taping them back in place, one last time. Sometimes, you know it's time to just let it go.
