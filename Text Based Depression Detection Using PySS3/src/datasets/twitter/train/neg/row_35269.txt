Endless cycle. Donâ€™t know how much longer I can take thisI keep having suicidal thoughts, then talk myself out of it because of how it would affect my mom and girlfriend and push thru for a couple days (i.e. lay in bed all day depressed and broke while my mom calls me a lazy piece of shit). Then the thoughts come back in a day or two. 

Just wanna join my dad. Jealous that he had the balls to do it.
