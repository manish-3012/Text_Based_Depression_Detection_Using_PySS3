I wanted to share an image.Are you afraid of what the face of suicide looks like?  Because she has won.  She has fooled you all and everyone.  How happy she looks in the photos with her then kids and husband?  How the happiest of times are captured through fishing, camping, hunting, and countless memories of the sort.  Are you distracted by all of this and more?  How cute her face is, how her smile brightens a room, or how her bright green eyes shimmer in the light?  How her life seems almost flawless, like a fairy tale but deep, deep down she has struggled to make it this far?  And then to purposely lose it all in self sabotage to finally have the courage to bite the bullet?  You'll never know.  What others are going through.  Their struggle of addiction.  Their struggle of self worth and self hatred, no matter what they are told.  No matter how much they are loved, self hate will win every time.  You'll never know how deep it is unless you're there in that deep dark hole.  Pray an angle will help pull you out.  Pray it is not too late.  Don't let the darkness consume you as it has me.
