am i going to die?i took 80mg of prozac...  im not willing to take the risk of never reaching my dreams.  if i stop now, will i wake up tomorrow?  i dont want to live...  im lightheaded now, im tired...  funny how no one tried to stop me...  please god, if you can hear me, let me die.

edit: i am now at 200mg...  should I tell someone yet?  should I write a note yet?
