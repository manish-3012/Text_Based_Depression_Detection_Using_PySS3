26 Ending it tonightI will walk out into the wilderness, have a few drinks and freeze.


quit my job, had a year long vacation and now I'm more sure of myself I have ever been.



I don't belong here, I'm a despicable racist, I believe WW1 was the downfall of western civilization and WW2 was the nail in the coffin, I'm disgusted by almost every aspect of modern society.


the subversive globalist have won, there is no going back, it's been downhill since the moonlanding, so I won't bother investing in children and a future.
Every day I spend on this earth I grow angrier, but there is nothing left to fight for. 

I'm very happy and excited about passing on. you should too be happy that the world will be a less hateful place without me :)
