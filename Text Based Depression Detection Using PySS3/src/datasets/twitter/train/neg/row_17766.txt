Back AgianI talked to my ex, seems like they really moved on and are way happier without me. I feel like everyone would be better off without me, my death would only cause temporary grief, I don't really care about how it effects others I just want to stop everything. I'm planning on purchasing a gun and quitting my job to go end it somewhere secluded.  I'm sorry if anyone that knows me see this.
