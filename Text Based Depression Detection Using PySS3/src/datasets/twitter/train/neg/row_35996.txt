I am not okay.I am not mentally fine, hence why I'll not ever deserve love. I am a burden, nothing else. In the state I am in, I should not be left alone at all, but at the same time, I cannot expect anyone to love me enough to keep me safe from myself, and I would die of guilt if I was to impose this on someone. I want to do it. I want to kill myself. I cannot believe in healing anymore or get in a normal or peaceful life after all that has happened to me. There is no solace for cunts.
