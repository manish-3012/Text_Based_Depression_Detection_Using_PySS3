Think Iâ€™m really going to do it this timeI want to die, my mind set is fucked. Iâ€™m lonely, unemployed and now failing my education... I canâ€™t escape this feeling I get motivated in short bursts and try to improve things but I always end up back in this place but worse and I keep getting closer and closer to doing it, I donâ€™t think I want to die more just not live like this, but itâ€™s like I get tunnel vision, I get fixated with ending my life.

when I was 18 I tried to end my life I took a bunch of pills a half arsed it and that just fucked with my brain, nothings been the same since I have massive amounts of anxiety and am spaced a lot of the time, I made a promise to myself that if I where to try to commit suicide again I will be serious about it and follow through,  I have moments of clarity maybe a month where itâ€™s like Iâ€™m the old me and I crush it but those moments are few and far between these days. 

Iâ€™m 21 now, I want to hang myself... but who really cares? Itâ€™s not like I have any positive effect on anyoneâ€™s life, I donâ€™t want to burden people with my stuff feeling empathy or sympathy for me is a waste. Idk what Iâ€™m doing anymore what is all this...
