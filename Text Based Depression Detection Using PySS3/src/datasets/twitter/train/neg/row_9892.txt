I want my pain to go away. I want it all to end.What is the point of living when you can't spent it with the person that you love, who makes you the most happy and who you would die for? What is the point of living when the person you care so much for doesn't care about you nearly as much? What is the point when you will never kiss nor even hug the person you love when she is standing right there? I don't think my life is worth living without her.. We could spent our lives together, raise a family together. Spent ever Christmas together. Love and support eachother. Be together until for eternity. I so wish my life could end tonight. But it won't... I can't commit suicide and I am not able to. Yet I want it all to end.
