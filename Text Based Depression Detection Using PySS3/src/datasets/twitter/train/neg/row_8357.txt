A bumpy road to recoveryI dunno what I'm really doing right now. It's 2 am and I just feel alone right now. I use to browse this subreddit everyday for months on end, cutting myself wanting to die. but after a brief moment of self realization just before an actually suicide attempt I decided to get help. I'm on medication now and reading.... or trying to read some books. when I say try I mean want to read but sorta avoid the idea of it. I've stop cutting everyday. Almost entirely until the other night in the shower. but far less than I use to. To be honest I dunno why Im typing this I guess just too keep my mind occupied from the loneliness tonight. I need help motivating myself to do stuff...
