My friends extremely depressed and I don't know what to doJust got off my pc at 1:30 am cause my best friend who's 15 gets drunk due to extremely severe depression and has in a drunken ramble talked about how his dad has abused him and how many times he's cut himself and how he often thinks about suicide and I don't know what to do because his dad has also tried to kill himself so he doesn't want to tell anyone because his mum still loves his dad and he's scared his dad might kill himself if he tried to get him in trouble for the abuse and them his mum would be sad and I have no idea what I'm supposed to say. He says he doesn't feel anything unless he's drunk or high and that he has a voice in his head that doubts everything he does.Hes been to multiple therapist who all have him antidepressants that didn't work so.What.The.Fuck do I do?
