I need helpI'm so incredibly low and broken. 
I want to hold my husband and tell him I love him.
I want to look in his eyes and tell him how much I care for him and want to be with him.
I don't think I can cope anymore and I have my plan in place I just need to get the courage. I've spoken to suicide helpline and my mental health team. I don't feel better. They told me to try and sleep and all I can so is cry. 
I'm at the end of my struggle because I either need a miracle to feel better sharpish which I doubt will happen. Or I'm just going to end it. I have nothing keeping me here any more. I just want to go to sleep and pass on. I am taking things hour by hour. My thoughts are breaking me. When will this torture end. September this year I will have been on antidepressants 20 years. I've lived longer on them than off them. I dont know who I really am.
