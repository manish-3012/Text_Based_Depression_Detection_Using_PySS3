Some helpful advice please :(My anxiety has gotten so bad, to the point where I spent this whole weekend in bed trying to sleep so that I didnâ€™t have to face the world. 
My ex recently broke up with me because of my anxiety, I was with him for 7 years. He got tinder straight away and had sex with someone a few days after I moved out. Itâ€™s almost like he couldnâ€™t wait to get rid of me. 
Since then Iâ€™ve been on a downward spiral, just anxious about all sorts of things and on a really destructive path. Doing things that are so out of character for me, I left my job, Iâ€™ve acted like a slag just to try and numb the pain of my ex doing the same thing, and Iâ€™ve just been a burden to my family. 
If anyone has any advice or has been through the same thing please talk to me as I donâ€™t know what to do. Itâ€™s the lowest Iâ€™ve ever been
