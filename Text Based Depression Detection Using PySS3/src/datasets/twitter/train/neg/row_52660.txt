People on this subItâ€™s funny how some peopleâ€™s problems seem more important than others due to the number of comments and upvotes- because some people get lots of downvotes. 
I almost feel like this place is just as cruel as the real world. 

And a lot of people want to kill themselves over material things when material things donâ€™t guarantee happiness yet these are the people that get the most comments and upvotes. While the people with real mental problems get downvoted. 

This place is whack
