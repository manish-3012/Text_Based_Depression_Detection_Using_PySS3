the feeling keeps coming backmore and more now i'm getting that idea to end it. been struggling with depression on my own for about 4 years now. when it started i hit many moments where i was determined to kill myself but never had the courage. eventually i wanted to make myself better so i distracted myself with other things. soon the suicidal thoughts went away and things were ok for a while. im at a new school now and ive been faced with more disappointments. im realizing my depression has destroyed all the work id done previously to become a sociable, motivated person. i cant quite relate to the people around me because i dont think like them anymore. ive never felt more unattractive and dumb than i do now and sometimes i feel like apologizing to others just for being present. i doubt things will really be better. i wake up every morning with the same old thoughts of wanting to die. help please
