i just really wanna dieI've never actually posted anything on reddit before and this will probably be my last, but hi, I've been suicidal for the past 8 or 9 months and the feeling gets worse and worse everyday and i don't know what to do anymore. i can't talk to anyone close to me because i don't want to burden them with this shit ya know so I've felt very alone. I'm just not happy, ever, i forget what it feels like to be happy and I've honestly been planning on killing myself on my 17th birthday. but, I'm pretty religious and I'm pretty sure god isn't very fond of suicide sadly, so I've been praying some freak accident happens so i wouldn't have to deal with that. but I'm reaching out to y'all maybe to gain some perspective i guess, cause my view of the world and myself is pretty bleak. so yeah.
