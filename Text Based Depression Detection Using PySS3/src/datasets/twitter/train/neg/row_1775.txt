I can't take it any longerI've been suicidal for months and therapy and medicine hasn't worked. Im starting a more intensive, partial hospitalization program on Monday, but every day is such agony, and I don't even think I can make it until then. I can't function. Nothing distracts me from my thoughts anymore. I keep trying to reach out to people but no one replies. Cutting isn't even helping me calm myself anymore. I have absolutely no hope and I have reached my end.
