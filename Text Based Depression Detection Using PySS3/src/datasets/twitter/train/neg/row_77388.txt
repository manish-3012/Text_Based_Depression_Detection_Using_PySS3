Dear self I hate you so muchI don't don't know why I am like this. Weak and I am afraid from every thing.i feel like I am not really here.i just hate myself so much,I hate the way I talk ,I look like, I think. Maybe I am doing this to get attention and really deep down I am a bad person.not only that,but I have been having suicide thoughts for a long time now,truth be told there were always there. Every time something,even the smallest things goes wrong I imagine myself dying. I can even feel what would be like. but then again I would be to scared to do it so I just hate  feeling like shit every day, without a purpose and being useless. I hope everyday something happens so I can die.what I feel even worse about I that I don't have big problems and I have family and friends that love me. This make me feel even worse. I just want, I don't even know what I want 
I just don't want to feel like this
