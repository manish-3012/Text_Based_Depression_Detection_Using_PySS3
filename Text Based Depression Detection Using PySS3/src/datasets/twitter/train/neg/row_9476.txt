humans are a fucking diseasei truly believe that we as humans are a fucking virus
a fucking abomination of flesh and bones
that was fucking created for NO fucking reason whatsoever
we are really selfish
most of us only care about ourselves
we all just go with life like a fucking rat in a wheel
running and running the same fucking cycle with no end
its so repititive 
and fucking boring
and i dont get it
why we strive to live(or the way most people think humans should do,no bitch some of us wants to die)

what the hell are we fighting for?
what greater purpose do we have?
other than eating sleeping fucking around working our asses for a meaningless paper
and the cycle returns again
we only hurt eachother
pain eachother
destroy the nature
hurt the animals
kill and rape eachother
destroy the air with gases from factories
ruin earth
fight over fucking stupid reasons
like religion
and beliefs
we are so fucking delutional for fighting over "whos right and whos wrong"
who the fuck are you or am i to decide what we do is wrong or right
here in my country they kill gays
trans and people who changed their religion
fucking isis am i right?
i fucking used to believe in god when i was younger
i was fucking naive from the ugly truth of this fucked up rat race
imagine putting up religion just for the sake of controling people
and that there is enternal hell if you didnt follow jesus or any other gods
im not saying that i know whats the truth about us humans and how we were created , im clueless just like you
im still wondering if there is a higher powerful being up in the sky
i seek truth with an opened mind
that is believing in every possible thing imaginable
may there is a higher being
may there is not
and even if there is 
it may be evil
it may be good
and not just some fucking retarted asshole whos claiming his religion and way of living is the only right and everyone is in the fucking wrong
thats not how things work
ya fucking idiots
we all fight for nothing
in the end 
we all rot away 6 feet underground
