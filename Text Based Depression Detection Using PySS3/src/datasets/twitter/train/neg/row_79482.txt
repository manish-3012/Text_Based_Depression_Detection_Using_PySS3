I want therapy, where do I even start?I don't know if I'm suicidal or not but this is the best place I could figure out to post this. Life has been a fucking drag lately and I can't motivate myself to do anythihng. I have no antidepressants or anything, life is just a day-to-day cycle of doing the absolute bare minimum to get by. I have wanted therapy for like a year now but have nobody to ask about it because my mother fears medicine and therapy like nothing else and my father is a wonderful man but absolutely clueless about these things. 

I want a therapist but I don't even know where to start. I haven't had a proper doctor's appointment in probably like three years now. I don't even know if my family's insurance (which I probably won't be able to be on for much longer) will allow me to get therapy. I've looked online, and all the "find a therapist" websites and junk just confuse me. They don't answer the simplest questions like what signing up for therapy consists of and it just makes me feel like a clueless idiot. I don't know physically where to go and my anxiety makes it too hard to just go to the clinic and ask or something.

tl;dr how do I even get a therapist as a 19 year old with no money and no help from my parents?
