I just want to die.I just want to die. I live with my parents.  Iâ€™m 34 years old. I have no job. I have no friends. I drove away the best person to ever had happened to me when I tried to kill myself 3 months ago. We still talk everyday but our friendship is different. It also doesnâ€™t help that Iâ€™m in love with him and heâ€™ll never want me. No one will ever want me. I just canâ€™t do this anymore. I feel so incredibly guilty too because my dad just had a heart attack and is all Iâ€™m so grateful to be alive. Here I am wanting to die because I hate myself so much and have nothing to live for. They tell me they donâ€™t want to deal with me anymore and I should be apologetic for my depression. I feel like I have no options. Nothing is ever going to get better. I just want to die. Solve everyoneâ€™s problems. No one has to deal with me no more. Iâ€™m just not sure when to do it because like I said my dad just had a heart attack and I donâ€™t want it to kill him.
