I can't wait to be deadI keep waiting for some accident or to not wake up one morning, but I'm getting impatient.

I'm done.

My family doesn't care about me, I have no really friends, and my boyfriend just threw me out like trash. I'm completely worthless to everyone who means the most to me. I don't want to go on a single day more. I'm sick of crying and throwing up from getting myself so worked up. I've never felt heartbreak or pain like this.
