Please help meI've had depersonalization for almost 4 months now after a marijuana induced panic attack. It's been chronic 24/7 with no moments of clarity. I've done all of the following: regular exercise, healthy diet, socializing, no caffeine and sugar, staying sober, and i've been taking college classes. But nothing seems to be working, i feel like an alien on Mars and I'm tired of feeling this way. I'm literally living for the sake of existence. Advice?
