Painless suicide methods.Iâ€™m just ready to not be alive anymore. There is nothing for me in this life. Iâ€™ve struggled with the thoughts of suicide and wanting to die for almost 16 years. Thatâ€™s like 46-47 percent of my life. Iâ€™ve always held off for the most part hoping things would get better. But the truth is it wonâ€™t. I mean things will get better for a little but no matter what they always fall
back to shit and Iâ€™m tired of the cycle. Having clinical Depression and fighting a mental battle almost everyday has taken its toll. And if Iâ€™m being honest I fucked up tremendously and am stuck dealing with someone and their family(mafia) forever. By the way Iâ€™m Black and this is not acceptable to them. I am constantly watched all the time and my phone is tapped. I literally canâ€™t get away from them EVER. I hate everything about this person and her family. But again even if I left theyâ€™d still be there. This just compounds my Depression and want for my life to end because I am stuck with these people forever. And with me feeling like a failure in life and my inability to get out of my own way along with having no love for myself I just canâ€™t take life anymore. So whatâ€™s a great way of ending my life quick and hopefully painless?
