Yeah.Posting here because of the anonymity and it lets me get this out there. I've been depressed for several years, I'm gonna go with 6. It has fluctuated, but it's always been there. These last 5 months it got pretty bad, culminating in me trying to OD about 3 weeks ago. My girlfriend followed suit on Thursday, and it hasn't helped my mindset. She would've died, had I not realized what she did. I feel like shit constantly now, failing at suicide, feeling like I should've done more for her before she attempted, emptiness, and constant suicidal thoughts. I'm taking antidepressants, but they don't do anything for me. I'm probably going to try again, and succeed, before school ends. I can't do this shit anymore, and no one cares anyway.
