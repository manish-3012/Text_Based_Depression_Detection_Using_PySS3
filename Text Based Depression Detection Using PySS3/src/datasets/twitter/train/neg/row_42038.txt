I wanna hurt myself because I can't find a partnerNo, it's not a recent breakup. I've been single for 3 years and I'm always pegged as the "sister"/"buddy". I got a minor stroke today and the nurse told me I was lucky nothing more happened, but frankly I didn't care. I'm not sure I wanna kill myself, but I don't know if I care that someone as unlovable as me would die.
