They said this subreddit was supposed to help me. I've never had that happen to me.I don't understand the point of coming here. One person gives their story that is similar to yours, another person tells you that you have no reason to feel this way, and someone religious person comes in and tells you that you're going to heaven. I don't know what I'm looking for when I come here. Maybe I'm wasting my time here and in this life and should have died long ago.
