havent felt this way before but im donei recently got a test score that was the lowest ive ever gotten. it might sink my grade to where I fail and cant graduate. my professor said I was fine, I was happy, then he graded my test and I did so badly it might not be good any more.

i dont really feel like typing a lot but im just so tired of this stress. i am under so much pressure and it feels like im constantly unlucky. many people failed this test but not as badly as I did. im just tired of it. im older than a lot of people in college and i need to start making money. i have to move back home until i graduate which was fine until now it might get pushed back.

i have been having a panic attack all day and i really just cant stop it
