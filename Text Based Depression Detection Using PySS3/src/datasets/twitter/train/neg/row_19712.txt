im on the brink of suicide because im transgender.If I had just been born in the right body, I would be ok. I wouldn't cry every night. I wouldn't cut. I wouldn't have issues with intimacy. I wouldn't be afraid to use the bathroom in public. I just want to have a fucking dick instead, that's fucking IT. NOTHING ELSE. I just want that. i'm not nearly old enough for phalloplasty and a lot of places don't cover trans healthcare, so i'm fucked. I can't take it. i've been a failure since birth, I should be dead. I'm really only here for my best friend, cece. I hope she doesn't see this, she would know who I was immediately. I'm tempted to cut my wrists and show it as a cry for help, but I can't go to a ward because of covid, and I really need it, I JUST WANT A PENIS, WHY CANT I JUST BE NORMAL??? I just want to be a normal fucking kid, not some mentally ill moron who can't fucking do anything because they're a moron.... I can't take it anymore..
