Progressing from Depressed to SuicidalI have been managing my depression for the past few years and prior to this I have never considered suicide as an option and have never been involved in self harm.

Recently things have changed.  Most days I consider how I would kill myself, I just don't think my existence has any meaning.  I am one person in one moment of time.  I just cant see any reason to spend the remainder of my life in pain when my contribution to the world is so insignificant.  I'm so sick of hearing that things will get better and that I should be happy, I'm tired of waiting for things to get better.
