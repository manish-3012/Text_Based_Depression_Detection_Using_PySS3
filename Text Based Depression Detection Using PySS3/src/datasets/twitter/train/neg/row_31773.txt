It's back.It's been months ago since I seriously thought of ending my life. I've been depressed for more than 5 years but I never bothered to get myself solutions until recently, which was 6 months ago. I went to therapy for about 2 months but I had to stop due to logistical reasons. I found a replacement therapist but I cancelled my appointment the last minute. I thought I was getting better -- I'm going out more often, I'm more willing to meet and trust new people, I'm starting to like myself again, I'm functioning like _normal_. But I viewed everything through rose-colored glasses. I'm not getting better. I didn't get any progress. I didn't gain friends. I've built this delusion of belongingness and family that I thought I've steered away from the demons in my head. They're still here. They never left and I just made things worse. I hate myself. My _friends_ are better off without someone like me in their life. The world is infinitely a better place without me in it. The voices are back and I just want them to stop.
