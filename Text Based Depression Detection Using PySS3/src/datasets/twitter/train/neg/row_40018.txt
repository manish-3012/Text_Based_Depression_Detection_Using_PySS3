23(F) My birthday is in a week and I will be spending it alone. I feel like I can't go on as the way things are.My whole life has been and is pain. I have bi polar, borderline personality disorder, depression and PTSD.  

  I was abused throughout my childhood. Then my mom died when I was 18. Soon after my whole family pretty much disowned me because Mom left me a little money I used for college.  

I have few friends (1-3 I talk to long distance), and feel utterly alone. My former best friend talked me into moving out of state with her so I did but we are no longer friends due to her backstabbing me. Now I'm stuck in this state alone with few friends that I barely see.  In a week I will be 24 and will be spending my birthday alone in this new state.

I work 65 hours a week and go to school fulltime. I try so hard everyday to be brave and to stay strong but my depression eats at me. Everyday I realize that "I'm all alone with no one who loves me and I'm in this new state by myself."  I have already tried to end my life last year and feel my suicidal thoughts raging back up. I have never known true love, I have never known true consistent happiness. My life is pain and after 24 years of pain, I feel like the end is near. My pain is too dee
