Really don't think it gets better-I really tried to get better, I really wanted to be happy, I wanted to not care what others thought about me and I could live a happy life
But I can't.
Every time something little happens, I cut my wrists and spiral down so much, and today I noticed they're not quick little cuts they are getting deeper and that should worry me but it doesn't
I really don't care, nothing works, I know I'm young and have a whole life ahead of me but I don't think I can cope with being this sad over and over again.
All I want to do is cry, cut and sleep
I try seeking professional help and it doesn't work, and every day my mind is telling me to kill myself, I honestly don't know how long it'll be before I try to take my life again.
