It won't get betterHi there

I'm nearly 30 years old and have depression at least for 10 years. I have no idea why I'm writing this. My father died when I was a kid and that was the time my life was ruined. At this point in my life, I am okay with that. I found new friends and was getting over it. It's okay, I guess. As soon as I moved out of my home, I had this strange feeling that I'm worthless and lonely. Many times I think that I would do everyone around me a favour and just kill myself.

I saw a doctor about that and she gave me some medication, but it didn't help a bit. 99&amp;#37; of my day consists of suicidal thoughts. I can't concentrate on talking to people anymore. It's like I'm a ghost. I'm a fucking nightmare to everyone else. Everytime I have some illness I hope that I have so serious shit going on, so I can refuse to be treated and die (no matter what the pain is).

I feel like everyone around me is happy and I'm some piece of shit that people tolerate.

This shit is killing me. I can't even have a proper relation with a woman, because I'm so fucked up. Every day it gets worse and worse. My family is the only reason I don't kill myself right now, but I'm not sure how long that will last.

Usually I hate when people mention this on the internet, but I'm kind of drunk. This might be the reason I'm writing this little text. Why do I have to suffer this much? In my whole life I tried to be a good person as best as I can. Life isn't going to thank me for that. Why is life fucking me so hard? I don't think that there is any kind of justice in life.

At this point I don't think that it will get any better. But do I have to live my life in pain just because I don't want to hurt anybody?

Sorry if my english isn't proper due to being a german.

Thanks for reading.
