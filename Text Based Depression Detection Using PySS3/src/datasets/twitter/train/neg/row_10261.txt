Hey guysNew here, just found it. I hate sob stories, and pity. I even hate explaining how I hate sob stories and pity.

I sit here at my desk, a few assignments away from finishing my first semester of school at 25. I thought it was an accomplishment when I started. Iâ€™m on my 7th beer I think.

I canâ€™t stand the ramblings that go on in my head. I donâ€™t want to die, but I keep imagining a bullet taking away that part of my brain responsible for those ramblings. Itâ€™s silly, I know. But what if a bullet could go through, leaving everything else untouched, and remove the part of my brain that causes my issues. I always like to imagine it as a lump of fuck just sitting in my brain, as if it could be removed in one fell swoop. 

I havenâ€™t shot my gun in a couple of years. I donâ€™t even know if it would fire. I donâ€™t intend to find out, but the thought of it doesnâ€™t scare me as much anymore. 

I donâ€™t really feel the need to be loved any more than I currently am. Iâ€™m not sure what it is Iâ€™m trying to get away from, and I think thatâ€™s what irritates me the most.
