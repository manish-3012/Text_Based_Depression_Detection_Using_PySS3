I need help Iâ€™m scaredI need help because Iâ€™m afraid that I might hurt myself. Iâ€™m 13 and I have knives in my closet and Iâ€™m afraid I might use them. I need someone to talk to because I feel like Iâ€™m worthless and no one wants me. Yesterday, I walked around asking people to sign a petition that said I sucked and I filled both sides of the paper and Iâ€™m scared of dying. I recently met someone who I really thought cared, so I talked a lot about suicide around them but I couldnâ€™t bring myself to actually ask for help. But here I am now, I know Iâ€™ll regret this in the morning but I need to do this. The person I talked about, I thought I might be annoying them so Iâ€™ve stopped talking to them. I feel like a worthless piece of trash and I want to die. None of this makes since but all I know is thereâ€™s cuts on my arms and my wrists are hurting and Iâ€™m scared. Please help.
