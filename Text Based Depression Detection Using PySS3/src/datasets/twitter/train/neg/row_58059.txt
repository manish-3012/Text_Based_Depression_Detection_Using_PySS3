Wonder why i even fucking exist sometimes..My life is never gonna get better, i'm a stupid lonely miserable sack of absolute fucking shit incapable of changing. It's always gonna be the same deal every morning; wake up, feel like shit, mask my feelings, talk to some worthless ass people on social media that wouldn't piss on me if i was on fire and then go talk to some worthless ass therapist that spouts the same old tiresome cliche inane feel good hippy nonsense "Take your meds and all will be fine with you" "
Think positive, be positive blah blah blah " and then go home, sulk in my room all day because i'm a talentless dumbfuck with no hobbies or skills and constantly beat myself up about how much of a fuck up i am. For a 17 year old, i sure seem to fit all the characteristics adults constantly used to slander me with which at first i thought was stereotypical patronizing bullshit but maybe they were right after all. I was just too arrogant and full of myself to realise that i'm not cut out for this world and im better off dead whether my family likes it or not i mean they should *JUST* owe up to the fact that im a fuck up in the gene pool and my life is a bigger joke than Donald Trump running for president so i can just kill myself with no regrets and get peace from all this emotional shite. Oh yea did i mention the so called "friends" i have don't give a flying fuck about me at all? Im too dependent and i can't let go of them because im a socially awkward anxious mess incapable of making anymore so im stuck with these cunts and myself. Yup Just me and my mind telling me how much of a complete failure i am. Gr8. 

 Fuck it im done
