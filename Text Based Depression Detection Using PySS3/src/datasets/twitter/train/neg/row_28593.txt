This is too much. No more ranting or tearing myself to bits, just need to will myself into doing it.I just hate taking up others' time with my petty problems. I've failed at everything in life, and i hope i manage to succeed in this. I can do it. No other goal remains. Goodbye all, and thanks for everything.
