Iâ€™m not sure what to doI have no where else to go so I turned to this subreddit. I have lost trust in everything and started doubting everything. My two best friends started dating (itâ€™s actually been a while and I still feel shit. Shows how crazy I am) and I was the last to know. I talked to them everyday and spilled everything yet they kept something like this from me and I feel betrayed. I know this problem is superficial and like everyone says Iâ€™m just being a drama queen but that doesnâ€™t change the pain I felt. I had problems trusting from the beginning and now Iâ€™m doubting everything. I started isolating myself then actually took a step forward to open up to one of my friends. They were supportive and listened to everything and yet they wondered why it was such a â€˜big issueâ€™ and I get it, Itâ€™s not a big issue and itâ€™s nothing so why am I feeling this bad?? I started doubting them too. I lost the courage to talk to them or anyone. Iâ€™m sick of feeling like shit and Iâ€™m sick of the pain. This whole situation just made me feel more worthless than I already did which is surprising hahaha. No one cares so why should I? My feelings donâ€™t mean anything and Iâ€™m nothing. Honestly Iâ€™m just the problem, everyone else is happy and itâ€™s only affecting me this way. Is it bad I just want to end it all?

To whoever took their time to read this thank you.
