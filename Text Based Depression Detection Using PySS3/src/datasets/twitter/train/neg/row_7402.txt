Today I did the right thingI talked to my mother and I talked to the only friend I have.

I was lying to them for years, I've been depressed for a decade.

Talking to people here and on other sites eased me into talking with people I care about even if there are only two left.

Thanks to people here I found a therapist online that I could be comfortable with and with his help dissected myself.  
Now I know what makes me get up in the morning and how I function.

I've been sober for almost a month, in a week I am starting a new job.

I don't feel good or bad, but I know that I did the right thing and I know why I did it.

I am in control and that is what I wanted to thank you guys for.
