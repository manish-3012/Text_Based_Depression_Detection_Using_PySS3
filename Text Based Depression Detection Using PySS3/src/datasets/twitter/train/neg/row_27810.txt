I just want it to enddddI feel like such a mess. No matter how hard I try I can never stop my upcoming BPD phases. I always manage to cut off anyone close to me. Itâ€™s always such a vicious cycle. I canâ€™t feel anything. I was forced to eat today and every bite was absolutely nauseating. Eating hurts so much to the point I wanna cry. I just want to disappear. Probably when I get home Iâ€™ll cut myself I wanna feel hurt. Itâ€™s the only thing I can understand. Iâ€™m writing this an nothing makes any coherent sense but it doesnâ€™t matter if Iâ€™ll die anyway
