I am going to kill myself in way to make it look like I died of natural causesI don't care about anyone or anything anymore. My friends, family. I have lost complete empathy of even caring. Whatever moments of happiness I have ever experienced were just cognitive lies... an illusion conjured up by my mind to shield me from the reality that is this pointless existence. There is no pleasure in helping people. There is no pleasure in even helping myself. Everything is just pointless unless there is a will to exist. As I am convinced of that truth, this cycle of pain and pleasure...it has to stop. And I will make that decision.

I have the means to kill myself painlessly in a way it will seem like I died of natural causes. So I will not leave a suicide note. This is to ensure I do not shock my friends and family and shatter their reasons for living and happiness in this pointless existence of reality.
