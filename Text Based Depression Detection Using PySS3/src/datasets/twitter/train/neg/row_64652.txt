My anxiety makes me walk and move weird/scary (freaks people out)When I am super anxious my entire body goes rigid and I am frozen in fear. Itâ€™s as if every person is staring at every single part of my body and Iâ€™m afraid to move, especially turning my head. I focus on every person in the room (I canâ€™t help it, itâ€™s what my brain decides to focus on) in relation to what theyâ€™re thinking about my movements. 

This results in me walking â€œroboticâ€ and quickly glancing/scanning the room out of the corner of my eye instead of looking up and at people (I am afraid to make eye contact). I move slowly and un-freely (if that makes sense), paying attention to everyone around me. I make weird facial expressions and look pissed off, but in reality itâ€™s just terror in my eyes from other people. My walk and movements have been described as â€œscaryâ€ and â€œfreaks people outâ€. I hear people talk behind my back when my anxiety is at its peak about these things. Iâ€™m the kid they jokingly say will shoot up the school, despite being the most harmless person. 

Does anybody else relate to this? I donâ€™t think I am made to live in this world. Iâ€™ve been battling and trying to distract myself from everything through schoolwork and make my mark there but nobody accepts who I am. In the end Iâ€™m have no friends, im not compatible with people, Iâ€™m burn out. I just want to fucking die every second of the day
