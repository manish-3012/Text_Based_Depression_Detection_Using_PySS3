Feel like I've completely destroyed my body and life to the point of no return.I'm 22 years old and have lived a very sheltered life. I would say I've been suffering from depression for the last 4 to 5 years and it's led to all kinds of problems, social anxiety, ocd, etc. I've not achieved much academic success because of this and still haven't ever had a real life relationship. I don't feel any sort of joy or drive in my life. I've been numb as long as I can remember.

I started taking prozac a month or two ago for my OCD especially and I think it's helped. However now I'm googling and seeing the side affects of long term SSRI usage and I'm afraid of ruining my brain. I'm already afraid that my brain has already been completely destroyed irreversibly due to the depression i've suffered for years and lack of exercise/poor nutrition.

Does anyone else have any suggestions? Is it possible to come back? I've always held out hope I could overcome this, however if I've blew my body and life already, there's no point in living, right?
