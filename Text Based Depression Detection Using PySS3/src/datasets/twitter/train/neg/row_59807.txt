I don't know what's wrong.This is my first post here. I'm not really sure where to start. I feel empty all the time. I feel like if I were to die no one would care, not even my family. I mean, I guess they care about me but I don't know. I have friends and a girlfriend, but even when I'm with them I still feel a little empty. I put on a mask when I go to school, and when I'm with friends/girlfriend. Recently I've had suicidal thoughts and even though I don't think I'll act on them, I still feel like I'd be better off dead. I don't even know where I'm going with this. I just needed to write it out. 

I'm writing this a little later than the above part. The thoughts keep getting louder. I feel like everyone is using me and that no one actually cares about me. I don't know what the fuck to do, and to be completely honest, I almost want to do it. I have nothing to live for, my life has no direction, no focus, I have no goal. I'm questioning my God, my family, my girlfriend, even my best fucking friend. I don't know what to do.
