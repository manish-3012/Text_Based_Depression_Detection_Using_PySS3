Overdosed, went to hospital, put on suicide watch, three days laters and i'm feeling like shit and puking my guts. Still want to die.Hello, i'm not sure if i can put this here but just a couple days ago i took 8-10 naproxen and was sent to the hospital. I felt completely fine. They took my blood and everything and i promised not to do it again (lol i dont believe that myself). Then i started feeling horrible yesterday. Really horrible. My gastric region hurt so bad, I can't eat anything. Food is disgusting to me. And i slept the whole two days. Feeling awful. I wake up this morning feeling awful, and then i have to puke. So i did. It was horrific, the taste of the disgusting naproxen, the nasty color, the reminder of why i dont wanna be here. my nana had to hold my hair and pat my back and i told her why i tried killing myself; because i'm nothing. I felt like a penny that's left on the ground. Nobody wants it because it's useless. 

I dont know why the meds didnt start automatically working after i took them all. It took it about a day and a half to kick in.

My mom is bringing me to the hospital. But I still feel suicidal and i dont know if i should let them bring me to a mental hospital. I dont know what to do, i regret taking the pills but I still don't wanna be here...
