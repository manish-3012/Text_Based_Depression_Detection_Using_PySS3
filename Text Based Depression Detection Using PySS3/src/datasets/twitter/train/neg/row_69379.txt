helpHonestly at this point, I donâ€™t even know what to do anymore. Ever since late elementary, Iâ€™ve always thought of suicide periodically, but recently it has gotten worse. I know that realistically speaking my death will have an impact on my parents due to how hard they tried to raise me and I would also likely cause a massive shitshow for my high school, given how most handle incidents like these.  

Simply put, I just want to kill myself off in a silent way that affects as little people as possible. 

But I would like more is to have real friends who donâ€™t laugh at me every single day or simply just exhibit some competence for anything. But thatâ€™s never gonna happen.

Iâ€™m was born to be a punching bag, and yet I really donâ€™t like to get hit. Iâ€™m a wuss and a coward, which probably makes this a good riddance.
