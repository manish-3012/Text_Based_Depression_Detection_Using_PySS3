Does ODâ€™ing on Xarelto hurt?Iâ€™m a 30 year old who just finished cancer treatment but honestly I donâ€™t have the will to keep going. My girlfriend of 10 years was going behind my back when I was in chemo and talking with some other dude. She currently has blocked my number and me on all social media. I guess weâ€™re just over. Iâ€™m at a pretty low point  in my life and this just adds icing to the cake. 

Iâ€™m surrounded by shitty toxic people. My sister abuses the state for unemployment, my mom constantly bitches and my dads in Lala land. Iâ€™m just tired of it and donâ€™t want to deal. Iâ€™m a little upset the cancer didnâ€™t do me in. I prayed it would but my friend told me I wasnâ€™t that lucky. I have an extra goal of blood thinners from when treatment started. Do you think it would hurt? I donâ€™t have the balls to do something drastic, but i think taking the vial of pills would be easy and get the job done. 

Iâ€™m tired of it all. I want it to end.
