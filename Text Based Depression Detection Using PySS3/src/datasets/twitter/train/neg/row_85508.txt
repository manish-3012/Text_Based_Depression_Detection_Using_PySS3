Do you ever get "stuck"? It creeps up on youI've been going about my life just like normal, and everything's been fine for a while. But I'm getting stuck and it's creeped up on me. 

I looked at myself today and I hadn't done homework in a week, I've watched 16 hours of Netflix in the past three days, all of my meals lately have been delivered, I've been wearing sweatpants, the dishes are piled up, my room is a mess, I haven't done my laundry, and I haven't spoken to my friends or seen my boyfriend in days. 

It's crazy how much of a mental switch it is going from "fine" to "not fine", I thought about cutting for the first time in MONTHS today. So that's good because it used to be every day but it's bad because it's today. 

I have a project due tomorrow at 8am that I'm going to fail with a professor whose opinion I really care about. What's weird is all of this was triggered by a really positive impact on my life, I wound up getting the internship I've been working towards for the past year. But in doing that I sort of lost interest in living my actual life, and now I'm Stuck. 

Does anyone have tips for getting unstuck? Or just a hug I'll take a hug
