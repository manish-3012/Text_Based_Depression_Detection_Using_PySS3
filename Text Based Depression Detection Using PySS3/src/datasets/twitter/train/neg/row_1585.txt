Revenge Suicide?Honestly I think I'm *broken* as a person. I remember when I was maybe 5 or 6, I would wake up and be excited that everyone was already wake, and I could go watch teenage mutant ninja turtles. My Dad and Mom divorced when I was in third grade, and I think this is where all of this started.
 
Things are different being a 31 year old, living in a 3rd floor apartment.
 
**Current Situation :**

*I have no job, I got fired for getting a phone number from a new girl that started, I work in IT so I had access to the employee info. (I asked her very respectfully if I could take her out for lunch)

*I kicked out my girlfriend right before Christmas because she was talking to some other person. (Honestly she was a mean snappy person anyways, that didn't appreciate me, but I enjoyed having someone to be there for me, even if she was a distraction of how I felt inside. It made me feel better knowing that I was helping her get her life on track again.)

*My Dad and I don't talk very often, and when we do he's always asking for help fixing his computer or getting his groceries (I live 2 1/2 hours away from him)

*My Mom is very stubborn, never really can ask or talk about deep down - about feelings or how she really feels about things.

*I had been on Prozac (8 months) and then changed to Cymbalta (took that for about 3 months) and I just weened off about 30 days ago. I wanted to get off of it because it generally made me that I didn't care about consequences (probably had something to do with messaging the girl about a lunch date).

I've noticed I'm easily irritated, generally down , and have been staying up til 4 am. 

**I sometimes think that if would be satisfying, to break-in to my old job, and shoot myself in the cube of the girl that got me fired.**

I suppose I'm just looking for some help or input on what I should focus on, or should I go back and ask for some other anti-depressant? Any feedback would help, thank you for reading.
