I don't even know why I still feel like killing myselfI got a job

Im definitely not poor, I'm not rich either, but you know, I can afford things I want

I am sociolizing a bit, I still feel lonely as hell but you know, I'm still talking with ppl and I'm slowly getting over that

I was literally spoiled a lot as a kid

Yet I want to fucking blow my head off

I just don't get it, financially I'm ok, socially, could be better, but I'm slowly getting better.

Before I didnt shoot myself because I was thinking I couldn't do it because of my family, but I have reached a point where I seriously just don't give a fuck, I'm trying to hold on, but literally nothing I fucking do helps

RN I feel like nothing is gonna save me from the self hate, relationships romantic or platonic, drugs, alcohol,

 iv been trying to distract myself by over working myself listening to music to tune out the voice in my head, playing videogames, and it works, drinking but it's only temporary, then I just go back to wanting to kill myself

I haven't tried therapy IRL, but I did do it online, and nothing... I just feel like I could either skip to the end  of live a miserable life

At this point, I'd take an eternity of hell over my life on earth
