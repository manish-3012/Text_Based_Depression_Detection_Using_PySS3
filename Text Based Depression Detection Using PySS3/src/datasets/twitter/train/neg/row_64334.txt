I canâ€™t continue living like thisI constantly think about dying. How it would honestly be a reprieve from my daily life. 

I live in constant pain (physical, emotional, and psychological). 

I have been massively depressed for the past three months to an extent I didnâ€™t think was possible, probably even more depressed than I was the last two times I attempted suicide. 

I have anxiety attacks on a daily basis. I can only sleep for about 30 minutes before waking up from the pain caused by my herniated discs, along with all of my joints. 

I have nobody to talk to about any of this. My current financial situation makes it impossible for me to see my therapist, and when Iâ€™ve tried to talk to friends about it they just tell me â€œitâ€™ll get better with time.â€ 

Iâ€™ve been thinking about making a third attempt for awhile now. I just thought I would reach out before doing anything rash.
