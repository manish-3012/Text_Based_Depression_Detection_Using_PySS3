I'm holding a knife in my hand and I wish I had the courage to make it all stopThe worst part about being a teenager is that your feelings aren't validated. Anger is a stereotype and being upset is just a reason for people to put you down. You can't be sad because then you're an edgelord. You can't defend yourself because then you're disrespectful. I feel so unheard and there's nobody that will believe me just because my fucking age is under 20. I want anything to make me feel something but I guess I'm just in a phase that'll pass or at least that's what my parents say since they're in denial that anything can be wrong with me. I wish I wasn't so scared of pain so I could just kill myself.
