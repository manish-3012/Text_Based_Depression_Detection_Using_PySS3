Sad. Should go to the hospital but won't.Well. Last night I was feeling awful so I took some tylenol sleep aid and 2mg of clonzepam. Not that bad and it wasn't to kill me obviously. Just to fall asleep right away and ignore the world. It worked well but when I woke up I was extremely dizzy. 

Okay that's pointless backstory. I just really want to kill myself. More than ever before. Today seems like a great day. I have no money, my house is a mess, and all my friends are 1000s of km away. No one would even notice for a few days. I'm so tired of being alive. Dealing with this is unfair, and I'm done. Of course I can't kill myself because ODing on drugs is awful and I'd probably just throw up. 

Why is being alive so impossible and cruel. 

In case you're wondering, the reason I'm on the edge right now is because some girl I'm good friends with went on a date last night. I don't know why I care, I don't like her like that. But it made me so upset and jealous. And to top it off, she kept it a secret from me because she knew it would upset me. 

I shouldn't be alive. I don't deserve to be and I don't want to be. 

EDIT: umm hi guys. No clue if anyone will see this, but I'm alive don't worry. I'm honestly so surprised so many people messaged me and commented. I appreciate it a lot. I'm feeling a bit better but every day is a struggle. I guess yesterday was just too much. Thanks again.
