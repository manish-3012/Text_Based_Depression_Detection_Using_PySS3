Some people aren't meant to be happyFor the past few months I've been feeling pretty decent. I was making some progress. Things were looking better for me after a really rough time and the dream of being happy was looking achievable.  Then out of nowhere something bad happens. I'm completely destroyed and back to editing my suicide note. I guess some people aren't meant to be happy... Life can be really cruel some times.
