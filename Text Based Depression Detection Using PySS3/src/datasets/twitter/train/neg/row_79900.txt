I don't want to play the victim. My mind is always in a jumble.I'm going to keep this short. I need someone to talk to. I've been to psych units/jail before, all relating to alcohol. I'm supposed to check into a mental health hospital tomorrow but I'm scared and have been flip flopping on the idea all day. I live with a family of substance abusers. My brother came home again around noon (my only friend and provider of alcohol) with a bottle as usual and of course I drank again. We have a weird love/hate relationship dynamic. He's my only friend but he has problems himself and I only feel empty after talking to him. I try to express myself and he only responds in anger. I can't take this dissonance much longer.
