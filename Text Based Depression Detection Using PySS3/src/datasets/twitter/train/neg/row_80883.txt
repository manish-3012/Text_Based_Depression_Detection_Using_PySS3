I feel so empty.I don't understand why me? Why do I have to deal with OCD, depression, anxiety, perfectionism, eating disorder, and a toxic family? What have I done to deserve this? I'm just so empty. I'm stressed every day, I'm grinding myself to the bone just to keep my job. I keep getting the same reviews "slow down. check your work", they never give me examples of the 'little mistakes' I'm making. If they don't tell me, how can I improve? I'm getting the ex's out of my boss today, but I just fantasized about sending them a letter - a suicide letter. an email basically saying:

&gt;I will not be in tomorrow, or ever again, if you're reading this - then I have killed myself an hour ago.

SOmething like that. 

But I don't _really_ want to die. I don't want to hurt my SO that way, or anyone else that actually gives a shit about me.

I just feel like I'm drowning, all the time.


It's not fair.

It's so tiring just to go day to day pretending I'm not drowning, pretending I have my shit together, pretending that I'm _okay_. I'm not okay. Therapy helps, but then after the session ends its back to square one in a few days.

**UPDATE** I just wrote a suicide note to my boss, not going to send it because i'm not going to kill myself, but...it was slightly cathartic in a way. I don't know why, maybe just admitting in writing that I'm *not* okay and that I *am* drowning helps? This was my first attempt at writing a note....It feels surreal and strange. Especially knowing I'm not actually going to end my life, but just suffer with passive suicidal ideation...My therapist has said my most immediate issue and threat is self-harm though. My chest hurts, I'm anxious, my stomach is in knots, and i just feel so...empty
