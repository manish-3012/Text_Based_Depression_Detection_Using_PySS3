gunshot or a falli think iâ€™m gonna do it soon, probably in the next month or two, just because i have some stuff to take care of first, people to say goodbye to, music iâ€™ve wanted to listen to, etc. i just donâ€™t know which one would be quicker and less painful. iâ€™ve held a gun to my head quite a few times but iâ€™m always too scared to pull the trigger, i think if just stepped off a building itâ€™d be easier. i donâ€™t really know anymore, but i know itâ€™ll be over soon and the pain is gonna stop.
