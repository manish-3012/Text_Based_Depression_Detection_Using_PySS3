It feels like everything has fallen apartI have to put all of this into words, as messy as they may be, because it has been building up for so long. Everything feels pathetically awful. Things I have been working on for years that I am still absolutely worthless at â€”Â instruments, sports, subjects. How could I be so pitifully stupid and incompetent? I am a poor friend, I'll never be an adroit leader, I'll never get into university. I have no interesting defining traits. Everyone knows I am an unintelligent, hopeless person. I can't be relied on, I panic. I break down and cry almost every day. I can't put on a facade of having it all together, so I selfishly cry and cry and exude these negative emotions onto others. I am not a good sibling nor daughter. I will never get anywhere in life. I don't perform well at school, I will never get a job. I am white, living on unceded land. I am no help to the community. I contribute nothing of value. I wish I could cease existing, but most of all, I wish I never existed in the first place. I take up space, I'm awful, I'm awful, I'm awful. I take up resources that would be better given to others. Why am I here? I should never have come into existence. Better never to have been. I wish time would stop so that I could reassess things and get things back on track or at least get rid of myself but time doesn't stop and everything is much too entangled to bear. I don't know what to do with myself. When will I get a grip? Never. And I don't even deserve a good life, so why do I whine about it? That's disgustingly self-absorbed. I'm a horrible, horrible person. Even writing this â€”Â what am I doing? Polluting the online world, leaving a footprint. I am such a waste of space. I hate myself.
