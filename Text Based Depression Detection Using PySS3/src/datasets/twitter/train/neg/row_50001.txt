I'm wasting my youth and want to kill myselfI'm 16, I never had a real relationship, literally the only time I kissed a girl was when I was like 5 like holy shit im a loser. I barely have fucking friends, I hate the country that I moved to and I just have nobody to speak to I feel so alone. Nobody understands my loneliness I dont feel like Im ever going to get a gf I'm ugly as fuck and I have social anxiety. I wish I could have a lot of friends, go out, socialize, HAVE A GIRLFRIEND. Girls only care about looks and thats why Im just so fucked. I feel depressed, alone, and confused everyone my age has someone to feel affection with. I'm just so sad. Life is not fair and I'm really sad
