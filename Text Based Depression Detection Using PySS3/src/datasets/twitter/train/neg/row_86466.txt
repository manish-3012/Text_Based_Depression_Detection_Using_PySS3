yEET I woke up wanting to kill myselfIt was my birthday yesterday (well really itâ€™s the fifth, but I invited my gf and my best friend over on the 3rd). My gf had to leave the next day right when we woke up, and while I wanted her to stay longer, I know her parents wanted her home, itâ€™s all good. My friend also said she was gonna leave, though we had a bunch of plans of going to the library and doing some fun things. She came up with a bullshit excuse why, but it wasnâ€™t like I was gonna call her out on it. Even my dense ass could tell she just wanted to be done with me. Once they both left, I fell back asleep for a few minutes wanting to kill myself. Iâ€™m just mad at myself that such a damn small inconvenience would throw my mental state off of a cliff. On top of that a friend of mine hasnâ€™t responded to my texts in forever, and Iâ€™ve boiled it down to two options- 1. He killed himself. Or at least attempted. Or 2. Iâ€™m annoying as hell. I shouldnâ€™t be bothered that my friend wanted to leave, I shouldnâ€™t be that bothered a friend of mine hasnâ€™t responded to my annoying rambling texts, yet I am and I just want to kill my self or at least cut the shit out of my thighs
