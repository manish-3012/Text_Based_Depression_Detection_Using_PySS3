I want someone to tell me I'm a terrible person so I've solid reasoning to kill myself.I've said and done things in the past that I can neither take back or forgive myself for.

I'm only 19 and I already feel like my life is over â€” that I've said and done things so bad, I can't redeem myself. Someone who's 19 shouldn't feel like this. I know it's a ridiculous train of thought.

Logically I know this isn't true, and that albeit being terrible things, I can try and improve my future â€” but I'm tired of trying to be logical. I'm so, so tired. 

I just want someone to tell me I'm a terrible person so I've reasoning to kill myself. Because if it comes from someone else's mouth, then it's true, right? I can't forgive myself â€” I'll always be this angry, sad, vindictive person, and no amount of self-reflection can change that.

I feel so stuck. 

I hate myself. It's inexplicable. I can't trust myself â€” I don't love my family. I don't love my mum, I don't love anyone. I feel so hurt, angry, and sad. 

I'm a bad person. No-one can convince me otherwise. Please don't tell me to seek help from either doctors, or reach out the hotlines. None of that's helped.

I don't know any more.
