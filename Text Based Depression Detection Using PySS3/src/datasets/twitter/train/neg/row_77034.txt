Hanging on to what ifâ€™sI want to die so bad, no one loves me and everyone I know has said that to me face. I have one person in life that actually cares but itâ€™s not enough. I work 50 hrs per week to just be told by my fiancÃ©â€™s father/landlord that Iâ€™m a lazy bitch who should die and heâ€™s right. I want to die so bad but I just canâ€™t bring myself too. I have no support in life I just suffer. I donâ€™t know what to do. I just want friends and people that will care... sorry for the drunken rant
