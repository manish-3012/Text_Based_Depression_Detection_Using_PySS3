A list of people I know who commited suicideWhen I was 9, my friend also 9 commited suicide by hanging herself (changed my life forever)
My neighbour at home hung himself, he was a family friend
Came to university= class mate 1 commit suicide in second year of studies
Class mate 2 commits suicide in 3rd year of studies
Flat mate studying actuarial science commits suicide 
Brother in law commited suicide last week and today was his funeral

I struggle with suicidal thoughts, i have attempted myself, is this lived experience conducive to my mental wellbeing?

Nope
But i just keep living. My life is painful and i sometimes feel the pain physically, I hope and pray I dont get to the point of doing it or attempting again
