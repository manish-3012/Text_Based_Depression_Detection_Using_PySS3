My name is for her, but I'm the one at this moment who needs helpHi all, 

Throwaway and all that nonsense. First and foremost, I'm scared. She cried today and was unable to work because I no longer function. I'm not able to reply straight away, but can and will.

I don't want to do what I do anymore. I want to help. I feel compelled to help others. Those less fortunate than I am. 

I turn to Reddit, because it's helped me in the past. How can I survive?

Thanks.
