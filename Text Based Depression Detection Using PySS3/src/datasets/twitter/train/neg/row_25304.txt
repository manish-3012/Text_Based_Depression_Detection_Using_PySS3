It's everything.I'm in my 30s. I have kids. A house. Brand new car. Stay at home mom. I tried to kill myself when I was 16 and again last year. Next week will be my final attempt and it will be a successful one.
I opened this up to talk. I dunno whatever. Anyway  I get to the page where you start typing. To show people what they're supposed to do, it says "an interesting title"

I actually laughed. That about sums up my life. I cant even comply with simple instructions.  I can't come up with anything interesting because I am not interesting in the least.

I'm nothing but a place holder. Dont worry about not responding.  I'm already aware I'm not worth the effort. 

I'm not writing a note next week. These are my last written words. It helps settle my head so I can go. Thanks.
