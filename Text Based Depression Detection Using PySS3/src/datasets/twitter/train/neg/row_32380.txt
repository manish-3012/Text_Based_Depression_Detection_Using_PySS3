i think iâ€™m afraid of getting betteriâ€™d like to want to get better and recover. iâ€™d like it if i wanted to feel okay again after 12 years of severe depression &amp; suicidal ideation. but iâ€™m so terrified of taking the steps necessary to being happy. i want to stay miserable and empty and depressed and iâ€™m not quite sure why.

maybe i want to stay sick &amp; get sicker because iâ€™ll finally have the courage to actually kill myself. or maybe itâ€™s been so long since iâ€™ve felt genuinely content that iâ€™m afraid i donâ€™t have a personality outside of my depression. or maybe i just hate myself so much that refusing recovery is a way to punish myself. i donâ€™t know.

does anyone else feel like this? like theyâ€™d rather stay depressed &amp; suicidal than put in the work necessary to feel okay?
