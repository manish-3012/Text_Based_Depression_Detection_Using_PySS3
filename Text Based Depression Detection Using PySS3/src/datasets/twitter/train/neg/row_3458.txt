Good move, or no?I ended all contact with my best friend starting today in order to get better. No matter how many times he tells me otherwise, he doesn't accept me as a gay male. Being around him (even just the thought of him) puts me through extreme turmoil. Could this be a bad move? Or is this the correct way to get my mind off of throwing my life away? Maybe I should just give him a few months to realize that I am a decent individual and do not deserve to be treated as less?

I've considered suicide due to many more problems than this one alone, but as a logical thinker, I am not able to follow through. It won't be easy, but starting a new life with new people would be awesome.
