I giving upIve gotten to a point where I just cant deal with this anymore. My parents have stopped supporting me and constantly yell at me, my family has given up on me, I dont see a point to keep going. Despite trying my best at everything I do nobody seems to care about me. The only reason im still clinging on to life is a girl and she is starting to take me out of her life too I just want someone to love me. The thought of hurting myself is getting louder and want someone to help.
