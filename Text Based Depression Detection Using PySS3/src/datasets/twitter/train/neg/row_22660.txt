JudgementalWhy are people so judgemental towards people who are suicidal? Iâ€™m pretty sure if you were in their shoes you could never â€œhandleâ€ the situation. Coming to the decision to want to take your life isnâ€™t easy its very very difficult when all options donâ€™t seem to provide relief , hope and resolution. please have compassion and sympathy towards those who are suicidal maybe then weâ€™ll see the numbers go down.
