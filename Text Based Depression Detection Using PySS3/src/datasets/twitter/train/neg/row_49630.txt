Why is this world so horrible.I've been to school all my life, I always did good up until 9th grade when my dad started getting violent at home, I managed to graduate but with very mediocre grades and during this time, about 4 years ago now was when my mental health started to decline.

I dont have any dreams, at all. I've been going to school my entire life, and it all feels pointless. I dont want to work, I dont even want to live, so why have I been forced to waste my entire fucking life sitting in a classroom being miserable so I can get a job and be even more miserable, whats the point? My entire life so far has just been school, and the future just looks darker and darker. When do I get time to be happy? 

Every night I lay in my bed staring up at the celing and just cry my eyes out, because i've put so much effort, so many years into doing some pointless job. I think if someone handed me a gun I would do it, I just dont want to abandon the few friends I have, my brother and sister and my mother. 

Dont tell me the usual bullshit, I want to know if things will change, or if its just the same boring tasks until I wither and die. I want to be happy, I just cant see how.
