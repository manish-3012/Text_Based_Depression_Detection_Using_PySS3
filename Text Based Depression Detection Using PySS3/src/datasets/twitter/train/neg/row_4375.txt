What's the point of living with a chronic disease.Seriously, no basic suicide advice works for me.

"Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem." No. My problem is not temporary. It will haunt me until the day I die. It will never go away.

Oh god, if I could do ANYTHING to rid myself of my illness I would. I have no sympathy for people with problems that are solvable with action.

I feel less than, inferior. I dont get to enjoy life the same way most people do. I'm always in discomfort. All because my fucking mom decided to have kids and doom me to a half assed life filled with suffering.

Life is just a tease for me. I already feel half dead all the time. I see things and think about how I cant enjoy them. I miss my old life. My life before my disease got worse. I was so optimistic. So full of energy. I felt strong. I felt capable, like the world was my oyster.

I can handle literally anything else in life but this. It's not fair and I cant accept it. I'm telling my mom that I'm planning on killing myself soon. So she can mentally prepare herself.
