I had a dream last nightI had a dream I jumped off a bridge, the one near my house. The water was slightly frozen, with sheets of ice broken up and floating below me. The drop wasnâ€™t far, but If I landed just right on the ice it could kill me. The dream felt so real, but at the same time, I knew it was a dream. My two friends stood beside me as I looked over the railing, one of them, the one who wonâ€™t eat and â€œaccidentallyâ€ cuts himself, told me to do it. So I did. I slipped over and angled myself towards the ice, and took a deep breath in as I felt my bones crunch against it. I broke through and Into the water, my entire body aching but in shock. It wasnâ€™t too cold, maybe the dream adrenaline was keeping me warm. As I stumbled out of the water a police officer approached me, told me heâ€™d have to admit me to a hospital. I told him no, I wouldnâ€™t do it again, and he believed me. So, I walked to school, clothes soaking, body aching, with my two friends.

This is the first dream Iâ€™ve had in maybe a year. Or at least, the first dream I remember. Even now, the smaller details are fading away, just barely slipping my mind. 

Maybe Iâ€™ll finally get to make this dream a reality.
