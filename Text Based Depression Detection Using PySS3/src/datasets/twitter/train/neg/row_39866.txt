im a suicidal failureim a senior in college now. just had to drop this semester because i'm failing everything. heavy waste of time and money. whatever used to keep me going is gone.

except for one time, i never came close to killing myself. i dont know why. i dont want to go to classes in the winter. i dont want to go through withdrawals again. want to give up more than anything. i just cant.

i was happy for a little while the first time i fell in love. that's long gone now. she said she would always have my back. said i could rely on her for anything, anytime. said she always wanted to know what i was feeling. i really learned a lot.

if you can relate to this, i dont know what to tell you. im in it with you, for whatever it's worth.


if you cant relate to this, i hope it stays that way. if ive learned anything its that you cant take it for granted. be honest with yourself. if you need help, get it. get it now. send some emails, make some calls. get yourself on medication, if thats what you need. dont be so sure you can go it alone. for fucks sake, dont be like me
