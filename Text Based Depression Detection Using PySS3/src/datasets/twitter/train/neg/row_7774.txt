Passive suicidalSo Iâ€™ve been thinking about this for months and months and years.. I didnâ€™t actually know the term for this but itâ€™s like I donâ€™t want to physically kill myself as Iâ€™m scared of surviving and deal with the aftermath but I just wish I wasnâ€™t here. Iâ€™ve been on antidepressants for a year (Trintellix) and all though it helps, I canâ€™t help but always feel unhappy. I work from home and great full to during these times and I look forward to future milestones but I could be happy without. I donâ€™t know I just feel empty, when I was younger I wanted to physically kill myself but as I grow older I realize that I donâ€™t have the guts.. or I donâ€™t want to all the time? Iâ€™m just constantly feeling in limbo. Sorry for the rant, but literally nothing is â€œwrongâ€ in my life, I do live with my mother and our relationship sucks I feel like Iâ€™m faking being ok, when I have a glass of wine sometimes Iâ€™ll mention to her in passing that Iâ€™m sad- she blames it on my work from home job that I donâ€™t have enough of a routine. But I thrive off routine, so I do have one maybe not as structured when I went to school and had a job, but I graduated so- that routine is gone. Iâ€™m just babbling but thanks for reading :)
