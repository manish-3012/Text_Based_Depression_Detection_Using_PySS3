Writing Suicide NotesI've just written my suicide note for the probably 6th time now. Lots of revising and editing.
The thing is, writing suicide notes have a very strange effect on me. I am a rather pathetic person in quite a number of things, but you can say I have a call in writing suicide notes, because it makes me feel very calm.
I had initially written notes full of hatred and blame, but now that I write notes, it's notable that I feel no attachments to anything. I no longer hate anyone, love anyone or anything - I just purely recount my rather disastrous life in clinical detail; that's it.
I guess I just don't want to leave a bad impression in my last note - or is it some kind of sick trick my mind is playing?
