Does anyone feel like a functioning suicidal?I feel like I could end it all at any second and get some relief. But I also go through the motions of life like I'm planning to live for so much longer. I go to class for the most part, eat food, try to look groomed on the outside. In a way, I feel like people can't take me seriously. All my so called friends just look at me like there's nothing wrong with me. Even though I tell them things, it's like the end of the day I look okay on paper, so I must be okay. My parents know I feel like this but they already have my life planned out and I feel trapped. It's been a constant trend in my life where even if I tell people I'm struggling, no one believes me. I think that's part of what has driven me to this point because no one wants to help. I don't know if I'm the only one who feels this way
