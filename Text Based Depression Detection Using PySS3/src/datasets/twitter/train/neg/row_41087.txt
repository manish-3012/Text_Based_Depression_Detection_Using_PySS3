I don't know what to doOnly reason that keeped me from hanging myself last 15 minutes is that I don't have a good rope. I wanted to go to near shop and buy it but I clearly know that going out of my house to this shop would be crossing the Rubikon. No other way out. 

I have deep mental issues. My first very close suicide call was when I was 10. I have been beaten and experienced violence through my childhood. I imagine killing myself dozens time a day since years. I have experience with various drugs overdose and trying to cut arteries at my wrist, but not deep. 

I'm typical Scorpio born 17 November. I have deep and extremely intense emotions. I have been let down by love towards few women several times in my life.

Only reason that worries me about killing myself is my dog. I live with my dad and I'm the one mostly to take her on walks and look after her.

I want to emoquit. There are some very dark thoughts over my mind. About harming myself and others. I'm a good guy and wouldn't ever harm no one who doesn't deserve it. Given a choice to kill innocent dog or kill myself aggressively, violently by stabbing, setting on fire or jumping out of window deliberately aiming  head down to concrete ground I would end my life.

I could give unimaginable love to someone pure and innocent who is in deep need of it, but there is no one close. Only me and my feelings. 

I don't know how and when it's going to end but I know that I'm close and that it's going to be intense.
