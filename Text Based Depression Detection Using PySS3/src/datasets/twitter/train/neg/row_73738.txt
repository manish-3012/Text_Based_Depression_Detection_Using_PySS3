Dad wanted to be proud of his sonToo bad he got a colossal loser instead.

I think I'm about done. I fail at everything I attempt. I won't amount to anything so why even bother? My dad is a great person, I hate to do it to him but I think he'll understand.

I failed my math class. In a week or two from now I'm taking a sort of a pass-test (basically retake the entire year in a form of an exam). I'll probably fail it and if that happens I'll do the charcoal suicide thing.

Wish me luck. (luck = your intepretation)
