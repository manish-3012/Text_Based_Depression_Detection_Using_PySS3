My girlfriend is extremely depressed and suicidal and has attempted 5 times in the 3 months and i hope some of you can give me advice on thisto start off with we are very long distance so take that into account. so she has been depressed for over a year, tried suicide 5 times like i said, she self harms, she has extremely low confidence and self esteem, is very sensitive, overthinks heavily which is how she gets to the point of attempting sometimes, she doesnâ€™t like being open with others, and she has been having therapy for over a month but it isnâ€™t helping. and she has had 3 deaths in the family recently. and i donâ€™t know what to say or do anymore, she doesnâ€™t think anyone can help her. i feel useless and itâ€™s horrible just seeing her in pain without knowing what to do, she sees no light at the end of the tunnel, she thinks she doesnâ€™t matter and it wouldnâ€™t matter if she did do it. i donâ€™t know what to do or how i can help her, i have tried everything, being there for her as much as possible, given her the best advice i can give, comforting her as much as i can all of that and she just seems to be getting worse. sheâ€™s told me that the only thing keeping her here is me but tonight she said she doesnâ€™t think she can carry on anymore but i told convinced her to stick with it a little longer. i donâ€™t know if i should just let her go, i donâ€™t want her to continue being depressed and live in so much pain just for me. someone please give me some honest advice
