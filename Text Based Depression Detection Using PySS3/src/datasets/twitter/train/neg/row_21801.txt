Just a reminder. Downvoting posts asking for help or sharing doesn't do much for the person who posts. Save your downvotes for the truly negligent on SW.Coming up on the two year anniversary of SW and I'm looking at some of the recent posts and am so suprised to see so many downvotes on postings just asking for help or sharing feelings. Please save them for spam, opinions or songs and articles you feel inappropriate.
