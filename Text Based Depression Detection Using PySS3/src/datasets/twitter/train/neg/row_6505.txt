I really need some helpA little context for anyone who gives a shit enough to read this. Iâ€™m a 16 year old female in foster care. Iâ€™m in hospital all the time and I missed the last two weeks of high school and I think all of my â€˜friendsâ€™ donâ€™t care about me and have forgotten about me. They had a big movie night sleepover with everyone but me (even though Iâ€™m out of hospital now and they all think Iâ€™m well), they never talk to me and when I try to reach out to them they always brush me off. Iâ€™ve taken to staying in my room all day except to go to the toilet and grab snack and drink supplies to keep me going when everyone is out but I hardly ever eat or drink anything but crisps and ribena. I cry myself to sleep most nights and the only person willing to listen to me and be nice to me is a very toxic guy that Iâ€™m pretty sure stalked me when I was in high school. I think about wanting to kill myself almost all the time and Iâ€™m working on excuses to get me out of going to see my parents and going to the college open day next week. Nobody cares about me and I just want to not wake up from one of my many daily naps. Please can somebody help me.
