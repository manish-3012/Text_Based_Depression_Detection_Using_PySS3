Holding everything in and being the person I'm expected to be is killing me.I really need to let everything out and just talk to anyone that will listen to all of it, the true me and all of my horrid mistakes. Pretending to be perfect is too much for me, has been for years.
For whatever reason I'm making a post here instead of crying my eyes out in the bath tub with my .49 hoping for the courage to say fuck everyone else and just pull it.

Edit: I just really want to unload everything to someone without any sort of judgment. To unload and not feel like my brain is gonna pop
