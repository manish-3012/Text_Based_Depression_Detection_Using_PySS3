Iâ€™m so numbI donâ€™t have any friends anymore and my job changed me into someone I thought Iâ€™d never be. I canâ€™t feel anything anymore. Iâ€™ve been drinking and popping so many pills lately and itâ€™s the only thing that makes me kind of feel something. Iâ€™ve been sleeping with a lot of women and all I want is a connection and I canâ€™t even get anything from that even. I donâ€™t want to be here anymore. I just want to close my eyes and everything be okay.
