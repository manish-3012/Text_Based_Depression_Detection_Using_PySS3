How much can I take?I know I'm resilient, and tough. Maybe that's why the universe decides to make my life hard.

It isn't always bad, but the bad seems to pile up sometimes and right now the pile couldn't get any bigger.

I got problems. Legal, work, financial, relationship, and even car problems. Stuff I probably could deal with at most points in my life. Especially if I was able to deal with one thing at a time. But now it seems like it is all happening at the same time. A clusterfuck for the ages.

I feel like I'm on my own. There is no one that can help me. Not my mom, not my dead dad, not my sister. They all got their own problems. They love me, but their hands are tied.

The worst part is these problems can, and already are starting to bleed over into my job. This is a job I can't lose. It's my foot in the door to my dream career. If I lose this I will really have nothing. I will be alone, no money, no place to live, and worst of all no future.

If my life falls apart, then I know I'm going to end it.

But how much more I can take before I lose it. I feel like it is all going to collapse no matter what I do. I'm just waiting for that final feather to fall on top of the pile.
