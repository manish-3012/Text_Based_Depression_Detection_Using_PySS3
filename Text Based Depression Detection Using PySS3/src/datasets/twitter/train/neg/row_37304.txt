Friend in need of help.I have a friend in California, around Palmdale and she's been abused a  lot, by her ex and family (She is 20). Beaten, starved, sexually  assaulted many times. It is very bad. She has recently escaped to a  shelter, but her mental state is very bad right now, she also recently  got an abortion from a sexual assault (her mother was trying to force  her to  have the baby), she got an infection and is in a lot of pain.  Her mental state is that she's hearing voices and seeing things that  aren't real. Top it off, she's lost her memories. This has happened  twice, so she's also forgot a lot of her trauma. She needs urgent  therapy and a place where she can feel safe. She's going to be kicked  out of the shelter tomorrow. I'm not sure what I can do to help her here  or what she can do. As she doesn't remember her traumas, I don't know  if she can answer questions related to it. She's also very scared of  police getting involved in these matters and blacks out whenever calling  any sort of shelter or other place. 

She managed to call this one in a desperation attempt, when she was  wanting to take her own life and said she'd take her life at the  shelter.

What can be done here?
