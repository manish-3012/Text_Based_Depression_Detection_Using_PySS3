RealizationI've accepted at least sort of that now that I've been outed for being suicidal in a way I am obligated to live otherwise I'd make too many people feel as if they could of done something. So if I live, I should just stop fighting and pretend to live happy. 

But I also realized that almost everything I have told myself, even that stuff which is to bring me down are simply lies so I don't look at the real problems I've deluded. I am not beyond cruel or overly romantic or existentially destroying myself, I am extremely socially idiotic. 

I can't talk to people basically about there day. I sit in silence for long long times. If anyone is hinting at anything I won't realize it for a year, but then lie to myself that I could predict or manipulate anyone. I don't know a god damn thing about sports or how to talk about sports or any other basic conversations and I don't even try. I realized that I don't have stories to tell to people not because things don't happen to me but because I am too stupid to tell them. How is someone so distant and estranged from basic human interaction supposed to become a writer or do anything with his life?

And I realize when I was happy that was such a rare chance to find someone who didn't realize the same things here that I didn't. I just want to die so I can stop lieing to myself.
