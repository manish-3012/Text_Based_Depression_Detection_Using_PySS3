,I might kill myself during the next week...the only person that really knows and understands me, I can't talk to. My family hates me. Just earlier I was talking to myself about how I'm going to kill myself. I have my suicide note written out, I have all I need to do it. I honestly might kill myself over then next week. I'm useless, a monster, an asshole, a loser, freak, and a curse. I should just fucking kill myself. I don't matter anyway. I want my family to feel guilty. I want them to suffer. I want them to know my pain. I don't have an escape. I can't go anywhere. I think I'll just kill myself Monday. Yeah. I'll kill myself Monday. Well, this may be my last post, so...yeah. Cya in hell.
