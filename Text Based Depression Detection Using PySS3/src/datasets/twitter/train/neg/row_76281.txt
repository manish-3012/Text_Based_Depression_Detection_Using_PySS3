I don't understand if I am really unreplaceable or if I do matter to othersI just got back from the birthday party of a girl I've had a close relationship for over a year, but I feel like I'm not good enough for her. I was with her at first but as more people arrived eventually she talked with other people, some of my friends came too but they were talking with others (there weren't more than 12 people there) so for the majority of the time I just sat there alone. For some time I have been thinking about no matter my effort to aproach the same people as those who went to the party I am eventually left out, they say they care for me and that I am a close person to them but I just don't feel like it is that way, for some time I have been feeling as if I can just be replaced after any given time and that there is no one person who would remember me if I was gone after a week or two.

I know this might sound like a dumb excuse or just me being overdramatic but I just don't believe I am worth anything to anyone not even myself.
