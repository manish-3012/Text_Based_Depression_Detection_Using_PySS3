i donâ€™t think the world is better off without me, i think iâ€™m better off without the world.it sounds selfish, and maybe it is, but earth is an awful place lmao
racism, sexism, rape, sexual assault, homophobia, transphobia, and, jesus fuck, so many other issues rid our world. 
i donâ€™t feel like i am not wanted by the world, or that the world is better off without me, but i feel like the only way to escape from the evil of the world and the pain that comes with it, along with depression &amp; panic disorder is suicide. iâ€™ve been in therapy for about four years now and have tried dozens of medications and prescriptions, none of which helped how i felt/feel. 
in september i survived an overdose on a â€œsuicide cocktail,â€ if you will, which contained probably around one hundred pills of acetaminophens &amp; anti-histamines. i sustained liver damage and despite taking the pills and going to bed, ready to die, i am still here. 
i donâ€™t know what iâ€™m going to do next. 
part of me wants to hold out and wait so i can experience life and fall in love and shit but if i off myself i donâ€™t have to worry about anything. itâ€™s a pretty loaded concept.
