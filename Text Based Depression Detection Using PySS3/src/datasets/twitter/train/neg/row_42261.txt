I hate myself and want to dieIf I knew for without a shred of doubt that my life going on after this point would be as miserable as my existence up until this point, I would end it all right now. No one in my life thinks of me or treats me as a person. I'm an object to everyone including myself. And as far as objects go I'm pretty fucking worthless. I'm fat, lazy and unattractive. To my friends I'm just a clown and not someone whose issues should be taken seriously. To my parents my sole purpose is to be a reflection of their self worth. Whenever I look at the world I'm just immensely disappointed. Maybe it's not the worlds fault. I don't know how to be happy. I don't think I'm capable of happiness really. I think as long as I am cognizant and able to perceive the world I will always be unhappy. I'm trapped in my own mind. In a way it doesn't matter if the world is broken or I'm too broken to view the world. Either way it will always be my reality.
