I need help pleaseI feel that Iâ€™m going to end my life soon. Iâ€™m to exhausted from life. My life has just gone down hill since i turned 18. I got married at age 18 and divorced at 21. I supported my family and made it where my ex could be a stay at home mom. One thing that really frustrated me was that I had to clean and make dinner every night. She would leave early in the morning and get back right before I had to leave for work at night so Iâ€™d be up for 48 hours sometimes. At court I only got 40% custody of our daughter and thousands of dollars in lawyer debt. Even tho I had evidence of a mentally unstable mother. The mom is a fucking bipolar wack job. I donâ€™t want to get into detail with. She never takes  her on her days. I love having my daughter but why am I paying child support when she never has her.  The Mother is always having a stay at a mental health hospital at least twice a year. I lost my job recently and havenâ€™t been able to pay bills or child support. My car is broken down and I have no money to repair it. I havenâ€™t eaten in two days. I donâ€™t even a fucking dime. I AM drained. I know someone has it worse I should be grateful for what I have bla bla bla. Well Iâ€™m sick and fucking tired of being walking on talking advantage of from everyone. I did not proof read this so sorry if I sound uneducated haha. Iâ€™m 23 and done
