So Iâ€™m an alcholicI hope that this is entertaining for you. From the time I was 10 I was beaten to a pulp. Had to lie to my teachers.( you know the drill). I was diagnosed as bipolar at the age of 8. Honestly my fingers canâ€™t type what else happened to me. Now:.. Iâ€™m an alcoholic in the US and have to find sobriety. I have no insurance so I canâ€™t go to rehab
