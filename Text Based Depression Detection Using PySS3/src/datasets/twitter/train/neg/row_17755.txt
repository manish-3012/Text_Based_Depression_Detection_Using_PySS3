I don't think I can go on anymore. I'm too tired and I'm a failure. I'm a pre-testosterone transgender man and a freshman at a community college. My report card came back and I got a 2.36 GPA. I feel like shit for it, and now my grandparents are on my case about it, which is fine because they are the people paying for tuition. But whenever I try to talk about how I am feeling emotionally about all this, they just beat me back down. I feel like a failure. I am a failure. And on top of all this, I am experiencing the worst body dysphoria of my life. I just look at myself in the mirror and I want it all to end. It hurts. I know if I don't get on testosterone soon, I will probably kill myself in the next 6 months. 
I just don't want to live any more.

 None of my friends and family are offering the right kind of support. I don't have a car or money for a bus to a therapist at the moment, but I will after the holidays are over. I can never sit down with my grandparents and explain to them how I feel about all this, because I get too emotional and I feel even worse about myself if I get emotional in front of someone. There are also guests in the house, and I would feel like a fool if I were to explain my emotional state to my grandparents while there were around. I'm just so tired of doing this to myself. I can't see any other way out than by ending it all.
