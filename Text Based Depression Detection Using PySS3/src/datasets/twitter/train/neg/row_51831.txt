tired of this living hellI'm 21 and I'm just getting to the point where I'm tired of waking up everyday, I'm tired of the people that bring misery to my life and took away the few things that brought me happiness in this world, &amp; my thoughts on killing myself are starting to get to the point where it crosses my mind several times a day. My mom and stepdad pretty much kicked me out of the house since I don't believe in God and for other reasons which made no sense. I did my best to follow there rules. They took away everything that made me happy, trying to mold me into the person they want instead of letting me be myself. I also hate my stepdad, I've hated him since I was a kid he is the cause of all my problems, If he wasn't around I wouldn't be posting this right now. I've tried talking with my mom, but there is no reasoning with her because all she does is bring up God &amp; the bible. So she sent me to my dad's house knowing me and him don't get along and that his house is the dirtiest place I know of. My dad isn't home since he's retired and it's me and my stepbrother living here. This place is so dirty with months worth of built up dirt that I'm breaking out in rashes and its already adding to the sicknesses I have. I have nowhere else to go, so I'm stuck here bouncing between two hells. I can't afford an apartment because my job only gives me 14 hours a week and I've been searching for another job. I've been paying to go to the doctor because of how much pain I'm in. Some days when I wake up it looks like I've had a stroke and half of my face is just drooping for like an hour or two. I can no longer deal with this stress I've been dealing with it since forever and I'm afraid if I don't kill myself all this stress will.
