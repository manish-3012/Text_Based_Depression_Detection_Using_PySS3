StrugglingI'm 42 and have struggled with mental illness all my life. Over the past few years, I've lost so much, that it's tangled me in my thoughts, and have made things worse because I'm self destruction. I've lost so many friends I spend most my nights alone, my wife works 3rd shift and she has grown weary of me and my constant depression and obsession with death. I've lost my Father last November, and my dog in the May before that. Oddly, losing my dog caused more despair than my father. I have had tons of financial losses, living on so little right now. My health hasn't been great, and I have neglected it, and sometimes think "screw it, just let it take me". I've but on weight and my self image is the lowest ever.

How do I stop this path towards this? I've had suicidal thoughts all my life, but something has come along to pull me out. I feel like I am at the end of my road.

Don't have any expectations, just felt like I needed to put this in words somewhere. I know everyone says "call someone, talk to someone". But there isn't anyone.

My heart is so low, so broken. 

Thanks for reading.
