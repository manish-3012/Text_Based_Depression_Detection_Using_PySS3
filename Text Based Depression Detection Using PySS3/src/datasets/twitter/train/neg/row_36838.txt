I think I'm just gonna kill myself soon. I've already failed once before and no one seems to care then. I'm a burden to my family, friends, and the person I love the most. They all say they care, that they love me, but I know the only reason they put up with is because I'm suicidal.I needed a place to vent and no one else is awake. I'm currently trying to find a way to do it with hurting people on my life the least.
