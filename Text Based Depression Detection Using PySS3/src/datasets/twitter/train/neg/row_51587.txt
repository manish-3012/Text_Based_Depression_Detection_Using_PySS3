I'm sorryI've never really done this before, but I'm kind of at my breaking point. I have kind of dealt with anxiety for as long as I can remember (probably around the age of 12).  It kind of got worse recently when I lost one of my good friends (i am in college rn). My anxiety has just gotten to the point where there's just a pain in my heart, and I just want it to go away. I hit myself to make it go away, but it's not working. I hate this feeling so much I can't deal with it anymore. I want to find the most painless way to leave this place. I hate this feeling and I keep hurting my friends and family and especially my boyfriend. Like last week I has a mental breakdown and I kept screaming that I wanted to die. I just keep hurting people That's probably why people are distancing themselves away from me, and I get it. Who would want to be with a bitch like me. I'm just a cunt who should've died when I had the chance. I'm not looking for sympathy I just need a place to air this out because I don't know how much more I can take.
