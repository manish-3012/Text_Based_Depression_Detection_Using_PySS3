My disease defines mePeople always talk about who they used to be before they were depressed and how they want to go back, but Iâ€™ve never felt that way. I canâ€™t remember a time before I was depressed. I canâ€™t fix my depression because I am my depression. Wash away the grime and thereâ€™s no person left underneath. The only way to end my suffering is to kill myself or handle my depression, and clearly the second one isnâ€™t possible.
