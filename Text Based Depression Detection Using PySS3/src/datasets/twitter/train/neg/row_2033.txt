itâ€™s funny how i can go from feeling fine to wanting kill myself so badly in under a few seconds.everythingâ€™s just taken a toll on me. my motivation has been taken away, and i canâ€™t do anything. iâ€™m ashamed to admit that i canâ€™t wash my hair or properly shower myself. my desk is a complete mess, my bed is filled with crumbs, and i canâ€™t feel shit anymore. i cant revise for my gcseâ€™s that are in 2 months time, and school isnâ€™t helping with anything; if anything, itâ€™s only making it worse by ignoring those who are suffering and putting my pressure and stress onto them. 
i would kill myself. i just canâ€™t do it right now. my familyâ€™s going through shit and i canâ€™t add my death to their list of shit theyâ€™re going through.
