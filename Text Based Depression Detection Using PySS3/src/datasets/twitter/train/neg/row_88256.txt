it didnâ€™t get better.i posted here a while ago, and attempted right after. i ended up trying to OD. next thing i knew, i was in a psych ward for 5 days. i even started self harming. i thought that getting help and getting medicated would eventually lead me to feeling at least a little better, but all i feel is guilt and shame for scaring my friends and family. iâ€™m tired of letting people down. i wish i had just succeeded in the first place so that i wouldâ€™ve never gotten to this point. i donâ€™t know how to get away from these dark thoughts. theyâ€™re literally going to kill me. iâ€™m done.
