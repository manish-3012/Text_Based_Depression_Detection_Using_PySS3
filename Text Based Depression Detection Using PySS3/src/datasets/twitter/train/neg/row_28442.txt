My world is crumbling and my support system has goneI have no idea where to turn. When it all came down a few days ago I just wanted to turn to my gf but she's broken up with me, and the one person I wanted to talk to about this isn't there.

My dad has been drinking alot more and over the last few days has got increasingly angry and drunk and is blaming my brother of stealing even though he didn't. He doesn't remember saying yes to my brother getting some money out of his wallet and screamed and shouted and threw things. 

My house has been so tense, and not only that but it worried me that he didn't remember as this has been happening increasingly more. However this is the only time he's ever got angry and blamed us for trying to make him think he's gone senile. 
I just want my mum or to make this all go away and the suicidal thoughts have started appearing again. It's only slight and I know I won't do anything as I don't want to die, and it'd hurt my ex gf, but I just needed to write it all down, it's worrying me as I've been very ill in the past. I hope this is okay I'm sorry
