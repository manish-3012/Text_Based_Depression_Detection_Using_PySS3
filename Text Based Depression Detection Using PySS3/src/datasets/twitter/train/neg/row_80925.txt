A story about no longer fearing deathI have been suicidal for literally as long as I can remember, about 7 years probably. Two years ago I had a pregnancy scare. I was super scared and worried, I had nobody to talk to and no way to check of I actually was pregnant. While I was wondering if I was pregnant, I had come to a conclusion I thought I would never have the balls to come to... "I'll kill myself."

I have a silent death wish, but this was a serious, no fear statement. I was going to kill myself if I was pregnant. I wasn't scared at all, because I had no other way out, it HAD to be done...... Maybe it was shock, but I felt kinda good... Like, being able to just know if I ever fuck up my life so bad I can't go back I can comfortably just kill myself. I don't know how I'd do it, but that was never something I thought about. 

It's helped me get over my suicidal thoughts as whenever one pops into my head, I just tell myself "this isn't a life changing situation, you can't kill yourself" and it puts me at ease.

Suicide never leaves my head, but I've managed to put tape on it's mouth until it's time I take it off.
