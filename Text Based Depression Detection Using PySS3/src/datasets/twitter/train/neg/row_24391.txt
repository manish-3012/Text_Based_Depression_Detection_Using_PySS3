Not depressed, exactly, just...donâ€™t want to be here sometimesI have bipolar disorder with treatment resistant depression. My depression is in remission right now, and I actually feel as good as Iâ€™ve ever felt. But still, there are days that I have to really, really fight the urge to get a refill on the meds I know will kill me if I take enough, and then take them all, so I can finally get some rest. Even when Iâ€™m not depressed, I donâ€™t particularly want to be here. Iâ€™m just here because there are people who need me. And I wonder how many more days there will be until I canâ€™t resist the pull anymore, and I get the refill and take the pills and sleep.
