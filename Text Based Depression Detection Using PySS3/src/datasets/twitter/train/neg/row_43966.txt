I feel like every time I get suicidal like this I get closer and closer to really doing it.Something awful inside is gaining resolve and I am certain I will not last the month , let alone the year. Tried all the meds ( still suicidal)  hung myself ( lived) took a whole bottle of pills ( lived) ... I packed my stuff, not to take but to get it out of the way of the next person who has to live here. This is my only outlet, but even you beautiful anons are not enough anymore.
