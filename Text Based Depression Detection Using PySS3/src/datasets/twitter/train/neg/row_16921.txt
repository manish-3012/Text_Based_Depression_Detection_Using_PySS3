I am about to reach my agreed death date. Turn 30. Die.I know Iâ€™m going to die someday. Iâ€™m going to do it myself. Iâ€™ll be 30 this year. It was my planned date. Iâ€™ve just got to get things in order. My only worry are my pets. I worry they will not understand. Maybe today. Maybe tomorrow. Everyday feels like A countdown. I hurt so much. Iâ€™m so alone. I just want to cut into my flesh and make it hurt so I feel something.
