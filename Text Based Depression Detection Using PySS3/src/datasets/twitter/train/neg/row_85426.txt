Depression has turned to angerEvery time I fail a suicide attempt I go ballistic. Yesterday I tried to hang myself and ended up breaking my tv and almost cracking my phone. Iâ€™m so scared Iâ€™m gonna go full on crazy one day and I just want to die before that happens. Every time I remember how pathetic and cowardly I am I go from sadness to a fit of anger. I think itâ€™s because for years I never talked to anyone about anything because Iâ€™m a guy and itâ€™s seemed as shameful or weak for men to talk about their depression. Especially when youâ€™re quiet like me the second you express your feelings everyone goes crazy. I remember I got mad once in highschool for the first time and yelled at a teacher and all my classmates started making fun of the way I screamed. Thatâ€™s when I really learned if youâ€™re known as the quiet kid everyone wants you to just stay quiet. And the moment you express yourself youâ€™re constantly roasted. But bottling all this shit up is making me go crazy. I need some way out.
