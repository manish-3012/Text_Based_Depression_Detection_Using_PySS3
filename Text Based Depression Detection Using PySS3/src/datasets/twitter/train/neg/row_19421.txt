Is it that bad to wish to die ?I'm not sad about life or have a bad life but since like 10 years my biggest dream was to die but not because of someone or something. I just have this some sort of instinct that tell me to die like I am maybe curious to die or something. I repeat, I don't have problems with my actual life even if there is some bad day. I am just curious to die...is it that bad ?

Is there someone like me ?
