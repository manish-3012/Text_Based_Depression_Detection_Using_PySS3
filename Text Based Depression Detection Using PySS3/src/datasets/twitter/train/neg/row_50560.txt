Fleeting but thereI've contemplated suicide 28 times today.

Never long, detailed thoughts, but a little thought blip that chimes in whenever something bad happens to me.

*"If you were dead, this wouldn't have happened!"*

I don't know if this is normal or what but it's getting worse.

It used to be once a month or so

Today it was 28.

Help me. Please.
