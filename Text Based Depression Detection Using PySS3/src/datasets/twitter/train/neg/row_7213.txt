HumiliationPeople knowing you are suicidal is the worst kind of humiliation. Nobody treats you the same, everybody is scared of you, they all think you are weak. No matter what anyone says here, nobody is non judgmental. Nobody thinks you are strong for seeking help. They are just looking down on you. The shame is too much. It's painful. Breathing is painful. I am going to jump off my balcony and end this all right now.
