I want to end it nowIâ€™ve thought of suicide for a long time. I think my time is finally coming. I feel so bad for my parents but I think this is for the best. No one beside my immediate family will miss me. I already have what I need and I feel ready. 

Iâ€™m sorry Iâ€™m such a failure. I just donâ€™t belong.
