I Think I Want To End It All NowI don't see the point of living anymore, I never did. My childhood I grew up thinking it'll get better in university. I'm here in university almost an year into it and nothing changed, maybe even worse. I think it's time to finally end it. There is no happy ending, might as well just stop now.
