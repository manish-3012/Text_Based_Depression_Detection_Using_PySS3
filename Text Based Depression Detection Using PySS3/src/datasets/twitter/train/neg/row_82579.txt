Accept itThis is the best it will ever be.

Life is what you make it.

There is no perpetual state of joy. Itâ€™s always up and down with periods of â€œnormalcyâ€ in between.

Iâ€™m an addict and everything that ever made me feel good once, has never made me feel that same way again. 

When you think about life on this planet and how many so many other creatures live purely for survival while humans have learned to live for comfort. What if nothing brings you comfort because itâ€™s never enough? The thought of how many other people are alive and what little of an impact you make on those around you and the community you live in. 

Iâ€™m a speck. A miserable speck. I donâ€™t know how to just float on like others do. I canâ€™t make life meaningful because itâ€™s not supposed to be this long. 

I do not want to spend the rest of my life having to live what others have done a billion times over. 

I donâ€™t know but a handful who would mourn me. There is nothing keeping me attached here. You have to live life for yourself and find happiness within yourself but what if there is nothing there? I cannot create what does not already exist; Iâ€™m not smart enough for that. 

Disappearing or distracting yourself seems a temporary fix at best because real life comes creeping back in. 

What would make me happiest is not having to exist anymore. I would like a way out. Get me off this ride. I canâ€™t make it work. I canâ€™t change the outcome. 

October is it for me.
