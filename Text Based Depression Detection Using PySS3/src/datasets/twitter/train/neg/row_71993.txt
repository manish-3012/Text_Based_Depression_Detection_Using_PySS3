Ive had enoughIm sick of waking up in pain everyday
The idea that things improve over time isnt true, ive been like this for 6 years and nothing really solves the root problem of feeling like shit all the time. I hate feeling like a problem to others and i always convince myself that im not that bad but i am i just dont tell anyone because nobody is going to go above and beyond to help me and i hate feeling like a burden and being looked at differently. I need my pain to stop, i cant take it anymore
