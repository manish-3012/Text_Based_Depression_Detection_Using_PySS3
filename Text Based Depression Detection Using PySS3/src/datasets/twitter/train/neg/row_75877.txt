Contemplation...I'm 30 yrs old (although I don't look like it.) I feel lost like I don't belong anywhere. I have problems communicating with the people who "cares" about me. (I say this with doubt because I don't feel like it, or maybe it's just not what I need or want, maybe it is, but I just don't feel like it.) I'm unmotivated, I'm slowly building debts, I'm on a dead in job. I'm a contractor who can make my own hours, but I always end up just staying at home, laying down. I'm inclined to think maybe ending my life, would be a better option. Sure the people around me will feel "sad" but I'm pretty sure they'll get over it. I keep trying to change but it seems like nothing works out for me. I barely have friends, I used to have friends. But I just got out of a relationship, which I used all of my attention to my ex, and just kinda alienated the people who I used to talk too. I just find everyone kinda irritating. There's really no place for me. I don't know. The holidays, the ex, my parents, my financial situation, and etc. It's just kinda overwhelming. Entertaining death seems like a solution that would solve my problem, and everyone who thinks I'm just a burden.
