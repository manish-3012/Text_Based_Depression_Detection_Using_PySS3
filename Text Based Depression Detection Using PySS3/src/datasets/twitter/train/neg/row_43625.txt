Bro I canâ€™t do this shit anymoreEvery day I feel more and more like a failure at everything. All I can manage to do is let down myself and my parents. I feel like the world would be a better place without me. I always wake up the next day thinking it will be better but at the end of the day I go to sleep with death inside my head. The only thing holding me back fro suicide at this point is the fear of why happens after I die and the physical pain that comes tight killing myself (even if the pain lasts for a few minutes)
