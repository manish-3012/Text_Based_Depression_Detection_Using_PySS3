I've sabotaged everything in my life because of social anxietyI have a fear of communication. Talking to people takes so much out of me. I've abandoned every social media platform I've tried because it makes me feel uncomfortable. Many times I've shot myself in the foot because I couldn't bring myself to ask someone for help, when any normal person easily could. I've sabotaged many friendships for pretty much no valid reason just because it's difficult for me to communicate with them, even when we are not even on bad terms. My relationship with my family is pretty much non-existent. I've sabotaged my career because it's so draining having to keep up with all of my co-workers.

It comes so easily to others. This has been going on for years and I've tried so hard to "get over it" and put myself in more social scenarios, and even leadership positions, but time and time again, I always come back to square one. I feel like I'm completely not fit to continue living in society.
