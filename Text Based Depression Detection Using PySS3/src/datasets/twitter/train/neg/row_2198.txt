Why canâ€™t I just do it?I have had depression my entire life. I honestly donâ€™t remember a time when I didnâ€™t want to be alive. The first time I attempted to kill myself I was around the age of 8. The second time was around ten years later, but I was caught before getting to my destination to bang myself. Now Iâ€™m 25 and the thought and emptiness hasnâ€™t gone away. How have I gone 25 years and not done it yet? What the fuck is stopping me? Why canâ€™t I just do it? Why the fuck do I care so much about ruining my parents and other family members?
