Setting a date and quietly preparing for the inevitable.This must be at least the 3rd time I've posted on this subreddit. I don't care anymore, about anything. I have had so much shit done to me and been through so much pain no one has any say on what is and isn't right of me.

No one understands me, they never have and never will. I feel very much alone. Everyone has such an inaccurate observation of who I am. I have been dismissed and shat on all my life.

I really was meant to die back in December you know. I tried with 20 pills or so back in November, shortly afterwards I got sent to a mental hospital. Kept me there, put me on a new drug, sent me out once that kicked in.

I had bought a helium tank, all I needed was a hose, just a simple fucking hose then I would have been able to leave this world. But no I listened to bullshit from people yet again, " it'll get better, move back home, you'll be a lot happier" yeah and look what happened. I still want to die as much as I did back when I was hospitalised. Nothing has changed.

I failed in the only shot I had of making something of myself back last year when I lost my mind during 2nd year finance in London. Now I'm back in my shitty hometown and I feel just as alone as I did back in London. I don't fit into any group particularly at all. I honestly wouldn't be surprised if I was legit some alien that fell to Earth.

I have aspergers and BPD. Life is hell. It always has been and always will be.

I am currently looking at the helium tank mechanism again for suicide. And once the plan is set. This time, it will happen. I hate this fucking world, its people, and my life.

Just let me die. Please. If I killed myself back in December I would have been at peace by now.
