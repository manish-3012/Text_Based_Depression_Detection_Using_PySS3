I deserve this.Two days ago, I got into my dream university on full academic scholarship after a really tough year and a half. A year and a half ago, I left my normal high school, where I had a decent social life with people I had known all of my life, to go to an alternative school so I could graduate early. I graduate at 15 in July. I completed 52 credits at my local community college in two semesters and I am 16 right now. I took all online classes so I do not have any friends in community college. I also wouldn't fit in with them, I'm only 16. 

My parents think I'm inadequate because I hang out with my friends too much but truth is, I only have 2 friends left and I constantly feel like a burden to them because I always want to hang out with them since they are all I have. My 2 friends think I am inadequate because I am shallow, they have been ignoring me ever since I told them I got into my dream university. I think it's because I was too proud but I wanted to be because I always feel inadequate to them because I chose a different route in life and they think it's easier. I'm constantly trying to prove myself to others and it comes off as pride. I am not an interesting person because I don't actually have a personality, I surround myself with all these achievements because I am nothing without them. I am so alone. I alienated my friends, they are sick of me because all I am is just a resume. 

 I am trying to convince myself that this is just a rough patch and everything will get better but it's getting so hard and I'm getting so tired. What if I don't deserve real friends because I'm so shallow? What if I never have a good personality and am just a long list of achievements? It's just getting so hard to convince myself that it will get better. I can't deal with the constant loneliness anymore, I'm so alone.
