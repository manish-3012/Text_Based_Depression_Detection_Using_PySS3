I want to leave my scar on societyI'm done with this life, but before I depart I want to leave behind a scar on this world. I'm facing eviction because I fell for some scumbags lies I dred being homeless again. I tried getting help before, I've been sectioned over 17 times in the past two years. If there is an attack on Boston's public transit then it was likely me that did it. I will leave my final manifesto on 4chan but let it be known, the world will fill my pain. I lost all hope. I tried to quietly off myself, but the mental health care system let me down. This world let me down. Now I will become the tyrant, it's my turn. I know why ppl become  terrorists. I sympathize with them them now...
