It feels like everyone is lying to me.It feels like all my friends are just pretending they like me at this point. Nobody can say anything straight to my face about how they feel. Everyone always tells you to reach out but when you reach out no one knows what to do. My friend told me to try journaling my feelings. I don't know what I would write even. I want to die? I wish I had never been born and that I had never made any friends because everyone leaves in the end anyway? I don't really feel like that would help. I tried to call the suicide hotline three times and the call never went through. I promised my friend I wouldn't take these pills but I don't know if I can keep that promise. I'm tired. I'm lonely. I just feel like I ruin everything. I don't know what to do and I don't even know if it would work if I tried. 

I just don't know how to do this anymore.
