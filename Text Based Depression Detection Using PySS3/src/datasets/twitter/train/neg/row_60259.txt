Deep desire to suicide after seeing my TherapistI'm living in a country where suicide is considered a crime. So no such thing as hotline or any form of proper services would be available. 

If I were to cover what caused me to do this, it would be insanely long. But I am seeing a therapist with little money I have left just to let it all out before this all ends.
