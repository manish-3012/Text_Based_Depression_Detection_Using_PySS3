Sick of people pretending to careI'm constantly in the process of burning bridges and isolating myself from anyone I know because I know they don't really care, and it's frightening seeing them pretend.

They act like they're concerned over my drug use, or my self harm, or any other number of shit that they find out about, but I can see through it every time. I'mconvinced that empathy doesn't really exist, that it's just faked by people for the sake of stroking their own egos or raising their social standing, and it's making it incredibly hard to resist putting a fucking bullet in my brain. ive already seen a few people show as much. It's bad enough having to live the life that I do without being surrounded by wolves trying to convince me they're sheep. They're out to get me at worst, sinister and trying to wiggle their way into viewing my livestreamed suicde for fun or at best, theyre using me to feel good about themselvves. I cant see a way out of this, its getting worse every day and on top of it i have to be alone because i dont trust them.

I've been drinking so i'm sorry if this doesn't make a ton of sense. Last person i talked to on thid sub yearsx ago tried to convince me to kill myself so im expecting the same from this but i dont care im just postign this as a way to talk to myself
