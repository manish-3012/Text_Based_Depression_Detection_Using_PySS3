My friend knows that I want to die and doesnâ€™t seem to careSo apparently my friend knows that Iâ€™m having suicidal thoughts yet she never asks how I am. 

She is very self involved anyways and usually only talks about herself. But you would think that when it comes to something like this she would actually care. I guess not. 

People only care once youâ€™re gone. So why should I stay alive for these people when they donâ€™t even try to support or care while Iâ€™m here.
