Suicide is only option33 years of complete hell. I have nothing and no one. Iâ€™ve attempted before and will try again. Eventually Iâ€™ll succeed. The pain of what Iâ€™ve endured is unbearable and life is never going to get better. No one gives a shit about me and there is no one who will mourn my death. I hate this world and wish I had never been born.
