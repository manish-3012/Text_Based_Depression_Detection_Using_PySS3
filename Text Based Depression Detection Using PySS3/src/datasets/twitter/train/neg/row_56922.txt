I feel like a prisoner in my own head.I wish i could reach in and fix whatever's causing all this self doubt, attachment, and instability. I don't know why i was made if i'm only meant to suffer. I obsess about everything, if something I do isn't perfect or the best then it's not good enough and it means i'm a failure. If i did something big but don't get the response i thought i would from other people then that means what I did was worthless. On the outside it seems like i'm doing good and like i'm happy; i've been achieving so much physically. If only my mind could catch up. When i'm out doing normal things it seems so unreal because i'm so trapped in my own head that other people seem alien. It feels like i'm trapped in a nightmare most of the time and if i kill myself i'll wake up.
