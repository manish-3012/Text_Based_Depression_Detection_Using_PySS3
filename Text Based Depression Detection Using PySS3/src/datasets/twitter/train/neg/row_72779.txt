Im doneI have had depression since I can remember. It wasnt until 2 years ago that I got the Asperger diagnose because of luck and my brother help. 

Im 28 years old and on med school. I suck, I suck as anything and as a student too. My generation graduated some years ago, made their social service and got into residence. I am kind of alone and under a lot of pressue. Last trimester my school had a sudden change on student policy and I got into "academic risk" (meaning If I failed one class, I was out), but at the same time they told me that if I managed to pass all my tests then I would not be on academic risk. By pure miracle I did it and got clean results.

start this new trimester and because of dates I need to graduate after this if I dont want to lose half a year to start my one year long social service. I have 10 heavy classes but I try to do my best. I check the school mail and I see 2 mails. One says that, surprise, I am again "on academic risk" and that if I fail 2 clases I am out but that they are "sure that I can do it" (fuck them). The other one was to inform me that the 29 of april was the last day to ask for less academic load.

I cant do this anymore. I almost decided to kill myself this last trimester when I had 6 classes. Now I have 10 of high difficulty and the academic risk gun on my head as a unexpected surprise bonus. 

I just want to get over this and sleep to never wake up. My family has given me all the support but there are things they cant help me with and this is one. 

I cant survive another academic risk trimester, let alone a worse one. Whats the point? I am too old and surely my peers think that I am an idiot. I think I am and idiot and a failure. 

I think almost daily on how and where to do it. Sometimes I distract myself with other things but It isnt working anymore. I just want out of this world.
