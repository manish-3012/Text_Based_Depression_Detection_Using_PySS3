I feel like I'm standing on an edgeRecently, I've drastically cut down my marijuana usage, from every day to once or twice a week. For the 5 or 6 days I'm sober its spent stressing to keep up a professional persona at work. every goal I try to look forward to sounds uninviting, and the days I do smoke make me happy, but then I overthink, criticize myself, and become deeply introspective and sad. There is so much of me that needs to be fixed and its apparent. I found someone who at least cares and shows me beauty in life, but I worry so often that my depression will ruin us. We have a connection that I know is rare. I cant ruin us. I wonder if the increasingly stressful days will lead to growth or death.
