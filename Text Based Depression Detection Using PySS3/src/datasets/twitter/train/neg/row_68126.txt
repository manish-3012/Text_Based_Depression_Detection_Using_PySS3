I would like to talk with someoneHi!

I have previously posted over here on regards to what happened to my little sister around the times during christmas. I just need someone to talk to. Right now my 2 and a half year old sister in the hospital. They suspect she has copd. I really, don't know how to take this information. I just feel sad. Extremely sad. I haven't had a good sleep for the past few days. Difficulties to fall asleep. I wake up during the nights to the crying of my little sister. I think I even heard her saying my name even though she is in hospital. Im losing it. I just. Need to talk. Please.

edit: I feel tired. Fatiqued. And cold. I don't want to sleep though. Please, I really really need to talk to someone.
