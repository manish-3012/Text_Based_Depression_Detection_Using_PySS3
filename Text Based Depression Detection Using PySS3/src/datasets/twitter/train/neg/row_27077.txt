Alcohol makes me happier?Currently at a party I didnâ€™t want to go to, havenâ€™t tried alcohol since new year and as Iâ€™m drinking for the first time since new year, I feel happier... Iâ€™m really tipsy right now son Iâ€™m focusing on writhing as good as I can... being drunk makes me feel happier for some reason, Iâ€™m able to talk more easily to people and actually laugh for once... maybe I should start drinking more regularly?
