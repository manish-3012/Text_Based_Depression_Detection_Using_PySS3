Everyone I know loves me. Why am I the only one who hates me?The pressure of life has come to be more than I can handle. I am a good person. I help out friends, co-workers, family and strangers any time im needed yet I feel in the background all the time. I feel like my feelings &amp; my thoughts doesn't matter. I go unnoticed so much that I think I could end my life without anyone caring. 

My job has me working in a hard, stressful environment. My bosses treat me as if I'm disposable although I break my back everyday. My skillset is doomed to keep me in near poverty for as long as I live. I dont see a bright future ahead of me.

The only reason I haven't been found hanging in a closet somewhere by now is because of my son. He's the best thing in my life by far but I feel like someone else could be a better father to him than I am. I would only be a vague memory if I died today. He would learn to write and read from his step dad, I would only be known as the guy who couldn't take being a dad anymore...

I'm rambling. The point is that I dont want to live with these thoughts anymore. They've been in my head in some form or fashion for 25 years &amp; it only gets worse each wave of depression. I dont **want** to die but I want these thoughts out of my head so I can function without suicidal thoughts. I always would say I'm delaying the inevitable whenever I put off suicide. I dont want that to be my legacy.
