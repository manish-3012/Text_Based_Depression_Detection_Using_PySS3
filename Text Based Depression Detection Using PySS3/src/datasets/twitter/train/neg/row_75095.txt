Goodbye.Do you remember exactly why Frodo left middle earth towards the end of the final lord of the rings movie, and traveled to the undying lands??? It was because the profound healing and peace of mind he was 
in dire need of simply werenâ€™t available in middle earth. This is unfortunately pretty much the same situation that I find myself in at the moment. 

This suicide note was originally intended to be much much longer, but I figured Iâ€™d go with using less words 

The last few years of my life have been too hard and none of it was worth it in the slightest.

I strongly disliked every minute of it.

There is a black hole in my heart thatâ€™s been devouring my soul at a rather frightening speed, and the damage thatâ€™s been done is truly nothing short of abysmal. 

To my closest friends: you guys were one of the few people that managed to make life just a tiny bit more bearable at times.

Thanks for everything, my companions.
