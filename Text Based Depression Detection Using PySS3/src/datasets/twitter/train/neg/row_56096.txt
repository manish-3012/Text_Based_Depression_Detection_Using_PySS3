I just canâ€™t anymoreThis is anonymous account for reasons 

I struggled with this before, and Iâ€™ve dealt with it for a while. But I just canâ€™t keep on living. My relationship with my parents is terrible, the only one in my family that I can stand is my brother. Iâ€™ve fucked up so many times there is too many to count. Iâ€™ve had hope for the past few month, because of this girl. We went on a few dates and have talked for the past two months. Weâ€™ve confessed feelings for each and they have been reciprocated. But out of the blue she said she doesnâ€™t want to be in a relationship. I understand it and I respect it., but that was the last good thing in my life. Talking to her got me out of bed every morning and weâ€™d stay up til 3 am talking sometimes. Iâ€™m reaching out here as a last ditch effort.
