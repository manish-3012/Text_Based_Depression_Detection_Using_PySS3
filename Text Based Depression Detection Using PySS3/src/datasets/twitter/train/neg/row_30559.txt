I think itâ€™s the endI think now is the time to go, about a year ago I tried to kill myself but after an hour of waiting to fall asleep I got scared ended up going to the ER and spent 10 days in a mental hospital. I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder with psychotic tendencies and severe anxiety. I also struggle with PTSD and my hallucinations havenâ€™t faded even when things were good leading to my therapist believing I might have schizophrenia. 

I got in a relationship shortly after getting out of the hospital with someone who showed me my worth and allowed me to regain my self confidence. He didnâ€™t shy away from my mental illness and when I relapsed he wouldnâ€™t be angry heâ€™d just remind me he cared and I could always call him. 

On Easter we broke up heâ€™s moving to California soon and said he didnâ€™t have the time for a relationship or the time to give me the attention I deserved. We cried together for a few hours and have seen each other a few times since. He wants to try and stay friends and I told him I donâ€™t think I can do that but I decided I couldnâ€™t handle not having him in my life. Being friends is shit though

Anyways here I am. I want to kill myself so bad Iâ€™ve been suicidal for 8 years with suicidal ideation on the daily. It feels like the inevitable end to my life and Iâ€™ve accepted that. I have a plan that will work and Iâ€™ve written letters to those who have impacted my life the most. Part of me doesnâ€™t want today to be the day though I tried to call the suicide hotline and it didnâ€™t help. I want to call him I want to hear his voice tell me everything will be okay I feel like Iâ€™m drowning and every time I get back up on my feet and out of the water another wave comes crashing down even harder than the one before. Iâ€™m sitting in my car blasting music just to get these thoughts out of my head but itâ€™s not working. What do I do
