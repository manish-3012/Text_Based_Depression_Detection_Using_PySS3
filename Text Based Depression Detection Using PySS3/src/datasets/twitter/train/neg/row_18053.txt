i literally flipped a coin to decide.sorry if this doesnâ€™t belong here.

iâ€™m not the kind of person who can make decisions on my own. iâ€™ve spent the last few weeks just.. going back and forth on whether or not i should just kill myself. i just got out of the shower, and as i was showering, i was drafting a suicide note in my mind. when i got back to my room i told myself:

no more going back and forth. you decide this now.

when i canâ€™t make a decision, i use my phone to flip a coin. even if itâ€™s something like what to have for dinner. i told myself, if i get heads: its a sign that i should go through with it, and start writing the suicide note for my roommate to find and give to my mom. if its tails, its a sign that iâ€™m not meant to die yet, and that i should keep fighting. i promised myself that iâ€™d follow through with whatever fate decided to give me.

i got tails. 

guess iâ€™ll be here a little while longer. if fate tells me to stay, iâ€™ll listen.
