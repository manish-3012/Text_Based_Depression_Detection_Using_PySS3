DeathIt's something I wish for to happen every second of my life. Worst part about it, I actually wish for my family, friends and my gf to just hate me and leave me, so I can so it without feeling bad about it. I can't do it knowing my little sister would grow up without her big brother. I can't do it knowing my girlfriend would be completely ruined, believing it's her fault. I can't do it knowing that my parents who always wanted the best for me will believe that it's their mistake, that they are guilty of it. My mother lost her mother to alcohol. My father lost his best friend to suicide. What kind of son am I even thinking about it? What kind of brother am I, leaving my sister to grow up without my protection? What kind of partner am I, being so egoistic that I'd just leave? I hate myself for thinking this, and it makes me want to end me. And that thought makes me hate myself even more. But who am I even? I have literally no personality. I'm the most non-interesting person in existence. I could be replaced by anyone. I could just let go, and not worry about it. After all, I have everything I need for it. Everything is prepared. What is there to live for? I hate myself for thinking this. I just want to stop existing. 

Am I the only one who feels like this?
