Maybe done something stupid..I just took a lot of medicine, clonazepam, with some other stuff. maybe I've done something a bit stupid... I'm not felling very alright... should I go to a ER?


**EDIT:** Good people of reddit. I'm well. I woke up in the floor, probably slept some 20 hours lying there. At least I was on the carpet.

I'm sorry. and feel embarrassed about doing that. I'm sorry for letting people worried... and ashamed for myself... I'm not sure what happened.

I'm on some antidepressants.. not sure what I was feeling, but just felt very very sad.. and empty. I think I've got no real friends, I'm doing rather badly at college, dad's dying of cancer, i've never really had a boyfriend or anything like that. (i'm a boy by the way...) you see, just felt like it's just not worth it all...

sorry for the confused speech I'm still not very clear-minded.
