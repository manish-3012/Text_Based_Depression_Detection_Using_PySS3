I'm gonna give it a yearSo after many years of depression and a couple of them with suicidal intent, lots of documentaries and info about assisted suicide, plenty of physical and emotional self harm, horrible eating habits, etc. I've decided to try for a full year to find what I thought I once had, and what I think I've been missing for a long time: a purpose, a real motivation to live and to get through every day, to get my shit together and scream to the world that I may be broken, but that doesn't mean i have to stay that way.

I decided to postpone the time of my departure from this world in order for it to be grand and scandalous, not just sad and petty, so that when I go, people will be moved to tears, not for a sad and quiet man who killed himself in his basement, but for a noisy and rebellious punk-ass-SoaB who refused to go down without a fight and who died being if nothing else, happy.

So I'll leave this wager here, and even if no one else is to read it, to serve myself as a promise and a warning: if I am not to find purpose through action and so, a will to live within a year that'll be it, I'll leave this earth without complain and by my own hand, but if I can manage to reignite the flame of life I'll give myself another chance, maybe even another one-year-wager.

For my late granny,  for my mum, for my friends, and also for myself.

Today I start with my psychiatric treatment accompanied by my therapist, why today? Well I figured out my cake day is as good as any day and a good reminder of my wager with myself, I'll try and keep posting updates. Wish me well.

Thanks to the people who kindly sent messages of hope my way in the last couple of weeks, you don't know how much you really help.
