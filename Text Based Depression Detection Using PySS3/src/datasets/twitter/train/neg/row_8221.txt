New therapist, things should be looking up.Expect they're not.

I had a video call with my new therapist today. I really like him and felt comfortable being (pretty much completdly) honest. I admitted I'm feeling suicidal but said there is no danger of me doing anything this next week, which is true. 

He said I will have to go to the doctor's soon and get my blood tested (something I've never had done) as, being bulimic, there is danger of electeolyte imbalances. He also mentioned trying out SSRIs. I've never been put on meds before but I'd give them ago.

This should bring me hope. But really, it doesn't. I feel unable to engage with university work, let alone recovery from mental illness. 

I just find that I simply don't care.
