I want to fucking die Iâ€™m so oldI miss being the youngest person at my job... Now Iâ€™m surrounded by a bunch of 14-16 year olds itâ€™s frustrating. I just turned 18 and I feel like I missed out on my youth and Iâ€™m not allowed to enjoy myself anymore. Iâ€™m approaching middle age and Iâ€™m fucking mortified. I hate the fact I was born in the early 2000â€™s when dial up internet, Flip phones, And VCRâ€™s were a thing. Hell social media didnâ€™t even fucking exist when I was born. I feel prehistoric just saying that. I would just love for someone to put a bullet through my head I canâ€™t take being old much longer.
