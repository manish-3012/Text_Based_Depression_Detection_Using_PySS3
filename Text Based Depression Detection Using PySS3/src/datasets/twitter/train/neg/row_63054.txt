I'm desperate because I really do not know what else to do to stop feeling depression and guilt 
I am a young woman of 18 years, for months I have had a person who has bothered me to the point that abuse of me many times, it threatened me and made me feel guilty for what happened. In my family I have many economic and also affective deficiencies; my parents spn divorced, I have three sisters and we do not have much money for things we need and really that bothered me of course,  but this person took advantage of that to make me believe that he could help me as long as I shut up about what he did to me and agreed to everything he told me, I always said no and even then he insisted me, in fact He is my volleyball sports coach, I do not know ... I am a person who has always sought parental support and have the desired family and he returned to take advantage of that. The 40\-year\-old man started to get very close to me since I was a little girl, even from 17 he started to insinuate himself but I do not know,  I was very afraid to think about the possibilities that he could do something to me, it was that or the inability to believe that my life coach was putting me in that situation. A lot has happened but once he took me home and abuse me, he is stronger than me and he did not need violence or drug me but to get on top of me and rape disgustingly while I begged him to leave me alone, that has happened from November to March of the year 2017\-2018,  
but in this conversation another person outside of me had sexual relations with me, I swear that I did not want to, I was afraid but at that moment I did not know what to do, I was totally out of my mind, mad and he knew it, even so. person thought that there was a kind of relationship similar to a Sugardaddy or something like that but it was totally wrong, he did it all the time against my will and acambio to shut up threatened me with my family or gave me money that was desperate for have, the point is that when my life started to go better he noticed and I told him that I would forget,  
everything he had done to me but to leave me alone now, I could not bear to have to do that; cheating my family, my boyfriend, my friends ... \(at this point he had already manipulated me to a point where he made me feel that in reality everything had been my fault, that I provoked him and that he did not say anything Because I liked it when seriously and I swear I never wanted to, the type of physical contact was already violent, I cried begging him to leave me in all the times he did it, I did not like it and he kept telling me that it was my fault ...  the point, that when in some magical way he left me, I suddenly returned annoyed because I had left, he told me that he had seen the face of a fool, that all the time I mocked him and it was not fair, so he agreed again to have something with him or pay him everything he had given me in exchange for shutting me up, I had no major problem because what I did not want was to have more conflicts with him, so I told him I would pay him but he wanted me to I left in peace, he made a sum too much money for what I could give him, he has a lot of money, I would never need what he was asking me so I knew that he did with the intention that he would have sex with He did not agree anyway, however the threats against me and my family started if he did not make a decision, he showed me pictures of my nude that he took when he was unprepared and he promised to show them if he did not pay. The guilt and the memory of everything that has made me spend these months is unbearable, I can not stand looking in the mirror and not feel disgusted by everything he did, if I did not say anything was because of everything he knew about me. and from my family, I feel that it was all my fault, I can not stand it anymore remember how many times I raped, I mocked and made me feel that everything was my fault. It will sound very ridiculous my situation compared to many who could enotrarse in this site but I can not stand it anymore, he has done me the worst I could have imagined, I finish with all my spirit of a girl of only 18 years with desire to do many projects, I can not anymore, I do not really want to continue with this disgusting feeling of horrible memories, I get tired, I have now no reason to follow every day with that memory while everyone tells me to forget it, I can not, I do not I can forgive and the guilt of having let me manipulate consumes me. I already tried to kill myself but my sisters and my boyfriend could say that they are my only reasons that stop me but days like today, days where the fear of seeing him again and hurting me, where the thoughts of how he raped me so many times and I just I was crying waiting for everything to end ... days like that they are consuming me all the time along with the desire to commit suicide, I do not want more, seriously I do not want more ...
