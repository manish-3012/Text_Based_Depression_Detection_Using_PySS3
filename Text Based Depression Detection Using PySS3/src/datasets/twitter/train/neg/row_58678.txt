No one to say goodbye to, except hereAfter 20+ years of being suicidal and some half-assed attempts, I finally have a plan and am fully committed to it. I realized that any hopes of discovering a purpose or happiness are non-existent. Iâ€™m ready to let go of desperately hoping someone will love me or care if I die. Iâ€™m ready for the nothingness of death.
