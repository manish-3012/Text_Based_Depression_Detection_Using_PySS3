Lingering pain for yearsI've been living with chronic depression for a while now and everything is just getting worse and worse. After I thought I was happy and my life was about to get better, I asked a girl I really liked and who I thought really liked me too. However, like almost all other girls I've asked out, she rejected me. I constantly disappoint people, I push myself to get out of bed, it's very difficult for me to want o hang out with people and when I do it feels forced. My social anxiety and general anxiety makes everything so much worse. Every moment I feel like I'm doing something wrong, embarrassing or just stupid except when I'm alone. When I'm alone, all I can do is think to myself "what's wrong with me." I used to have a therapist for substance abuse who referred me to a psychiatrist who diagnosed me with ADD, chronic depression, social anxiety, and generalized anxiety disorder. I feel like I'm being constantly watched and judged and whenever I'm relatively happy, I feel like it is going to end (which it always does, often due to me fucking something up) and that whenever I feel sad that it is going to be worse at some point in my life. I've been crying for about two hours off and onI can't live with this mental torture and I'm seriously considering ending my life. The only thing that is really holding me back is my parents and my closest friends. I'm very close to breaking down and giving in.
