Okay SW, let's see how you handle this one.It took me a while to get this done because I absolutely hate talking about this but something needs to be done.  Haters gonna hate so downvoters do your thing._x000D_
_x000D_
Yes I am thinking about killing myself.  Again.  Let's just get that out of the way._x000D_
_x000D_
Now, for a back story, which involves (predictably) a girl and a few regrets._x000D_
_x000D_
In 2003 I nearly slashed my throat with a knife.  I was a self-injurer back then.  I nearly bled to death, once.  I got it cleaned up though and nobody noticed.  That was the closest I've come to killing myself until a few years later.  This is probably what really set in motion an ongoing cycle of suicidal thoughts -&gt; almost suicide -&gt; hey things got better -&gt; things are okay -&gt; oh god what the FUCK -&gt; suicidal thoughts -&gt; again._x000D_
_x000D_
Over the years I've gone in and out of this cycle several times.  I am currently bouncing between "oh god wtf" and suicidal thoughts._x000D_
_x000D_
I'm going to summarize the most recent disaster quickly because I fucking hate having telling this story for the 11 millionth time._x000D_
_x000D_
In 2005 I met a girl - I will call her Susan - we were classmates.  It took me 2 years to work up the courage to ask her out.  She said no, of course, but I was proud of myself for trying._x000D_
_x000D_
We graduated in 2007 and maintained loose contact (her idea, really)._x000D_
_x000D_
In 2008 we started talking about things over email.  We shared a few personal things.  Susan was a friend of my own friends so we were already part of the same social circles.  We got close (as much as you might be able to over email).  I guess I must've been doing something right because she invited me along on a trip to another country with several of our friends.  Did you get all that?  Susan, myself, and a few other people were all going on a trip to another continent.  This was her idea._x000D_
_x000D_
So in 2009 we go.  At first Susan is herself but about two days in a switch flipped inside her head and suddenly she turned distant, bitter, short, angry, annoyed, etc etc.  I didn't understand what was going on and it was putting a serious damper on my "vacation".  This went on for two weeks.  She had become a completely different person.  My solution for calming down involves removing myself from a bad situation, but in this case, being trapped on the same bus/car/plane/room/hotel/trolley/whateverthefuck meant I couldn't get away from the problem so I eventually had a panic attack for the first time in years._x000D_
_x000D_
We get back, she says she never wants to talk again, we bitch back and forth a few times through email a few times, done._x000D_
_x000D_
Well fuck.  Vacation ruined._x000D_
_x000D_
Oh, I should clarify, we weren't dating.  Heh, we were "just friends".  We never touched each other._x000D_
_x000D_
&lt;/story&gt;_x000D_
_x000D_
The story above occured in 2009 (it is one of several similar stories).  It's been a year to the day, and I'm am still goddamn mad as hell.  I can't even put into words how fucking pissed I am about this.  I cannot fucking believe that someone would treat me so terribly and then later just walk the fuck away like I wasn't worth the trouble.  Furthermore, Susan has manipulated her schedule such that it's either Susan + friends or me + friends for hangouts.  Not that I would show up if she was there anyway._x000D_
_x000D_
This incident has unleashed a torrent of pent-up anger and regret and hate and bitterness that has been stewing inside me for years._x000D_
_x000D_
When I was a kid, I had a habit of getting the shit beat out of me.  Either at school or at home, someone usually had their first or hand against some part of me in anger.  People told me that they hated me, that I was a burden, that I was stupid, that I should kill myself, that nobody else on this planet would ever love me, or that I was ugly, or weak, or etc etc so on so forth.  I would get things stolen from me, I'd be singled out for ridicule, or wrongly blamed for some crime, or some other shitty thing would happen.  I dealt with it, though, because even when things were absolutely fucking miserable, I would think to myself "man, when I'm an adult, things won't be so bad, I'll have money and a girl and things will be okay"._x000D_
_x000D_
I guess that feeling died in 2003 but I kept finding "litle reasons" to hold on.  Now in 2010, I am 25 years old, I go to the gym three times a week, I make almost 80k/year, I have no debt, and I am in good physical health, so shouldn't my life be working out okay?  I am so bitter and angry about how people have treated me that I just want to just get a shotgun and blow my brains all over the inside of my living room.  I cannot stop living in my past.  I still have nightmares about high school, nightmares about Susan, nightmares about women in general and generally feel like shit, all day everyday.  I am 25 years old and while I see people around me having fun and being happy and moving on with their lives I still stand there and think, wait a minute, what about me?  When does all the fun start for me?  Girls?  Hello?_x000D_
_x000D_
When I go out and "try" to do something good for myself, I can tell in the way that people look at me, or the way I'm treated, that people just flat out do not like me.  I know this is because of my defensive nature.  I was taught to act that way by those useless asswipes from my early years.  I cannot break that feeling of "oh god, this guy/girl is about to totally flip the fuck out and I'm going to be in so much trouble" when I meet new people._x000D_
_x000D_
I'm seeing Susan again at a friend's wedding in about 36 hours.  She emailed me once to say she's "sorry about what happened last year" and "hope you don't have any reservations about seeing [her] at the wedding".  I am so anxious and pissed and upset I could barf until I turned inside out.  Twice._x000D_

UGH.  Wall of text.  Fuck everything.
