College makes me want to commit suicideI hate college. So much. I just want to get out of here and get a job so I can live my life and not be stressed every goddamn moment. I feel like being in school completely consumes me - I'm exhausted in the morning and then have to sit through hours of lectures then just studying for the rest of the day. If I do any less than 5 hours of studying or don't do high enough quality work then I feel insanely guilty about myself. I would force myself to work late into the night but I am just so tired and can't concentrate that late, which also makes me a failure. I am 21 years old and have never had an internship or a meaningful job. I haven't done any research and I don't care about my major, I just picked it because I hated it the least and it would make me somewhat employable. I hate my school's stupid fratboy and workaholic culture. Every moment is filled with anxiety and thinking about how I am doing everything wrong and will never amount to anything. I have no choice but to be here though, my parents would never let me leave or transfer (again). I just desperately want school to be over, but I still have two more years and then I'll probably have to do a Ph.D. because that's the only way to really be successful in industry or something like that. All of the stress, the constant self-hatred, and the shitty people just make me want to end it now. I don't want to go through the rest of college. I just want out.
