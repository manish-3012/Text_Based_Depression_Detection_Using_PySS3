Living on my own terms for now [ramble]I don't wanna take my medication anymore. 
I don't wanna eat only healthy foods I wanna eat anything sometimes a ton of junk food, sometimes a ton of hamburger helper/pizza. I don't wanna go to bed at night I wanna stay up late playing games and raging out when I lose. I wanna scream when I win and I wanna be lazy all day. I don't wanna work! I'll just be broke all the time. I don't want to make friends. I don't want to pay bills. I don't want to live in a way that makes me sad or angry all the time. I've only been happy as a kid because everything was just about living back then. Now I have to worry about my health my mind my body. I have to worry about money and education. I don't feel like it though. 

For now... 

I think I might get better one day. Maybe turn into a guy who says I want to more then I don't want to.
But for now I'll be lazy and selfish and do whatever I want because why not. Why live if your always stressed out and angry. Why go on when your always more sad then happy. I don't really care about feeling sick from stopping my medication if it kills me so be it but I highly doubt that. If I get sick and die it's ok. At least I did everything on my own terms. Because I'm just tired of trying. I believe I can live like this for a while. At least until something in my live inevitably changes.
