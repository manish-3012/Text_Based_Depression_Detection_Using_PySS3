I just realised what a burden I amI kinda had a rough day, where I remembered everything. The only good thing Iâ€™ve ever done is given my mum emotional support, but that made me become emotionally exhausted and I had to stop. 

Iâ€™ve had a psychotic episode and it made me become so useless. Now Iâ€™m just a brat who canâ€™t get over what happened two years ago. 

I just donâ€™t wanna be a burden to anyone anymore.

Sorry for wasting time. Iâ€™m just not sure if I should or not. :)
