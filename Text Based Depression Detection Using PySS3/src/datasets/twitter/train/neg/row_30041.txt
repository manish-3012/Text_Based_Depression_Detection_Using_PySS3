Aspergers Hell - No FutureI just don't know what to do anymore. I feel shunned by everyone I meet at some point, like I'm incapable of advancing even the most simple relationships. Relationships I desperately want and crave but never can materialize because of my deficiencies. It feels like I have so many opportunities but have let them all slip, things I should've had as a normal person but never have. 

It seems like everything I strive for, personally and professionally, is snuffed out and destroyed because of this deficiency. Like I have all the tools ready but I'm just broken and don't know how to use them.

How the hell do I continue living life like this? I feel like I have no more recourse. I feel like I will never be able to become better. I used to have hope, I struggled every day of my life thinking I could and would be better. I just don't have hope anymore. 

I feel like there's no point.
