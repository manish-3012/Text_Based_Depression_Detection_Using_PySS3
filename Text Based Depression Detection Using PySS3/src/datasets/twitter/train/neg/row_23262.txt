Motivation for living.Um, I don't quite know how to start this. I'm not really a suicidal type of person... I appreciate the beauty of things and the way that the sun can tinge the clouds with gold outside my window. I've a family that loves me (which is going through its own issues) and friends that would probably be slightly traumatized by my death. But the fact is, I don't feel like living. I don't feel like hoping or fighting or being fucking strong. I'm exhausted. 

In the past, whenever I was down, I'd make up one of those stories about how my life is going to be better in the future. Logic says, it IS gonna get better and I'm going to laugh at this later. But then I think about my future, really THINK and I feel this grey fill me up and throttle me. It's not happiness or sadness, but rather emptiness. The sort that drags your feet and clouds your eyes as you fake a smile. 

And goddamnit, I want to die, but I'm too fucking scared. So, what do I do? Where the hell do I find the motivation to live? I can't feed on my guilt and my fear and allow it to keep me from jumping forever.
