Living to a ripe old age and dying a natural death with a chronic illness is just plain impossibleLet's just say by the time you get old you would've already racked up a shit-ton of medical bills. Provided your physical health lets you get there in the first place. 

To me suicide is a feasible exit through the back door. A merciful escape compared to spending your last days languishing in some nursing home, or in a hospital hooked up to machines.
