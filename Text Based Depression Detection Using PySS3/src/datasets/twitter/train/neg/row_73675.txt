falling in loveI am 17 years old. People keep telling me that I'm young and that love will come later in life but I don't think I will make it that far. The only guy I've ever liked is going to a college three hours away. I am morbidly obese and I hate being alive. I hate knowing that nobody is ever going to truly, unconditionally love me. I don't want to be here anymore.
