2020 was just another year of being in a dead bedroom for me.I know there's an r/deadbedrooms subreddit, but it doesn't help. Fuck the virus, I had to live in my dead bedroom throughout 2020... and 2019... and 2018... and while I'm not suicidal, I hate living in a dead bedroom. That's not a life, that's torture. "Just leave" isn't the solution to me for right now. I've been sobbing all night instead of celebrating. My partner recoils at touch and doesn't even want me to look at her. She refuses medical/therapeutic care. I deserve so much better. I don't know what to do because she doesn't care about intimacy. There's no way she'll listen to me and I'm just bitter toward everything.
