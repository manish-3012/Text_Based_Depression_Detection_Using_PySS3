held a loaded gun to my head tonightIm 28, very average american white priveleged male. I have a job, make great money and have a lot of "friends". I have been a serial monogamist my entire life and have been engaged before. Since that engagement broke I have been seeking mental relief in forms of other relationships and eating. I put on close 60 lbs and this only made things worse. Recently I broke up with a girlfriend of 2.5 years who I was never in love with but she comforted me. Since that has ended I've been a tornado. I lost 20 lbs in 2 months because of gym and diet and I have been doing decent with the single life.

Tonight everything came crashing down. I open myself up to a woman I have had relations with and they were shut down. Nothing abnormal, I can deal with rejection just fine, but it triggered something scary. Feelings of no self worth.I hate my typical american soul crushing office job. I have no idea what my life is supposed to be about. I hate the american dream of slaving away in an office in order to afford to buy stuff I dont need. Yet if I say any of this to anyone, I'm ostracized and made to feel worse. 

This is all a shortened version of everything going on but I didnt get any responses from the text messages I put out and I didnt have the balls to pull the trigger. I need an outlet.
