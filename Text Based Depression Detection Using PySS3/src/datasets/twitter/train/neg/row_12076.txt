Im tired of being sexually broken. Some people are just born to lose everything in life.My penis just doesn't work. My foreskin doesn't want to pull back nor am I even sure if I have a fucking erection. I'm not sure if It is stuck at semi erect or not. My penis is small too, so even if this gets fixed I'll have to deal with this.

What is even the point of living? People here talk about fruitful relationships and the pain of a breakup while I'm here sexually broken with no relationship or sex ever.
