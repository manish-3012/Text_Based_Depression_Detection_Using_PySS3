Hey guys hope your all doing well (just of a bit background Iâ€™m in the U.K)


I took an OD on Friday, I was really depressed and took beta blockers and sedating antidepressants, I didnâ€™t think it was that serious until I woke up in intensive care the next day with tubes and lines everywhere after they managed to stabilise me I self discharged and tried again and it all happened again, I canâ€™t say I regretted doing it as I donâ€™t I have tried before this but , theyâ€™re now keeping me in a hospital ward with the threat of section if I leave until they can find a bed at a MHU (psych ward for the American brothers) I am slightly anxious as I havenâ€™t needed to go in since I was a teen, theyâ€™re talking about the priory in Chelmsford, I was there years ago in adolescence but this time it will be adults I was just wondering as to what I can expect, 
They currently have me on regular Clonazepam to chill me out and to help my PTSD. but Iâ€™m still having bad anxiety about going into there, can anyone who has been in a private/nhs adult mental health unit give me an idea of how itâ€™s gonna be please, is it gonna be as bad as I think or hopefully you guys can put my mind to rest ðŸ™ thanks everyone
