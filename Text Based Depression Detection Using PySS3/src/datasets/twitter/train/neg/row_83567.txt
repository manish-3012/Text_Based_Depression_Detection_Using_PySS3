Literally so dramaticI donâ€™t know if anyone else feels like this, but seriously any sort of feeling can be make me suicidal. Like I could get the smallest amount of overwhelmed and immediately think about putting a gun to my head. I could have a tiny homework assignment due and automatically think about killing myself because I just have no motivation I guess. I donâ€™t really know. Anything could happen that makes me feel stressed, especially school, and I will automatically feel suicidal. Itâ€™s pretty damn dramatic.
