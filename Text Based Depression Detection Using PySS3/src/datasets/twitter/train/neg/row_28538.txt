There's nothing I even want from lifeI'm a 26, moderately privileged, and I have a post graduate degree. Reading some of these posts makes me feel even worse for wasting the opportunities I've had. I'm just miserable and can't think of a thing that could change that. There's just nothing I want to achieve, no experience I desire, no object worth working for before my inevitable departure from this world. I'm tired of fighting this depression. I've seen professionals and tried many antidepressants. I feel like I've just been putting off killing my self everyday and I'm ready to quit.
