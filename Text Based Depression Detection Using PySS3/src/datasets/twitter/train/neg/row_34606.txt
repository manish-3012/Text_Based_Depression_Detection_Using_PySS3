The encouragement makes me feel worse.I'm tired of being told I could do so much better in life, or that I have "potential." It's just a backhanded way of saying that you think I'm not trying hard enough. 

That's not even to mention the empty offers of help - everyone wants to think they can help, so they post the suicide hotline like we don't all know how to use Google. It makes them feel better and no one else.

I don't know. I'm just tired of being surrounded by "supportive" people.
