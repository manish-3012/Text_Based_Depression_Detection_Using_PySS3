Everything is getting to be too much and I'm going numbThe world is pretty much ending. Riots are all over the country. I can't make my boyfriend happy anymore. Fuck I can't even make myself happy. I cannot for the life of me figure out why he's still with me. I'm a burden. I'm a clingy and bad best friend. My mother will never change and I can't accept that she's pretty much too far gone. It feels like something is missing inside of me. I'm hanging out with friends right now and I feel so alone. I just want to go home and sleep forever.
