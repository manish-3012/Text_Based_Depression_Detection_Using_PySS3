How to stop the thoughtsHow do I stop the thoughts about killing myself, about dying. I can't go on now, I can't get out of bed. Today I found a lump in my body and all I can think is how bad I want it to be cancer, at least I'll die. Only sort of motivation to live right now is my internship hunt. But that is because I feel like getting out of where I am right now and leaving everyone behind and starting fresh is the only way I can get better. I am afraid of not getting one, because the desire to die is only getting bigger and bigger. Worst part is, I know what the cause of my depression is, and it is totally stupid, a totally not valid reason to be depressed. But I can't help it, I tell myself constantly to just get over it, no big deal, shit happends, move on...but I can't...all I can think about is dying. I want to stop.
