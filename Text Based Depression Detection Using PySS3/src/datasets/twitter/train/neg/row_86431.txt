No purpose in lifeI'm a 21 year old unemployed man living with my parents. I'm not looking for work and I'm not pursuing a higher education because there is absolutely nothing I want to do for a living. I graduated high school in 2014 and have had 3 shitty short term jobs since then. The last time I worked was 13 months ago. I spend 16 hours a day in front of my computer, playing games or watching streams of games, wishing I enjoyed it more than I do. 

I see my closest friends about every other week and hardly enjoy my time with them eitner. As I watch my friends slowly but steadily building their careers and enjoying everyday life, I don't feel any happiness for them, simply jealousy and anger that I keep inside. I have no interests at all meaning I also have no ambition in any field of work. They'll be successful and happy while I keep being a useless piece of shit.

I just don't see my life leading anywhere at all. I live in bumfuck nowhere and watching my parents work their dead end jobs, spending every day in front of the TV and being as antisocial as me, knowing that's my future I can't find a reason to go on. I don't have a real reason to die, I just have no wish to live.
