I don't think I can succeed in anything. Every job I get, I failed. I don't think I'm going to be something in life.I hate my parents for being selfish by letting me born. I hate my mom because she let my dad who already have a wife (my mom is my dad 2nd wife) to be her husband. I hate her because she made me born even she knew my dad is an asshole and her kid wouldn't be anything but a loser. I hate being alive. I didn't ask to be born. Sometimes I just wanna die but the society keep scaring me to kill myself. Why did all of you have to be so selfish? Just let people who wanna die, die. I hate to know that even though I can kill myself but I may not succeed because I might still be alive but paralyzed if I failed. I just wanna sleep forever. Or just not be alive just like before I was born.
