I donâ€™t belong hereI canâ€™t die today. Tomorrow is my dadâ€™s birthday and I know heâ€™s been stressed lately. I donâ€™t want to do that to him. I donâ€™t want to hurt anyone, I just donâ€™t want to live anymore.

How long do I have to wait until itâ€™s okay. Until all my family is dead? I donâ€™t know if I can bear all this pain for so long.

Itâ€™s never going to be a good time. Maybe I ought to just get it done, stop procrastinating like I always do with everything. Take some initiative to get what I want for once in my life.

Iâ€™m so tired and so empty. Itâ€™s been too many years of this. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll ever be okay again. Please just let me go. Itâ€™s for the best. Itâ€™s not that the people who love me arenâ€™t enough. Itâ€™s just that I donâ€™t belong here.
