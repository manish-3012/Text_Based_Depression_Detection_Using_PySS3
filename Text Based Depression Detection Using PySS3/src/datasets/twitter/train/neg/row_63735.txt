I need someone to talk toHey guys this isnt my first time posting here. My best friend since middle school has told me to fuck off because im an annoying needy little shit who has to make everything about me and wont listen to what he has to say. I have autism and i have a lot of trouble interpreting the meaning of what people tell me. I guess i havnt taken his needs seriously enough. Today they sent me an essay detailing why i an worthless and we should stop being friends. It all started because of a debate over the kavanaugh trial. I think this is something that has been brewing for a long time between us but im scared and i dont know when or how this started. They have been the only person i have been able to rely on for a decade now. Im lost and alone without them. I tried to make it up to them but ive only gotten vague replies. Im hurt he says i hurt him im angry and i hate myself so goddamn much. I always said i would kms when i reached a certain age that birthday is in 2 weeks. I think its time guys im all alone. Im sorry for rambling im crying a lot right now. This is my main account but i dont gaf anymore its all over.
