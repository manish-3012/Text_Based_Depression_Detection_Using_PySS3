I feel stupid.I feel stupid, coming to an online forum for help, but I'm pretty desperate.  I can't stop crying and shaking and I just want all this to stop.

There are dozens of paragraphs of back story that I won't bore you with, but I've suffered with depression for as long as I can remember.  These past few weeks (and especially the last few days) have been pure torture, and I'm the kind of person that refuses to go to my friends for help.  I don't want them to feel bad or put them in an awkward position...but mostly I just don't think they can help me.

It's just so hopeless, my life.  I have nothing, I have no one and I'm very alone.  I can't remember it ever being this bad.  I don't know what to do...
