I'm losing hope. What's the best way to do it?Recently had to drop out of uni and am now back in my home country where I can't speak the language or find a job. I'm so depressed and tired and my parents keep guilt tripping me about my failures. I've been planning to kill myself for a while now but I think I'm going to get serious about it. The easiest would probably be to jump but I don't want to do it from my apartment building since I live with my parents rn and I don't want to traumatize them like that.

What are the easiest and most surefire ways to take my own life? I don't really care about pain since I don't necessarily deserve an easy death. Just something quick and that'll get the job done for sure. Preferably no guns since I can't get those. Knife is ok but tbh I'd rather not. 


Thank you.
