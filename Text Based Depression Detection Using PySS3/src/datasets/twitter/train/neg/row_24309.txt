Why do you care?I could tell you a story about how i'm some suicidal maniac who hates himself and mostly everything. Knowing this community, you would probably read it and comment like you care. Maybe you do, but you'll forget about me in a week. Why do you "care" about me?

Also, if I have mental problems and have thoughts of murder suicide, it's everyone else's fault for not helping. Yet if I act on this, i'm suddenly an asshole and people would be glad I died. Why do people pretend to care?
