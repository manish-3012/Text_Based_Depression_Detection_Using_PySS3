I don't think I can keep goingI don't want to sound cliche by saying a girl broke my heart and now I want to die but it really boils down to that
Every girl I've dated has always left me for another guy, gotten married and had kids
I always knew I'd end up killing myself I just can't find the courage to do it
I'm so empty and alone and my head is numb and loud all at once
I don't know how to stop thinking about her with him
I don't know how to stop regretting not trying harder when she was mine

Aren't we built to spend our life's with somebody else? What's the point in being happy if you can't do it with somebody else? I've been so lonely my whole life and the 2 relationships I've had, I've ruined entirely.

Every birthday I have I realise I'm getting older and all my friends have partners and are getting married and having kids and I've never even come close to that. I can't go through life being alone, I can't do it
