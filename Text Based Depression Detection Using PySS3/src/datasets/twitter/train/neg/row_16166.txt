I keep lying to my therapistShe has asked me more than once if I am sucidal.  I wonâ€™t tell anyone that I am because they will dismiss my claims and feelings and write me off even more than they have already.  Truth is, I want the people that lied to me, these people that I love, to see my dead body and bullet hole in the back of my head.  I want them to see what they created.
