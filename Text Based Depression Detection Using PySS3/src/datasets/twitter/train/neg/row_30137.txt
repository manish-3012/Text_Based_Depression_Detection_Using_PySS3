Have you ever wondered if there was more to life, other than being really, really, ridiculously good looking? Unfortunately, I'm ugly.

edit: Sry about using a movie quote, I just found that the humor has a cold core of truth. I hope I'm not being shallow and obsessive about looks, but it looks like my ugliness belies every other aspect of me.
