Feeling really down on myselfNot going to go into much detail because it exhausts me to think about. TL;DR: my sister set up me up with a douche bag friend of hers without telling me he's a huge player. He led me on and made me think that he liked me, just so he can get sex out of me. He slept with my sister the night before sleeping with me. Sister blamed me for it. Family refuses to talk to me about it. I'm so angry at myself for being so naive and stupid, mad at my sister for setting me up with this scumbag, mad at myself for not seeing the red flags and listening to my gut, tired of pretending everything is fine, tired of not having my family to rely on and having to sit at the dinner table pretending it's all good. I need some help... how can I feel better? I hate myself right now.
