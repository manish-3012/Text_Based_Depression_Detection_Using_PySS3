Ran away for a better life. It got worse.I moved across the country. Iâ€™ve been here a year. Nothing has gotten better. I havenâ€™t been able to have a moment of my life to myself without consistently working. I have no friends. The friends I thought I had are very close with each other so they donâ€™t really talk to me. I hate my job. I get excited about life and get shot down consistently. I ran away to prevent suicide, and I think I just encouraged myself to do it further. 

I think Iâ€™ve had enough. I donâ€™t want to keep doing this everyday. This life sucks.
