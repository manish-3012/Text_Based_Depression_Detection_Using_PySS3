I feel like I'm having a breakdown and want someone to ramble my fears to.I'm so overwhelmed and scared right now God fucking damnit I hate myself

I keep having these fears I can't handle it I feel like everything is falling apart and I don't even know if it's real or in my fucked up head that likes to make up shit
