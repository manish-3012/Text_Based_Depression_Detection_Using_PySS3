I want to kill myself to get back at peopleSometimes I'm so angry at people or they've hurt me in such a way that I fantasise about offing myself just to make them feel bad or upset. This isn't my core reason for wanting to end it but it's a contributing factor.

Making them suffer how I have suffered for too long - thinking this also lets me know that I am an awful person who probably deserves death anyway.
