ExhaustedI am okay around others. But when i am alone, things quickly decline and my baseline is to think about how i want to end it that will be the nicest to my loved ones. I just lie in bed, don't move, don't clean, don't shower but you would never know when i'm out on the weekend. Another weekend has gone by and i just notice how everyone is so concerned about their own happiness that they forget or fail to notice if anyone else is doing okay. Even if they do notice, it's hard because without the conversation you still feel unseen. I know a lot of ways to improve my mood but i really am that lazy and i feel like i am giving up on myself. 

Any words of advice will help at this moment, thank you for your time.
