I think today is the day guys...I already have suicidial thoughts for over 3 years.  
I've never been so depressed in my entire life.  
And I'm not depressed beacause I have no friends or abusive family.  
I want to kill myself because I know I'll never be successfull.  
I will never reach my goals.  
I asked for help and the only answer I got is..  
"That's life, deal with it."  
So no thanks, I prefer to not deal with it.  
Goodbye folks.
