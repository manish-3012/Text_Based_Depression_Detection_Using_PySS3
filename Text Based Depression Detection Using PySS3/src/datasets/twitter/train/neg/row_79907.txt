I was think I hit as low as my life I can go then the next day happensI thought things were going better in life I finally made myself a friend. Not just a coworker I'm on good terms with but an actual friend. But then I discovered that they are in a horrible relationship that I can't do anything about and I'm forced to listen and watch them suffer wanting to do anything I can to help but I can't. It seems the more I learn about other people and the world the worse everything gets ignorance truly is bliss I wish I can go back to the days when I didn't know about hunger,war,abuse,suffering and loss. I wish I could just wake up go to school talk about cartoons and eat sugar filled snacks then go home and be ready for the next day excited for what was to come. It feels like it was a lifetime ago. It was only 15 years. It honestly doesn't even feel like that was my life it feels like I'm looking through someone else's eyes. I just wish I could have a happy day.
