You know it's a problem when suicide starts to look like a good optionDiagnosed with depression. No on meds currently, previously prescribed prozac. jobless. issues submitting paperwork for my degree to actually be awarded. All classes are done. no concentration. no energy. sleeping too much and too little. living on my mom's couch. still recovering from a major break up from a few years ago, learning to let go. problems helping out financially, spiritually, emotionally. on my last leg here. teeter tottering between life and death. last week i woke up and thanked God for another day, today I dreaded waking up. No substance abuse. No drugs, no alcohol, no pot, just plain old mental disease. ghosts from my past continue to haunt me. dealing with issues of morality. dealing with issues of self doubt. dealing with imposter syndrome. feels good to write this out. forgetting the reasons why I fight to stay alive. "suicide doesn't take away the pain it gives it to someone else" - this quote keeps me from moving in that direction. no more pain. i feel my chest caving in. my heart is heavy. brain chemistry blocks my outlook. i just want to feel normal. ive gained a lot of weight. suffering in silence. ill prepared to take on life's challenges at this point. emotionally i don't feel like I have what it takes to make it.
