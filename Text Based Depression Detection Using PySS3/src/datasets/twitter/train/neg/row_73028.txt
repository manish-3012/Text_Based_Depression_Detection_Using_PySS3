Is guilt a good enough reason to live?Ive spent the last 5-7 years dancing with suicide, never letting it out of my mind. But each time I reach a point where I think I should end it the thought that keeps me going is the guilt. 

I know it would crush my mother and my sister and I know it would lead to her fighting with my stepfather to the point of no return. I then think of my debts, My car that must be paid off, the thousand dollars I will forever owe my sister. 

Thoes are the thoughts that keep me alive the same guilt that drains my will to live is the only thing to keep me going.

I don't know what to do now. Barring a lottery win I know I will never be happy, this kind of society just doesn't work for me. I see people working around me and the thought of reaching their age with this kind of job just makes me miserable. I wonder every day how they haven't killed themselves yet. 

Im terrible at school, can't save money worth a dam and I get no joy from this work, sleep,  pay back lones lifestyle. 

Sure someday in 20/30 years I may have things paid off but by then what's thepoint.
