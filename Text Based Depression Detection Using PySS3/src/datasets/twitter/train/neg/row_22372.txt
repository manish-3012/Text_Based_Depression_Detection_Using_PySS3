I canâ€™t shake thisI donâ€™t want to live a life where the woman Iâ€™m madly in love with has left me. I grew up in a damaged and very violent family. Iâ€™ve never had a healthy relationship. Sheâ€™s left, she wanted me to move 1400 miles to be there for our babyâ€™s birth. I wanted to move but it wasnâ€™t fast enough and she was becoming depressed. I couldnâ€™t keep letting her down with her never knowing when Iâ€™d arrive. I love her with all of who I am, and all Iâ€™ve ever done is hurt her. I canâ€™t live with myself. Iâ€™ve never felt this much pain. If Iâ€™m not dreaming of her with another man, Iâ€™m dreaming of all the friends Iâ€™ve lost. This Memorial Day had me on the ropes and I just donâ€™t think I can beat it this time.
