BlahI've always dealt with depression and suicidal thoughts.  I attempted once as a kid but got scared.  I've always felt guilty about how it would affect my family.  Well I'm older now, and I don't care too much about how it would affect my family, however I have a child who means the world to me.  Up until today, I felt like suicidal thoughts were behind me because I could never do that to my baby boy.  Hit a rough spot today and found myself overly comfortable with the thought.  Not sure what to do.  Not sure why I'm even posting this cause it doesn't matter what anyone else says.  Just therapeutic I suppose.  I'll leave this up long enough to get embarrassed then delete.  Stay strong fam.
