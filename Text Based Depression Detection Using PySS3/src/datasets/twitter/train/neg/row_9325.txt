This sucks but Im probably going to have to do it soon.I fucked things up. I keep fucking things up. I have a job interview for Monday that I got because my mom drove me to the place. I can barely leave my house 6 days out of the week so how the fuck am I going to be ok to work any day. If I fuck up my interview that gives me more time I guess. My ex who I was slowly fixing things with saw that I like a shit ton of girls pictures on instagram. It sounds shallow and sick as fuck but thats all I want to do. Sleep around. But it doesnt work because I cant leave the house because I feel like shit. I have no other goals or ambitions. I literally can't do this anymore. I just need the courage.
