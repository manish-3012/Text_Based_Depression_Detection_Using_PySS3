I lost my coping mechanism I'm scared I'm going to hurt myself.My only comfort broke today, my ps3. I know that sounds so silly but I've suffered from severe depression and suicidal thoughts for awhile, when I played my ps3 it reminded me of my childhood and I was so happy but now it's gone, and I looked it up online, it isn't fixable I don't know what to do anymore...
