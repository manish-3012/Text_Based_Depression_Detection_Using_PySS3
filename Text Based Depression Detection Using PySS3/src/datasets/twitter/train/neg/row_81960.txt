RevelationSomething broke inside me today...  
I'm so broken, I'm always surprised at just how much left there is to break...  
But it broke, the something, and suddenly I see just how disgusting everything truly is.  


Life is disgusting.  
*Existence* is disgusting.  
A small stain on the purity of eternity.  


Rather than clean it up, life just wallows in it like pigs in mud.  
If people want to wallow, let them.  
But I'm tired of being disgusting. I'm tired of my own selfish wallowing.  


I want to clean myself, rid my small speck of filth and become pure once more and not have to face this disgusting reality.
