I can't sleepIt's 2am here and the only thing I keep thinking about is how I am a waste of space. I don't know how I can keep putting up with this. Then the arrogance of people saying oh but how will people who care about you feel? First, who cares about me? Second, am I supposed to live in agony so someone else doesn't get sad I'm gone? I just want to put my fucking head through the wall. I want to scream. I want to thrash. I just... Idk. I don't want to be.
