I'm tired of trying anymore.I don't know where to start. I'm a struggling mom, with PTSD, and several other mental health issues. I feel like I can't reach out for help in my state because I've been using marijuana to help with the PTSD flashbacks and anxiety. My husband is a great guy, but we're stagnant in the bedroom, and he's stopped helping around the house. The kitchen is a mess, but it's also a huge trigger for me. My step father would beat the shit out of me while I did the dishes for not cleaning them fast enough, then later in the evening I would be sexually abused by him. 

I'm just done with everything. I'm not good enough of a parent to my kid. I'm not a good enough spouse. Christmas isn't going to happen this year for my 3 year old; not even sure if we'll be able to pay rent and electric bills at this point. 
I haven't had a break from my kid in over a year, before her heart surgery. I'm so stressed, I yell all the time and it makes me feel so shitty. 

I should just end it. My family would be happier without me, and get survivors benefits from SS...
