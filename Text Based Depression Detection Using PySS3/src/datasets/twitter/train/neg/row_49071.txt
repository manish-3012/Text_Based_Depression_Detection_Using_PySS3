iâ€™m going to take my life tonighti feel pathetic because itâ€™s my sixth attempt but this time itâ€™s not an impulse-based shitshow of a suicide attempt. i wrote my note, i did my research, i know how long it will take and i feel at ease about death.

iâ€™m scared that the stab will hurt but apparently if i do it right oxygen will stop going to my brain and iâ€™ll loose consciousness after 1 minute, shortly after i will bleed out. 

i feel like i did everything i could and there is nothing left for me in this life. iâ€™m not sad when writing this, earlier i cried and i realized it was because i was so happy that i didnâ€™t have to be in pain anymore. 

the only reason iâ€™m writing this here is to materialize this into existence a bit more and to let my nerves calm over the fear of being pain. 

i heard death feels comforting. 
i canâ€™t wait.
