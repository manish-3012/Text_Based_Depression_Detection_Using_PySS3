I don't know what to do about my friend.I have a friend of mine who has just started cutting themselves furiously, and basically making me feel guilt with their threat of suicide on a nightly basis because they have forced themselves into believing they have lost all of their friends when in reality he just stopped talking to everyone. _x000D_

I don't want to go into details unless asked, but I just don't know what to do to help him. I went through cutting years ago, and it doesn't really phase me seeing someone else do it I just can't get over the immaturity of the act._x000D_

Edit: Thank you all for the great advice, but I figured I should throw in this detail that I left out when I posted this - I have told him my honest opinion and that he needs to give people more of a chance. I was in his position at one point where I would cut and bring that problem to other people to try and show them I need help of some sort. He is like family to me, and it pains me to see him like this but I  have explained to him he can come to me and talk, but I can't help him or save him, he will have to overcome this in time.
