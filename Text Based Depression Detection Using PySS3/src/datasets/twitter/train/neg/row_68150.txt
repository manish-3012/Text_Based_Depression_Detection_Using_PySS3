Just... tired of life.i'm an 18 year old male in my first year of college. some stuff about me; I'm really shy and introverted which makes it really hard to make friends. I always hear about how college is the easiest place ever to make friends, but I don't think that's true when you're like me. I've never had a girlfriend, no first kiss or anything, so the stigma that comes with that makes it really awkward for me to deal with girls. I'm really sick of going to school, I only am in college because my parents expect me to. Honestly, I just wish I could lay down, close my eyes and then be gone forever. Nobody would notice if I was gone anyway. I'm so tired of trying, trying to be normal and have normal relationships, trying in school, trying to please people. I want this to be over. I want to be gone.
