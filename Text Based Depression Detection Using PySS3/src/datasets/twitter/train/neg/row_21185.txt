a little rantSo Iâ€™m using a throwaway for obvious reasons. I havenâ€™t told anyone this.
Iâ€™ve been intensely depressed lately, it hurts physically to be alive- i wake up and go to sleep crying. Anyway so yesterday I went to drink on the park with some friends and I drank far too much, hoping it would make me happy or numb. It did for a bit but on the way home, I got off the train in the middle of nowhere, sat in a park and had a mental breakdown. I mean, properly sobbing- i called Samaritans hoping theyâ€™d be able to tell me why iâ€™m suicidal even when iâ€™m happy, but they were utterly useless and only responded with â€œmmm...mmm...that must be hard.â€ So i hung up and cried for an hour or so on the random park before heading back to the train station and god i wanted to chuck myself over the tracks so badly. So badly. I was too pussy to do it though. I got on the train and cried all the way home and couldnâ€™t think about anything other than killing myself. 
Yeah. I havenâ€™t told anyone that- nobody knows the extent of my depression. Why am i suicidal even when iâ€™m happy, Reddit?
