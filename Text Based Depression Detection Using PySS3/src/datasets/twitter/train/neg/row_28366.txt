A year ago today I said if I wasn't significantly better, I could finally end things. I'm worse than I was last yearI had a suicide plan a year ago. I promised myself I had to give it another year to give things a chance. Well here I am a year later. And honestly I've never wanted to die more. Not even in my previous suicide attempts. It's barely that day, just past midnight here, and I'm hysterical over how shitty I still feel. I don't know if I'm going to end things. I promised two people I wouldn't. But I don't know that I can continue on like this. I can't do another year. I can't even imagine a tommorow anymore
