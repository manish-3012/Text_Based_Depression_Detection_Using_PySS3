Feeling HopelessI'm in my first year of college. I've been missing a lot of classes this week. I don't really see the point in going anymore. I would just sleep and not go to class. I think I failed my chemistry exam yesterday. I've haven't felt like shit for a while. I don't know why I'm in college when I'm fucking stupid. I either didn't study enough for the exam or I blanked out because I forgot how to convert grams to moles and find molecular formulas. This is legit high school chemistry, and I didn't know how to do any of it. I used to do very well in school, but now I'm hardly passing. I remember when I got A's, but it hasn't been like that since first semester of junior year of high school. I don't know why I suck at school now. Everything seems hopeless. I really don't want to drop out nor disappoint my parents. Most of all, I'm disappointed in myself.
