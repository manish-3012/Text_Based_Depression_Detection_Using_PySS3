Iâ€™m 19, just got into a pretty good wreck with an odd situation, have had one prior wreck recorded and feel like giving up.No matter what I do Iâ€™m always told that I wonâ€™t be able to or should do what I want. The only things Iâ€™ve ever really done that I wanted other than my girlfriend is my job and my car. I plan and install aftermarket audio in cars and purchased the car Iâ€™ve wanted for $4000, and put about $3,000 worth of work into getting it where I want. Needless to say, I just got into a wreck that most likely totalled that car and I have liability insurance. Itâ€™s clearly her fault but her insurance company is adamant that itâ€™s mine, despite my insurance company arguing otherwise as well. Iâ€™ve had a history of depression and recently got into a spot where I felt comfortable coming off my meds and thatâ€™s lasted about 2 months. But, all good things come to an end. I just duct taped a hose to a can and that can to my muffler tip and put the hose in my trunk and started it up. Now, Iâ€™ve lost my catalytic converter and was saving up to get another one (test pipes are cheaper and cat was torn open) so I have plenty of co. I told myself that if I last ten minutes Iâ€™m gonna go on with life and if not weâ€™ll, yk. I set a timer for 10 mins, started my wrecked pos and sat and waited. All Iâ€™ve gotten is a burning nose and sweaty as hell. Iâ€™ve got three minutes left
