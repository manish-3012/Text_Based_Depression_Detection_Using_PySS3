Goodbye, tell the people who cared that I loved them.I've decided I'm killing myself tonight. 50 klonopins/clonozepams and downing 2 bottles of rum. To make sure I die, I self harmed a bunch and have sliced into a vein. 

I'm just so tired of living. I'm tired of this existence. I'm tired of being me. I'm tired. I'm so, so tired. 

I'm living a lie. I'm not even living, I feel like I'm stuck. I'm stuck and for what? My family doesn't want me around, my friends have long forgotten my existence, my online friends are better off without me. I do nothing but give people grief. I'm surrounded by people waiting to tear into me and rip me apart to shreds. I am loved by people online but no one knows me. No one really knows how miserable I am because I pretend I'm not. I'm a waste of intelligence and beauty. I'm a waste of air. I'm emotionally stunted and yet I'm not even allowed to feel, if I feel anything at all. No one knows what I do for them without them knowing, and none of the effort matters. I wish I could believe all this pain was worth it, but I know it isn't. What is the point in my existence? I make no difference in the works, the world is not impacted by me. 

I'm barely coherent, I keep nodding off, I don't know if I'll finish this note even. 

But to the people that cared so much about me, even if you were so far away I couldn't give you a hug: I love you, all of you. Don't forget that. But you're all better off without me. I'm doing you a favour. You'll be sad now, but with time you'll thank me. 

I can barely keep my eyes open. Time to slip away.
