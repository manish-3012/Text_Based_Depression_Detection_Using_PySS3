I donâ€™t even know anymore. Itâ€™s becoming too much to deal with.Hi, 

Iâ€™ll start by saying that I donâ€™t really know why Iâ€™m posting here. I feel so overwhelmed with everything right now. I have no one to talk to and Reddit is kind of anonymous I guess..

Just had a heated argument with my mum, where she was talking about my weight and Iâ€™m like, Iâ€™m trying to lose it, contacted a personal trainer etc. Her comeback was â€˜yea, until she runs away from you like the last one didâ€™. Apparently my last personal trainer told her that she wished I wouldnâ€™t talk about my problems with her (side note: she said if I have any, feel free to talk about them, so I did..)

Donâ€™t know what to do anymore feel like such a wreck. The above isnâ€™t even the top of the iceberg. Iâ€™m 26, still living at home, work isnâ€™t going well, have no social skills, canâ€™t see a way out. The only way I can think of keeps popping into my head. 

Sorry this is long winded and all over the place. Just donâ€™t know what to do..
