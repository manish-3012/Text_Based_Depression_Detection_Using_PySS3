there isn't really any reason to go onHonestly... 

I don't see myself ever getting better. I definitely have stress from school with all the homework, tests, and projects that are being piled on, I've been having other problems. I have indeed been to the doctor and have received MRIs on my brain and spine, but they all came back with nothing wrong with me. My memory is really the main issue along with this, as I have lost basically everything I ever knew besides a few faces very close to me. I forget things minutes after learning about them, and I lose track of time. I do have some other weird things, but they don't really provide any context. People don't understand me, and they always assume nothing is wrong with me. I have no one to turn to because of them not understanding. They either think I am exaggerating, or just want attention and because of the MRIs coming back fine I don't have any proof.
It seems easier to just die than have to deal with all of this.
