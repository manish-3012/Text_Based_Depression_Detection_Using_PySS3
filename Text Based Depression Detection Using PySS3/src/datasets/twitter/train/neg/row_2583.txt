Limbo between empty life and not being dead yetI can't make myself want anything enough to go after it. I just want to sleep and not wake up. If I could trade lives with someone who could make better use out of it I would. I don't deserve to be here and I don't want to be here. I can't make plans when all I want to do is die. I'm a shit friend. I'm a waste of space and life. I'm just a selfish piece of sad traumatised shit and I only get worse. I don't know how people go on. I'm jealous of happy people. I kind of hate them. How are they doing that? It makes me feel even shittier about my pathetic self. I don't know how people get up and go to their jobs every day. I don't know why more people don't kill themselves. I'm so empty. I don't want to live. I want to die. I wish I could just do it.
