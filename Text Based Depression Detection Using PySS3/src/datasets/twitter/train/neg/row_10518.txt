Iâ€™m really thinking about it this timeIâ€™ve been depressed a lot recently from school but seeing my awful grades and realizing that Iâ€™ll never be as good as my peers (and that theyâ€™ll never care about me like I care about them) is making me actually feel like killing myself. Before this moment, the thought of what my future holds has kept me from doing it. But I donâ€™t think my future holds much of anything besides me being a disappointment and a loser. 

Iâ€™m really, really distraught. I donâ€™t know what to do. I wish I could just end it all. 

I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m posting here. Iâ€™m sorry.
