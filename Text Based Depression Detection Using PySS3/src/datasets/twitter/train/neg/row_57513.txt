what it takes to not diei know very well what would help me

i described and explained what, why and how it would help me to people i know


and yet they decide they dont want to help me. nah. nothing. not even some basic fucking care for someone they oh so like.


few words. few clicks on screen to send a god damn facebook stickers. thats all it took to not cause a complete break down. 


you know what? ill be gone. no more texts from me. so you can be happy. i aint worthy of hugs anyway.
