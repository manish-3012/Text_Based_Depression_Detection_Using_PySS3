My husband and I just got in a fight. He broke a plate and said he was defective and couldnâ€™t do this. He said he was gonna drive somewhere and shoot himself outside of the car so I could have it. He left but there doesnâ€™t seem to be guns missing. What do I do?He has PTSD. Heâ€™s been getting depressed and disconnected over the past few years and Iâ€™m too exhausted to think straight. 

I donâ€™t want to call the cops on him without a GOOD reason bc heâ€™ll lose his job. Heâ€™s only threatened suicide a few times and itâ€™s always in a panic attack. Heâ€™s just never told me a plan before. 

Iâ€™m just really tired and scared and idk how to make a good decision right now please help.
