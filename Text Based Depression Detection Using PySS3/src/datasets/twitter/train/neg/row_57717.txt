I need to know how to help my friendMy friend said he was going to commit suicide, and with doing so no one would care. Not even his girlfriend. He didnâ€™t tell me but he did talk to his girlfriend about it. She contacted me knowing Iâ€™m one of his best friends. He didnâ€™t open up like this to me we where making jokes and having a good time texting. Until he suddenly stopped answering my texts. And his girlfriend asked me if he told me that. My friend is 14 and pubescent
