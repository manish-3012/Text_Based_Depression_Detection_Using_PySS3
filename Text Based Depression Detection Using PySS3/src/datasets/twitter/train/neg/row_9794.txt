I dont see any point leftMy life has completely fallen apart. Most of the things important to me have disappeared from my life, and the only meaningful thing I have left is gone. My mental state has withered to the point which I cant come back from, and I'm the shadow of a person. My family are unsupportive and my girlfriend passed away recently. I think I'm done.
