I don't want to die but the world wants me tooI don't want to die, I'm a great guy not gonna lie. But other people don't see that for some strange reason and my family are pathetic and useless as are my "friends". Which I barely have any left. Everyone either hates me or ignored me and I can't understand it. My social anxiety prevents me from meeting new people and getting a job. I want too meet new people and have a job but if I can't best this illness then I don't see the point in being alive anymore. I really don't want to die but it's what I need to do and everyone else clearly wants it.
