Not doing particularly well today.Today is not the day, but suicide is all I can think of.  
  
I should be feeling pretty good. I've a vacation planned in September and some great friends that will be joining me. Yet all day long (or month) I've been imagining severing an artery in my neck or tying myself to a tree.  
  
I've been suicidal for 9 years. I have my ups and downs, my existential crises, my bad breakups, but I'm afraid it's good old-fashioned love-sickness that might one day push me over the edge.  
  
There's also the fact that all things break, time destroys everything, and I see no evidence of the divine. I can't find pleasure in many things, I can't summon the energy to do the things that I actually want to do, and I can't crawl out of the pit of sadness and negativity that I so often call home.  
  
I wrote a poem recently. I think it came out pretty good; it expresses what I've never quite been able to:  
  
Some can find the joy in things,  
No matter what the future brings.  
But I have always been the one  
To cry before the thing is done.  
  
I recently learned the term "adult separation anxiety" and it hit me like a ton of bricks. (If you would like to feel young, or like a dog, I highly recommend it.) It seems to explain all the insecurities I feel about the people I care about, all the energy I spend on not appearing "needy" or "clingy" because I couldn't bear to push people away, and it explains why I want to kill myself when I think about how the person I need the most will likely be moving away someday.  
  
I don't know why I'm asking you to read this. Like I said, it's not a great day and I really need to unload some pain. Thank you all for being here. What a wonderful world it is where all the depressed and desperate people can all find each other, and I mean that.
