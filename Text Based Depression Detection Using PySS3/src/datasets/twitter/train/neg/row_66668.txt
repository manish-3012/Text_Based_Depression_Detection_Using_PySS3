This is what I deserveIâ€™ve realized that everyone I ever knew would be better off without me. Iâ€™m just a selfish, lazy piece of trash that drags down anyone unfortunate enough to really know me. I donâ€™t think there is any hope of recovery for the cancer that I am. I have to accept that I will never be a good person. 

Sometimes Iâ€™m afraid of death but I think deep down I know itâ€™s for the best. I donâ€™t want to hurt my loved ones but I just want to die. Iâ€™ve been through so much shit and Iâ€™m just so tired of trying to hold on. Iâ€™m sorry to the people who care about me, I wish I could have been stronger. Hopefully Iâ€™ll be gone soon
