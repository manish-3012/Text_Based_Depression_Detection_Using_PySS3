Do I need to get help?I've been going through a lot recently and I've been getting more and more depressed. I used to push suicidal thoughts out of my head. But now when I think of ending my life, it scares me, but it seems like it at be soothing in a way... I don't think death should be soothing. I dunno if I wanna keep living or not. I'm trying really hard because I have an amazing girlfriend that I love more than anything and I really don't wanna hurt my family.
