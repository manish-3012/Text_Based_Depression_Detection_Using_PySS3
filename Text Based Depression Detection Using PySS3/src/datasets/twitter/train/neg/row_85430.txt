Botched plastic surerI had face lift, neck lift, &amp; upper &amp; lower eye surgery 2 weeks ago.  TOTALLY BOTCHED.  The so-called surgeon made the incisions under my eyes BELOW my lashes - totally VISIBLE on my face so I look like a FREAK.  My face lift is a disaster.  My neck was pulled so tight I can hardly lift my head (HUGE SCAR underneath -- even though they told me it would be a 'tiny' 1/2 inch incision).  I feel totally suicidal and almost jumped out of a window the other night -- the only thing that stopped me was the knowledge of my 17-year old son at home.  I had this surgery in India (no one in my family knows yet), but I will be flying home in 2 days.  I am horrified by their reaction.  Not only will I NOT be able to pay for revision surgery, but with the scars the way they have been made (me being totally butchered), there is only so much they could do anyway to fix me.  I have now seen a VERY reputable surgeon in Mumbai, as I was seeing infection &amp; incisions not healing - he told me that whoever did this surgery, was 'clearly not skilled regarding these procedures'...  That's putting it MILDLY.  My life is ruined.  I am currently unemployed, but was planning on looking for work immediately upon my return from India.  NO ONE WILL HIRE me looking like this!!!  This is the main reason I had the surgery - to look a bit more refreshed for the job market (I am 54 years old, &amp; will need to work for many more years to survive as I have no savings &amp; no husband).
