It's all a matter of when, really.The slightest things make me angry and resentful. It's like dominoes, with each one being bigger than the one before. Unfortunately I'm smart enough to realize that it's really my fault that I get agitated so easily which manifests itself in helplessness and the realization that there is no cure. I'm unable to change and it's not going to end well. I don't want to hurt someone so it's gotta be me.

Fuck all of this.
