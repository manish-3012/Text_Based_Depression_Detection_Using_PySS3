54 days, I'll be alone.It's 4:23 AM, I can't sleep and I have work today. I want to end it but I want to wait until I'm alone in the house. 

Parents don't care if I'm gone. Sister's don't care if I'm around. No extended family to turn to.

In December, the entire family leaves for Europe. I want the last moments to be alone, and I can't wait any longer.
