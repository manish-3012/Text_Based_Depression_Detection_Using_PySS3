I intensely want to die.I would like to go to sleep and not wake up. I pray for this intensely to whatever higher power that may possibly exist. If Jennifer Gibbons of the Gibbons twins was able to will herself to die from a cardiac arrest to honor an agreement between herself and her sister, it may be possible for anyone to drive themselves to die during the night through sheer intensity of will. I want to die. I want to die. I want to die.
