I donâ€™t know what to sayFour years ago I was involved in an abuse Iâ€™ve situation. My â€œmotherâ€ and step father abused me physically, but it was the only time it was physical on a level worth taking me away from them. But my step sis and I had been mentally, verbally, and emotionally abused since I can remember. 

So for the past four years Iâ€™ve been suicidal off and on and with varying intensities... Iâ€™ve convinced myself not to kill myself so many times itâ€™s getting tiring. My current parent has brushed off my attempts of getting help so many times and Iâ€™m honestly afraid of seeking help... I donâ€™t know if I can hold out long enough to seek help. 

Iâ€™ve been having dreams of being r*ped since this year started, and they honestly make me scared. Iâ€™ve never been r*ped, just... harassed? I dunno. Touched in places I donâ€™t want to be without my permission and even after constant reminders. 

Yesterday I told her that I had another dream. She shook her head and said â€œI donâ€™t know anyone who has had as many dreams of being r*ped as you.â€ It sounded like she was blaming me. 

Recently Iâ€™ve been trying to get through how badly Iâ€™ve been haunted by my past and how my mental issues are getting. In the past I made so many suicide jokes that she threatened to send me to a mental hospital. Now I wish she wouldâ€™ve done it.

She wonâ€™t believe that I have depression. My friend told her therapist about me. Not only did she pretty much confirm I have depression, she said I should have been in a mental hospital, but I was walking around freely. 

For a bit of back story I used to scratch my arms in a small spot until it would bleed this left many scars, all of which are very visible because Iâ€™m extremely pale. She said I needed to stop because it looked like I was self harming. I lied to prevent drama. Now I cut my legs and wear pants. 

I keep thinking: â€œwhat if I hurt myself just enough to hospitalize myself? To open everyoneâ€™s fucking eyes maybe itâ€™ll get better...â€ but... I only know how to succeed. 

I literally donâ€™t know what to fucking do anymore... I want a future. I want to be able to transition a bit (Iâ€™m genderfluid) but life fucking sucks. And I donâ€™t wanna do it anymore.
