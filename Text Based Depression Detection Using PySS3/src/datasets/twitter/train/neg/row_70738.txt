Iâ€™m afraid.I can feel another attempt coming up.  I have a feeling itâ€™s going to happen on Friday as Iâ€™ll be alone and itâ€™s the anniversary of my late Motherâ€™s suicide.  Iâ€™ve been feeling it for a few days now.  

I am manic depressive bipolar with adhd but Iâ€™m not medicated because I canâ€™t pay for the appointment to get my refills nor can I pay for my medication half of the time.  

My stress level has increased so much this month due to my second roommate leaving their key on the doormat after clearing out their things while I was asleep one day and skipping out on rent.  This second roommate who I thought could help me turn my bad financial situation around after my first roommate, an on and off again ex of three years lived with me and used me.  Not paying for rent, food, using me in other ways. Causing me to fall deeper into debt.  Iâ€™m a month late on my rent and late on my car note.  The Cares Act for housing ends on the 25th so, Iâ€™m more than likely getting evicted with no where to go.  No friends with extra space and no family that is willing to let a fuck-up occupy their space. On top of having the rug pulled out on me by the second roommate, this month the person that I had been starting to romantically talking to ghosted me.  Weâ€™ve worked together at my job for almost 4 years.  They wonâ€™t even look at me when we pass each other at work.  

I feel worthless and I donâ€™t see things looking up in anyway. My last attempt wasnâ€™t successful because my sweet dog came and sat at my feet before I had a chance to finish swallowing pain meds.  That an the alcohol that I was mixing with the pills made me vomit up all the contents of my stomach.  

Without somewhere to live, I cannot keep my dog and cat alive, safe or fed.  Without my animals, I have no purpose.  I donâ€™t have anyone close to me who knows my struggles, both current and passed. Without my car, I have no means of transportation or a possible place to sleep.  

Iâ€™m afraid.
