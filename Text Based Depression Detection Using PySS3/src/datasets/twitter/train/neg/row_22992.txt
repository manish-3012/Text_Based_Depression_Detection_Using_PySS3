Tips for affected family member?Hi! I'm not depressed or suicidal but I have an 18 year old sister that's been caught in the cycle since 2013. She'll stay clean for a few months and then self-harm or make a suicide threat, rinse and repeat. Not really having many friends myself (autistic and socially awkward), I get kind of lonely when she's gone to a facility. =( Any tips to help me cope?
