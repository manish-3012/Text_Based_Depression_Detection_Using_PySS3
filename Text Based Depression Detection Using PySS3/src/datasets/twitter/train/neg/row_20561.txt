Joining a esport club and not feeling respectedYeah I joined a team club for League of Legends. Silver players only so that we can have fun and be slightly competitive. There were two guys and 3 girls (including myself) plus the coach and 4 other members of the club that didnt want to be on the team.

The guys started ordering us girls around saying we have to play certain champs we were uncomfortable playing with. The top laner was really rude to our mid laner. I tried to speak up but the coach and other players (besides the girls) werent listening.

I hate that I cant try to join something competitive without the guys putting down the girls. It makes me want to kill myself. I feel so worthless.

The bot laner and I split off from the group to practice our partnership and our playstyles worked well together. We won all 3 games we did together. We came back and played another game with the group and all we got was unwanted advice from the guys about our builds and how we weren't having an impact on the game even though we were winning our lane and they werent speaking up.

I hate that I'm going to have to deal with men looking down at me because I'm a girl. Because we have different ways of communicating. I'm not blunt and in your face. I try to think through my words and I dont like having to defend myself and other women because we shouldn't have to defend ourselves. We should have at least bare minimum respect for how we play.

This is going to happen more and more as I grow up. I just want to die.
