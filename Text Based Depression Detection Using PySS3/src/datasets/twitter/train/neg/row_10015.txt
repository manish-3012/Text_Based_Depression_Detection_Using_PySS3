Are you going to college after you graduate? If so, it's a great place to reinvent yourself. I didn't get a girlfriend until I was 19. I know it's hard, but if you just accept that rejection is possible and do everything you can to put yourself out there, you'll end up accepted more often than not.

Do you see a therapist about your ADHD and ODD? If so, I'd encourage you to talk to him about these issues.
