Life isn't made for people who lack social skillsThe world revolves around social skills.  Work, school, relationships, just interacting with people in general.  I have none of those. 

I'm so horrible with women.  I have very little experience and it fucking sucks when the occasional person comes up and asks how it's going with the ladies.  Nothing is going on.  I don't know how to talk to women.  I don't know how to ask one on a date.  I don't know which ones are single.  I can't approach the group of girls.  I can't fucking do any of that. 

I have only 1 friend but he's pretty busy so we can't do much.  I usually end up at home on a friday and saturday night.  After working all day though I don't really have the energy to do much of anything. 

I'm fucked when it comes to work after college.  It's not what you know, it's who you know.  I don't know anyone, I couldn't afford to do an internship (because I wouldn't be able to work in the mean time), all I'll have is a degree.  But a degree doesn't mean shit without knowing people and being able to sell yourself in the interview.  And it's kind of important in my field. 

I feel like I've wasted college.  I haven't gone to any parties, I haven't even been invited to a party.  I haven't found a girlfriend though school.  I haven't made any real friends to speak of.  It's all just been one huge waste.  And how will I meet women once I'm out of college?  If I couldn't get a girlfriend or get laid in college, how the hell will I manage when I'm out?

Life isn't made for someone like me.  I honestly forsee myself working some shitty trucker job until I get fed up with life.
