Need Coping AdviceSo basically I have Generalized Anxiety and Depression among other things, so there are many times in my life that I don't feel comfortable or happy. I do at times feel happy or in a good mood, but sometimes I feel myself stuck in moods of anger, bitterness, awkwardness, anxiety, discomfort, upset, loneliness, etc that are very intense. Especially if these feelings come from more non-tangible or unmendable things (chaos and outrage in the world, declining job market, confusion about religion etc)  I sometimes feel not as though I will never get out of these feelings, but that they will always return and I don't enjoy them. I fear the thought that I'm tired of feeling these ways or that I don't want to feel these ways anymore will lead to terrible decisions. Any advice to coping with these? I am on medication for this.
