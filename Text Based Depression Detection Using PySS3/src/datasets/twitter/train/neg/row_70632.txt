I've run out of options.I don't really want to die, but it's the same shit, day in, day out. Berated daily by the people I live with (mother, 5 year old brother, her boyfriend), telling me I'm "worthless, brain the size of a pea, won't make it in the real world, gonna have to sell myself on the streets, etc.". Fights are rare, but my mother regularly makes gestures like she's gonna haul off and punch me. They regularly threaten to throw me out, but the time I tried to leave, she followed in a car screaming at me 'till I got into the car. If I stay, I'm a lazy leech, if I go, I'm selfish for "abandoning" them. Can't win.


Nobody wants to hire a GED student with zero work experience and social anxiety. I go for days without leaving the house, because I have no money, no friends, nowhere to go. The rest of my family will not take me in. I don't have health insurance, either.


It's just seems pointless. I'm accomplishing nothing. They say it gets better, but it's just been a constant spiral downwards.
