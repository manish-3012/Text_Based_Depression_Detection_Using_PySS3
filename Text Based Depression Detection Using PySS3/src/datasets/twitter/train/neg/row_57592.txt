a modest proposalhi.
i have struggled with depression ever since i can remember. 
i have cut, abused medicine and have tried to sleep the pain away.
i feel like i am pretty good at faking life, at faking happy, at faking interest. 
i am 23, come from a loving family and have a handful of degrees.
but i still fantasize about killing myself every day. 
it has left me feeling exausted. 
i have written my sucide letters and planned the details about how i would do it. 
i am posting here, not because i want someone to talk me out of it.. whatever, you're not going to, maybe i won't, maybe i will, i have not decided yet. 
i feel like i would just really like someone to talk to who is going through the same thing. 
i feel as though mental illness is so stigmatized.
i feel safe hiding behind my computer, admitting these things to you, the internet. things i would never say to anyone who knows me. 
really i am just reaching out, looking for someone to talk to. 
looking for someone who can relate to what i am going through, who is not going to judge me... a friend.
