I lie a lot.Whenever the doctors or people ask me "you don't want to hurt yourself, right?" I always just say, "No. I just wish I wouldn't wake up." but it's a lie because I've spent hours and hours researching ways to kill myself that will be effective. I know how I'll do it, I just don't know when. I have nothing left. I feel like I should do it before the end of the year. Give everyone a clean slate for the new year.
