Born to dieThere is no point of living. Why am I going to get a job after so much schooling just to slave away until Iâ€™m useless, and then the youth after me pays for the rest of my sad existence. Iâ€™m going to convince my friend to buy me a gun fairly soon here so I can stop making excuses on why Iâ€™m still alive. Everyday people smile around me and it just pisses me off. How are they happy? Youâ€™re going to die. Youâ€™re going to become useless. All the good memories youâ€™ve made will be meaningless. People say sleep is the best escape. No, itâ€™s a spit in the face teasing you of something you canâ€™t have yet. Death.
