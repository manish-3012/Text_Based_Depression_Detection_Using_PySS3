Suicide date set, plan to jump off a cliff. Any advice on what to expect?Nobody has responded to my past posts and I plan to do this on my 26th birthday on the 10th Feb. But I honestly cannot wait that long.

I plan to get an uber (which will cost a ton) to throw myself off a cliff in a coastal area. I dont know whether it'll be painful or what to expect. And believe me, life wont get better. I've been like this for 4 years and my life is a living hell.

I actually want to do this in a few hours but I dont want to pussy out. So I was wondering how do you overcome that barrier of jumping? And beleive me I really want to die but it's still a hard thing to do.

Any responses on this would be helping me a ton. If this post gets ignored then it's just gods and the universes way of telling me that I should do it anyway.
