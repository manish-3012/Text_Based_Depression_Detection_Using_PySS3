Desperate to end it allI have been contemplating suicide almost non-stop for weeks. I think years of depression and falling into this whole on and off have damaged aspects of my mind. I have trouble making certain connections and while I used to be intelligent, I find it difficult to hold a conversation and find myself stuttering at times. The brain is a muscle after all and when you don't exercise it, it diminishes... All of this, and my stubbornness to try to get better again have lead to this decision. I have even tried to find people who are in the same mental state as I and who want to give up but all those that are serious about leaving this realm are in other countries... 
There is no one close to me in California who I can take the leap with it seems. What scares me the most is not being able to off myself and the impending doom of all my problems hitting me at once. 
I want to be dead. I do not want to live anymore.
