Iâ€™m concerned about losing my freedom to choose method because of the lockdownThey arenâ€™t actively enforcing it where I am yet, but they will. My plan has always been to walk into the ocean, and this crisis was gonna be my get out of jail free card. Iâ€™m not willing to live in whatever brave new world follows, so itâ€™s a must, but I donâ€™t want to get stuck and have to drink bleach and make my roommates deal with it also they need the bleach. 

Yet moving up my timeline to right now in case leaving becomes risking arrest... thereâ€™s still resistance in me. Things arenâ€™t bad enough yet, I have roommates I care about, friends I can still talk to, a roof, food. (I deeply apologize to those who donâ€™t have those things who I just made feel really bad. Feel free to rip me in the comments. If it helps I am not able to have romantic relationships and looks like Iâ€™m gonna did without ever being hugged again whether by virus or my own hand)

So which is worse? Leaving too soon or too late. If I make the wrong choice I know I wonâ€™t be capable of regretting it in the long run but somehow it still feels important to decide.
