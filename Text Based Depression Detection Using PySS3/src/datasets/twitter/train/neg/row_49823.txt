I (29f) am a complete fucking disaster.I hate myself completely. I hate how I look, my personality, basically everything. I get up, go to the gym, go to work, rinse repeat. I barely leave the house, I don't have any friends, I have never even had a boyfriend. While everyone else who is 29 is buying houses, having kids, getting married...here I am sucking at everything. I am basically exhausted and ready to give up.
