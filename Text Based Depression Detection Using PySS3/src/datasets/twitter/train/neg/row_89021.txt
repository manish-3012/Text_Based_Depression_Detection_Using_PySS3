I wish I didnâ€™t existItâ€™s 4 am and Iâ€™m having another night of no sleep. I have so much coming at me from different angles. Both of my parents are narcs but I have gone no contact and I am severely codependent. I am also married to a narc. I have had 4 children and relinquished all rights to the out of fear I would damage them like I was damaged... I feel stuck where Iâ€™m at emotionally. Itâ€™s like I have completely checked out and dgaf anymore... Iâ€™ve looked into going to a dual diagnosis center but it is cost prohibitive.. figures
