I don't enjoy lifeHey I'm a male 25 year old unemployed high school dropout with major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and panic disorder. I've been on multiple antidepressants over the past 6 years, and had counselling for 3-ish years but stopped because I didn't feel like it helped. My medication almost completely stopped my near daily panic attacks but it doesn't help much with anything else. I have family and friends that understand and care but I honestly don't care about anything at all. I had to put my dog down in October, my grandfather (whom I live with) had his second stroke earlier in the year, and two of my siblings have expressed suicidal thoughts, so 2020 has been a really rough year. My mother also attempted suicide unsuccessfully last year (she's doing very good now thankfully). I don't have a license so I can't drive. I'm scared of driving for both rational and irrational fears due to witnessing a person being hit by a car and killed. I don't want to work because I'm afraid of my anxiety getting in the way, and I'm so depressed that I don't have the motivation to find a job in the first place. I can barely even take care of myself, I shower maybe once a week, I don't brush my teeth, I don't get any exercise, I smoke, and all I eat is junk. I just don't care enough. Ironically I do keep my bedroom pretty clean. I don't even really care about gaming with friends or by myself anymore. I sleep A LOT, sometimes ~15 hours a day because I'd rather just be asleep than suffer being alive. I wouldn't necessarily say I'm suicidal, I'm too scared to do it, but I don't really want to live. Sorry if my post is all over the place, I'm not very good at expressing my thoughts and my head always feels foggy
