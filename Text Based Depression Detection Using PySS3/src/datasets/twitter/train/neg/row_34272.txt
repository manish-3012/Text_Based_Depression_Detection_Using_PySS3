Have tried to die 3 times in the psych ward this month already...And every time I've been brought back.

The first 2 they found me unconscious and just released the noose and gave me oxygen but the last I was unconscious and also not breathing. I woke up to receiving CPR and a week later I'm still bruised. I'm just so sick of living and know one day the nurses are gunna be too late, they'll come to check on me and find me dead. It's not fair on them to find me when their goal is the opposite, but in my mind it's better than say my roommate or family finding me. I just can't do this anymore.

I was having a deep conversation with a nurse yesterday about how I wish I could just be euthanised and my organs harvested for people who need and want them. The nurse even said "you're right, you could save like 15 people with the body you don't want". She's one of my favourite nurses because she just gets me, she gets how much I don't want to be alive and is just hoping eventually a treatment will work. I've been in the psych system for almost 7 years now and my hope is just dwindling away with each failed treatment.

I guess this is a vent more than anything. I'm still actively planning my death it's just hard when you're in a psych ward with limited resources and time. Eventually we all die I don't know what the point of delaying it is when life just isn't for you.
