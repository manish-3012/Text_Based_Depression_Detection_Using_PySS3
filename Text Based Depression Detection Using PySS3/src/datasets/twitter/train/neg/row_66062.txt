The only reason I havenâ€™t killed myself yet is that it would really hurt my familyI feel like Iâ€™m walking on thin ice and I donâ€™t know how much longer I can keep going. I have a plan on the how Iâ€™m just missing the when, I feel the day getting closer though. I feel like Iâ€™m letting them down cause I love them and if I through with this I know on some level they will blame themselves. I guess itâ€™s easier not thinking of how this will affect my friends since I managed to cut most of them out my life except for my roommates (for obvious reasons) even though I have tried. Iâ€™m just lost at this point and I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m coming back. I wish I wasnâ€™t this good at pretending Iâ€™m okay but Iâ€™m too much of a coward to ask for help.
