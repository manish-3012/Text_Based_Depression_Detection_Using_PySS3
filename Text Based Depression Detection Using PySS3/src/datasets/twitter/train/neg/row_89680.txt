I just can't do it, period.I don't know what else to do than writing this thinking how terrible my life is.

My parents got a divorce about a year ago, and my mom is thinking me and my brother and her are going to move away from my dad. I am not going to see him for 3 weeks and then I am moving. Never to see him again. I finally cried myself over this forcing me to get help. 

School is coming around and I am just so depressed and not focusing on school. I barely have no friends they broken away since I ain't active no more... I'm failing 1 class now... It just gets worse and worse. I look at myself in the mirror and I just mumble "failure" "loser" "pathetic"... Eh what's the point of living anymore.

I tried writing a diary but, it didn't help too much... I thinking about killing myself right on the spot in my house.

"I just can't do it" "just do it"
