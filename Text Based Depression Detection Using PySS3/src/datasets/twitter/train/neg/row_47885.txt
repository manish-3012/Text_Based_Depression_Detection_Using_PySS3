I'm killing myself todayI'm trapped in a relationship of hatred and fear. He doesn't love me anymore but it's dangerous to split us up. We're trapped together and I don't know what else to do. He doesn't understand that he's better off without me. I've done nothing for him except make him angry and scared and miserable and now he won't even talk to me

He was just trying to help and it wasn't good enough for me

I have nowhere to go

I'm cold and I'm going to kill myself today. I told him I wouldn't so he didn't worry. I told him I was too scared. I am, but I'm sure there are ways to numb the pain and get it over with. I don't have a plan yet, but I'm in the process of making one. 

I just wanted this out there before I go, or for the few who are curious enough to know what happened to me to check my profile. 

Goodbye
