Is this real?Right now it feels like Iâ€™m dreaming. Not just a feeling but itâ€™s like I literally AM dreaming. Itâ€™s like time itself has stopped and Iâ€™m just floating around as if Iâ€™m already dead or Iâ€™m a ghost or something. The rain drops outside have stopped in mid air. It feels like if I close my eyes and try hard enough I can change anything. I could do anything. Iâ€™ve wanted to fly. I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s real. Thereâ€™s writing on my walls and i didnâ€™t do it and i donâ€™t know whatâ€™s happening to me.
