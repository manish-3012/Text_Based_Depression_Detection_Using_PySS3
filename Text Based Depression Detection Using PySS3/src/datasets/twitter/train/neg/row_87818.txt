23 M - Looking for seriously suicidal person to chat to during final daysSo I plan to kill myself soon (third time lucky!). I was just wondering if there was anyone else in my situation that would like some friendship, companionship, etc. during their last days, as well as assisting with methods, and encouraging me to do it (I know that may cross the line). We can talk on whatsapp, skype, discord, whatever you like :) PM or comment me on here a brief bit about you and we can take it from there.
