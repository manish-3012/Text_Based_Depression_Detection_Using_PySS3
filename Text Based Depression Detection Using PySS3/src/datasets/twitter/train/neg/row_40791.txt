The dark part. By me.My mind is something of a sadness cave and when I write it helps. This is probably my first and my last. Who knows but here we go.


This weight in my chest is something of a pain that only gets heavier every day I live. I feel nothing anymore and death doesnâ€™t even scare me. I find pleasure in other people feeling grief, but I also feel sympathy. When I see that cliff edge there is nothing stopping me from leaping over except a small chain link fence.

I find myself not surprised with death anymore. I find it gruesome, entertaining, and maybe even some what of a slow, never ending board game. Some people decide to bankrupt early, while others decide to let fate take the wheel. 

My heart feels like itâ€™s about to burst like a volcano ready to erupt and I hope it does because I want to wonder what it will feel like.  Iâ€™ve always been like that, wanting to try new things. Death is still that one that I havenâ€™t been able to feel while still living. 

I want to live, but I want to die. Thank you
