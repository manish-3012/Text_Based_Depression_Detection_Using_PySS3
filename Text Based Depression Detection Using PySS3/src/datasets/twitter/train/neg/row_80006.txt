Sat up in bed this morning tying a noose.Tied the noose to the bed. Still can't seem to take myself seriously. This doesn't feel real, because surely if it were, I'd feel so much worse about planning my suicide with my partner downstairs? It just feels like the sensible option, with a bit of a hurdle to get over, like all big changes that require that initial big step, point of no return.  
 
I'd love it if they could just put me in a mental hospital for a few weeks to get my head straight, but I have a job and rent to pay for me and my partner.  


Cons:  
I don't want to ruin my partners memories of the house that we made our own. 

I don't want her to have to explain what has happened to my stepdaughter. 

I only just got life insurance recently and it doesn't pay out for suicide until you've had the policy for at least two years.
