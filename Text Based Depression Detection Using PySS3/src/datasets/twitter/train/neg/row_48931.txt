humiliated and suicidalI made a terrible, humiliting, gigantic mistake with my boss today and its making my suicidality worse. I was already feeling down on life and now this hot shame and embarrassment is making suicide seem all that much more appealing. Wishing I had access to fentanyl right now.... :( Sick of this feeling
