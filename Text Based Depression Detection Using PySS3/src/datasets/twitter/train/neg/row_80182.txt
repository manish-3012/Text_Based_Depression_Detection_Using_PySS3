brokenstill haven't ventured past the front garden since September of 2017, recently had my 19th birthday and my mother insisted I celebrate it, although I feel as if I have nothing to celebrate having been inside doing nothing for 3 years, she gets upset. I don't understand any of my emotions, I'm fucking stuck man. Planned to kill myself in July 2020, couldn't do it, couldn't finish school, can't live.
