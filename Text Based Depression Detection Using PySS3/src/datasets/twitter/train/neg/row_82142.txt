Am I suicidal?I'm not sad and nothing is going wrong in my life but I think about suicide all the time. It's like another part of my brain is telling me to kill myself even though nothing is wrong. It's been slowly getting worse everyday to the point where I wouldn't go through the effort of finding a building to jump off but if I had a gun in front of me I think I would shoot myself.
