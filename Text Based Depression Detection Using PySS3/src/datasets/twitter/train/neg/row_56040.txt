My StoryIÂ´ve struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts for as long as I can remember. Actually one of my first memorys is trying to strangle myslef at maybe 6 Years old. I\`ve since gone throug various ups and downs in my life but always accompanied by feeling not worth anything and a constant death wish. 

And I really dont know why. At least there is nothing obvious about why i should feel that way. I have great friends, I even had loving relationships with girls and I come frome a rather wealthy background. 

But it all doenst mean anything to me. I dont value anything in life. Maybe also because I suspect that i will always be feeling this. And if im feeling this fucked while everything is pretty fine i dont want people to rely on me because when life will get atually hard im pretty sure ill kill myselfe anyway and only cause more suffering (e.g. if i were to start a family). 

In my "defence": I have mental illness running in both my parents and their both suffering from it immensly. And ofcourse that fucked me up real good as child (emotional abuse &amp; neglect, a very unstable &amp; hostile home, etc. ) but iÂ´ve worked on that so much with so many people (proffesionals &amp; friends) that i donÂ´t think this will ever go by. 

So I pretty much come to the Conclusion that its better &amp; reasonable for me to go. I know that a lot of people would be really sad, but i think its not fair that i need to suffer trough my own hell just to have other people not feel pain? Especially since i feel it will happen eventually anyway and its probably going to get worth for them as well.

sorry for the unstructured thoughts, I just wanted to get some of my chest ...
