Just Want It To StopGoing nowhere.  I made a huge mistake about a year and a half ago and hoped that I might be able to hang on to some of my relationships and rebuild my life, but that hasnâ€™t really happened.  The person I loved left me because I had to move to find work (among other things), the job I moved for is nothing but a fucking dumpster fire day in and day out and I go home hating myself, I canâ€™t travel right now due to personal stuff and am stuck in a back water part of the fucking world with no hope of improvement right now.  

The only reason I havenâ€™t just ended things yet is because I know it would break my parents hearts.  Iâ€™m just not so sure that thatâ€™s enough for me to keep suffering through this hell Iâ€™ve created for myself.  

Havenâ€™t said this out loud to anyone and hope this is the right place for me to give voice to these feelings.
