Someone I don't know has left their final message withThis person reached out through Reddit saying they were going to end it. The comments in the sub it was posted in felt less than genuine, so I thought I'd respond more honestly. They ended up sharing their story with me, but also confirming there was nothing I could do to stop them. I managed to get basic information from them, but I don't know their full name or city, so I have no clue how to report it. They didn't want to leave a message for their relatives either. It was not a new account, and the karma showed that previous posts/comments had been deleted, so I cannot confirm it was real or not, and some parts of their story felt odd. However, if possible I'd still want their body to be found somehow. How can I, with the little info I have report something to a foreign authority?
