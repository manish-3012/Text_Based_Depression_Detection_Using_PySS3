Im 16 and have actually no one to talk to about my depression and suicidal thoughtsIts been exactly 5months since my best friend died i has been suicidal since.. depressed ive been about 2years and wow.. depression feels bad... i cant think of anything else than how im going to suicide (taking cyanide) seems easiest..
Insomnia, fatigue and really why live? We are going to die anyways? Waste of mental energy being sad all the time i dont talk to my family about it for them im just the â€œQuiet kidâ€ they dont know about my untreated a.d.d 
About my depression which is rather dysthymia to be honest. Any reply would help!
