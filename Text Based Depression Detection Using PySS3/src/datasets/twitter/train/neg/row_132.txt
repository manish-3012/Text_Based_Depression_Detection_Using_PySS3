What sin did I do in a previous life that had me be born a short man?Why and how am I not able to meet their height standard

I'm nothing that girls want

It's clear on both social media and in real life that girls don't desire short men at all,

and we should just go and die somewhere or something

My dad doesn't allow me to save up with *my own* money to get a leg-lengthening surgery, what's supposed to be my final hope of redemption

I will do anything to look good, to have the right to exist, and I can't even do that.

I just want to die
