Time to end itI think it's time, why bother with this anymore. It all hurts, it's pain to be alive. I havent been in school for like 3 months, didnt even realise its summer break for the half of it because I skipped school the 2 months previous to that. Im a loser that does nothing with my life, nothing brings me happiness. There is no future I want, no goals in life. My friends will forget me in month or two anyway, my mom will be sad but I cant live my life just for her. I have been collecting anti depressants for sometime now, I think I have enough. Todays the day. Goodbye
