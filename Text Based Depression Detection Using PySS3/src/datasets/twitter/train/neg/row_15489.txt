Lost.I'm a 20, almost 21 year old male. I'm above average intelligence, attractive, people seem to enioy being around me and I'm mostly personable. I love my job.


 But things aren't great right now. I might be getting fired tomorrow because I fucked up. I put myself into a few thousand in debt with financing because I finally had a job I liked. I love video games but for the past few weeks I've mostly sat at my computer  not playing anything. I can't get girls because I'm picky and have emotional damage. When I do finally find a girl that I like, it never works out(never had an actual girlfriend and only have had sex once). I also probably have schizophrenia but self diagnosis is bullshit so maybe I've tricked myself into thinking I have it. Things constantly don't go well for me, or if they do, they end up hurting me eventually. I'm just exhausted of everything. I just want someone to be with who actually cares about me. I'm a "student" but I've always struggled with school because I'm lazy and have been going to community college for 2 years but only have 12 credits despite being full time. I don't know what to do with myself. Nothing seems to work. I don't drink or smoke or do any drugs and I'm a vegan(it's not even something I talk about much, my family doesn't even know about it) and I'm constantly shit on about it by random people and friends too and it really hurts me because it's something I care about deeply. I'm only ever happy when I'm with someone that I like but I have no real life friends and like I said earlier, I struggle to develop romantic relationships.
