Thoughtful and deliberate choices
I think I'm done.

I'm 40.  I pride myself on my ability to solve complex problems and i've been extremely successful doing so in my work life.  Next year I stand to make more passive income than I know what to do with and I currently have more money than I can reasonably spend.  I'm not unattractive, I am down to my college weight, I eat healthy and I exercise near daily.  i.e. I'm not overweight and gross.  In fact, I'm moderately attractive as a Spanish/Asian mix.

Every relationship I've had in my life end in ridiculous tragedy or is just plain ridiculous.  

Oddly, the problem I struggle with most is in my personal life.  I approach women on a regular basis.  I get the occasional date, yet i'm unfulfilled.  As I require a certain level of intelligence and attractiveness.  Perhaps I'm too picky.  Still, women I'm interested in, they abhor me.  

I don't believe in God.  I think we're worm food.  We exist to continue the human race and to improve it.  I work everyday to improve the lives of everyone on the planet.  Yet, I don't think I'll be in any way part of the future through my lineage.  I have no path to a lineage.   It's troubling.

I wrote a will.  A good friend of mine whom, I hope, is living well has 5 children.  I'm leaving my money and estate to them for when they grow.

I have a gun.  I think I'm going to use it.  Forever sleep sounds nice.

Goodnight.
