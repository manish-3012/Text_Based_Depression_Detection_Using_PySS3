I went to jail over the summer.My mother sent me to jail on a fake DV charge. I spent the night in jail. I could have hung my self with how long the towels were and the holes on the bunk bed. I sat there choking and then I stopped. I should have continued. It was my best chance, nobody would have been able to save me. (The guards never came around.) I should have done it. The patches will do though..
