I'm a failureGeneric title, yeah. 

Depression can fuck off. My life is so shit. I'm facing being kicked out of university it's so bad and my attendance is non-existent.

But I'm an only child and I don't want to leave my parents alone. But I can't do this anymore.

I'm so confused and empty that I just want to sleep.
