I Don't Know Who Else To Go To.I feel like such a failure, and I just can't imagine myself going through life suffering such immense emotional and mental pain.

For the sake of Clarity, I am an eighteen year old with Aspergers Syndrome. It seems like for the entirety of my life, I've been held on some sort of pedestal simply because I'm well-behaved and polite. These are, at least in my own opinion, my only virtues. In school, I'm viewed in a similar light - even by the teachers whose classes I am currently close to failing. How the hell am I supposed to tell everyone that I'm just a fuck-up? I'm not worthy of any praise or honor? I am also one of the middle children (out of ten) in my family. Our household seems to be in a constant state of disorder and conflict, and the only purpose that I seem to serve is keeping a system - one inevitably doomed to fail - from collapsing. There never is a moment when I can truly escape - it's always at the back of my mind, and the stress is driving me to the brink of insanity.

Currently, I'm feeling quite on edge. My baby sister - the very one sitting down and watching TV right now, the one who views me as some sort of hero, the one who I've been treating unfairly out of anger because of her sheer capacity for love and tolerance of me, is the only person keeping me grounded at the moment. Even then, why shouldn't I? She is still young enough to forget about her older brother, young enough to not have to truly experience the sorrow and heartbreak that comes with losing a family member.

Overall, I'm just unsure about what course of action to take. There's no point in living if there is nothing to be gained from it, but there are still a multitude of people that would be saddened, maybe even be driven suicidal as well if I acted on this.

Any advise is welcome.
