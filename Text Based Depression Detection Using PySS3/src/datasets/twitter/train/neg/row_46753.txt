Wrote my first suicide note a bit ago.I'm scared of death but I want it so badly.
If I posted on facebook (The only way I talk to people) that I was in the process of killing myself no one would rush to my house to make sure I was okay. I don't blame them though, it's no one else's fault. I'm unfixable. I've tried. Doctors have tried. My family has tried. Nothing works. Everything that helps is only temporary. I'm a financial burden, unable to hold a job, have medical bills from attempted suicides. I just want to embrace what everyone has to at some point. I'm scared of death though. But I so badly want it.
