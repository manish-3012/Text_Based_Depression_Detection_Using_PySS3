I know how Iâ€™m going to do it.Iâ€™ve done my research. 

First off, Iâ€™m going to take all of my prescribed benzos, and then Iâ€™ll wash it down with a couple of beers.


Before I start getting drowsy, Iâ€™ll start tying my knots. Iâ€™ve already got pretty good rope. 


Iâ€™ll then tie it to the overhanging railing of the 16th floor building thatâ€™s close to where I stay. 


Iâ€™ll fix the noose around my neck, and then Iâ€™ll jump. If the noose fails, Iâ€™ll be falling off at least 45 metres, so that ought to do it. 


If none of those works, Iâ€™ll just have to hope I die of respiratory depression from my overdose and alcohol.
