I'm going to do itI think I've been scared for a long time about actually killing myself but I think I'm finally at peace with it. I'm going hiking this week so it will be a nice final trip with people that I love. I can't just live for them anymore I've tried and I've decided I just don't want to be here. Thanks for reading my very short story I felt like I needed to tell someone.
