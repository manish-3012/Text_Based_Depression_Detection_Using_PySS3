Suicidial ideationSo I don't have any plans to kill myself, it's just that I literally cannot stop thinking about how much I want to be dead. I spend the minute I wake up to the minute I go to sleep thinking about killing myself, I write suicide notes in my head, I just cannot imagine living the rest of my life hating myself this much. It makes everything hard, I go to lectures (uni student) and just don't absorb anything cause I can't pay attention, I try and do assignments and I'm like "what's the point of this degree if I'm going to kill myself anyway", I've tried counselling, anti depressants, exercise. Nothing is working. I just don't know how to stop wanting to die. I have no friends (I've tried but am too awkward) I am single. I live alone. I'm 23 and having nothing stopping me.
