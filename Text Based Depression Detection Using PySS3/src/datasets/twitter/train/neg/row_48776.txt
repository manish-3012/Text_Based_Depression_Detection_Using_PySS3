Feeling drained and destroyedI started dating someone about 5-6 months ago and things were amazing. While at school, immediately after the relationship kicked off I was overwhelmed and he took it well. We spend every night together until the day we moved out and he has always been there for me. 

Recently Iâ€™ve noticed, well we both have, that Iâ€™ve become self destructive because Iâ€™m scared. Iâ€™m starting a full time job and Iâ€™m anxious, my summer plans and basically everything else has gone to shit, including opportunities to see him, since we leave 2 hours away from each other. 

Yes I should be grateful that Iâ€™m starting my career but because of this self destructive behavior I end up starting little fights that turn into big ones and recently I was so upset and genuinely had concerns that it seemed like one of those stupid fights. Yeah kinda like the boy who cried wolf - well sorta. 

Heâ€™s been taking a few days to think and the worst part is before I bought up my concerns I never had the right chance to do it. It was just abrupt because I was holding it all in and whenever I did want to bring it up in person he was never sober- always smoking weed.

This wait for him to talk to me is destroying me because I am so in love with him and itâ€™s my fault itâ€™s come to this due to my approach. I havenâ€™t eaten in two days and am already losing weight and having a history of eating disorders is triggering so much more. 

I just feel so worthless and at times he wonâ€™t understand why some things upset me, or I havenâ€™t been able to express those feelings that it continues to make me feel worthless. I just question being here lately and have been having such a hard time doing simple tasks. 

Iâ€™m literally all alone at home and so low in energy. I feel like Iâ€™d be completely okay with letting my body whither away with no hope for anything. I havenâ€™t cut in 3.5 years and Iâ€™ve been trying so hard to distract myself but each minute that passes by, feels like an hour. My seasonal depression hasnâ€™t been as bad in years and with everything going on I feel a new low. 

Im not sure how to handle this self destructive behavior and the way Iâ€™m feeling
