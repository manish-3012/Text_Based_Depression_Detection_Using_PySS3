Iâ€™m a bit nervous to post here because Iâ€™m not great with you know being open with my emotions but it wonâ€™t help to bottle them up so... here they are I supposeTW: pedophila and self harm, donâ€™t purposely read this to trigger yourself, I know how it feels to do that and I wouldnâ€™t wish it upon any of you.

So umm I relapsed today. Itâ€™s not pretty and my thighs look like a checker board. Iâ€™m not looking forward to having to wear trousers to hide them but in hindsight I probably shouldnâ€™t have put them so far apart. Thatâ€™s besides the point. Iâ€™m really tired okay? I was meant to have a therapy session today but all they did was talk to my parents and double the meds that help me sleep, I donâ€™t have issues sleeping anymore and itâ€™s not what I need. I need some kind of mood stabiliser and preferably not one that makes me gain weight as a side effect like my current one because my body issue is probably one of my second biggest problems and Iâ€™ve been told Iâ€™ll probably develop some kind of eating disorder at some point in my life. I struggle with BPD, anxiety and Aspergers, I feel like I never really got a childhood because I had to mature quickly to help my parents cope with my brothers (both autistic one still doesnâ€™t have a high school and the other wonâ€™t be allowed in school unless heâ€™s medicated which makes him loose appetite and is now extremely under weight) I started self harming at 12 when another girl spammed me with photos of her cutting and then a few years later I was sexually groomed by a pedophile and to be honest, sometimes it scares me to the point Iâ€™m too scared to leave my house. The police never caught him because I was still so in love with him I barely told them anything, at the time I couldâ€™ve helped them get him but I didnâ€™t. Sometimes the fact that thereâ€™s nudes of my underage self covered in self harm marks on the internetâ€™s scares me, keeps me up at night. 
At the minute Iâ€™m only alive for my friends, one with cancer and the other one who would probably kill themselves if I left, Iâ€™m pretty much their entire support system. Also I donâ€™t think my parents could cope with them without me. Sometimes I hate the people in my life for relying on me so much, Iâ€™m in pain and I canâ€™t do anything to stop it because of how much itâ€™ll hurt everyone else, itâ€™d be too selfish but at the same time...  Iâ€™d love to do it to show my school therapist that I wasnâ€™t overreacting when I said I was suicidal, love for Charlie to see that the girl he manipulated for so long finally snapped, Iâ€™d love Veronica to see the girl she taught to self harm never stopped. But itâ€™d also make my friends who tried to help me think they werenâ€™t enough. I donâ€™t know what to do but I donâ€™t want advice. Iâ€™ll admit it, Iâ€™ve given up on getting better, I canâ€™t see it happening and I donâ€™t really want a future anymore. I fantasise about it though sometimes, a loving girlfriend cuddled up to me by an open fire with an elderly dog on my lap half asleep, itâ€™s the life I want but will never get you know? Iâ€™m ace and Bi so finding a loving partner would be harder for me, it doesnâ€™t matter, Iâ€™m not going to find anyone anyways. Sorry Iâ€™m just ranting haha, thank you to those few who encouraged me to post here itâ€™s helped take things off my chest a little. I really hope things can improve for you guys who are still fighting, who are trying to get back control, Iâ€™m so so proud of you all for being so strong for so long.
