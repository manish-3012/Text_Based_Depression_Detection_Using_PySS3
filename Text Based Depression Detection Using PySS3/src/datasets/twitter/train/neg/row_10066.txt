Repost: I'm so sorry it's for a college apeachSo my 2 sisters are working on a college speach they volunteered for and it's about how serious depression is and how real it is and it's nothing to be ignored or not taken seriously and I told them I would find real footage of someone committing suicide from the internet (we would edit it) I'm quite sorry I really tried finding anything for my part bit couldnt find something that would be convincing for all ignorant people out there
