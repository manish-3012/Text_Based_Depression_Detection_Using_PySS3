Got no futureIn a few months I'm gonna have to sit some exams that will determine how well I'm gonna do at life. I already know I'm gonna fail most of them anyway and there's just too much pressure to do well. I've been seriously considering suicide for a few months now.

Why shouldn't I kill myself now instead of making myself suffer for longer? 

And please don't come up with all the "contact your suicide hotline" there's just no point.
