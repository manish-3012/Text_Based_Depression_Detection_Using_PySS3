I have no life. I'm a waste.I don't have anything to live for. I live with my mum, I have no friends, no job and my day to day life is laying in bed looking at the ceiling hoping to just pass. I've tried to kill myself before to no avail and now am too much of a pussy to do it but it's getting to a point I'm not scared. I don't know why I'm living. There is no happiness. I've not left the house for months and even when I have it has been for something trivial. I have a few personality disorders which make it impossible to have a job and I can't keep a hobby as I lose interest extremely quickly. I've tried loads of hobbies and tried volunteering. There is nothing in life that I enjoy. My mum told me when I did try to kill myself a small part of her was happy to let me go because she knows how unhappy I am. I've seen doctors and am on medication, I've tried and tried all the different things people have suggested but I've ended up like this. I am nothing. I am a waste of space. There is nothing in this world for me and there never has been. This has been my life since I was a small child. My oldest memory's are of me crying and telling my mum I don't want to live anymore. I hate myself. I hate who I am. I do t even care enough to change it anymore. What is the point. Really. People just live and die. Why not just skip living.
