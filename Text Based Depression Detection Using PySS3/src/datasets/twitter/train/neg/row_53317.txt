Not willing to work hardFuck everything. Life is all about work work work. Fuck the gym, fuck the school, fuck the job. I just want to lay in bed all day, watch stupid movies and play video games. I hate that it's supposed to be this way and you're meant to be productive. Why should I  live if I dont want to cotribute to society?
