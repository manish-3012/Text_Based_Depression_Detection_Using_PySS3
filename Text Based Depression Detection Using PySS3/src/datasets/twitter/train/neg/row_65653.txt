Probably Gonna Happen (Dec. 10th)Alright. So, this is kind of tough to put into words right now. However, trust that I've been thinking about this for the past year and a half to two years. Despite a couple "ups", I have noted no real change. I'm going to save up some more money, and by December I'm going to quit my job. shortly after, I'm going to pack up and leave home in the middle of the night, and move to an undisclosed state. Then I'm going to wait it on out and see if I like it there. But things are looking like I'm going to end it there.
