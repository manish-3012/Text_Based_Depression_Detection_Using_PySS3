OddsThroughout life I have felt like odds are stacked against me, like if I want to succeed Iâ€™m going to have to work twice as hard as anyone else. I feel like this with work, girls, friends. It seems like I have to give those things 200% just to get back 100%. Thatâ€™s draining man, to feel like I have to throw a football over the moon to get the girl to like me, or like I need to buy my friend a Ferrari for their birthday just to be noticed. I donâ€™t know if I create these situations in my head, or if everything is stacked against me because I spent high school being a shitty person.
