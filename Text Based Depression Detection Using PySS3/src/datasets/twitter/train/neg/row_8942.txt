IDK what to doI feel like everything has fallen apart. I go to a conservative competitive private school in TX. I'm gay and I hate that part of myself; the guy I have had a huge crush on I"m realizing is straight af. I accidentally piss of my parents on a daily basis, and I'm just a horrible person. My grades are dropping and I transferred schools, leaving all of my old friends behind. I feel now that I have almost no friends at this school. The high school I was supposed to go to had an amazing speech program, which is the one thing i actually liked to do, but my new school has nothing. I try to work hard at it anyways, but to no avail, My family is very conservative and religious, so they will not be supportive of me coming out. I can't hold on any more, and I  feel everything slipping away out of my control. I just want this all to end. I don't know anymore.
