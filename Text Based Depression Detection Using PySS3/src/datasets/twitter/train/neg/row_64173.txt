whyIm talking to this girl and we went with someone to eat afterwards she told me they need to do something for her boss (they are sort of working together) so i said cool and went home after like 5 minutes she texts me that shes sorry for lying to me but she wanted to talk to him privatley but didnt want to offend me, i know it sounds simple but i got hurt from it and i cant let it go 15 minutes ago i was crying in bed and told her i needed some time , the thing is we are not dating or something but when she said she lied to me it fucking broke me . A year ago i was sort of seeing someone and she broke my trust so bad that i blocked her from my life and it sometimes still haunts me, i dont even know why im taking this so hard i just dont know what to do im afraid. I had some mental problems that my friends helped me cope with and this event just makes me wonder if its all worth it
Why live if i end up getting hurt so easily i dony think i can trust anyone from this point on
Not really looking for help since i dont think i can solve this
Thanks for listening
