I no longer think it's just a joke; I actually want to kill myselfFor the past few years I've always been making ironic jokes about wanting to die, but lately I've been thinking about it and I don't think I'm joking. Every single day I feel like ripping my throat out and smashing my head against the wall as hard as I can. I suffer a lot. I'm in agony. I'm miserable. What I feel is pure misery. Over the last few months, I've cried almost every single day, curled up on the floor and scratching/punching it. Most of my thoughts make me cry and it's out of my control. Almost nothing makes me truly happy. And those few people I often spend time with and seem to be enjoying myself with...sometimes I think I would be better off without them; they make me miserable without ever attempting to do so. I can't control my emotions and even though I'm aware (or at least I think I am) of how absurd sometimes my reasons for feeling this way are, I can't seem to react differently, no matter how hard I try. For example, them hanging out with people they've recently met. Things like these crush me. I don't want to come across as possessive, bratty, jealous. But I can't stop myself from being miserable because I'm not the only person in their life..? What the fuck? Why am I wired this way? It's not like I actually think they're going to leave me for other friends. Or do I? I behave like I really mean that, like I really think that everyone hates me and are going to leave me, but It's like I don't actually believe it. With me, it's like common sense only exists in the form of words, but it has no power over my emotions or behavior. I can't describe to you how miserable I feel whenever something as minor as this happens and despite apparently being aware of how unnecessary my reaction is, I'll cry in agony for literal weeks. Not a day goes by without thinking about how much I want to die. I feel like my brain and heart and everything is poisoned and/or rotten. How do I fix this?
