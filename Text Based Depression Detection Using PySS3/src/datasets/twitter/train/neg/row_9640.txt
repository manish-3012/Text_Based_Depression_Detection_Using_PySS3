This will not end well.I hate the fact that I can't even share my true real opinions, thoughts and feelings on this subject to people IRL. 

They have no real interest in listening. They just want to try and tell you you're wrong and the ever so infamous *WhAt AbOuT mY fEeLiNgS".... unfortunately for you, I give zero fucks about your feelings. 

This is why I can't "talk" to people when they suggest it. Yikes, they'd be horribly disappointed in my responses to them. 
If you really wanted to listen you'd know I'm not interested in negotiating what YOU demand I do with MY body. 

But I feel like I'm going to crack under the pressure of keeping my mouth shut. I feel like I'm just gonna say every real thought and feeling I have and well, that will not end well.
