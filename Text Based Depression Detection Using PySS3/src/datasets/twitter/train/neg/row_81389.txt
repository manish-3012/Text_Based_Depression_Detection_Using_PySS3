After my friend committed suicide, my dad attempted to multiple times, and Iâ€™ve almost done the same, Iâ€™ve indirectly made it my life mission to help others who are feeling the same way.It doesnâ€™t matter how shitty I feel, how little or how well I know the person, what time of day it is, where I am, etc. If a friend or even stranger reaches out to me, having a mental breakdown or considering suicide, I take all the time I have and put it towards helping them feel better. I know I canâ€™t fix it, and I know I canâ€™t save everyone. But Iâ€™ve made a noticeable difference in a few peopleâ€™s lives and it helps ease the pain of my friendâ€™s passing and my own suicidal tendencies.

She had been feeling suicidal for a while, and I have my own issues so I would flake out on her whenever sheâ€™d want to hang out. It was nothing personal, I just donâ€™t really like hanging out with people Iâ€™m not 100% comfortable with because itâ€™s extremely mentally exhausting and quite a stressor.. she began posting about how lonely she was. And then one day I got the news that she shot herself. Ever since then, I havenâ€™t been able to get over it. I miss her every single day. Itâ€™s been a year and 2 months and it STILL doesnâ€™t feel real. For the longest time, Iâ€™ve felt like I couldâ€™ve done something to at least help her feel better sometimes, if not save her. 
&gt;
So now, making sure people know they matter, that they deserve happiness, and that they have someone who will listen who does not judge them and cares for them has given my life meaning that I didnâ€™t have before. Iâ€™ve had my own struggles with suicidal ideals and self worth, so helping others when I know how much itâ€™ll impact them, really makes my life worth living.
