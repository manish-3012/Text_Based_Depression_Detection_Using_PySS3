Fucking done.there's too much shit going on right now and I can't handle it. my parents don't even care enough about me to not blatantly lie to my face, no one noticed me, I tried committing suicide multiple times and I told my friends in a group chat they told me not to (which is the WEAKEST ASS response EVER) and then continued their conversation I need someone to hold me and tell me it'll be okay but no one will do that. and who is there to help me? some random ass internet strangers? fuck that if that's all I have I'm just gonna down some acetaminophen and end it.
