15th birthday.my 15th birthday is coming up soon. november 2. i think thatâ€™s when iâ€™m going to go through with it. iâ€™ve made posts on here on a couple different accounts for a couple of years now but i feel so sure in this. this is the most sure iâ€™ve felt in committing. i have some time to plan, i guess. 

i donâ€™t think thereâ€™s anything that can talk me out of it. iâ€™m ready to let go, i just have to wait a couple more weeks. 

if anyoneâ€™s reading, how do i write a good suicide note? iâ€™ve written a couple recently but theyâ€™re just. bad. i canâ€™t seem how to convey my thoughts and emotions onto paper. also, would i be an asshole if i listed my reasons why i did it and then specifically called out my parents? idk feel like it would be dickish. anyways.
