I feel so hopeless and I dont want to live anymoreHonestly I just want to be shot.

Ive got nothing to say.

My life isnâ€™t horrible, im stressed about personal issues but I cant put them into words.

I keep picturing my death.
But im too weak to kill myself so im stuck in this pathetic rock.

Im worthless.
I deserve to die.
Thats all that matters.
