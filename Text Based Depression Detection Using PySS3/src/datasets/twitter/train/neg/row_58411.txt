It feels like my psychiatrist is failing meIâ€™ve been getting worse recently. Iâ€™m now suicidal, again, and sad. Iâ€™m suicidal and sad every night and now almost during the day. Iâ€™ve been feeling extremely anxious and paranoid as well. Iâ€™ve been feeling this way for the past few months and itâ€™s only been getting worse. I mentioned this to my doctor yet she didnâ€™t do anything. She did prescribe a benzodiazepine, but it didnâ€™t do anything and she didnâ€™t prescribe any other anti anxiety pill. Not even in the next appointment. 

I expressed how my suicidal thoughts have gotten worse and she didnâ€™t do anything. She didnâ€™t increase my dosage for my mood stabilizer or antipsychotic. I canâ€™t do therapy. I donâ€™t like my therapist and it wouldnâ€™t help me. I know medication would help me. It helped me before. It did wonders, but I think I built a tolerance. 

It feels like theyâ€™ve given up on me. My therapist didnâ€™t make a new appointment with me and I need to talk to him about something important. He usually schedules an appointment, yet he didnâ€™t this time. It feels like they donâ€™t want to see me anymore. I donâ€™t know. I know this is all just depressive thinking, but it hurts.
