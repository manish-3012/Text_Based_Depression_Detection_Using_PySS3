I'm giving it one week.As the title suggests, I'm giving myself one more week with the hope that things will somehow get better. I have gotten to a point where it doesn't seem possible to ever be happy again. I have no friends, no prospects and no real reasons to live anymore. 

I can no longer stand the constant brain fog and anxiety that comes with these feelings either. I feel braindead most of the time, which makes it hard to do anything at all to try and better myself. Even as I write this, I am struggling to think of the next thing to say. 

I have recently started going to therapy, but it seems like it's more stressful than it's worth. My therapist talks a lot, and it's hard to get a word in sometimes. I also just found out that it's going to cost more than I had initially figured, and I probably won't be able to afford it anyway. 

Don't try to tell me that things will get better, because I'm sure they won't. Anytime it's seems like things are finally starting to look up, these horrible feelings return and I find myself stuck in the bottomless pit of depression yet again. I close myself off from the world and shut people out in my life who mean well. I lose my motivation and end up no better off than when I started trying to improve. I'm hopeless and fucking tired of it. The very fact that I am this way is also the reason I am so alone in life. Nobody wants to be around someone like me. Nothing positive can come from my existence and I think it's time to end it once and for all.
