Getting to the fricking end of my ropeI am near the end of my rope. I just had a reduction of (syrup) $250 dollers last couple months ago and now have 80$ to pay the phome bill and bus fair. I don't know what to really do about that. I am SO at the end of my rope and feel like offing myself, I just feel hopless now.
