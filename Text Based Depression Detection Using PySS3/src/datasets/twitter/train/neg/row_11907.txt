What should I do before I leave?I won't do it soon but in a couple of months. 

The only question I have left is what should I do before? I have no idea, usually I am good with these things but my mind is just blank and I could use some opinions.

Maybe some info that can be useful: I have $500 to my name. I am 17, but I can't drive (lol sad, i know). So what can I do? Any ideas are appreciated :)
