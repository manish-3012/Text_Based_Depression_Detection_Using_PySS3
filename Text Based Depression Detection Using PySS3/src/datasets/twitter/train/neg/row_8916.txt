How do I atone for harassmentIn short me and my ex fought on her social media months ago. I've since left her alone, however the posts are still up there and theyve exposed my full name. I'm afraid of retaliation for something I've stopped doing. Do I apologize and ask her to remove the posts? or just let it go? What if someone comes a lot anonymously and continues the argument? Even though it isnt me. It can get me in serious trouble for something I no longer do. I keep thinking about it and it's driving me crazy and to depression.
