I feel like Iâ€™m in betweenIdk what Iâ€™m doing here again. I got over my depression a long while ago but Iâ€™m finding myself feeling this way again. It doesnâ€™t feel as strong as before though. I donâ€™t feel like I need to die. I donâ€™t feel overcome by negative emotions. I almost feel great but sometimes I just donâ€™t even know why I bother with life. I donâ€™t really know why I am alive right now. If I were to die tomorrow I donâ€™t think I would care. The only thing that would hurt me is the way my death would impact those I love. I admit the recent celebrity suicides makes me feel like all my effort was in vain and that one day my depression will come back with great fury and finish what it had already started.
