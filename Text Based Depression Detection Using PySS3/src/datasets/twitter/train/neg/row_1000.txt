Gone, I couldn't murder your promise right before my eyes, the revolutions of my psychosis kept me out of the way.Once inside, all I hold is ash. Fail, suppressing every feeling; I'm in so much pain. I have every fucking right to hate you, I can't take it. The hardest part was knowing I could never be you, now all I do is sit around and wish I could forget you. Who are you to me? Who am I to you? Is this a lesson in nepotistic negligence? By default, you are my only link to the outside psychosomatic suicide. Where were you when I was down, can you show me a way to face everyday with this face? When I blur my eyes, they make the whole world breathe, I see you fucking me and I am absolutely controlling every urge to mutilate. The one and only answer so much for memories, I want to dress in your insecurities and be the perfect you. I'm out-stretched out for all to loathe, here we go, the ultimate irony.
