When does it get better, reallyLike screw the last 2 years.. how long is a person supposed to hold out before theyâ€™ve had enough. My cup isnâ€™t big enough to hold all this shit.. Iâ€™m tired of pretending like Iâ€™m ok with life; like things are looking better when theyâ€™re not. I keep cycling between all the stages of grief over my life and how much shit itâ€™s been. I want it to stop.. Iâ€™m ready to be done..
