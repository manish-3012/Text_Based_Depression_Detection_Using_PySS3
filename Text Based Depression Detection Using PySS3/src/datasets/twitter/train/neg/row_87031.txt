I'm tired of myself, the voice came backI feel like im unbearable, my family seems tired of me all the time, being raped a year ago doesnt help at all, I have no friends, my boyfriend left me, I hate myself and im tired, I dont believe in the world, why do I worry so much about my future? Im dumb and I cant do nothing right. The voice came back to me, that voice in my head that tells me the best for me is to stop existing
