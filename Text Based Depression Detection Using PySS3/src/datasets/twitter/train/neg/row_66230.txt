Hey peepsI  can't handle other people telling me what to do anymore. 

I can't handle people anymore. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's like no matter where I go, I'm *always* a problem, no matter how hard I try not to be. 

I hate having to depend on other people who only want me to become a perfect machine. 

&amp;#x200B;

What's worse is the fact it's everywhere. 

I need to be the perfect person at home with no problems. 

I need to be the perfect person at work if I ever get work (who has no problems).

I need to be the perfect person at school (who has no problems). 

&amp;#x200B;

I just always need to be the perfect person who never has problems where ever I go, and I just can't handle it anymore. 

&amp;#x200B;

If people could "hear" my thoughts, they would tell me how to think as well...

But I can't take it anymore, so I think I'm going to say goodbye when I find some rope in this place.
