Caught plagiarizingI've contemplated suicide many times, but I never wanted to kill myself more than now. I got called to the office and was caught plagiarizing two papers (one from months ago) and now it will be in my college transcripts because its a college class and I'll be expelled from my school. I am a pretty smart kid (ap and college classes, 16 years old) and I got scared and tried to change up my friend's paper enough so that I wasn't caught but now I'm fucked. My parents care about my grades a lot, they're the only reason that I try in school. I don't know if I can handle how disappointed they'll be in me and I'll be embarrassed to ever show my face again, so why not?
