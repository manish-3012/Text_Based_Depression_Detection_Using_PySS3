Me Living is actively a drain on those I care aboutMe being alive is draining on those I care about. I disappoint, let them down, drag them down with me, and generally cause difficulties. Anytime that I've wanted to change or improve myself, it's always been past the point where I could have solved things. I always realize the error of my ways far too late, and it keeps hurting people that I care about.

I have so many small mental issues, and yet not a single fucking one of them excuses my plethora of issues. It must be that on a fundamental level, I am a bad person. And yet, I can't even be obviously a bad person, I'm an ensnaring disappointment that grinds away good will, and brings out the worst in people. It's so unfair to them.

I have nothing going for me beside the typical things people say about someone, and have nothing tangible to give myself a career or a future. I don't ever seem to have motivation, and I suppose I must have been coddled too much as a child, for I have no work ethic. I'm already 26, and I can't seem to be a functional adult, I can only leech off of others and slowly cause resentment. 

I shouldn't be alive in the first place, I should be dead. If I had a single ounce of real care for those around me, my brains would be a painting on the wall. If I could be motivated for even a god damn second, I could turn my arm into fleshly red ribbons and save everyone their time. I'm just too much of a coward to try again.
