I think my mother is going to try to kill herself and I am so scared and alone.She has tried before (in recent memory) and it runs in the family.  She has perceived her life falling apart for some time, with everything now climaxing with a separation and impending divorce. I think she will do it in Denver when she flies there for a doctors appointment.  

My step-father tried to get me to help get her committed a few weeks ago but i couldn't do that to my own mother.  She was miserable last time it happened and still has not forgiven my step-father for it.  

She just called and told me I need to forgive her for things in the next few weeks that she may do and that she loved me.

I don't even know what I am looking for posting this.
