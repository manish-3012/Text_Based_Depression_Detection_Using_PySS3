losing hope, delusional (request for persons soon to leave this world)I do not believe in any god or afterlife, but if by some miracle one exists; could you please try and save pathetic me once you pass on.  


  
you're my only hope, I don't deserve it or care about other people myself.. but... yeah I'm screwed.  


  
I don't want to die, but I most assuredly will suffer for the rest of my life; as I have already been doing for the past 20 years. Please just let me know happiness once and I'll accept suffering in hell for eternity, in your place.  


  
I will try and bare the pain for at least another month, while I hold onto this false sense of hope.  


 thank you.
