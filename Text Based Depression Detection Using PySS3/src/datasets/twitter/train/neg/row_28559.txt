Think I'm gonna do it this friI've rented a hotel room in my favourite city and bought tickets to a cover of one of my favourite bands so itll be a nice send off.

I feel obliged now because my mum just said she spends all of her time worrying about me and I think she'll probably be in a better place once I've gone. So that means that there would only be 2/3 (dad and 2 uncles) people who would care if I ended it.

I've got a bit of money in the bank so I can afford to do it the most painless way I've discovered.
