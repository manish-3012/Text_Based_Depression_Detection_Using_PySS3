PainMy boyfriend of over 3 years broke up with me today. And itâ€™s my fault I broke trust. I did something terrible which I canâ€™t take back but Iâ€™m trying so hard to mend. Iâ€™m blocked on everything currently and I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. The pain is too much to handle. I wonâ€™t kill myself even though I wish I had the courage to, but I will hurt myself to ease this pain. I am a terrible person and I just lost my life home everything because I was a shit person and decided to snoop through his phone and my jealousy got the best of me and I deleted girls. I wish I could kill myself.
