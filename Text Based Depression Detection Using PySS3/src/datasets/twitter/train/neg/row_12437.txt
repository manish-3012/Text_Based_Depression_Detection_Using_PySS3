I sexually assaulted someone and cant live with myself.Now i always considered myself a good person before this and was always respectful of all people. So first of all she was my friend who was having a rough time at home and i offered for her to stay over at mine. I told her i would sleep on the floor and she could have my bed but she said i could sleep in my bed with her so i did. Now i had absolutely 0 intentions of doing anything with her that night. So we talked for a bit then we went to sleep then this is when the fucked part happened. I sort of sexually assaulted her in my sleep. I thought I was dreaming it but once i woke up and realized what I was doing i quickly stopped but it was too late and the damage was done. I told her what happened and that i didnt realize what inwas doing and that I was kind of sleep assaulting her but obviously she didnt believe me because who would believe that??? I only touched her breasts and didnt try to touch her lower area at all. And it has affected her so much and it has also affected me greatly. After the incident i just fell into a massive hole and hate myself now. I dont go out anymore because i am afraid she has told people and that they will confront me about it. I have a lot of psychosis mental health issues due to drug use which has made my life horrible. 
I also just want to know what happened that night, because i was 100% asleep at the time and just dont understand what happened. I almost think about this everyday and it always ruins my dad. So i just basically want someone to tell me what happened that night and what i should do about it because its killing me inside.
