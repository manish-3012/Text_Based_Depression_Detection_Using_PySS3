Why people are so mean?I feel like I have some sort of curse.

Throughout my life i have run into a lot of bad people.  I have had a lot of bad social experiences and today as i hit rock bottom in my life i feel like people are even worse and more malicious and cruel to me.

it's as if some would like to give me the final blow, the decisive assault that would make me falter for good.  why is human nature so awful?  even my own family is bad to me.  When my psychiatrist told me that it was important to have support, and that I told him that my family was not positive but negative with me, he found it difficult to understand and he looked at me with astonishment...

I have the impression of living a tragic and dark film today where everyone turns against me, I have no one to rely on and where others rejoice in my misfortune.  even my neighbors laugh at me.  

If I did the bullshit killing myself, would all these people party?  Would celebrate this?  why so much hatred and unjustified malice towards me?  

In any case, all of this made me deeply Misanthrope and lonely, if one day I manage to get out of this nightmarish situation, I know that I will never be able to count on anyone again, friendship is dead for me just like  the sense of family, I don't want children, I don't want to start a family.  I saw the blackness of the soul of all these people.

I think this is one of the major causes of my depression.  and now i know how it goes, i know how reality is.  I know that most people are basically evil, are selfish, rejoice in the misfortune of others.
