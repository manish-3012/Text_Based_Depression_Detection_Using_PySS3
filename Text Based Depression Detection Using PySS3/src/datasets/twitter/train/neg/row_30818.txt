I feel hopelessHonestly just want to talk to people I can open up to because IRL I keep it all hidden, but I'm completely falling apart. I don't enjoy many of the things I used to, I always look forward to when I can sleep to get away from everything, and I hate being alone, especially with my thoughts. It honestly feels like the world is crashing down on me and even though I don't actively want to die I'm kind of at the point where I wish I did, and I think about that every day. I think about what it would be like to not have to feel everything I feel on a daily basis, what it would feel like to not be forced to have all these memories of when life was better constantly reminding me that it's never going to be the same, and never going to get any better. It feels like I'm not even myself anymore and I don't know how to fix this.
