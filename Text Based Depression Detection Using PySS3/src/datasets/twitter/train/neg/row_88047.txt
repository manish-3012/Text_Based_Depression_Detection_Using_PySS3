I lost the willI just don't want to live anymore. I've lost joy for the past few years, except when I drown myself in a relationship, living by procuration. I don't have an individuality anymore, and when I inevitably get betrayed, I don't have anything left.

My best friend don't want to see me anymore until I get better. My girlfriend asks me to leave her alone. I'm just an annoyance to everyone at this point.

I'm too much of a coward to do anything, so I'll just lie in bed, pretend to work and if I get the energy I'll take my bike for a last ride. I'm also scared of failing to crash properly and becoming even more of an annoyance if I end up crippled.
