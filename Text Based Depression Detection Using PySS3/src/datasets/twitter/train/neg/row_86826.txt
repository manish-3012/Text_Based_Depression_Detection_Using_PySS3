Rope will set me freeI dropped out of school because of my anxiety, depression. For the past 8 years, my life turned into a small hell, now I am 20 and feel nothing. No goals, no passion, no hobbies. Nothing gives me pleasure anymore. My two friends don't have time because they now have jobs and I am just stuck at home doing nothing killing hour after hour. I was so happy that this month I would go into a psychiatric hospital for 5 weeks to work with people like myself on my problems, but guess what? COVID fucked everything up and now I have to wait till the new year...

Father was always very masculine figure in my life but I was not born like him, from a young age I was shy, not into sports etc... Now I feel like a weak man, my masculinity was stripped away by my own mistakes and problems... I do not trust myself and I hate this loser mentality that sits in the back of my mind telling me how many things I have fucked up in my young life... I do not see that light at the end of the tunnel, I just don't know what to do, it is so hard to go on, so much crazy stuff is happening outside and I still check news like a dumb prick. Today I visited for the first time psychologist so it was just telling her about myself, next appointment will be three weeks from now and I don't know if I am going to make it. Everyday I dream about me being in school and doing tests, I regret quitting school so much but I had no other option. Thinking about putting a rope around my neck and chocking on the nob till I am free.

Society is turning into hell, I really do not feel like people care about men's mental health, all over the Internet females get more attention in everything, and feminist still hates on us guys...

I hope you are doing better then me stranger, much love and peace
