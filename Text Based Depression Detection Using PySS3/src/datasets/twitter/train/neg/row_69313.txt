I may be ending this all soon.im 16 and in eight grade. I get called a rapist and weird on daily bases. Im really thinking about killing myself at this point

being in a same grade as fucking 13 year olds as a 16 year old is not ok. Im basically nearly an adult now. Im getting bullied on daily bases. Im tired of this. Im ending this all in 1 month. I will most likely kill myself on my old favorite childhood place. 


Literally give me a single reason why this is worth it to live for
