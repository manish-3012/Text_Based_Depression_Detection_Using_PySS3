a year later and I haven't changed at all..**dont worry too much about reading all of this, I just want to vent.. again.**

Hi, reddit.

This is kind of a follow-up post. According to reddit, 11 months ago I made a submission [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Needafriend/comments/8ga5n/nothing_i_do_feels_natural_anymore/) at /r/needafriend. I don't know if it might be helpful to read that bulk of depressing crap before reading this one. =/

So basically I was dead-sure I wasn't going to pass college and make it into university. I had my suicide planned out; 21st August 2009. Two or three weeks before this, on my current reddit account, I made a depressing comment somewhere about how I felt about my life, and a redditor PM'd me asking if I wanted a friend. After some ignoring, I eventually replied and we became close friends very quickly.

I have to say, that redditor saved my life. If it wasn't for her, I don't even know what would have happened. She helped motivate me to look into foundation courses at university, let me talk through all my problems, everything. And when the day finally came, and I collected my results to find I had failed, I went to the bridge I planned to jump off of. It was for that person that I stepped down and walked home. I called up my desired university, and despite my failed grades they let me on my desired, full-degree course anyway.

Great, right? I'd been given a second chance. I'd been saved.

I don't think it was one week later that I told that redditor, someone who reached out to a faceless name on the internet, to fuck off, and that I didn't wish to be friends any more. I didn't know why I did this, I just did. But this was just part of the bigger picture in the end.

September 2009! I get my hair cut, which hadn't been cut in over three years, to try to force change. I felt like this was my chance to become a new, different and better person. I get to university, in a new environment, new people. I begin to feel a future for myself, I feel myself becoming happier with myself..

and then, in February, for **absolutely no fucking reason whatsoever**, I stopped attending university. I slept all day and all night, not showering or eating for days at a time. I just stayed in my bed. I missed about 4 assignment deadlines, which has now secured I have failed the first year.

I just don't understand what is wrong with me. I don't know if it's a knee-jerk reaction of me continuing punishing myself, even though I no longer consciously feel that I deserve it, or something else. I just can't have anything happy, even though I want it to be happy so goddamn much. It's like a part of me just wants to make the other unhappy.

I was given a second chance to fix myself and become a better person by getting into university with insufficient grades.. I've completely wasted that chance, and now I am in exactly the same place I was a year ago; planning to die some time in August. I don't want to go through all this shit again where I pretend that I have the capacity to 'change'. Because I can't. Everything just resets itself again and again. I'm a coward who can't face the consequences of my own actions.

I just wish I knew what it is that keeps making me screw up =[
