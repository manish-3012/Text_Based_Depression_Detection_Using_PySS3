I used to have tiny hopes and now I have noneFor so long I've been going down and falling deeper into my depression, but I kept hoping I would get better eventually, I tried so hard but I'm giving up because whatever I do it only gets worse.

I had a dog and she was the only thread keeping me alive because I knew she needed me and she was always there for me when I felt the worst but now she's gone and it's partly my fault because I knew she needed a surgery but I couldn't afford it and was too overwhelmed with everything that didn't know how to try to make a fundraiser or anything and she suffered for a week before dying in my arms I also have a feeling that the vet kinda ignored a lot of symptoms and I should have seen another one and I can't get this image of her last hours out of my head and I miss her so much, she was my child, my best friend, my therapist 

I dropped out of uni in march because my antidepressants made me feel like my iq is 10 and I cannot focus for more than two minutes. I had a very demanding major and I was close to finishing and just threw it all away

I have a job only because my dad found it for me and called the boss (his friend) if he could hire me. I couldn't even find a fucking job. I feel so guilty because recently I've been doing everything so slowly or going weeks unable to finish my tasks and I think the only reason he hasn't fired me yet is because of my dad. He has lowered my income though and I don't mind the slightest because I think it's just fair. I'm only an expense to him.

I moved in with my boyfriend two months ago because I was constantly fighting with my parents over me being lazy and laying in bed all day. But now my mom is guilt tripping me even more because I'm living with a man before marriage. It's awful because we both moved out to run away from the stress in our homes, not because we thought of it as some next step in a relationship or whatever. 

I was crying to my bf about my mum yesterday and later I overheard him talk to his friends online how he hates my parents and then they all laughed at them how pathetic they are etc. But I love them and they've done so much for me, of course I'm annoyed at a few things but still love them and now I feel bad that I even mentioned it to my bf because now he hates them and I feel guilty again because they don't deserve being talked about like this 

I'm also really scared because the rent turned out to be much higher than I expected and I don't earn much money and my bf just quit his job and I feel like everything is on my shoulders and it's so difficult for me to care for myself only, there's no way I could provide for us both, I'm so scared 

I want to adopt a new dog, or a cat, or both, because I feel like I need a pet so much in my life, animals are pretty much the only thing that brings me any kind of joy in life, but I'm so irresponsible, I'm afraid I won't afford them, I'm afraid I'll finally kill myself and they'll be alone or I'll just leave my bf alone with everything 

And then last week I went to see my doctor and it turned out I don't have insurance anymore since I'm not a student anymore and at work I have the type of contract that doesn't pay these taxes (I live in a country with public healthcare). So I have to ask my boss to change the contract and it simply means keeping me will cost him even more and I feel guilty again and I can't bring myself to talk to him about it

So now I'm even scared to try to do anything because if I fail idk what will happen, will I have to pay some extreme price for the hospital or what, i don't know 

I just feel so guilty all the time and I hate myself and my meds are making it even worse because I can't focus or make myself do anything more than the basic minimum but without them I feel even more suicidal so I just keep existing and I'm scared of all ways of suicide but I also have no hopes for the future, I feel so lonely and as if there is nobody I could really honestly talk to 

Sorry for the long post I just don't know what to do anymore, I want to simply disappear, the last days I have been in an all time low and I just can't anymore
