Ready to put in the towelHi whoever bothers reading this. I probably don't know you and you don't know me.

Anyways. I've struggled with emotional and phycological abuse since I was young. I'm socially awkward, a loner. No friends. I've struggled with depression for many years. I have bad anxiety and I can't make friends or hold relationships at all. I've tried countless times but it never works. I work a crappy 9-5 job 40 hours a week and go to bed when I come home. I have no energy left anymore. No energy to get out of bed or do anything. I'm going to end my life very shortly. People always say shit gets better but it never does. We are all doomed to work a shitty job. Pay taxes and end up in a grave. This ends my retarded rant. I know I'm stupid but I digress. Anyways. So long and thanks for the fish.
