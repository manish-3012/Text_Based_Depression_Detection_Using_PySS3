Suicidal thoughts.Hi, lately, I've been feeling like total shit, and I feel it every day but today was something that made me unwell. Starting off, I am 13 years old. I tend to lean towards negative thoughts. But I do try to be positive. But somehow, when coming to terms with myself, I put myself down. I should be happy. I should be energetic. But I feel like total shit. My head runs around in circles repeatedly. I get much more emotional. Every day, when I wake up, I always think to myself, 'I hope I die today.' I get an extremely strong urge to die. My family doesn't really treat me nicely. I mean, I am an idiot who doesn't meet their expectations. I'm not perfect, smart, or beautiful. I'm just... Plain. I'm myself. So, I try to be like the other girls, but I feel so secluded. I feel like a reject. No matter how much I cake my face with makeup or act like them, I can never ever be that gorgeous, beautiful girl. I know, I'm only thirteen and I shouldn't be putting makeup on, I should be hanging out with friends. But I don't even have friends. Because in the end, I am used. I am always used. My money is gone. Gone to my family and "friends". I can't even use some for myself. And when I do, I can only buy one product. I hate using others to help me. Because it makes me feel like I'm a horrible person. I have straight A's but my family doesn't even acknowledge that. Even my ex's. All my ex's who I gave my time to and love to they all left me disappointed and weary. I had to let them go. 

There's this one guy who I loved so much. But he went and used me. He used me. He never really wanted me, I was a fool to think he did. But he loved another person. I wish I am dead. I wish that I wouldn't have to be a burden. It'll all be better if I was dead.
