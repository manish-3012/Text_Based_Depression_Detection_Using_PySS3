my mood swings are so fucking annoyingi can go from "there's no point in living" to "i am worthy of love no matter what" (and the other way around) in a matter of seconds, and it's honestly making me so fucking tired i don't know what to do anymore. i never know whether i'm gonna feel like shit or like a god. i never know whether or not i'm going to try to attempt suicide. it's always the smallest things that flip the switch - i feel happy, my mom shouts something across the room and it makes me go into a depressive state so deep i want to get hit by a car (and that state can last either days or minutes, but when it's happening, EVERYTHING feels bad). then, something flips the switch and i go into some kind of manic episode, where i feel like i can do the unachievable. there's also the "neutral" mood (on-and-off, too), where i just chill, and i feel like i'm my true self, who's just enjoying being a teenager, but that doesn't last more than a few days, either. there's periods of time i spend daydreaming, or hyperobsessing about something (like a tv show - i love it to the point i plan my whole life around it), or just being depressed. my relationships are like moodswings, too - i either completly idealize them or loathe them, which makes it extremely hard for me to make friends.

it's all just so... tiring. i wanna be in that neutral state all the time, and i feel like i'm being delusional, because even though now i feel like, shit, in some time - whether it be minutes or days - this will change to something completely different.
