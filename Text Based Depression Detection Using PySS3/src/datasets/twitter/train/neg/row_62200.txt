Im sorry i wanna be heard for a little whileHey so im currently being really shakey and stressed out as im writitng this but for somereason this whole day i was feeling fine until a few seconds ago when my mind screamed bloody murder to me the graphic images of me doing something bad to myself flooded my mind and still are (i havent harmed myself cause im scared to be judged for having such expressive emotion) ive seen suidcidal thoughts been really frowned upon and to be honest youd never even think that the 16yo girl that laughs the entire schoolday comes home and thinks about killing herself on a very regular occasion basis. Maybe the thoughts are occuring cause i wanna feel better than someone in only one thing or two or cause only if when i died people would actually say "wow i really liked her, she made my day" . Maybe im desperatley clinging onto hope or something to feel things cause even so ive been stopped mentally to feel any kind of sadness due to my living situations. My heart goes out to all of you that have the same struggle as me, please be very considerate of yourselves. 
And as someone whos heard the phrases "i wanna kill myself" coming from others i must say it really stressed me out and made me fall helpless in the decision realm of things. It hurts to know you wanna die and it hurts more to know that others wanna end their life, it really does. 
Thank you if you took your time to read this non-sterotonin filled paragraph.
