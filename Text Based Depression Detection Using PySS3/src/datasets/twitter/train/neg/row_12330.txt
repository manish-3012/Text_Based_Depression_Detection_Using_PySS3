My existance is small and miserable and I wish I was never bornI'm either in a panic attack, worrying about if I was going to die, or wishing I was dead. Nobody likes me, not even my parents. If I disappeared, no one would probably give a shit. I have no friends, and I'm too nervous to approach anyone. My life is small and insignificant. I should just end it all right now. Someone please help me. I'm so lonely
