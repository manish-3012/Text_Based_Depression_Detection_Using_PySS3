Logical SuicideHere we go. I've been thinking about suicide for most of my teenage and adult life, and am now in my mid 30s. As a teenager I made some attempts and failed. The reasons back then were different, but are still somewhat a factor now because they have evolved into different situations.

&amp;#x200B;

I wouldn't say I'm in danger of doing it tonight, or tomorrow, or even next week. Maybe in the next year though. I create goals for myself to complete in order to delay the suicidal thoughts, because I feel like if I accomplish that goal maybe everything will finally come together. The problem is that it never does.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll try to make a long story short. I was raised in a very dysfunctional family where there was alcoholism and physical/emotional abuse, the middle child of three. Every day of childhood was a war, with endless yelling and violence, though the parents never attacked each other physically, just their children. Money was scarce, largely due to alcohol costing money and also leading to bad decisions or delays in maintaining responsibilities. Money being scarce meant no chance of social success at school. I was also not allowed to do anything with friends, due to my mother being paranoid and overbearing. This situation led me to my first attempts at suicide between the ages of 15 and 16. It led to me being unable to complete highschool on time, though I finally managed to complete it by 20. I was severely depressed back then. I went to psychologists, and psychiatrists, and I went through the medication gauntlet, but nothing really worked because it was not a chemical problem, it was a lifestyle problem.

I finally made some major progress thanks to taking a very high dose of mushrooms one night and having a monumental perspective shift. I was not a substance user, but decided to say "fuck it" that night and take the risk. A few days after that, the 180 degree shift started and I found a job, and started saving money to move out on my own. I did it, and then put myself through school. Throughout this time I was always suicidal, but I had logic on my side and knew I could simply follow certain guidelines to have a better life. This always turned out to be the case. I graduated at the top of my class. I got high paying jobs while still in school, and afterwards. Nobody even knew I was suicidal at this time, because life was so good, and I became a success story in my impoverished hometown.

My love life was never great. I'm not an ugly guy, but I'm not really attractive either, I'm just somewhere in the middle. Women never threw themselves at me, but if I tried I could get a few numbers based on my personality and being in pretty good physical fitness. All of my relationships have been with abusive women. I believe this is because of my subconscious mind looking for its comfort zone, which is abuse in my case due to my upbringing. However I have not really found a solution to this problem, so I largely gave up on dating years ago. I'm pretty much clueless as to how to move forward here, if at all. I really don't want to go through the pain of a failed relationship again, and I don't know how to have a healthy one, so I settled on not having one at all.

&amp;#x200B;

I was successful in my career and smart with my money. I burned out at my last job, and realized I needed to quit when I started thinking about jumping in front of the train in the morning instead of going back to the office. So then I quit and bought myself a one-way plane ticket to another country. I wandered around for awhile crossing borders every so often and finding myself in the most random of places without a plan. I tired of this and returned to my home country, only to go back to school to get an even better education. This is a delay tactic, an attempt to put another goal on the table for me to complete so that I'm distracted from the real questions for awhile.

&amp;#x200B;

So here I am now. I am once again at the top of my class, with very little time left to go before I'm finished. I'm paying out of pocket again, but this time I have a large supply of cash and few legitimate concerns from a logical standpoint. But something is still wrong. When I graduate for a second time, I will have no goals left on the table. I don't want to just go back to my old life, working at an office for 8+ hours per day and coming back to an empty home for another 30 years. I have no family support because my parents are still drinking heavily and both have a foot in the grave. One of my siblings is extremely abusive and disrespectful, and the other left the country many years ago to escape the situation I've described. Relationships don't seem to be a realistic possibility. Most of my old friends are deteriorating into their own substance abuse situations, which seems to be very common for people from small impoverished towns as they age. New friends are harder to make as you age. I am reluctant to get a dog because it's a huge responsibility that I may not be able to fulfill if my mental state deteriorates.

&amp;#x200B;

So this is why I call this logical suicide. I don't feel depressed, or sad. I just add everything up and don't really see much room for change. I can continue on like this, but there's no source of joy or happiness in any of it. I just continue to exist, continuing to repeat this cycle endlessly until the day of my natural death. This is why I think about suicide nowadays. It's because I don't feel like waiting around anymore. Maybe there is truly no logic in any of this thinking, but you need a little bit of comedy I suppose. If I do it in the next year I'll be leaving a bunch of cash behind, which is the strangest part of it. Money doesn't really make you happy or solve any of the real problems after all.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just putting this out there to see if anyone has any advice at all or at least can empathize.
