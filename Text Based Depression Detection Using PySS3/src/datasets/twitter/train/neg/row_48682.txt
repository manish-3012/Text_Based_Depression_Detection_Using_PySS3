Go on or go to emergency services?Hi, 

I drink to much, nothing new. stopped drinking for a few days, nothing changed. I still am not sure if I should go "full working mode", full "fuck it let's drug up mode" or worse (minimal chance). 

Should I go to a counselor? Or just back to work and hope it gets better (tried that for years) 
Or just admit myself to a Hospital?
I really don't know how to handle it anymore...

Sorry for the rambling, but I hope this is the place where I may get some answers. Did it more or less anonymous obviously.
