i need helpiâ€™m lying here sobbing into the covers bc i donâ€™t want anybody to hear me even tho all i fucking want more than anything is to be held and cry into someoneâ€™s chest. 

why does everyone elseâ€™s trauma turn them into a good person? why did my trauma just make me angry and spiteful and malicious? i feel like a rabid street dog with no home no love and nobody but the fleas on my back to keep me company. my dog even prefers other people to me. 

i hate my job i hate where i live i donâ€™t have any money and no matter how fucking hard i try no matter how many applications i submit (over 100 now! i keep a spreadsheet) my portfolio is never good enough. my art is fucking garbage and iâ€™m wasting my time in any artistic pursuit. 

i paid someone to review my shit professionally and iâ€™m STILL not getting any call backs. i feel like the worldâ€™s shittiest designer/artist bc even my craft shit feels like childâ€™s play compared to what iâ€™ve seen other people do with the same mediums. even if i wasnâ€™t comparing myself i have no confidence in my abilities and not having a support system doesnâ€™t make it any easier. 

i feel like iâ€™ve been love starved my whole life and now when someone tries to show me compassion i reject it bc itâ€™s unfamiliar, but iâ€™m dying for a fucking human connection. iâ€™m dying to have someone outside of my partner to talk things thru and spend time with. 

i donâ€™t mean cheating i just want a fucking friend!!!! iâ€™m so sick of sex i just want someone to fucking talk to. 

earlier today i was feeling suicidal and raked my brain for someone to talk to bc i needed a connection and found.... no one. so i had to text one of the hotlines in order to have a conversation with a human and start to relax. it only worked for so long. 

i hate that i canâ€™t even explain myself without always making myself the victim. i hate that i donâ€™t know how to human bc i was denied so much social interaction growing up. i hate that even tho i am so adamant about working thru things in therapy, i donâ€™t find myself getting better, just repeating the same old habits and self sabotaging every single time. i hate feeling trapped i hate feeling hopeless but above all i just hate me.
