RantI've made a promise to myself that no matter what I want to accept myself. If I can't then I'll become depressed and hurt alot of people that care about me. I dont want to hurt my family by killing myself. If that means i have to be the depressed asshole for the rest of my life then so be it. I will do everything for the people I love. Even if that means i have to live with the piece of shit person I am. And I don't regret it.
