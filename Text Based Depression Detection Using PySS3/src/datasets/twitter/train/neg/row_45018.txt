I don't want to be alive next yearI'm tired of trying, of putting in so much effort everyday for nothing. I don't even know why I bother posting anymore. I just feel defeated. I'm lost, I don't know what to do anymore. I don't see reasons to keep living at least any that apply to me. I think I'm just destined to be this way, if I don't do it now I'll probably do it later anyway. I'm just not good enough for the world. I'm not enough for anything. I don't have a future. I'm just a burden, liability on everyone's life. Everyone I know including family would rather talk to someone else if they had the chance. I'm just done. I can't get therapy and I'd rather not call a hotline and get generic useless advice or get put in a mental hospital. I don't know how to do it, I really wish I could get a gun to shoot myself.
