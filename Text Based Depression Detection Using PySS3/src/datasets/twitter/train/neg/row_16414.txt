I just want the fucking stress inside me to stop and I can only think of one way outIt's constant day in and day out pressure and I can't fucking take this shit anymore, I've popped pills before but thrown them up. 

I just want the fucking stress to stop it feels like I'm about to hit the ground after freefalling every fucking second. 

I can't fucking go to the doctor and they all tell me the same shit, it's my fault. It's all my fault, it's all in my hands and I know that and I don't care, Or maybe I do and I just realized that the only good thing I can ever do is get rid of myself so nobody has to ever deal with me again. 

Nothing will ever turn out right and before I was so afraid of going but now I'm just impatient for it, I'm getting violent with myself, and I can only imagine how good it'll feel once it's finally over. I've got the gun out and I'm teething the end of the god damn barrel. I hate this so fucking much. It's never getting abtter, it's not fucking worth it, I can't fucking take it.
