Today was a reminder, and another step down to the endAnother self deprecating post from me on reddit, hurray.

I serve in the IDF, and today, due to how close we are to release, we were sent to a convention about job applications, courses, etc.

This is the offer:

Possibility for early release

Partially of a fully paid course to train you in that skill (IT, Management, app creation, electrician, hotel jobs including management, medical research, etc)

Instant employment

Funds to live through during the course, in case you won't work during the course, etc.

So as you can see, it sounds too good to be true.

But I couldn't even get to one of them. I can't talk to people, I'm next to mute, and some people even think that when they first meet me.

I just stood and watched everyone go up to the stands and talk, gather information, etc.

I don't think I ever wanted to commit suicide more than this day.

This isn't the first opportunity I blew. This has been going on for over 15 years. I was about to just burst out in public for the first time.

I already put the gun barrel in my mouth last month. I doubt this is the last time I'll just watch everyone, but I'm not sure I'll let myself live through any more of these situations.

I've been posting on reddit about this for more than 2 years now, and so far I only find solutions to keep me going until the next problem appears.

6 psychologists, 15 years down the drain.

I keep smiling near others, and then I go to the bathroom and just start punching the wall until my knuckles are red and hurting.

Can't even write a coherent and well structured post, I just remember and write and hope that I remember everything important.
