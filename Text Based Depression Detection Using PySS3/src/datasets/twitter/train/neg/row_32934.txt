Checking inI posted a couple weeks back that I have been having fantasies about killing myself if I can't get my life back on track with my wife and/or finding a job.

I just thought I should check in. Obviously I'm still here.

Severance ran out, I'm now just starting to dip into what was supposed to be my retirement savings (RSP here in Canada). Obviously I don't want to burn through that all, but at least I have that for this emergency. I'm still bummed I have to touch that though.

I've had a couple interviews. Waiting to hear if one of them panned out, should know Monday. Not holding out a lot of hope, I was one of 15 people being interviewed. Market is competitive. I don't know if I mentioned my wife also was laid off and is looking. Part of me doesn't want her to find something before I do because then I will feel even worse. At least right now we are going through this together. Selfish I know.

We're doing family activities tomorrow which makes me happy. She likes that we're doing more as a family. That was a huge issue in our marriage, I am a homebody, my whole family was, at least growing up. It's a hard transition to make, I have to fight it all the time. My wife likes being out there, doing things.

Anyway just wanted to say I'm still here and kicking.
