Hopefully this is my last post on hereIâ€™m Sofi, 21 years old, a loner and a failing student in 3rd year of university. I have zero self esteem, crippling social anxiety and depression. I have no educational achievements and talents.

Iâ€™m going to end my life soon. My mental illness has drastically declined the past few months when I thought I was getting better. I think Iâ€™m approaching the end because Iâ€™m becoming more unstable. 

I already cleaned my room, cleared everything and packed my stuff into boxes so that my birther doesnâ€™t have to do much. Iâ€™ll transfer my savings into her account which should be enough for my funeral fee. 

I will die by 3rd of January after I say farewell to my friend. Thank you if youâ€™re reading this. Best of luck to everyone whoâ€™s fighting against themselves.
