What is Life?To me itâ€™s corrupted by selfishness and greed; it was encouraged by others and is now taking over at this very moment. I sometimes think if I end it; iâ€™ll be happy, I wonâ€™t be stuck in some harmful world, and I will end it all. Weâ€™re all just creatures put here randomly, just to work and be part of an unjust system. I feel nothing at all. I feel like drugs are my only way to truly feel. They take me out of reality while i lay in my bed seeing nothing but an empty image. Everything is bullshit; i help others, but i donâ€™t take my advice. I need help, but my parent wonâ€™t consider it. Iâ€™m a good kid in school, i get good grades so i can feel iâ€™m worth something, but in the end it feels like wasted time. I have no effort now; i try to do work, but i just donâ€™t have anymore energy. My time is getting closer and closer, and i feel it. I canâ€™t sleep at all, when i do i fuck up my schooling. I canâ€™t focus. I can cry, but thereâ€™s no emotions attached. I suspect BPD at this point. I need help.
