everydayEveryday I just want to end it all. I have the perfect life but nothing is going right I fucked up my whole life and everyday I want to just cut my wrists and drift off, I'm so tired. Everyone judges me because I'm not perfect and am nowhere near it. I'm just a coward for not doing it. I just want to be gone and all the suffering to stop.
