All my friends I've known irl have abandoned meJust got blocked for no reason by my 2 friends who I've been hanging out with since June for seemingly no reason, my dad hates me, my mom has covid, I am weak and disabled compared to the average person though I can walk, just not very far without getting tired, I only get to see one side of my family and its only a few times a year i have seemingly no purpose in life no talents I can't graduate high school or pass my permit test, I can't get a job because I cannot stand up very long, and I have no talents. I just 18 this month. I've tried to workout and improve myself, to no avail. I've been struggling with suicidal ideations since freshmen year especially, even some instances as far back as 9 years old with my first existential crisis. I've been to counselors and have talked to all my friends about it extensively. There is no more hope. I began 2020 feeling better, having gotten my first girlfriend and when she dumped me I had good friends I hung out with irl, now I have no one but my friend who lives in another country who I've never met irl.
