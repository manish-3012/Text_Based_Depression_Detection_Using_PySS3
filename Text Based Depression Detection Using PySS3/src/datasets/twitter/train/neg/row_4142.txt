Repurposed speechI.
 
HATE...

This place.

Thisâ€¦zoo. This prison. Thisâ€¦reality, whatever you want to call it, I can't stand it any longer. 



&amp;nbsp;

It's the smell...among other things.

I feel saturated by it. 

I canâ€¦ â€œtasteâ€ the absurdity.

And every time I do I fear I have somehow been driven mad by it. 
It's repulsive, isn't it? 



&amp;nbsp;

I must get out of here. 

[I must get free](https://youtu.be/JrBdYmStZJ4?t=3m20s) and suicide is the key; my key.

Once my body fails there will be no â€œmeâ€ to be here, do you understand?
