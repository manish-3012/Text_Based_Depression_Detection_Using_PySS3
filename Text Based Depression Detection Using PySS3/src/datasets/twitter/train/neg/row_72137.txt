Sorry mom. Sorry dad.I know you love me and I always feel thankful to you. But, sorry. Iâ€™ve been thinking about suicide for 6 years, and I think Iâ€™ve reached the last station. Forgive me. If I had a choice to choose my parents, I would always choose you. I was happy for living with you. But Iâ€™ve never satisfied you and I always discourage you. Please forget me and love happily with my brother. I decided to kill myself within years. Iâ€™ve gotta end what Iâ€™m doing first. I will try my best to be a good kid for the rest of my years. 

Love,
Your kid
