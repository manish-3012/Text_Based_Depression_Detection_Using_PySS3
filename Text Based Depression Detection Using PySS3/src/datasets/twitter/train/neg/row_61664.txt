pretty much lost everything dont have anyone else and school hasn't started back up. Feels like my friends replaced me with another girl which i dont really like (dont like the girl) and i dont have any other friends, feels like ive been betrayed. Ive been feeling extremely depressed for 2 weeks now and i just recently got discharged from the hospital from a suicide attempt, tried telling my friend about it but she didnt seem like she could care less. Im so lost and I've literally lost the will to live.
