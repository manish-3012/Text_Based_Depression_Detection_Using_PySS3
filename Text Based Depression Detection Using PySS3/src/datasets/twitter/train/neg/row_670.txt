I fail at lifeYeah. That's it. I mean, I've got some legit issues. PTSD, anxiety disorder. I'm on meds. I'm in therapy. But I have my kids' stepmom telling them that she's their real mom and that they should tell me not to come to school activities because she's coming instead...I make a fool of myself in front of people on a regular basis because apparently I have no capacity for interacting with others...my fiance thinks I'm an incompetent idiot...I can't leave because of my kids, right? that's what they say. But they're already being brainwashed into thinking I'm not as important as their stepmom. I'm trying to assemble the suicide bag thingy and I can't figure out the valve...I fail at this, too.
