In a dark placeLooking for advice on how to detach my self worth from GPA/grades. Tired of the bad voices in my head. I graduated as valedictorian of my high school and now Iâ€™m competing for a spot in a super selective program. I am very passionate about the program but I live in fear and dread that after agonizingly challenging month after month after month after month of work, I will get rejected. I always feel weight on my shoulders, kinda like itâ€™s impending doom. Canâ€™t remember a day in recent memory that I didnâ€™t cry. Outlook is grim, everything is bleak...even all the good things in my life are canceled out by the possibility of too many Bs for acceptance to this program. Iâ€™m ashamed to admit I have considered suicide these past couple of weeks. The pressure is becoming too much to handle.
