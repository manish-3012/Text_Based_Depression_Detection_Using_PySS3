Today I got a nice haircutI stopped feeling sorry for myself. I accepted my faith, I will leave happy. For years I've been complaining, whining about life, because I still had hope that some things will change. But they wont, and now I'm okay with that. I finally came to that realization after so long. I will take a bubble bath, shave, get dressed nicely and do it with a smile. In all my previous attempts I was drunk and drugged, crying and screaming, angry at the world and at myself because deep inside I knew I didnt have the courage to go through with it. But its different now. I found peace.
