Kinda want to go on a walk to decompress. Kinda know that if I did I'd jump off a bridge.These last couple of days have been extremely rough for me. I feel like I'm fading away from my normal self and I can't tell if the depression and anxiety or I'm growing up and either case it's just way too much.
