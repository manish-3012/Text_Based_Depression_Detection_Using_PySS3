I'm backSpent over half of my life here, then some shit happened and i finally backed off the edge. I knew the void was there, I knew it existed but i wasn't looking into it anymore. I didn't want to and I didnt need to.

Was a good 4-5 months but now i'm back, on the edge, just staring into the void again.
