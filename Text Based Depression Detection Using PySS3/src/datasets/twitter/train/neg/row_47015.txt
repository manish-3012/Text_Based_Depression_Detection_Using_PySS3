why shouldnâ€™t i fucking end it right nowiâ€™m so fucking alone i have nobody. my boyfriend and i broke up a week ago and heâ€™s telling everyone i treated him like shit when i didnâ€™t, heâ€™s telling me he doesnâ€™t give a fuck about me, i dont have friends, i donâ€™t have parents in my life.  iâ€™m so tempted to slit my wrists rn i canâ€™t even explain. i feel like thereâ€™s nothing to live for anymore and my time has come. i donâ€™t want to bother my grandparents theyâ€™ll probably think iâ€™m over dramatic. i feel like shit.
