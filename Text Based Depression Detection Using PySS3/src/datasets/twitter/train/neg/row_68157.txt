i dont even knowhello. i'm writing here because i don't know what to do. i have made a plan and have the means and intent to carry it out, but it's happening a week from tomorrow. my only fear is that i will fail and end up in the hospital (i've been admitted to a psych hospital 3x since february). i'm in a partial hospitalization program and if i tell them my plan then they'll send me there, too. i really don't want to go back to the hospital and i really don't want to live but i'm not 100% sure that my plan will work fully.
