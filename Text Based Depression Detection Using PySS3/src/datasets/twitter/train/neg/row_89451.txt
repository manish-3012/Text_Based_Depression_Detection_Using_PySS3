I can't comprehend the death of my grandma, it hurts so muchThis is one of the worst pains I've ever experienced. She died like 2 Â½ years ago but these times are hard for me and I miss her so much. I've been crying for hours now. My inside is screaming, it hurts. Everything hurts. I didn't knew I had such a big problem with her death but I realise I have. Everytime I think about her I run in my room (if someones around) and I'm just crying for like 30 mins. 


Also, my mom doesn't know about my mental health state and she also doesn't know that I'm so sensitive. But we had an argumented and she just said "if your grandma knew how much trash you leave arround you she would turn in her grave, if she had one"...that sentence really destroyed me from the inside..how could she say something like that? It was HER mother. 

Also I don't get the sentence "she would turn inside her grave, if she had one" what could that mean? I mean I know that phrase but "if she had one". I don't get it bc I wasnt intending her funeral, I have kind of a phobia when it comes to graveyards and dead ppl, and I'm also really young. And I've never heard anyone talking about an urn with ashes inside, and they never drove to any kind of sea to dispose any ashes there, what could she mean by that?
