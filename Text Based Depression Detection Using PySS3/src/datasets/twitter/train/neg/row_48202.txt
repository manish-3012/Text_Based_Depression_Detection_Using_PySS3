Please help. How do I help person who has made up their mind to kill themselves?My sister just lost loved one. She was suicidal before and had depression for years. She's already in theraphy but it seems she is determined to kill herself anyway. I love her and I don't want her to die. She deserves happy life, she's good, compassionate person and it is killing me that she is suffering so much.

I'm useless. I have been thinking about killing myself for years and I think this is why I can't help her in any way. But she deseves it. If there is any one who deserves to live, it's her. 

Any advice is welcome. If some of you were/are in similar situation, please tell what may help.

Thank you all.
