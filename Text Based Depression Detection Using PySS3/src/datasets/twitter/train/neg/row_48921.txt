The hardest part is when youâ€™re crying out for help in every indirect way possible, because itâ€™s too difficult to be direct, yet no one notices.People are taught to look out for the â€˜signsâ€™ these days, everyone is made fully aware of them, some include:
Not eating
Not sleeping 
Poor hygiene
Long clothing to cover scars
Scratches that may be uncovered
Uncharacteristic bursts of anger
Etc
Etc
Etc
I understand that itâ€™s not always easy to spot the signs. But when Iâ€™ve made a massive point for years and years about keeping my body hidden, despite living in 40+ degree heat (depending on the time of year) and Iâ€™m telling the people closest to me that Iâ€™ve not showered for four days and canâ€™t sleep at night and have lost my appetite, I donâ€™t understand how my pain is still invisible to them. 
I know I should be direct, but itâ€™s easier said than done.
