Never felt like this before but now I don't want to liveI have never been suicidal. I've had a good life, really. 
I'm 22 and a few days ago I lost my best friend and identical twin sister. I can't explain the kind of grief it's causing. I feel like I can't breath. 
It's always been us, always together. One soul in two bodies. I have plenty of friends, but no close family. She was my other half, the one person who would never let me down and always have my back - even if I was wrong.  Without her I'm sinking. I can't live like this, I can't imagine a future without her. 
When I first got the news I thought I would actually die right there and then, but sadly I didn't. They gave me medicine to calm me, but I can't stay on drugs forever. And I can't exist like this. 
I don't want to die, I just don't want to live without her.
