Losing my battleI just came here to say to anyone who cares to listen that I am losing my battle with depression. For years I thought I was ok, but events in recent years have turned my life upside down and i feel there is no way to get out of it. I tried settling for a simpler life with no material goods to speak of and just living life to live. But that is not working out I want more but don't feel I can reach it. I've had years of a certain mentality pounded into me and now that person is telling me to do something totally different from what they "taught" me. I don't feel equipped to shift my life back to what it was before, taking back that normal life feels insurmountable and that I have no help to get me there. It comes down to my life feels worthless, I'm 40, no family of my own, live with my parents, make 218 dollars a week. I want more but I feel like whats the point, I've never had anything to speak of, I'll probably never get anything that I'm not just working myself to the bone to just stay afloat and I don't want that either.

I pray to a god I know doesn't exsist that I will have a fatal heart attack or my cholesterol and triglycerides will kill me or a mack truck t bones me in an intersection, I just want to die, I just not sure if I can do it to myself.
