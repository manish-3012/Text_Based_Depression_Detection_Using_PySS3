School pressureI'm in my last year of high school and fuck, things are so stressful. I don't know how much more of this I can take. 

I don't think I'll actually off myself, mostly because I don't want to throw away my life over something so meaningless like fucking school stress, but my God, I'm so stressed and I don't want to sound ungrateful because my parents are immigrants who've worked their asses off but I can't do this anymore I can't I really can't. 

Getting up in the mornings are so hard because every day is just the same cycle of stress and anxiety and I barely get any sleep at night so I can barely stay awake during class.
