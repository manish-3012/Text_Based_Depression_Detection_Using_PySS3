My futureHey! Itâ€™s been a bit since Iâ€™ve been on this reddit, thankfully. I generally have pretty constant, waxing and waning suicidality. But my new one and only goal is to find a nice alley to lay in, hide in a sleeping bag with a stuffed animal from when Iâ€™m a kid... and not letting myself move, no matter how cold, thirsty or soaked I get. Just absolutely let myself dissolve, hopefully just lay there until Iâ€™m gone.

It is..: harder to describe to people then â€œIâ€™m suicidal.â€ And this is because I know I will never kill myself. Every time Iâ€™ve time Iâ€™ve gotten to that spot where I have the ability, and got down to the last second, I never do it. I never will. I am the perfect patient because Iâ€™ll never do it. But if I could just let myself rot away?? 

Iâ€™m traumatized to the point that every single day everything I do is thinly motivated by not being in more pain. I have severe physical disabilities, an assortment of mental bullshit, I didnâ€™t finish school, Iâ€™m to depressed/lazy(depends on who you ask) to work or stand up and contribute to society, Iâ€™ve been in therapy for years with no progress, multiple medications have only served to make me starve myself or more suicidal, I literally donâ€™t function as a human. I sleep for hours and do nothing btt it waste time, or wish to be dead already. 

I talk about my future in vague terms. Referencing an age I donâ€™t plan to live to. Iâ€™ve spent most of my life like this. I am unbelievably, bone chillingly tired. I donâ€™t believe life gets any better then this. I have been in love, Iâ€™ve been happy, Iâ€™ve seen babies be born, been to Hawaii, had a lot of fun, and life still doesnâ€™t seem worth it. None of that was good enough to ever make me want to stay. I wish that I could have a peaceful few months until I can disappear without any major trouble, but they will not be peaceful and the people in my lives will not contribute to it in any positive way.  Since I cannot work, or will not work, I will never achieve anything. If I canâ€™t work, Iâ€™ve fantasized about what it would be like to be homeless. I wouldnâ€™t need to worry about suffering because thatâ€™s all thereâ€™s left for me. Then at least I might live. But I donâ€™t want to.
