It's The Good Days That Will Kill YouI've had lifelong depression, varying from bad days to middling days. In spite of this affliction, I've had some good careers and fun times. 

Every once in awhile, the depression gets very bad and I start experiencing mild hallucinations (squirrels talk to me) and things become fuzzy and ambivalent like I'm in an overlap of two kinds of reality and I have to keep guessing which is which.

Without fail, the next day is the way I should be living. I feel pumped and extroverted. I get lots of things done, not like from a manic frenzy, but with high quality. People react to me positively. It feels great. It is great.

By the middle of this fairy tale day, I start to worry about when it's  over. I don't want to go back to the way it was. I can't bear the thought. But, within 2 or 3 days, the spell is over and I'm back to my normal, depressed life. 

I told a friend about these good days that happen two or three times a year, and how difficult it is to lose the magic. I shared my fear I would kill myself one day after losing one of this special days. He shook his head knowingly and said "it's the good days that will kill you."  

How you cope with this? How do you make more good days come your way?
