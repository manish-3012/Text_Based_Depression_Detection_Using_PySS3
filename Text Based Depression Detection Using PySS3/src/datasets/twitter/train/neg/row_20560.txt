I wish I had the nerve to end itAs I've posted, I'm a 31 year old virgin who doesn't make much money, still lives at home, is ugly, and has no friends. There is no support for guys like me, just people who want to shame me and tell me I am not "entitled" to a girlfriend just to rub it in. They think I'm "pathetic" because I make "pity" threads almost every day since I have no other place to talk to anyone. People from Reddit have said they want to be my friend but they end up using the same cliche lines as everyone else. When I turned 30, I tried to OD but it didn't work. I tried again a few more times but stopped short of taking enough to end it. Did anyone care? No, in fact in response, I was called a "misogynistic pig who should kill myself" when I posted about it. I don't have access to therapy and even when I did, it didn't work. They used the same cliche lines that everyone else used on me. I've tried everything you can think of to meet people but nothing has ever worked and I don't have the energy to keep trying. Why go on when I have nobody there for me? Why go on when I can't find a job that I can have to support myself? I know the stories of people having success in their mid 30s and beyond but I won't be able to make it that far. One day I will have the nerve. One day I will be able to end my miserable existence which will make most people happy.
