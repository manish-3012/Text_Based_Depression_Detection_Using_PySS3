Today's the day.This is the last time I'm going to post here, because I'm actually going to kill myself this time. I just fucking hate this so much. I HATE it. My life is so useless, I can't do ANYTHING right. I'm just done. I give up. Not everyone is meant to have a good life.

Everything is just so *shit*.

I'm struggling so fucking much and no one cares nor understands. I asked my doctor for anti-depressants, she said to go to therapy and "just had confidence in myself". Well that's not fucking happening. I am reminded on a daily basis that I'm a piece of shit. Everything about me is wrong. I'm trying to change and can't do that either.

I just vomited all over my stairs, and I've had my mum ranting at me about how I've ruined the carpet and I need to pay for it. And she thinks myself I want to kill myself because of it. 

No, I want to kill myself because my life is shit, and my life is always going to be like this. I'm always going to be seen as the pathetic, skeleton, awkward girl and I don't want that life. I don't want this. 

I fucking hate it all.

I'm so desperate to just get away from everything. I'd be willing to spend the rest of my days in a mental ward.

But, why do that when I can just kill myself? 

No one cares about me or want me anyway. All I seem to do is give people grief.

I'm done. Fuck everything.
