I canâ€™t live like this anymore
Hi,
I know each one of u have your own struggles and problems but have u ever felt like enough is enough?! 
Basically from when I was born I have been constantly reminded that I am not good enough. My parents used to criticize me for being a complicated child and they have been comparing me with others throughout my entire life . Once I got into a professional dance school (13yo) , I was made fun of and got bullied for not being talented enough and not reaching their standards . The teachers were constantly reminding me that I was too short, not skinny enough, and claimed I wasnâ€™t made to dance . They made me feel worthless in every possible way . I never got the chance to dance on stage (because they were afraid I would put the school in a bad position) and my parents told me I was a disappointment. Thatâ€™s when I developed an eating disorder (at the age of 16) ... I was anorexic . Nobody cared about me, I had no friends, I was living by myself , the school only cared about me being skinny. I went through horrible times, constant pain and felt everyday worthless,dumb and a mistake . Recently, I have developed an other eating disorder: binge eating... Iâ€™m everyday eating my emotions and I simply cannot stop or control myself.
Iâ€˜m still in the dance school (18yo now) and still struggling with getting bullied by my colleagues for not having the right body type for a dancer . This year, I have finally opened up to my parents about my depression and about how Iâ€˜ve been treated by the school, to which they replied: â€žthatâ€™s all your fault because you are not working enoughâ€œ . I told them about how I wanted to attempt suicide because I cannot live like this anymore , but they claimed I only want attention... thatâ€™s when they got mad at me and stopped talking to me . 
Everything in my life is simply going downhill . I moved to a foreign country from a very young age to become a dancer, I didnâ€™t finish 11th grade, so I could finish my dance school and here I am , in my last year of dance school not being able to get myself together for another 10 months . Right now, all I want is for it to STOP... to not have to go to sleep every night crying and to not have to wake up ever again .
