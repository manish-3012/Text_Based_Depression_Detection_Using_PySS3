I feel like I have to.Before when I considered myself suicidal I would be laying in bed sobbing. This time it feels much more detached. I keep losing expensive things. I keep costing people money. I am never happy, even when I should be. I am often cruel. Nothing I do makes me a better person, nothing I do fixes me. It would be very easy for me to jump in front of a train and stop burdening and harming others. Instead of feeling sad I feel good. I feel peaceful. I have never felt suicidal and good before. I think it's the only thing that willl help.
