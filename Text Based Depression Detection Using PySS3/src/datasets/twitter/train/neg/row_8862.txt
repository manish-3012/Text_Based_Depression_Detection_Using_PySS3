Feeling lostI wake up each morning and feel lost. I feel like Iâ€™m never going to get ahead in life and trying to reach my goals feels impossible. I think of my life in the next 5-10 years and I donâ€™t see it going past 30. Iâ€™m tired of putting on a happy face when all I want to do is lay in bed and be around no one. Iâ€™ve tried antidepressants and my doctor had tried 4 different options and we kept having to change prescriptions because I was at the highest allowable dosage. Iâ€™ve gone to 5 different therapists and felt like I was wasting my money because they didnâ€™t seem to acknowledge things I was talking about (I would talk about x and how it upset me then they would change the subject to y). Iâ€™ve tried and tried for 8 years to get help and get better and I feel like Iâ€™m done trying. 

Iâ€™m not scared to die but scared for whatâ€™s after. If I could end it without hurting my parents, friends, etc I would do it. I often feel guilty about being sad/depressed because I know it makes me hard to be around some days. I wish there was a way to come out of this on a happy note but I feel like Iâ€™m stuck.
