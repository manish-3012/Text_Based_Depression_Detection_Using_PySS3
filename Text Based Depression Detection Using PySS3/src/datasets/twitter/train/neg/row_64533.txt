I don't know.I'm sitting here in my kitchen. Not entirely sure what to do. I don't know if this is the right place to put this, but i don't know where else to put it. I'm pretty young. Just turned 21 last June. Ever since then, things have been kinda rough mentally. I can't just enjoy shit, I feel like I'm always being a downer, my alcohol usage has increased due to the fact I've been able to purchase it legally, and I've been having more increasingly vivid thoughts of suicide. It's weird too. I've got some kind of future. I'm going to train to be a pro wrestler by the end of the month. But at the same time, I got fired a couple days ago. I don't know for what other reason other than I didn't show up for one shift. Maybe I did something else, but I don't know why else. And the way this manager fired me was very much in a way that it seemed like she wanted to embarrass me. It kind of worked I guess. Cause I haven't really been able to get it out of my mind. Even though I've been very good at pretending it didn't. I haven't told my parents yet because I don't want to disappoint them. The violent thoughts have gotten worse. The drinking is starting to be more prevelant. I shouldn't feel like this. I have a future. I don't know. I just feel like I can't so much right. Feels like I shouldn't exist. I've stopped telling my friends these feelings because any kind of support they give feels annoying. Like they're on my back. When they're just trying to help. I don't know what I can do. I know I need help but I can't force myself to get it. I'm close to a breaking point. I really don't know. Thank you if you took the time to read this. I guess I needed to get this out. It's still there, but it's good to get it out I supoose.
