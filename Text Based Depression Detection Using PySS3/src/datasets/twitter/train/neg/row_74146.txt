Maybe it's time for me to go.I feel bad posting here again, I feel like this is supposed to be a one-time subreddit.
But here I am again, feeling... This way.
Maybe my time is up. Maybe it was up, a long time ago. I've never been content really. Maybe I'm just here by some twisted up "luck". But things... Why are they this bad? I don't think they should be this bad, maybe everything is just trying to tell me, it's unsalvageable, it's done, it won't get better. Maybe it's time for me to go, but my dog will not be okay if I do. So I guess I'm staying but I really don't feel like I can go on. I guess I will go on, because my dog needs me, and I should be selfless for one time, just once, and ignore everything telling me to go. For her.
