My shotgun taunts me.This gun haunts my mind. I can't seem to get it out of my head. Any free time I have in school, I fantasize about putting the cold barrel into my mouth and pulling that trigger. I really want to load and feel the sweet release of death. 

My life has come to nothing. Thinking about my future, I'm afraid of what will happen... 

I can't take care of myself, and I seem to screw everything up. I have no real reason to live anymore. What is the point?
