A fresh startI can only feel relaxed and non anxious when I think about life without living. At 24 I have reasons to live but non are worthy of me living my life. Iâ€™ve thought about hurting myself and tonight I will try to and think about the best way to take a life without causing pain. Iâ€™m tired of feeling sad and anxious 24/7 tired of pretending Iâ€™m okay when Iâ€™m not. The stress that goes away when I think about taking my life is so amazing.
