Iâ€™m Not Sure How to do ThisLife. 

I have attempted suicide about 6 times in the past 10 years. Two got me in the hospital and then a psych ward. Since I was a teenager, Iâ€™ve felt the â€˜Call of the Voidâ€™. Iâ€™ve been self harming near consistently for over 10 years. I also became a drug addict and alcoholic. I was very deep into it for about 4 years. I am just over 1 year sober now. I didnâ€™t care when I got my 1 year date. I donâ€™t care about anything. I have royally fucked myself in my schooling program. I am so ashamed by that, that I asked around to see if anyone had a gun for sale. One did. I was going to exchange all my benzodiazepines and adderall for it. 

I only didnâ€™t because of my girlfriend. In a way I hate her. Sheâ€™s the only reason Iâ€™m still here. Her mom is in the hospital on a respirator for COVID. And her social circle is having major issues. But I also I truly love her. Like, sheâ€™s the one. When I think about her and what state sheâ€™d be if I killed myself, I am overcome with self hatred and fear that I no longer have the option to kill Myself.

The drugs really messed with brain. My short term memory barely exists, I get auditory hallucinations, and Im just not as smart anymore. Iâ€™ve permanently messed up my head. And Iâ€™m 25. With my messed up brain, this messed up world, and the knowledge that it wonâ€™t get better, I have thoughts about killing myself more so than ever before. Iâ€™m in-between passively and actively suicidal. 

I have a good life, by any persons terms. But Iâ€™m scared of everything. And it almost seems smarter to end my life. Iâ€™m extremely conflicted. And I canâ€™t use crisis line as I used to volunteer there. I donâ€™t mind if no one comments on this. I just needed to get it out. I just donâ€™t want to feel so bad anymore.
