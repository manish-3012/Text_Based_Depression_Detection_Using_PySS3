Been feeling better but my hallucinations seem to be worseningIâ€™ve been feeling better and less depressed lately but I find that my hallucinations are becoming more common, less able to differentiate from reality, and are becoming more distressing. I sometimes fear that non-earthly entities and/or ghosts may be here to kill me, or feel unimaginable pain. Sometimes I look at the paintings around different houses and see the devil within everything corroding and trying to either kill me or make me feel immense pain. I have begun see evil entities giving me a death stare, they appear to be similar to humans but not human at all.
