i need irl suicide watch, i think if i am left alone for to long without a clear short term goal i am gonna try to kill myself againso my mom is leaving for a week, so i have the house to myself and i was suposed to have friends over, butt they left me in the rain again. problem is i am getting more and more suiciad and last time this happened i atemted. i am not sure what to do.

they know i am deprest and have tried a few times. plauged with mental ilneses some diagnosed some ignored by my former therapist, i am kinda looking for a new one but i am unsure if i am willing to trust someone so deply again and what if they ignore me again.

idk what to do, i kinda need to ask someone for suicide watch but i am unsure of who or what. I worry it will come over as a manipulation, idk. i really am scared. my famili is no help they have a tendacy to just make it worse and then spin it that its about them. they don't get that i am genuenly mentaly ill and that i can't really not be suiciadal no matter what happens

i have a pretty good life exept i barly have any friends. soory for the gramar its hard to write with whet eyes
