Starting to feel stuck.Right now Iâ€™m just laying and overthinking at 4am but I hope my thoughts donâ€™t become reality cause theyâ€™re already suffocating me. If it ever comes to it being really bad, I just want people to know Iâ€™m not a bad person. I would never hurt anyone. Iâ€™ve made mistakes, I know and I regret them so much. Iâ€™m so sorry. Iâ€™m starting to feel thereâ€™s no way out. Maybe my thoughts are too dark right now but the anxiety is killing me. I just wish things get better. Please.
