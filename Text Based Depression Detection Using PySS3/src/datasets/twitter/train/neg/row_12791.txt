I donâ€™t know what to do with my lifeMy dad hates me, he calls me â€œitâ€ and yells at me to pay him rent which he will gamble anyway. Iâ€™m 19 and my mum never took me to a doctor for my mental health, I took myself last year and got diagnosed with depression, anxiety and OCD.
I try to explain that to my parents, which is why I was a â€˜weirdâ€™ kid. They donâ€™t believe me and just argue with me about something else and change the subject. Iâ€™ve only dated two men in my life and the first one manipulated me for sex for an entire year while he cheated on me by abusing another girl. I went to therapy and everything felt â€œnormalâ€. I met a new guy and he ghosted me after an 8 month relationship that was on and off, and now he actively posts about personal things I did, joking with his friends. He even let me meet his mother and now sheâ€™s blocked me.
My OCD affects my life the most and I think it has since I was a kid. Iâ€™m not sure how to explain anything but after he ghosted me Iâ€™m sure there is truly something wrong with my brain. More than a mental disorder, I was never meant to be here and I think thatâ€™s what life is telling me.
