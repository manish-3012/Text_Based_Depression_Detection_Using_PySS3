Iâ€™m itching closer and closer everyday.Itching closer and closer everyday to just end this suffering. Iâ€™ve been depressed before but this is different, this is worse much worse. Iâ€™m alone I literally have nobody my family abandoned me my girl now ex abandoned me knowing I had nobody and now Iâ€™m all alone. Iâ€™m broke going back and forth through friends houses so I donâ€™t have to sleep on the streets anymore. Literally donâ€™t see my life getting better at all. My life sucks it wonâ€™t get better. Im just going to continue walk closer and closer to the edge until I snap. Iâ€™m starting to not care about people anymore. At first it was like I didnâ€™t wanna kill myself because I didnâ€™t wanna hurt certain people. Now I just donâ€™t care. Literally just wanna be done with all this bs Iâ€™m so tired of it Iâ€™m so tired of being alive. Donâ€™t see how any of this can ever get better. My life fucking sucks Iâ€™m suffering every single day.
