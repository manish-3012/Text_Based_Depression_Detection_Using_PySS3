I feel trapped in my own bodyI have problems surrounding my own gender identity. Some days, I want to dress up like a woman and look pretty while wearing a one piece dress. Other days, I want to dress like a man, binding my chest and wearing casual wear. One day, my dream is to wear a suit. I think if my relationships had gone well, I wouldn't have this desire to want to like a man. I think it's because I crave to find my perfect match, that I try to embody it. It might sound weird to others, but that's how I try to rationalize my mindset. I have this tendency to do that. Anyway, this confusion makes me really tired every day and makes me self conscious about my appearance. I often feel disgusted by what I see in the mirror because I can't live up to my own beauty standards. I know it's not healthy to think like this, but my idealist mindset takes over the rational part of my brain most of the time. The fact that I can't live the life I always dreamed of after getting depression is probably why I'm suicidal in addition to a lot of other factors. I can't see a future where I'm happy. Even if I achieve my goals, if I'm not satisfied with the end result, what's the point? Most of my friends don't really get it. They've never had depression or if they did, it wasn't as severe as mine. Most guys I meet often ghost me after they find out I have depression. I often feel anguish, knowing that most people my age don't feel like this. Or they often invalidate my feelings, saying others have it worse or everyone feels like that sometimes. Makes me want to shove a curling iron down their throat.
