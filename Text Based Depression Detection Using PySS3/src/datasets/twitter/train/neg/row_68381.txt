It makes me happy to think that I'd rather commit suicide than to live an unhappy lifeAt least that's something that many of the people who aren't suicidal can't do.

I used to worry a lot about my future being worried about if I fuck things up and I create a bad ad unhappy life for me that I'd have to deal for the rest of my life, but now that I know that I can just end it all if things go bad, that makes me feel much better for some reason...
