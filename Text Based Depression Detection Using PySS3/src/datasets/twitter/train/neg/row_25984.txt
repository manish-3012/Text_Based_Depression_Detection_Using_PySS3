Will anyone talk for the night?I have steam. but we don't have to play any games, I really just wanna have a normal conversation.  I don't have anyone else to talk to, other than one friend who says he'll stay with my until next monday, but he's not on right now and I need someone. I can PM my discord link to anyone who might want to talk. I'm going to be hanging myself next monday so I just wanna have *someone* to talk to. The emotional pain is horrific, I just need to pass time until next monday. Please come talk, I'm 17M. I know it's kind of grim talking to someone who is going to die, but maybe if I can just have a conversation I can maybe get my mind off this agonizing pain for just a second
