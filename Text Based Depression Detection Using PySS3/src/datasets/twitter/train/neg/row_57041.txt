The one girl that loves meSo I've been talking with this girl for a while. She hasn't killed herself yet but she said she was going to today. The day I was going to ask her on a date. It may not seem sad to you guys but this is the only girl I've loved a lot and she loved me back, I've also never had any relationship with a girl. I don't post on reddit often but please what the hell do i do?
