My life is a lie and all the lies are catching up with meI really donâ€™t know what to do
So, I (27yo F) had to do my thesis work to get my title as an architect, classes ended two years ago and I havenâ€™t done my tesis. 
Iâ€™ve been working but thatâ€™s not an excuse because Iâ€™ve had plenty of time to do it, but I just didnâ€™t want to, I donâ€™t know why but Iâ€™ve been postponing it.
So the time for me to present the thesis work is over, And I have to take one more year of classes in order to get my degree.
But Iâ€™ve told everyone (parents and bf) that this month Iâ€™m going to get my degrees because they think Iâ€™ve been working on my thesis,but non is not true. 
And now I donâ€™t know what to do. I thought of running away, or even committing suicide, because I canâ€™t keep lying
I canâ€™t tell them the truth because it would kill my parents and it would really hurt my boyfriend and I know he would leave if he knows Iâ€™ve been lying 
So I donâ€™t know how to tell the truth Iâ€™ve been lying so much to the people I love and itâ€™s not fair for them that I disappoint them. 
Iâ€™ve been googling ways to kill my self with pills
I fell like human trash
