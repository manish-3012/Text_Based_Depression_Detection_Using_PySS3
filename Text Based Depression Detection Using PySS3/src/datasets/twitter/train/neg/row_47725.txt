I'm becoming very close to breaking25 male college student here, who can't seem to find a job and who is flunking out of college this year. I'm becoming very close to just saying fuck it and jumping off a bridge. I haven't had a job in three years and spent all my time dedicated to school. And now after three years I'll be lucky if I have to attend school for extra semester. I am so fucking tired and I hate myself sooo much... I cant believe that I am having suicidal thoughts on an hourly basis. I'm such a dumb fuck up I deserve what's coming and I sense it's coming soon... My family is about to cut the leash on me and I have nowhere to turn now. I have no one to blame but myself.... I fear my death is very close I cant stop thinking about killing myself..... I'm soooo sorry that I such a fuck up I soooo sooo dumb I deserve all of this.... I cant afford help I dont know what to do anymore....
