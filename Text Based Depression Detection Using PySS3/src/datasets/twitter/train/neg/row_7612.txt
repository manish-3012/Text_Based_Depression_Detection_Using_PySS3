A placeholder lifeI figured this would be the best place to put this but please correct me if Iâ€™m wrong. Do you ever feel like a placeholder? Like youâ€™re just alive, waiting to die? Itâ€™s like Iâ€™m waiting for someone else to come along thatâ€™s a more updated version and they can just come and take over. Iâ€™m already so bored as an 18 year old, what more can life bring my way to excite me? I canâ€™t think of anything right now that would excite me. Iâ€™m always seeking the next thrill. The next thing to waste my hard earned money on. The next drug to try and escape. First it was cannabis, then MDMA, then 2-CB, LSD, Ketamine and DMT. Iâ€™ve done enough drugs to sink a ship haha. Iâ€™m just always looking to escape. Iâ€™ve had to deal with a lot of trauma as a child and teenager and now Iâ€™m only just an adult, I feel like Iâ€™m nearing my end but Iâ€™m okay with it. Iâ€™m not really scared of the end, itâ€™s welcoming in a weird way. Itâ€™s like, everyone treated me so bad in the past so why should this skeleton damaged with trauma have to burden this beautiful world? I just feel like Iâ€™ve reached my purpose. I got my mum and sister through many traumatic past partners, my sisterâ€™s going to be successful and if she isnâ€™t then sheâ€™ll have her rich dad to fall back on. I havenâ€™t seen them in a while. I miss them. I donâ€™t know, this is just a throwaway post to get my feelings off my chest. I just feel like Iâ€™ve already gone past my sell by date.
