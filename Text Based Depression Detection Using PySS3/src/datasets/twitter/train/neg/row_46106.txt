Leaving for the train stationI miss my ex so fucking much, which is sad cuz we've been broken up forever ago. Then seemingly overnight I became 2/10 and can't find a partner. That's not the only thing. I've been dedicating my life to art in school. I fucking suck at it tbh. I don't leave my room anymore, and it'll be over soon.
