I Didn't Kill Myself Last Night - Why Not?I feel asleep before I could kill myself last night. Why am I still here? 

It seems the only thing that helps is talking to people here. I'm so f--ked otherwise. 

I'm lonely, bored, young but chronically ill. I'll never have a romantic relationship. I have no purpose in life and without that there's really no reason to live. I have no friends and rarely leave my house. 

I want help but I don't know what to do.
