Why can't everyone treat nice people, niceHonestly, I treat people so nice.  I always make sure to treat others with respect and always try to diffuse situations. Everyone I've talked to always get mad at me. I feel like I can't do anything to make anyone happy. Everyone always says to make yourself happy first then make others happy. But I feel like people take advantage of my niceness and they make me feel bad. Like really bad.
