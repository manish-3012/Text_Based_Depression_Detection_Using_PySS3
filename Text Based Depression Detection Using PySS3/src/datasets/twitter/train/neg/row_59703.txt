SuicidalI had almost two months of sobriety and then I threw it away. I had just recently gotten back with my ex. After drinking we had a fight and things just went downhill from there. He told me yesterday that we can never work together and that the relationship is destructive. He also said I make him cynical and depressed. I just feel like such a horrible person and I don't see the point anymore. I've been experiencing suicidal ideation for a long time but this low I'm experiencing is like no other...it's reached to the core of my being. I don't even want to cry or think another thought. Everything hurts and the drinking is only making it considerably worse.
