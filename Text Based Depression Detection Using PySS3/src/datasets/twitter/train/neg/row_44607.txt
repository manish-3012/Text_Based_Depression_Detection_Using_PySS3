Finances got me downSo, trying to figure out if I am shallow here. I am a college graduate drowning in debt from student loans and a few credit cards. I really get down when I think about repayment (currently repaying). I moved to my parents house with a plan to pay it all down but I am not making any traction. I dont really feel like going to work just to pay debt and my current circumstance doesn't allow a lot of useful utility in life. Has anyone else wanted to take their lives because of financial matters? Also, there is more. I have never made good decisions. It was stupid to move out of state to college and now I am dealing with the consequence. It was also stupid to live beyond my means with credit cards. So with economic viability pretty much out of the picture for the rest of my life and being pretty untalented and otherwise mediocre where is the tragedy in offing myself? Never did anyone good anyway, I am really just a waste of oxygen.
