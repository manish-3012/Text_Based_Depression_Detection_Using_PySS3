Goodbye...Lost everything... Great world we live in.. Unless your poor.. Welp guess i have to go now.
It was fun talking to you all, guess we have a hard time taking our own advice. Hope i helped the few i gave words of wisdom too.. This has gone on long enough... sux how money controls our lives and so few have any. No kind words or pitty needed, i wont get it anyways. Just wanted to say goodbye to someone. "Broken, torn and battered, really my life never mattered". Much love hope you all find happiness someday. I truly did fight this but some wars u just cant win. Goodbye ðŸ˜¢
