Stuck in the dark place of wanting to and being too scared to do itI have been going through the worst times of my life and I am really tired of it. Itâ€™s like loneliness and sadness just took over everything and I am stuck in this place where I want to be gone and just end it to stop this shit, but I also seem to be scared of what is on the other side. I donâ€™t know. I have almost tried to end it so many times this past week, but I am nervous to find out whatâ€™s on the other side.
