Finally in the right mindsetHi, so I made a post earlier about this but I felt like maybe I should elaborate a little. I'm 14m and have never really considered myself "depressed" until recently. I had bad days sure, some of which I misinterpreted as depression, but I never truly felt the way I do now. Anxiety and my fear of multiple medical conditions coupled with increasing drama between my parents only serving to exacerbate my mental state have just become too much for me. I doubt I'll make it through the year, seeing as the thought of death is no longer a fear for me, but instead something that fills me with a vague euphoria and, for lack of a better word, happiness. With that fear of the unknown gone, all that's left is to find a method, which in my case shouldn't be too hard. Like I mentioned in my other thread, talking probably wont' do much, but I figured I should post it here just to get it out. Thanks for reading.
