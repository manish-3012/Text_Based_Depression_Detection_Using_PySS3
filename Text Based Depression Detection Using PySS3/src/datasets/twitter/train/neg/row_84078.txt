So I decided to stop being a shut in...Aaaand it didnt work out, i forgot how shitty people are, how awkward i am, and just how the universe decided that im not worth anything. I'm not ugly, im not mean, i dont try to always carry my sadness around spreading negativity to others, i may be a little weird but whats wrong with that ? The closest thing i have/had to a friendship is just being there for other people and letting them open up to me, while not talking about myself and keeping my problems bottled up. I honestly just think its worthless at this point, like wheres the joy in life ? I'm just being used, i dont have any real friends, and worst is that my mom only gives a fuck about what my brothers do and not me because i look like my fucking dad. Idk man, like honestly i dont even think i want a good friend now, it legit just feels worthless to make friends or even try to work on myself more.. like the only thing i can do is end my shit already but im too pussy for that too, so here I am, on the weekend, posting on reddit... I really hate my life dude hahaha whatever, atleast r/SuicideWatch can relate with me. Goodnight guys, i hope everyone else has a better weekend than me :)
