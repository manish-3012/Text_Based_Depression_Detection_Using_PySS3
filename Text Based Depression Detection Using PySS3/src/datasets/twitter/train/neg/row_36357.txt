Venting.I love life. I love every single breath of it. I love it, truly, dearly. Living every single day is like feeling palms of God caressing you on head, every single day is like a celebration of the beauty of life. For life, it's a pleasure, constant surprise, life is beautiful.

But I shall no longer be part of it.
I have schizophrenia. I hurt people all the time, without knowing. Living with my illness is hard, I have to be on meds. The only thing that I think is good about it, is that I can go to the kitchen, pick up the bottle with pills and consume it all. I don't even fucking care. I hate myself so much. I hate being in this world, being alive. It is like trapped in limbo, my soul is bound to this Earth, my soul cannot escape and it screams. I want it to be end. I want every single evil in the world to focus on me and destroy me. I want to be calm, I want to be patient. I want to be able to breathe the last breath of life into the wind and die, I want it so damn much. I don't care about my family, I don't care about my friends. They will be better off without me. I hate myself so much, I hate, hate hate hate hate hate. I fucking want to go away, I want to disappear, I want the bugs to consume while I rot in the soil, I want to be the one with the skeletons, I want my skeleton to be scattered, I want myself to be the one who is not called upon during the Last Judgement. Please, please, someone end this for me.
