I think I might kill myselfDramatic title, I know. But itâ€™s all Iâ€™ve been able to think about for quite some time. I donâ€™t want to die, I think, Iâ€™m just so tired of living. I am a high school student, in my last week of tenth grade. Iâ€™ve failed about 4 classes this past year and to make up the classes is so incredibly expensive and my family can not afford it. Iâ€™ve let them down. My mom makes me feel like shit about it and sheâ€™s right, I should feel like shit. Last year I got out of the abusive home of my father, who had been molesting  me for around 7 years. I cannot remember most of my childhood. I have been in and out of the courtroom and have talked to dozens of lawyers and therapists and psychologists and no progress has been made. I cost my family so much money and I canâ€™t even get a job. Iâ€™m so stupid that Iâ€™ve mostly given up on homework. I have no other options and I can barely function as is. I donâ€™t know what to do. I used to be so excited for the future and now I can barely stand to wake up in the morning. Iâ€™m sorry for bothering, please continue scrolling. There is nothing anyone can do for me.
