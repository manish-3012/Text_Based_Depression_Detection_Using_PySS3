latest attemptMy best friend when I was 13 hanged himself in the garage at a sleepover. I was the one to find him. He was the introduction to the things i loved like the guitar, now i cant even pick it up without bawling my eyes out. im fucking sorry, im so fucking sorry for not understanding what you were silently yelling out to me for

Then a year later came my other best friend, the one who helped me recover and gave me any feeling of happiness was shot due to an accident, the person who saved my life multiple times, pills or knife in hand. Gone, from a night of fucking minecraft to him being dead next afternoon. Died to violence when all he'd do is dedicate herself to saving and helping others. Its just how life is, and thats another reason why i don't want to spend another year here.

Its been 6 years since that sleepover, and with that 4 attempts, weak attempt after attempt. And now, last night. I always seem to pussy out last second or tell myself this time it'll kill me. This time i tied a noose, spent a few days debating and then decided to find the best rope i could. 30 seconds of me flailing around, then me thudding to the ground.  

To those reading this knowing the same struggle. you are far from cowardly for attempting, willing to never exist again. That last second before our jumps, slices, or swallowing death is something that requires infinite willpower. I dont even believe in an afterlife or any religion, but if there is one i wish when i do finally reach that willpower ill be able to meet them again
