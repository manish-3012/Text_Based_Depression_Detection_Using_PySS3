Some Kind of Cruel Jokeeveryone who acts like they like me is playing a Cruel Joke on me. Everyone hates me because I'm ugly inside and out and yet I still have the gall to want positive attention and love and affection when I don't deserve any of it and I'm really just fucking disgusting repulsive trash and I should just run away and die.
