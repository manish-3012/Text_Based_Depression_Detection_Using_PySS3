i donâ€™t know who to tell anymorei used to tell someone of all my suicidal and murderous thoughts. he didnâ€™t care but it helped. now i have no one. i have no friends left i have no one to talk to. people on reddit doesnâ€™t feel the same. it feels like they say what you want to hear instead of a friend saying whatever. keeping it all in is eventually going to drive me to do it but oh well
