BeliefsWhy mostly people who are atheist are suicidal.
I am not saying there is anything wrong with being an atheist but with the strength of someone's belief over something and perceiving the world in a positive way. Don't get me wrong i don't support or believe any religion specifically.
But i've seen people with depression and many other mental health problems who are atheists(mostly including myself and my friend circle and few researches over the web not on this sub particularly). If we don't have any option left but suicide why not considering and accepting some beliefs before we go it might change our mind...just saying. You can share your opinions on this and let's have a respectful debate. Much love
