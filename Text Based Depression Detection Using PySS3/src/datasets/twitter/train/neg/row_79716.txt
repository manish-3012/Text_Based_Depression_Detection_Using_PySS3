That strange feeling of inner peaceWho else gets this weird feeling of inner peace when the end feels like it's near?
It's hard to explain , looking around at people at work like it's the last time I'll see them or even hearing the birds sing. It feels like I've made peace with the world it almost feels like hapieness, euphoric even.
It's like nothing matters anymore because next week won't mater if I'm not here.

But then reality sets in when I change my mind again.
