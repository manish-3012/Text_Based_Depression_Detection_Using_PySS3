I keep a belt tied around my door knob at all timesJust in case I ever work up the courage to do it. I keep it tied because I know this is an effective method. I've tried it before; Got light headed in just a few seconds and nearly passed out before I started hallucinating and pussied out.

It strangely calms me down that it's there and ready. All it takes is 20 seconds of courage. That's all I need. I just don't wanna wake up tomorrow and go to work. Have to deal with my coworkers and fucking management again and get embarassed as always. I can't even begin to list how many thing in my life currently are fucking terrible. Even in a fucking movies it wouldn't be believable to have this much of a shit life. Fuck I don't wanna go to work tomorrow
