everyone fucks mei don't know how to calm down. why do i keep trying to make new relationships when they always fuck me? i feel like an idiot for trying again. i would rather be depressed and lonely than whatever is happening to me now. my arms are numb and i can't stop shaking. i humiliate myself every time i get into something like this. i'm mentally ill and not capable of maintaining friendships. i want to hurt myself.
