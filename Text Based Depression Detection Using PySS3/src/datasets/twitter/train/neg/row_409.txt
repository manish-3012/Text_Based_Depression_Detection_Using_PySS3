You know what really fucking hurts? Realising your sibling is way more successful than you, and way more than you could ever be.You know what hurts more? The fact that they're younger than you. 

It really just makes me wonder what the fuck am I doing so wrong in life to be this fucked up? I truly cannot do anything right, and if that doesn't prove it I don't know what will. 

Just why? Why the fuck am I like this? 

I swear I can't go on like this.

Why the fuck is life so cruel?

Why am I expected to continue to live in a world that clearly doesn't want me?

Because if it did, I wouldn't be dealt with a shitty ass hand of cards. 

(And, no. I did not say people clearly don't want me. I said the world. So please, don't start with the "you matter, people care, I care!" bullshit. You would not believe how many times I have heard that, and how absolutely tired I am of it. That shit has no meaning to me anymore. It's watered down. Tasteless.)
