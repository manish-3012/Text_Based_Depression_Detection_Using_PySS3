Soon I will have access to the drug to do it. Looking for one reason why I shouldn't.I'm fat, ugly, stupid, unemployed, can't drive, friendless, and never been in a relationship. I'm just a failure as a human. 13 year old boys are better than me. Nobody wants to be around such an abject failure. Therapy has failed and pills have failed. I will have the drugs soon and they will certainly kill me. So here you all go. Give me one reason not to do it.
