Really really close to ending itThe person I care about doesnâ€™t care about me. The world is falling apart. I am so isolated and alone. Iâ€™m fucking scared all the time and my anxiety is physically unbearable. Itâ€™s just all too much. I have the pills ready to go. The only reason Iâ€™m not right now is because I donâ€™t want to fail and take up a bed at a hospital. I am a worthless piece of trash who shouldâ€™ve died a long time ago. I have nothing to live for. I am selfish and mean and terrible. I have no job I dropped out of college and disappointed my family. I want to take control of something in my life because I feel so helpless all the time. What should I do bc Iâ€™m about to do it
