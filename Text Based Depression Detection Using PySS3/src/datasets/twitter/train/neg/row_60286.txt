I'm only 14.I hate this shitty teen angst. I used to do things. I used to hate going to sleep because I loved being conscious. Now I hate going to sleep becuase I know that when I wake up I'll have to face another day. And no one even knows what I'm going through. My life is perfect on the outside. My family is middle class, I have friends, and I'm funny and smart. I've only told my 3 best friends about my depression, but they din't even know about the OCD and the anxiety. I just can't grapple with existence. The only reason I haven't offed myself yet is because I'm scared that I'll still exist after killing myself. I wish that I wasn't so tired all the time. Antidepressants didn't change anything, therapy didn't help because there's nothing to talk about. I just enjoy nothing. People enjoy my presence, I'm decently attractive. I wish that I could just accept all the gifts I've been given, but instead I just am so fucking sad all the time. How do I start enjoying things and get motivation?
