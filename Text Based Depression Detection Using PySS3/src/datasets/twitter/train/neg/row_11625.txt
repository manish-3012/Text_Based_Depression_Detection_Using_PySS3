I can't connect with peopleI don't know how to.  Everytime I meet someone I have a genuine connection with, I never realize it until they're out of my life.  I'm not trying to meet people on reddit, I'm talking about in person.  It's like the universe just wants me to be alone.  Or maybe it's just what I want deep down so that way when I finally work up the courage to kill myself, I know I won't be hurting as many people.
