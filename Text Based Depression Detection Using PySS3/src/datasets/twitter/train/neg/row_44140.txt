I'm not sure what else to do.I've been fighting myself for whether or not I wanted to post something here for a while. I couldn't decide whether or not I even wanted help. 

My ex-girlfriend told me she started seeing someone else tonight. We still live together. It's been months since we broke up. I'm just too poor to afford to move out. I'm behind on all of my bills and my car has had a rejection sticker on it for over a year. I haven't had health insurance in years and I don't even have any family or friends anymore. I've tried really hard for months and months to get a better job so I can pick myself back up financially and get out but there's nothing out there. I guess at this point it doesn't really matter, I would just be alone and miserable in another location.

At this point I know that no one really cares about me anymore. I don't really care about me anymore. The only ones that did are gone or dead now. I've struggled with suicidal thoughts since I was a kid and I battled depression for as long as I can remember. The thing is, I don't even feel depressed anymore. I cried for the first time tonight in about a year, I guess, but past that I don't even really feel sad anymore. 

I think ending it all just sounds like a good idea. It seems like everything around me would get better if I did it and, also, then I wouldn't have to deal with my life anymore. 

I want someone to tell me that everything will be fine if I just hold on for a little while longer but I also don't. I've heard it all before and nothing ever gets better. It only gets worse for me. 

I don't know what to do. I want to just end it all right here right now but I would hate for someone to have to clean up the mess. My only solution in mind is to go somewhere where no one will find me or know what I did so that no one has to deal with me anymore. 

Is it wrong to feel this way?
