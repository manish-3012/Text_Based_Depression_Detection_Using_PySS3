one of those endless nightsthis doesn't happen that often for me, at least it hasn't been very frequent for the past few years. but here I am, tears welling up for no fucking reason. I feel like I've failed everyone. I have so much work to do but I can't focus on anything but the past (read: my failures in it) I'm not going to do it but it seems like such a fucking relief, like it would at least show the world that I hate myself as much as it hates me. Fuck. Feeling like this just makes me feel like more of a worthless pile of shit. I have so much that I need to do but I'm just laying down and crying. I'm an adult that can't truly grow up. I don't know how I could forget this feeling because it's the strongest emotion I ever feel, aside from love, which usually ends up the same way. I don't know why I'm posting this. I'm not a danger to myself, I just wish I was.
