What's there to say? Is this where I whine about life and beg for attention?I am a very unhappy person.  I hate the way I perceive life.  I see the worst in things rather than the best.  Shouldn't people have the freedom to at least govern their damn life at the very least? We defend a humans right to live above all else but not their right to choose not to live.  Anyways, yea. I am at the lowest point in my life.  I am scared that I will have nothing to lose soon.  I don't want to go back there
