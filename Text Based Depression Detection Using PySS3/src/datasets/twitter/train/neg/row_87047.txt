I must be some kind of mistake, why am I here?Cons of my life :

- I don't know the birth dates of anybody in my family, besides my brother, who's two days apart (different year)

- I barely know anyone in my family, even though I've visited them, I could care less about getting to know them, even my own parents.

- I have friends who never invite me to anything, which is odd because I rarely do anything to make me a disliked person, no one really responds to me in a negative way, I'm just a boring guy.

- I do the same thing almost every day, I wish I could do more, I wish I could get to know more people, I love talking, it's just that everyone I know is just so fucking boring and so fucking different.

- I can almost remember anything in my life, that's how dull and boring it is.

- I get a hard reaction from drugs, is it because I'm so empty that merely one hit can impact deeply?

- I rarely laugh at jokes

- I've almost never cried in my life, maybe a few times in my life, but it mainly because I didn't get something my way.

- If my someone in my family died tonight I would honestly not care at all, not in the slightest bit.

- Typing this out makes me look like the shittiest person alive, but I honestly wish I could relate to someone, I wish I could socialize, I wish I was able to do things, I'm just so used to be being boring and held back all the time that it has stuck with me greatly.

- When I think things like "what if there was no existence?" "what if I was set in a different year in time?" "why does life exist?" "what if I just die?" it makes me feel so great inside, like a small instance of euphoria

- ..But then I think "well what if this is all my imagination?" "but wouldn't that make my imagination imaginative as well?" "what if the world is fake?" "well the my thoughts would be fake?" "why does everything feel so artificial?" which just puts me more down, I'm not sure

- I never go anywhere

- I'm a shitty eater

- I'm terribly skinny

- I'm sitting down almost 70 percent of the day

- I have the urge to do something that'll kill me slowly, like start smoking cigarettes, or fuck up my body in some kind of way

- Everything I did enjoy slowly disappears, delayed video games (make a guess), ending TV shows (things that kept me from thinking about my own life), my mother moving out of the country, other bullshit

- School fucking sucks (sixteen year old, sophomore in HS)

- I'm almost nocturnal, I hate being awake during day

- Shit grades, I can do the work I just fucking hate putting in the effort and could care less

Pros of my life :

- I'm a fairly good artist

- I have a unique taste in music which I enjoy very much

- I love writing and letting my imagination go

- Food tastes good

- I'm not poor, and I'm not in a state of disgust

- I'm around pretty good people, (even though most of them are uninteresting as fuck)

Sure you might think, "Oh well, you kind of did that to yourself, you chose to be boring". Honestly I didn't, I live with the most boring/paranoid father in the world, won't let me go anywhere and won't take me anywhere. As for the making friends part, I'm not much of an outcast, I just can't relate to anyone, I do have current friends but I try to keep myself looking happy around them, but even that tends to fail.

I really can't find a place for my on this earth. I've tried finding one, but I really can't, and there's not point in trying to find one either.

I don't know what to do tbh. I may just be extremely selfish or something, I have no idea. Maybe it'll better for others if I just died. I may kill myself, or I might just live the rest of my life doing nothing and see where that takes me. Bleh.
