I can't do this anymoreTrying to make a TL;DR out of this, but I suck at it just as I suck at everything I do. 

I met my soulmate,  the love everyone dreams of, just over three years ago. A year ago, I moved in with him, and everything went wrong. It ended with him hitting me (twice... the first time I gave him a second chance,  but when it happened again I took my kids and left). 

The depression and feelings of failure are overwhelming. I have no friends and I am estranged from my family,  so I have nobody to turn to. I am unemployed and living on welfare (not in the US). 

My life is a mess, financially and emotionally, and I don't want to live anymore. The only reason I'm able to post is because the only final exit available to me at the moment is overdosing,  and because I have kids, I don't get enough time alone to go through with that. 

So I'm alone, and despite my "soulmate"  telling me that he will do anything to grow and change so he can make things right between us, he's spending this entire weekend with a younger girl who he met online. When I emailed him in desperation, he answered to say he he's with her until tomorrow,  then turned off his phone so I can't contact him at all. 

This is not all about him,  though.  I hate my life, I am 40 years old and I have never been happy,  never made a real contribution to make this world a better place,  never meant much to anyone. Everyone I've ever loved,  from my parents on,  has abandoned me. 

I don't know how I can survive another hour like this. I wish I had a gun so it could be over quickly.
