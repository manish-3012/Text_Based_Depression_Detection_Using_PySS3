Iâ€™m a fat 22yo neet with no future.I just donâ€™t see the point in going on. I have nobody to help me and Iâ€™m scared to help myself. I feel completely worthless at all times. I keep telling myself that if I turn things around it will be ok. But how do you turn things around? I would still live at home. Still have no friends. Still no real future. If I donâ€™t kill myself will still probably have fucking braces for multiple years. How the fuck Iâ€™m I supposed to find happiness whenever Iâ€™m the definition of a loser. Donâ€™t get me wrong Iâ€™m absolutely terrified of killing myself and dying. But itâ€™s an end to a miserable existence.
