How do I lose the fear.I got discharged this morning during dawn hours from observation precautions at an ER from a teaching hospital.

.

The night before, I was transferred to the teaching hospital from a free standing ER where I tried to overdose myself by drinking the hand sanitizer bottle in the waiting room when falling into desperation and realizing how bad my life could be getting if I was to need to miss work regarding a sports injury I had sustained that day.

.

During my outpatient stay of observation at the teaching hospital, there was an IV needle in my right arm. I really wanted to just use my left hand to just punch into it and tear my skin open and cause something fatal. But, I was scared. And, I don't know why. When the security guards would continue their prefect duties to rotate monitoring other patients on observation precautions, I wanted to just choke myself with the blanket, but the the thought was never made flesh. I'm still not knowing why.
