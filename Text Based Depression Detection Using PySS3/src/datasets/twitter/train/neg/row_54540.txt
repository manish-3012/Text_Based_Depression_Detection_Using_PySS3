Suicidal for 7 days nowI can't shake the feeling so I'm watching a lot of TV and reading a lot of books.
It's affecting my sleep schedule.
I can't shake it, my mind thinks of many ways to do it.
For example, I'm thinking after the lockdown I will go to the hardware store to buy chemicals to use as deadly gas.
I really can't take it anymore.
