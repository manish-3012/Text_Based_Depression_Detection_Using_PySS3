I've done a lot of bad things.I have regularly cheated on my spouse. She still doesn't know. I have no intention of telling her. I will definitely do so again if the opportunity presents itself while I remain alive.

I have, for petty reasons, derailed the lives of people around me. I did not let a neighbor use my phone to make a call that would stop him from getting evicted from his apartment because it was dial-up days and I was downloading some .mp3s. I wrote a college essay for a woman in a way that would specifically get her plagiarism caught and have her removed from her undergraduate program. This was not cosmic justiÃ§e; she interrupted my poker game, so I wanted to get her back.

Years ago, when driving a taxi, I hit a dog in the dead of night in the middle of the road. I got out to check. It had a collar and tag. I got back in the taxi and kept driving. I never contacted the owners. It would have been inconvenient. 

There are a lot of other instances. I don't intend to correct my behavior, and I expect all of this and other acts will come out sooner or later. Death seems like a good way to escape the consequences.
