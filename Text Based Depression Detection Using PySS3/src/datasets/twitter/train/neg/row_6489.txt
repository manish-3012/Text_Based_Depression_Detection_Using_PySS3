Months  of failure has rotted me, made me a literal retard, unable of thought.  Only able to comprehend his sad existence as something that is sometimes  good. Oh, that feeling- good- how relative a word. I would go into the  many examples about how good changes depending on perspective, but I  really donâ€™t care, and I lack that special prose way of speaking that  makes even the most basic of thoughts seem elegant. I wish to have that  ability, but I never will, I lack the will; Years of watching TV hasnâ€™t  made me a fool, but just compliant with my current situation. Iâ€™ve been  sleeping for 12-hour periods making me more of a literal dreamer than a  real person. My lack of a job has made my nonexistence even more  apparent. Sure, I sit in this chair and think, but all that means is  that my silly container is still working correctly. I need a paycheck  from some corporation to feel real as if I exist. Sitting around and  waiting for the death tolls from childhood and the opening of the gates of the stillbirth that is adulthood is making me sick and bored. What is  there to do in between these two states of life? There is nothing to do  get over it. Write your thoughts. Prove to yourself that all this is  real, but just wait all this will be real soon. All these delusions and  thoughts will dissolve as I become a true intelligent boy in the big  building called university.
