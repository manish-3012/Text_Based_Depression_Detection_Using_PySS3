...I'm starting to consider slitting my wrists and bleeding out. I just...dont know what I'm going to do. About six months ago, I moved from my home town to live with my brother. I had just got fired from my job at the hospital, and was moving between odd jobs here and there. Around December, I finally took my brothers offer to move to his place a couple states away. I've lived in my home town all of my life, and was tired of living there. I don't want to go back. It's been about six months since I've moved here. I've been applying for jobs endlessly. Out of the 100 applications I filled out, only two called back. I've been receiving unemployment from my old jobs, but I have about three months left before it runs out. Supposedly sometime in August I'll get my last UI check. I don't know what I'll do then. I came here as a last resort, and told myself that if it doesn't workout here. I'm done. I'm turning 21 here in a week, and I've already racked up a debt over 10k. All because of some fucking motorcycle accident where the lady didn't see me. I'm just tired of trying.
