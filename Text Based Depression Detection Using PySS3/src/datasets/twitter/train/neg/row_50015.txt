Nothing to live for. I'm lost.I post here nearly every month with a different account. I've been suicidal for years now and I might attempt it again. I've been to a psych ward before and it was horrible and I've also been through therapy but my depression is coming back in waves and it gets worse every time. I'm living with my grandma, have almost zero friends, have no job even though I've been trying to find one ever since I graduated highschool last year. I also can't get into college because I'm missing a math credit. I've come to the conclusion that I'm destined for a lonely life and my life is most likely gonna end by my own hand soon.
