Nothing left for me. Please help meI have been struggling with depression for two years and have attempted suicide ten times or more. I am a social person and I am very easy to talk to but I have always exhibited passiveness in which people push me around and mess with my feelings blatantly. I have low self esteem and rarely get girls and I'm sixteen years of age living in america. I want to be dead and I don't see anything on this earth that could benefit me because every single group of friends I've ever had has turned on me and started to dislike me and bully me. I feel lonely, abandonded, and unwanted by the general populous who previously used to be my friends. I am sad and devastated about my misfortune and I do admit, I feel sorry for myself, but that is not the cause of my sadness. I don't think I'm overthinking this all because so many people purposefully inflict pain onto me. Nothing ever goes my way and I have the worst luck with anything from chances to girls, etc,. On top of that, my girlfriend fell in love with another boy when we had broken up a year ago and now I feel like she is fading away from my life and she is the best thing that has ever happened to me so adding to my present loneliness, I am even more corrupt. I don't know what to do with myself and I have reached out for help numerous times but it seems even then I want death. Please help me, give me advice, or encouragement.
