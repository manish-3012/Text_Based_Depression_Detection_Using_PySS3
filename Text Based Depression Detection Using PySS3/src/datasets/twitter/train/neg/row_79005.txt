For my whole life I've been lonely, and I can't stop thinking about killing myselfI'm 27 years old, had an abusive family growing up, bullies throughout all of school, and I've never had friends. I've completely given up on relationships with the opposite sex, since none of them will even look at me. Trying to find even a same-sex friend is impossible. I've tried going to meetup groups, clubs &amp; organizations. But it seems that no one even wants to look at me or speak to me. I've tried numerous times to even say hello or start a conversation, but I'm always the excluded black sheep. 

I haven't gone out for a drink with anyone for about 7ish years now. And on the occasion I meet a person who I'd like to get to know more, it's always flakey last-minute responses where the other person has some emergency and can't go anywhere. 

I don't know what to do. I have no one to talk to about anything. Every day of my life is the same thing: wake up, work, come home &amp; do nothing, sleep.

Usually I wake up OK, but as soon as I see a happy couple or a family, I can't stop thinking about killing myself until I fall asleep that night. I have a noose tied &amp; ready, and a couple cups of bleach and ammonia laying around.  I imagine there is a warm feeling people get from hugging and kissing loved ones. It's going to sound pretty fucking weird, but the only I can get that feeling is when I sleep with a noose or my b&amp;a next to me. I just can't fucking help it.

Yes, I've tried meetup groups, various online groups &amp; organizations. Doesn't work, perhaps my desperation is seeping out, I really do try to hide it?

And now we have another weekend (a long one), where I get to stare at the clock all day and wonder, is today the day? 

I know none of you are capable of helping me, and any advice you give will be useless generic shit that I've read/heard a million times. But at least I found a place where I can at least write (if not speak) what's on my mind.
