A pointless goodbye note.As of now I've cut contacts with all my friends I used to talk to. I'm going to isolate myself from all the activities I somewhat still enjoyed doing and I'll lock myself in a dark place where I'll sit with a thing in my hands waiting till I lose completely all will to live or I'll die if dehydration whichever comes first. My life has no meaning I can't do anything this is what I have to do. Now all I have to do is wait for the battery to run out.
