burnt out with lifeDeath is inevitable, so why bother living? The concept of a meaningful life is just a lie to ensure survival of the human species, so is love and friendship and all that shit. I've tried. I've given it a go, but if I'm this burnt out from living at 14 whats the difference at 40? 
Social anxiety and depression don't seem to help me now and I have a feeling they won't go away. They sent me to a "patient centered counsellor". He thinks I have the answers to my life, the truth is I don't. I'm just tired. Tired of being weak, of being the weird one, tired of worrying about what people think all the time. I'm trapped in my own hell awaiting an inevitable bittersweet end. 
My mum is angry at me for being depressed because apparently I was born too lucky, too wealthy, too resourceful to be depressed. 
If I'm gonna die anyways why not spare everyone the pain and do it tomorrow, right? I have tried once, still wanna go so badly.
