"Things will get better"No they won't, I have been told this lie for damn years now and it hasn't gotten better at all! Things keep declining in quality and I am damned for eternity with the wretched filth humanity has done to my mind and body!

There is no better, im mentally broke and spent to the point I don't want to get out of bed everday. Waking up some days is a big middle finger on the disaster my life has been.

I miss my family even as shitty as they were, I miss the friends who took their lives before me or succumbed to Heroin addiction. I miss enjoying things and not having my head clouded with horrible thoughts of cruelty and death surrounding me.

Happiness is too much to ask for anymore. I do not smile anymore. Things are just hell and even before the pandemic things were not the best.

I am forever cursed with this life, living with all my mistakes and constantly losing those few people im surrounded by, either by their death or the subsequent permenant silent treatment.

I want to restart, I want to go back and fix my mistakes, but I know it is not possible, the only solution is ultimately my death.

I want to do it... but I can't... im too scared to take my life, and im too scared to continue down this path of life. These crossroads are not easy to choose and I have no idea what stupid bad luck, constant mistakes, and idiocy awaits the path of life before me.

Im in pain, just constant pain dwelling on the past and looking to the future. I want my mind to settle and be at peace but I do not think that will happen till I am gone.

I want death, but taking my own life is not something I look fondly of. Im scared of the pain and of what happens afterlife. 

I need something to change, because at this rate death is seeming to be a better alternative to waiting it out.
