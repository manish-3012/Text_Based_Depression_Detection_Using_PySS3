Can I just catch a fucking breakIâ€™ve been suicidal for a long time but always found some way to keep pushing on and all it has ever done is bite me in the ass. I pushed thru an abusive childhood just to get rejected from the military and have to continue to live in the abusive household after graduation. Then I had a mental health crisis and was in psych wards for almost a year where I lost a lot of friendships and my family temporarily abandoned me. I manage to convince my family to let me come back home so I can get on my feet and then I come back home and got really sick and had to go to the hospital. Got out of the hospital and it happened again and I had to go back to the hospital. I just recently got out and was starting a new job yesterday when I was on my way back from lunch while it was raining and slid off the road and totaled my car. So now I have literally nothing. No money, no car, no nothing to show for all this time Iâ€™ve been home. Iâ€™ve struggled with avoiding substance abuse as a coping mechanism as itâ€™s rooted deep into my genes and easily accessible. Now I have no choice but to sit and burden the people around me as they try to get me a car and keep me from offing myself because they know my mental health has never been the greatest. Oh and on top of all of this my girlfriend went to rehab and came back after a month and insists that a relationship isnâ€™t possible and that Iâ€™m selfish for thinking maintaining one would provide her more support than not having one. Guess thatâ€™s what they say in rehab no relationships and she took that shit to heart so thereâ€™s nothing I can do about that either sheâ€™s gone. Iâ€™m only 19 and itâ€™s been literally nonstop failures and disappointments since I graduated hs at 17. Iâ€™ve lost 30 pounds because I canâ€™t bring myself to eat anything. I think this is it. I truly think this is the time I take matters into my own hands I feel like a dumbass for letting myself suffer this long.
