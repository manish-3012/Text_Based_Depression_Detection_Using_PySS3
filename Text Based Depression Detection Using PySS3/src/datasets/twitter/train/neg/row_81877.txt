I feel so tired of lifeI'm 28 male, I have a fairly successful job in information technology, and I own my house. I have always managed to keep it together and not the rough parts of life own me, but I have tried to own them. At times, this has left me pretty cold.

My marriage failed. I think it was my fault. I changed and could no longer be happy in it. To be honest, I married her because it just felt like the natural progression in life. What I was supposed to do. I could never be open with her, I was never happy because she never knew who I was.

After I started seeing a another girl. This was a life changing thing for me, because for the first time I really felt like I could really  open up to another person. I stopped feeling so cold and all the flood gates of emotion opened up and I felt like a real person for the first time in 20 years. The only issue was she held a flame for her ex and then left me for him.

Right now, I know I could keep going. I could be successfully in life. I could meet something new. It just feels so pointless at the moment. Why should I bare the stress for another 50 years when I am going to die anyway when I could just get it over with. Nothing feels like it is worth doing and all I can do is think about sleeping forever.
