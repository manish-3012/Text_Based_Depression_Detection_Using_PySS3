Years of Love Forgotten. I've suffered for depression for a while now, the  more days that go by, the more I want to make the days stop. The only reason i haven't done it yet is for my son, he means the world to me, he's all i have left, but since his mother left me i haven't been able to see him, i can't  even take her to court for split custody.  It's legally impossible  for me  to. I  just have nothing left, some may ask about family? No fuck them, they fucked my life up from the start, they're the reason my life is so fucked up, there the  reason i can't see my fucking son, they're the reason i can't drive, they're the reason i can't get a job. I just can't keep doing this. The feeling of being worth less, the feeling of being help less. I just don't know what to do now, life just keeps getting worse with no sign of getting better. The only reason i haven't fine it yet is that i had my dad die when i was 5, i didn't under stand, how could he just leave me like that? I keep on asking for him,  but they told me he wasn't coming back. I felt abandoned, i was scared my dad left because of me, that he never wanted to see me again. I was to young to understand what was actually going on, and even though i don't see my own son, i don't want him to go through those feelings... But  every day gets worse,  I'm afraid I'm going to be overrun by the feelings that I'm going to end it all. I don't even know if i can be helped, I'm just begging for some help, i don't want to leave him alone.
