my boyfriend is having a really rough time, and i dont know what to do anymorei love him so much. i need him as much as he needs me. but hes going through so much right now, so, so, so much that i can't even fathom going through it at our age. i dont know how i'd cope if i went through the same thing. sometimes i think the best thing for him would be for me to let him go. but i dont want to. i love him so much but the future seems so bleak and itll be so hard for him. but i love him and i dont want to lose him. would it be better to let him go? i hate that. i dont want that but hes just in so much pain. this is the one thing i could do to make him so happy but its so painful. and things can get better, i know they can but it just seems so hard from now. i just want someone to tell me that my thinking is wrong, and that he should be here and suicide is the worst option possible. but what if it isn't? but it is, right?
