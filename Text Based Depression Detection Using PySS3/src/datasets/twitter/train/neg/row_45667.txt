I don't want to be alive anymorePretty much as it says in the title. I've spent years on this issue in my mind. Tonight, I may have actually come to terms with the fact that I am destined not to continue my life. I am OK with dying, with not being here anymore. I'm OK with nothingness. I'm OK with no afterlife, no reincarnation, no heaven, no hell, I'm OK with just dying and having nothing more. It may be the ultimate definition of peace for me. So now what.
I'm crying, I can barely see. I have no Paracetamol here to do what I will with. I don't want to do anything messy. I would prefer to take 50 valium and die in my sleep. So I guess all I have to do is wait. Not even sure why I've posted this. I guess this might actually be a final cry for help.
