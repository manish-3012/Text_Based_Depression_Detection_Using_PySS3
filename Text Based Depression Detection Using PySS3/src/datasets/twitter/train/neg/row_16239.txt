It's Everywhere.Every since almost jumping out that window a few days ago all I can think about is ending it. I don't know if its the constant pain from the gashes on my thigh but everywhere I look all I see is ways to end it. Oncoming cars, building roofs, all of that just looks like another chance to me. It used to be the cutting would buy me time and take my mind off of it but now it's all I think of. Even when I'm making a new slice I think of what would happen if I slit my throat instead. I'm not sad or angry, I don't know why I think about it all the time I just do. I know I need help and I'm getting it but it's not really helping because I can't trace the root of my urges.

I'm kind of approaching the end of my will power here.
