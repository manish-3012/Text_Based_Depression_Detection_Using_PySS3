this is the only place i can post thiswhy am i here? because im an attention whore? pretty much.

my entire life is just up and down. i have my friends but i cant really tell them this, i just feel like telling them would make it awkward and pointless. we are all introverts. i have 2 online friends but one is an asshole and the other is a nice girl who doesnt see the asshole in him, but neither of them know me, the girl has a lot of problems and i listen to her and try to help but the guy just jokes about it and that makes her laugh. mannn i hate it. i like her but i hate them.

anyways. life kind of just sucks tbh, i just scratch cut and poke stuff into my arm because i have nothing else to do, and it actually feels like it distracts me from thinking about things she says to him. call me a simp or whatever i dont care lol. i dont know how to talk to people i dont know how to make this feeling stop but i dont even want it to stop there are just too many things wrong.

i hate myself, im posting here for attention, no one is gonna be able to help me and i know that. i guess self pity is in there too, im fucking pathetic. i am having a hard time expressing my feelings with words.

my heart is hurting so bad, every time i think about her calling him his mum jokingly i start to cry. i want to cut them out but i cant and wont. my whole day i just think about her, i try to block it out but its always her. this also turns me against the guy. hes aight. im only 16 and i guess its just my brain but thats me right? so i hate me. im the most insecure, pathetic, attention seeking loser on this whole planet. 

my only hope is that some day ill muster up the courage to kill myself before i start to change

im posting here for closure i guess. i hate it so much i just want it to end.
