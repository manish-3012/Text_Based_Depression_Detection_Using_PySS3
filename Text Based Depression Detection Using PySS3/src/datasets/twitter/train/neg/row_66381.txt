I feel alone and I just want to end it allI don't want to be alone. I want to be around the people I love but they don't want to be around me. No one gets that my brain isn't healthy. No one cares. I'm trying my best to get better but it's still held over my head. I just want this life to end so I can't feel ever again. I don't want to rely on medication, I don't want to argue with someone else I love ever again but I have cause so many problems everyone hates me. I try my best to be a decent person but I fall into bad places mentally, I try to apologize, I've tried to stop, I've tried to get help.

I just want this suffering to finally end. If I could right now I would.
