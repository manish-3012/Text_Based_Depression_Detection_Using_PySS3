WhyQhy does nobody like me? Why can't I make friends? Why am I alone all the time? Why am I so ugly? Am I really that unapproachable? I'm so useless to this world. No job. No school. No natural or learned talents. No special interests. Never had more than 100$ to my name. How can someone be so insignificant?
