Nothing left for me here.I've come to the conclusion that I can't amount to anything. Before you say it takes hard work to do anything, know that I can't do anything. I'm lazy and unmotivated to try. I'm going to either live a life of failure or jump into traffic. Most likely the ladder. This is goodbye.
