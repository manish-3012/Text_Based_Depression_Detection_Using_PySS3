I'm sitting here contemplating.....if i want to do it or not. These past few weeks I've found myself thinking more and more of just ending it, i feel like I'm hopeless. The decisions i make turn out to come around and go wrong leaving me this confused saddened mess, who can't seem to catch a break. I'm not very religious and don't think this is some other power keeping me down like this, I don't know what I'm doing wrong. I only have a handful of friends these days and my family is distant from me. I've been off of the meds that were given to me by my doctor for about 3 months now as I can't afford them anymore and I just feel worse every day. I constantly keep imagining scenarios where i off myself with a very real gun that I have more than enough access to. I don't want to think like this anymore I just want help.
