Ugh (huge TW for self harm)I don't even know what to say here. I don't have the words to explain just how much life hurts right now. I don't want to die, I just really don't want to live like this and I don't know what to do about it. I just cut myself, and I already feel like I need to do it again. Just to have that moment of peace, where my brain isn't screaming at me for all my failures and all the ways my life will never live up to any expectations ever. I just need a break from my brain. Just a day or two, maybe, where I don't have to be me. But that's not how anything works, so here I am - posting on reddit instead.
