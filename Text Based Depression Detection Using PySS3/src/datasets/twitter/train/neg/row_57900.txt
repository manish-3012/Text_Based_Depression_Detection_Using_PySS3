Ever feel..The world is so, so fd up, humans have destroyed everything that is good, everyone is so selfish, there is more evil than good, nothing is fair and itâ€™s just not worth hanging around. I often go to bed and wish I never wake up. If I never had dependants Iâ€™d be so out of here - Iâ€™m 48 - and too sensitive for this world. I wish I never had dependents, Iâ€™d be out of here otherwise.
