Another cowardly rant...Don't know why I am writing this, but today I have decided to write a farewell letter to my family and keep it with me at all times because I am afraid I will put an end to my life soon.

No one else is there to blame for my choices I have made. People keep saying try this or that. I cannot seem to fins any motivation at all, be ot my parents, my grandmother, my sister or friends. I know they will suffer, but I (selfishly?!)   feel this is about me after all. 

I have made too many bad choices for 30 years now. I have made several acquaintances over the Internet who have all been extremely understanding, but I still feel that I myself do not want to succeed. As simple as that. No matter what advice I am given, I do not have the courage to take my life into my own hands.
I have been a cowars my whole life. 

I will write a farewell letter now and keep on me every day. Just a rant I guess. I am not special, nor have I had a tough life. Just tired that is all. Someone else could have used the comfort of life I have had way better.

Who knows, maybe I willu get hit by a car lethally and at least I will have the letter on me.
