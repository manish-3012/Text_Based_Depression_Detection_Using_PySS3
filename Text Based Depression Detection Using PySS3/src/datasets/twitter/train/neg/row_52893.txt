I am one of the top students in my school, blesses with logic enough to win me some competitions. However, my life feels empty. I see people around me with their friends, loving each other and having fun. I desire such fun yet I cannot have them. Can I die now?Living have been such an arduous task. On most days, I have to will myself to 'be a person' and go out there to meet people. I just don't feel that this life is for me. I know that one day my life will end. But I can't wait for it. Am I legitimized in killing myself? Don't give me sugar-coated truth on why live is worth living because there will always be people who care about me. They will move on once I died. My parents can make more kids if I am gone. My friends - if any - will probably not notice that I am gone. Give me your genuine opinion on why live is worth living or not worth living with respect to my situation. I know I seems arrogant and ungrateful, such intelligence and yet I am still unsatisfied with my life. I am sorry if I come across as an arrogant, ungrateful individual. If I can choose to not feel this way, I would have done it a long time ago. However, that is the thing with depression. You don't have depression. It owns you. It controls you in every aspect of your life. Help.
