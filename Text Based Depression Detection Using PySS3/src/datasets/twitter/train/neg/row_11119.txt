Going thru really bad breakupMeh so like 2 bad long abusive relationships fast forward. Thought i was healed but this relationship ended really fast and abruptly and they p much have isolated me from all my friends and are ignoring me until they move all because i wanted to take it slowly because of sexual trauma. I know I shouldve worked on that but idk everything happened so quick and I am just reeling
Adding to the fact that I am getting barely one day a week at work, I have no family I can talk to, my health isn't doing well
I just feel so much turmoil inside and idk how to deal with it.
I feel like throwing up, ripping out my hair, getting drunk, anything you name it.
I am so tired of myself. I feel unloveable and worthless and sick.
I can't sleep for the last week or so. Also drinking a lot. I wish I could disappear. I wish I could make bad thoughts go away.
I'm so tired. Why is my brain so broken... I wish I ran away when I was younger, that I knew I would end up being abused by so many different people. So I couldv gotten away.
I feel like a waste of a human.
