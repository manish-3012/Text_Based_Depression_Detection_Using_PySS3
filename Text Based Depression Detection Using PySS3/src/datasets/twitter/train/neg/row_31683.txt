Iâ€™m getting a promotion at work but why donâ€™t I feel betterI have been suicidal for awhile now, but how intense the thoughts surrounding it vary depending on my current environment. I recently graduated, but with the pandemic and other personal reasons, Iâ€™m unfortunately living at home and despite being fortunate enough to be working, I was still in an intern position at a company I had been working at for over a year and half now. I was (fairly aggressively) applying to jobs since graduating in May, but nothing was working out and any positions that followed up with me were essentially to say, â€˜we think youâ€™d be great, but weâ€™re not hiring atm bc of the pandemicâ€™ which definitely started to hit hard after the first few times. With this, my parents were actively encouraging me to pursue my masters, which I did want to do, but I needed a break. 

All the stress has started to compounded and lately Iâ€™ve been consistently having a steady stream of thoughts in the back of my head. At first it was about how I could die and I wanted to die. It then moved to I need to die and I should just die. This is definitely new territory for me, and although Iâ€™m not self harming and I havent in years, the fact that these thoughts wonâ€™t leave me alone is really upsetting me. When it started, I thought it was caffeine related, but itâ€™s just all the time now and I feel like thereâ€™s no end in sight. 

My boss is great and he was fortunately able to work out a full time salaried position for me that I will be moving into within the next couple of weeks once some paperwork gets sorted. The expected salary is much, much more than I anticipated it would be, and frankly feels to be much more than I deserve. I feel like this should make me happy, as it takes some of the stress of finding a full time/ well paying job, but Iâ€™m not. My boss stopped by earlier to congratulate me and assure me that I deserve the position, but I think he could tell something was off, because he stopped for a moment to ask â€˜are you as excited about this as I am for you?â€™ I reassured him I was before sending him on his way, but Iâ€™m not. I just feel so exhausted all the time and I constantly have headaches, which have worsened recently. 

Theoretically, I should feel better, and I feel like such an ungrateful brat for not. But I canâ€™t seem to shake this and if anything, I feel even more stressed out for seemingly no reason. Has anyone been in a similar position? any advice is much appreciated
