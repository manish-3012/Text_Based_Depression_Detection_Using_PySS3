Nobody will care if I dieI just have nobody to care about me and feel I have no reason to live. I always get bullied and made fun of. Even if I were to end my life nobody would remember me if I was gone.

I've been feeling suicidal for 6 years.... I've been through many suicide attempts and even been to a mental hospital... But none of them help. And I feel the only thing that can help is suicide. It's been a good time on reddit and figured I would post this as my suicide note. Goodbye everyone.
