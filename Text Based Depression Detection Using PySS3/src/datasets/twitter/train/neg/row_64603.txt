I can't even do homeschooling15, f. Thanks to the horrible school years I had through high school, I've now associated all that with the process of learning. I feel like my back is against the wall and I just feel like dying. Also please don't say "Go do whatever you have nothing to lose" because I feel like I *do* have things to lose, it's just that I can't see a way out of this situation without killing myself.
