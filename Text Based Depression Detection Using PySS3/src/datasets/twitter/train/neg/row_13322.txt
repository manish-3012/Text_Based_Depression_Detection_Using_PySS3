My boyfriend attempted suicide todayI'm not too sure what to do, how to feel, or what to say to him? I feel like he's been depressed for a long time. I feel helpless. I'm scared. He said he was tired and going to bed, but all I keep thinking about is what if he wakes up in the middle of the night and tries again. I don't want to pressure him, scare him off, or say the wrong thing so I've barely said anything at all so far. I just sat in silence on the phone after asking him like two questions. I kept telling him I love him, because it was all I could say. I don't want to lose him.
