Nobody will understand till after you dieLike people say nobody cares till after your dead, but i think its primarily because it doesn't make sense till after you die. Im suicidal and i had a girlfriend, but she has past trauma with suicide, and i was not healthy for her mental health. And obviously i love her, so i broke up with her so she doesnt have to deal with that mental pain of me always wanting to suicide. She wont understand that i did that till i die, and by then it will be too late. Even for my parents, depression is a joke, till they see my dead body being dropped beneath the ground. Suicide is like a way to make everything you said finally make some fucking sense too people. They wont ever connect the dots of the actions you do, the small cries of help that you force out, until after your gone. What a fucked up system of a world we live in
