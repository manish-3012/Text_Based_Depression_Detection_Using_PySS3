I'm still hereI always post and I'm just annoying a bratty and everyone is probably pissed off. I have nothing left. This is the only place where people listen. I've tried therapist and hospitals and they won't help me. I feel like I'm at the end. I have bpd and I always have low mood like this and I just don't know what to do anymore
