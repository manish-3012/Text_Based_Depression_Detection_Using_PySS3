I think I have depressionI'm not gonna outright say I have it, cuz I might not, but I've been suicidal for years and have felt this way for years. I check off literally every single symptom and it's not really my fault I'm not diagnosed. My mother and stepfather were abusive and homophobic as hell (I'm lgbtq+), and they had no clue about what was going on with me. I knew they wouldn't get me treatment though, cuz a. They already talked down on people with depression, anxiety, etc. And b. the one time I broke down and told my stepfather I was suicidal, he told me i was horrible and I was going to hell.
