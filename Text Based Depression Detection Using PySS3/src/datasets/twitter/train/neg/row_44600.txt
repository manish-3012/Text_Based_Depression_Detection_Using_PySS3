Wrote out my suicide note tonight. Still haven't fully fleshed it out yet.Mom and Dad: I love you and Iâ€™m sorry to cause you all this pain, though Iâ€™m sure, to some degree, you arenâ€™t surprised. You guys know Iâ€™ve dealt with depression for years now, as well as the pictures you found on my camera when I was a teenager. What you may not know is that Iâ€™ve dealt with self-harm on and off for years, starting around the time of that picture, continuing occasionally once I reached about 20-21. I never told you guys about any of this because I didnâ€™t want to make you worry. I have attempted suicide in the past as well. As for why now? There are a lot of reasons, honestly. Iâ€™ve never felt like Iâ€™ve been a particularly good son, father, or boyfriend. I know that you guys have always told me to ask when I needed help and that youâ€™d always do what you can, but I know that you guys had to make sacrifices to do so. I  know that you think thatâ€™s your responsibility as a parent, but I know you guys still struggled so you could help me. You may not have consciously or actively thought it, but Iâ€™m sure, deep down on some level, that you guys wished I would just get my shit together and be an adult and learn to take care of myself. Well, this is the last time youâ€™re going to have to take care of me, now.


(Girlfriend): I canâ€™t say thank you enough or that Iâ€™m sorry enough. I know Iâ€™ve hurt you, several times. Iâ€™ve hurt you more than you ever deserved, and youâ€™ve helped me way more than I ever deserved. Iâ€™m sorry to do this to you but I canâ€™t take it anymore. Knowing the pains that Iâ€™ve caused you, the scars Iâ€™ve left upon you and your personality, even your mental well-being, and knowing that youâ€™re going to carry these the rest of your lifeâ€¦ I canâ€™t deal with it anymore. That said, I canâ€™t say that I ever appreciated you going through my private belongings and telling people things they neednâ€™t know. You have issues with personal boundaries that you need to get in check. I know youâ€™ve said time and time again that if you think something is going on, youâ€™ll find out. I understand why you would go through my computer and my phone, but my journal is crossing the line. Youâ€™re the third fucking person in my life to go through my journal and I donâ€™t fucking understand the logic behind it. That is a complete invasion of my privacy and my trust. And, about telling people things they donâ€™t need to know. Youâ€™ve brought up about my bomb threat to, at least as far as I know, (old coworker), when we were on (account name). And youâ€™ve brought up shit about my stamina/our sex life in front of people like (old coworkers), and Iâ€™m sure youâ€™ve told others I donâ€™t know about. While youâ€™re doing it, you have the most smug look on your face from the sick, twisted enjoyment that youâ€™re getting from putting me on blast in front of people. But you donâ€™t see anything wrong with this. Maybe this will change your mind.


(Son): I love you and Iâ€™m sorry. Iâ€™m sorry that you had to grow up with me mostly not around, and with two parents that canâ€™t stand each other. Iâ€™m sorry I wonâ€™t be around to watch you grow up, but that may end up being for the best. Iâ€™ve never been the best father to you. Iâ€™ve yelled at you for things you didnâ€™t deserve and taken my frustration out on you for things you didnâ€™t do, or at the very least, didnâ€™t warrant a response like I gave you. Iâ€™m sorry for passing along this crippling mental illness, but I hope that you can cope better than I have. Please, if youâ€™re ever feeling depressed, that you feel like hurting yourself or killing yourself or anyone else, please talk to someone. Please talk to your mom, your grandparents, your teachers, anybody. Donâ€™t put yourself through this. Youâ€™re not weak for reaching out for help.
