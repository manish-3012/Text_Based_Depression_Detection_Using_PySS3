im scared of myselflast year i lost my grandfather, i had gotten raped, and i had two other losses in the family.

two weeks  I lost my aunt who I was so close with. she raised me as if I were her child because my parents were always away 
 i can't bear this. it hurts. it always hurts I need to die I need to make it go away 

i don't want to be a burden on anyone
