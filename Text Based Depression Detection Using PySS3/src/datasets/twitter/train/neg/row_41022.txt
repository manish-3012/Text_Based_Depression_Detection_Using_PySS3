Why is suicide consider a bad thing.?I have lost everything in the last month including friends and my girlfriend. No one seemed to care that I did until I started taking drugs and alcohol. Then everyone calls me selfish and my ex girlfriend kept preventing me from doing it. Why can't I just be left alone.
