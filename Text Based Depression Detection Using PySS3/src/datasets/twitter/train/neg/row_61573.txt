I made a plan to die before Iâ€™m 20Iâ€™m 19 and In a week I will Take a train for 3 hours check into a room, meet my boyfriend who cheated on me our whole relationship, lied about everything, and manipulated me for the first time. Iâ€™ll tell him I know he cheated again but I just needed to see him one last time. Tell him that even though heâ€™s a liar I loved him more than myself, kick him out.
Take a whole bottle of sleeping pills with vodka and slit my wrist. 

The hardest part is saying bye to my cat. Sheâ€™s my world and the reason Iâ€™ve been here this long.
