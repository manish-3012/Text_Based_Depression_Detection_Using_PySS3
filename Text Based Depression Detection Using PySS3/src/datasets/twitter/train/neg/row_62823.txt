I'm a college freshman and I've been struggling. I want to leave the number of a 24hour student hotline on my HS graduating class FB group, but I'm worried that everyone will be mad at me and hate me even more. I think it might help at least one person.I've been accused of trying to be fake-nice or a fake good person so many times by these people. Whenever I tried to do anything positive, they would mock me. But I think this number stopped me from killing myself. I don't think enough people know about it. I think it might help one person. But I'm scared people will think I'm posting it for attention. The guy who posted on the group before me, left a long emotional and loving post. Everyone was showing him so love. I'm scared they'll think I'm trying to be like him. I'm scared. But this might help one person. That's all that matters.
