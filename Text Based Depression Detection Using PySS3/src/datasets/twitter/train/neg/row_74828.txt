Appreciation post, but also I need help with something!Iâ€™d like to say thank you to all the people who commented supportive and kind things on my previous post (deleted because I hate looking back at my â€œIâ€™m about to kill myselfâ€ rants, since I didnâ€™t go through with it). Anyway, because of those heartfelt words, I got through another night. I still have these intrusive thoughts, but I feel less alone. Hopefully, I can get to a point where I donâ€™t have such suicidal thought anymore.

I also have some questions:

- how do you cover up small tattoos?

- how do you cover up self-harm scars?
 
So, Iâ€™m a 14 yo female, and my mom noticed my stick and poke tattoo (where you take a needle and ink and then repeatedly poke yourself). I quickly used the excuse, â€œI just draw it on every dayâ€. She believed me, but Iâ€™m scared that sheâ€™s going to find out itâ€™s not just a drawing. Itâ€™s on the side of my finger, and itâ€™s not that big, but I just need a way to cover it up. Should I use like a full coverage concealer?? Iâ€™m not really sure. And please donâ€™t be like â€œitâ€™s your faultâ€ or â€œwhy would you do that anyway?â€. To me, itâ€™s like another way to harm myself. I wish I had never done it, but it was impulsive and during a time that I was not doing well.

The same goes for my self-harm scars. They are on my thigh and Iâ€™m scared that if we go swimming, my mom is going to question them. I donâ€™t know what to do. Again, would concealer work? And if so, what kind? I can only buy makeup from the drugstore because I am only 14 and donâ€™t have a lot of money.
