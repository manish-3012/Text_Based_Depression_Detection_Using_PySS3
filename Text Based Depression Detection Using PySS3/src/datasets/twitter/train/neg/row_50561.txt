I kept on living, what now?Iâ€™ve always struggled with depression. Throughout my high school years, I idealized suicide and was very close to going through with it on multiple occasions. I was just sick of the pain of everyday life. Everyone always told me it would get better, so I waited. They lied. I had some ups, but I always end up back in the same place - depressed and suicidal. Here I am in college with a miserably low gpa, an ex who just broke up with me, and a lifetime of student debts to look forward to. Everything that once brought me joy is gone. I feel numb. Is now my time, or do I just keep on living through the pain?
