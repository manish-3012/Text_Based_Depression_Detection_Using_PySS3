Doxylamine SuccinateSo I made an attempt tonight, well an attempt so far. I probably took 20 or so of these , so around 500mg or more. After about an hour or two in I started chugging water and throwing up. Now I'm just sitting here having moments of feeling like waking up when you doze off, you know, that affect where you kind of startle yourself. I'm not sure what to do. I know people are going to tell me to go to the hospital, but that's going to be a big scene. Plus I'm really far from one and without insurance. Is there a serious risk here?
