It is no one's fault for me wanting to take my life. It is selfish but I accept that. No one owes me anything. But I can do what I want.Being honest with myself is exceptionally important here. Removing myself from this world affects those around me much more than it does myself in the end, and I get that. But now I have such a limited staff in that category that it doesn't matter much. I don't want to hurt any of you nor waste any of your valuable time. I just want to get that message out whilst I prepare. Thank you for being you.
