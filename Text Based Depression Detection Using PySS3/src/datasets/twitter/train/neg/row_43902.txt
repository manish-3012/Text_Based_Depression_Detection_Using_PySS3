Overwhelmedâ€ªI just feel an overwhelming amount of sadness. I havenâ€™t been ok for a Long time and I am starting to feel hopeless about being ok. 

I know it will pass but it doesnâ€™t pass for very Long and I donâ€™t know, I keep feeling like I am not doing anything right.

I feel so so lonely in all of this. I am not comfortable sharing with my family about this because they donâ€™t â€œbelieveâ€ in mental illness. I donâ€™t want to call up my friends because I donâ€™t want to trouble them and I am too afraid to call a suicide helpline. I keep feeling like I am just too sensitive or whatever I am feeling isnâ€™t as bad as it actually is.

I have an SO but sometimes, Idk if itâ€™s because I am afraid to come off vulnerable and needy if I tell them about how I feel or I just afraid that they donâ€™t really understand me and as a result wouldnâ€™t be able to support me emotionally. I know he isnâ€™t obligated to do so either but I feel like I am going to break apart soon. I just really want someone to hold me tight. 

As edgy and cliche as it sounds, I just feel like no one will ever truly see me as I am and itâ€™s so fucking lonely to feel that way. 

Like everyone else here, I want to end my life. I just havenâ€™t found the push to do so. I love life and I love the people I have in it but I donâ€™t love myself and I wish I didnâ€™t exist. 

I wish I could just go away painlessly and everyone could forget about me.
