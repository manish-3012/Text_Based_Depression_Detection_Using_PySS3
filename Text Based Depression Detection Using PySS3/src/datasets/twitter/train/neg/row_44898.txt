Hospital trip?Iâ€™ve been extremely suicidal for weeks now. I havenâ€™t been able to bring myself to go to work (I make my own schedule), I can barely wake up to bring my dog outside to pee, Iâ€™m not eating. I have no idea how to kill myself successfully so Iâ€™m too scared to try and have it fail. Idk what other options I have other than going to emerge and checking myself in, but last time I went they didnâ€™t have room for me on the psych ward and I was left to sleep without any pillows all night because of a shortage and I couldnâ€™t eat because of how disgusting the food was. What the fuck am I supposed to do? Iâ€™m at my end. I just want it to be over.
