Why does living have to hurt so muchI can't stop hurting. I want to cease to exist. I keep making mistakes and fucking up. I keep hurting those closest to me. I want to blow my head off but then it just makes things worse for everyone. So I stay alive in constant pain so that others don't have to suffer through any worse pain. I wish that there was an accident or that someone would do me the favor of ending me. At least the pain wouldn't be as bad as me doing it myself.
