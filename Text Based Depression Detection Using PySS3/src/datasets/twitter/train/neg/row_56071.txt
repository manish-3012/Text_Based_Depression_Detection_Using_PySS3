I don't want to be anxious anymore.I've ruined my life avoiding anxiety. I'm 25, got into debt failing out of college twice because my response to anxiety is avoidance and procrastination. Because of that and not having a car only minimum wage jobs are available to me and its just not worth it. Management is the only route upwards for me but I cant get through a shift without constant, unstoppable ideation.


My life isn't worth living. If i could go back I would do so much differently but now I'm in debt, working a shit job and can't make friends because socializing involves so much anxiety.


Being dead is preferable to further years of anxiety and self-loathing.
