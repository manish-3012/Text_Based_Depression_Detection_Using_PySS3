I thought I was okayI got a job, a beautiful place to live, had a great relationship. I'm losing my job and can't find a new one. I'm just not good at anything anymore. I am tired of fighting. I am disgusting. I wake up and the first thing I think of is shooting myself in the brain stem. I haven't been able to get out of bed in weeks now and my job is gone. I have a degree in a field thirsty for workers yet can't find anything. I'm no good for no one now

I can't talk to anyone about my problems or my childhood. All my friends died

I am posting here because I know I should be but maybe this is just a formality. I've typed out my note ten times already. Sorry for taking up your time. I am glad there is a place like this to exercise my thoughts
