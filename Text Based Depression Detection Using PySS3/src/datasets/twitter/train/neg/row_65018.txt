"suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem"...what if my problem isn't temporary?I have a great job, lots of money, nice car, e.g.  What I don't have are friends, or a social life whatsoever.  Never mind a SO.  Things that money cannot buy.

Since I left college several years ago, I have been getting lonelier and more depressed every year.  I've come to realize there is nothing left for me in life.  The best days of my life are behind me.

My problem is not 'temporary'.  The reality is that for the next 50 years I will come home from work, maybe work out a little and then repeat it all again the next day.  I can't remember the last time I was happy.  I don't even remember what being happy feels like to be honest.

If suicide will prevent me from spending the next 50 years as miserable as the past few, why not?  I would love to go to sleep and not wake up.
