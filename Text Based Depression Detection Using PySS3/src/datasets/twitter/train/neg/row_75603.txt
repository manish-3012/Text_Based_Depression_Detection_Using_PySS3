Needing to talkLately (starting roughly 2-3 years ago, but progressively) I feel trapped in my mind. I feel detached from reality to the point that 30% of my day is spent wondering/hoping/feelinglike I am not in reality. That I'm stuck in a "fog" or dream world. My mind goes numb, and I begin to panic if I even look at my reflection anymore. I can't stand to see my own reflection because of how depersonalized it makes me feel. When ever I am in close proximity with any other human (even close friends) My mind is uncontrollably filled with thoughts about them from horridly harming them, to doing socially unacceptable things to them (not sexually) that I know I would never do. Yet these thoughts still force their way in my mind. I don't know what to do. I feel trapped, fogged, horrible, paranoid.
