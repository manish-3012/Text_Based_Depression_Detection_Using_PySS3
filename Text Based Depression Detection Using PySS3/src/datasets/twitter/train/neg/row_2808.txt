I lost everything last night.So, last night when I was talking to my fiancÃ©, I mistakenly answered a question wrongly, so she rage quit herself and suddenly reveals everything that she is cheating on me with my worst enemy all this time. She ask me to go die. 

I have suicidal thoughts before this for other reasons and it was her and my cat are keeping me intact. Since she is gone, why should I care. I have no one. No friends. I am so lonely.

I already thinking about live streaming my pain, agonising death.

Is this normal? Should I just proceed?
