Is it normal to picture yourself committing suicide every day?I donâ€™t think i would actually ever do it for a number of reasons... 

I guess Iâ€™ve been wondering if this is ok? Iâ€™m 25, have General anxiety disorder and mildly depressed with an unhealthy mixture of laziness I think. To be honest Iâ€™m not sure if Iâ€™m lazy or if Iâ€™m just running away from daily problems...

Every single day I imagine myself committing suicide. In all types of ways. Itâ€™s like I can picture each step.... up until the moment when I picture my mother finding out about my death. Then I stop and feel guilty. Like I said, I donâ€™t think Iâ€™d do it. I wouldnâ€™t be able to hurt others around me but sometimes I just wish that I didnâ€™t have to wake up and be a burden anymore.
