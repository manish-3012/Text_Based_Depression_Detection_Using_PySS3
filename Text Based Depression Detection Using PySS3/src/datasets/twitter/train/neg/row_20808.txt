Afraid to postIâ€™m sure Iâ€™m being overly sensitive but I thought the reason people posted here was to possibly find someone to talk to or to get something off of their chest. My last post ended with someone telling me to just do it since I had it all planned out so well. Maybe Iâ€™m just not tough enough for the internet as well as not being strong enough for life or suicide. 

Iâ€™m sure there are plenty of you out there feeling trapped. Canâ€™t live, canâ€™t die. Iâ€™ve been sleeping all day but my sleeping pills rarely work any more. Iâ€™m just laying here alone now wishing I had the strength to do something.
