Sort of not too bad news...Hi, I just wanted to give an update on my situation. I don't feel so bad right now... I only have two months left on my unemployment insurance, for sure it cause me some stress but at least I took a few steps and they're starting to give concrete results (I hope so). I called at a place dealing with toxicomany and homelessness and I asked if they were hiring nightwatchman. Then, they told me to come to see them right away on the next morning and I got an interview with the manager. It seemed encouraging, he told me he will need employees soon, at least for the summer and maybe for an even longer period. I got an appointment at another similar place too. Then, there's also a chance that I could get Prior Learning Assessment Recognition, I asked for a recommandation letter at the suicide hotline center, where I worked for two years as a volonteer. I had 180 hours of accumulated volunteering, so I hope it will be enough to get throught the PLAR process, they told me that in case I don't have enough knowledge, they will ask me to do some homeworks to complete my curricular and then, I'll be able to receive a diploma. Let's see how things will be going in September... Finally, I don't feel so depressed, I feel like I will at least have some fun in the future.
