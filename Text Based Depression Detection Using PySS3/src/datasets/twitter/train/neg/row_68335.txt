I hate that gen Z has normalized "wanting to die"Obviously I never know what people are going through, but whenever I spend an entire night fantasizing about over-dosing and how my family would react, I brush it off as "everyone hates life right now." Everyone jokes about how much they hate life, or school makes them want to die, and who am I to say they're joking? I say those things too.


That being said, while I tell myself I have no idea what people are going through, I end up invalidating anything I'm feeling as "normal gen z." I mean, who doesnt want to die? How am I supposed to convince my parents I need therapy and I'm not just "fitting in with the trend called depression"? (Their words, not mine).


Sometimes I just really fucking hate society. It's great to normalize mental health and get rid if the stigma, but this whole thing * vague hand gestures *? No thank you. Bullshit, honestly.

Edit: thought I'd throw in that I am also gen Z, and am also definitely part of the problem.
