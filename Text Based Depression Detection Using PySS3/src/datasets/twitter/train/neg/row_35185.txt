Completely AloneI'm 25. I have lived alone in my small apartment since 18, but have been alone my whole life. My abusive, and extreme religious parents forcibly homeschooled me, and pretty much locked me in their ranch house for the first 17 years of my life. They never supported anything I ever did or wanted to do, and constantly told me I wasn't good enough. I wasn't allowed to have friends, have a cell phone (until 17) or even go around the block at times. They where very angry I got a job at 17 and would yell at me when I came home late at night from work. I moving out at 18 because I was sick of the abuse, but I never found "a home". In my working life I have been screwed over and used so many times I no longer have the strength to try, and absolutely have no support. I am very much an outgoing person and can talk to anyone, yet every close friend I have ever has just used me for money and then abandon me. I have never had a romantic relationship (boyfriend) and have never had a close friend more than a year. They all use me and then leave when they are done. Any other "friends" are coworkers I lose contact with once I change jobs. I am not important or even in anyone's life. If I were to quit or get fired and kill myself on the same day no one would know or even find me for weeks. I have been suicidal since 12 (due to my parents abuse) but now I can't blame anyone. Not my parents, not my former bosses, or "friends". I try to blame myself, but am unable to change my situation. I am left with this question: How can I not be worthless when no one needs me, wants me, or cares if I am alive or dead?
