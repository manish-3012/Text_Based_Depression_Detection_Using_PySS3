Stop lying to meEveryone says they care, that they want me alive, that I would really make them sad if i died. Stop lying to me, i know you're all just waiting for it to happen, they just dont want the guilt of my death on their hands. Ive been lied to so many times, and i just cant believe it anymore. I want everyone to just forget about me, or hate me, its all better than being lied to.
