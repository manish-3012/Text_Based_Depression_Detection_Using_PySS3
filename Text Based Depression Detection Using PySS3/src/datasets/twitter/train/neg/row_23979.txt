Voices keep telling me to kill myself.I'm 27, I feel like I wasted most of my life being abused by my family. I want to sleep but every time I do I get these wakeful nightmares. I've been trying to sleep but I kept dreaming of these black spikey thing coming out from inside my jaw, In this dream thing (i am awake though) I cut my cheek out and I started pulling out these black spiky things. I was in the hospital and they used a suction thing like in the dentist and hundreds of them came out. My jaw and lower portion of my skull started to disappear. I was full of these things. I am terrified to sleep. Another One was me killing someone and then that person turned into my partner, my abusers made me question my sanity and it shows up so much in dreams.  My psychiatrist is on holiday, nowhere to go. My partner has his son over today in just 5 hours, it's nearly 7am. I don't want to wake him up just so I can go to a hospital that is over an hour away. I am losing touch with reality. I keep hearing "kill yourself, i want to kill myself"
I took some diazepam but it's not helping. The pain is in the front of my skull, like the depression is alive and maybe these black spikey things are inside my brain
