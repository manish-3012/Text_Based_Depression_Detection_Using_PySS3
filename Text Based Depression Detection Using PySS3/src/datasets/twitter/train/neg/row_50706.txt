AloneHaving one of those nights when I realize just how fucking alone I really am. I try to hide it from myself all the time, but once in a while my eyes really open and I look at my life and I really try to count the friends I have. And the number is 0. Shit like this is what led to attempts in the past.

On nights like this I spent hours watching youtube videos of cats, I want a cat so bad, so I can have a friend. Right now all I have is this stuffed animal. It's an ok substitute for now but it's not even alive and I feel weird talking to it.

Anyway if anyone wants to talk please message me.
