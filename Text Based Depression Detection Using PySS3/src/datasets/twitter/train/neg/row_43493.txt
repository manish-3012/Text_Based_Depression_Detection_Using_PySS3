Life &amp; the people in mine have taken enough from me. I have nothing left to give.I am literally living my worst fear and have been for almost a month now. I always promised myself that if I ever had to endure what I am doing now that I'd end my life. For context, i've been forced to live with my s3xual assaulter who's also my older brother. I now live everyday in fear that each day I wake up might be the day that it happens again, that he will have fooled everyone so well into thinking that he changed so they'll forget to take him or me with him whenever they leave or they'll think it's fine to do so and that'll be it. the mask will come down and i'll no longer be a survivor, but the victim of him again. I've dealt with memories of my trauma flooded back to me, constantly being on edge and having to fight just for him to stay with a shirt on in front of me and it just doesn't seem worth it anymore. The locks on all doors here are broken, my grandparents who are supposed to be looking out for me are either so far up my older brothers ass that that they think he can do no wrong or they are simply too overbooked with taking care of others to really take care of me. Every person who gave even the slightest shit about me has either changed, become too busy, or left me suddenly. The only one who checks in on me is my therapist, but I need more help that I can't get from the people in my life and I can't have myself admitted into a psych ward because my grandma can't handle even more stress. I'll be told that I should have 'finished the job' since I want to give up on living and I can't deal with being told that anymore so if this doesn't work or do anything positive for me.. i'm afraid there's only one last option i can resort to.
