everyone is better than me.I do not have anything going for me in life. No husband or boyfriend, no amazing career, no skills, nothing. I have nothing to show for my 28 years on planet earth, and I am infuriated at myself for letting life get like this. Everyone I know has so much going for them. One of my acquaintances just got accepted to medical school, another is consistently being published in academic journals, then a few other have successful careers or comfortable family lives. I feel like everyone moved on in life and I'm still stuck feeling like a child. I hate how little I've done in life and how time is over for me now. I'm stuck at a dead end job (I did graduate from college but it doesn't matter because I was too shy to network for good jobs so I work in retail now), I don't have much of a life, I have no one to talk to or to turn to. I tried to turn my life around (become healthier, pick up some hobbies, cbt. etc.) but suicide still seems to be my only answer. I cannot envision any way to fix my life at this point and I feel like it's too late to become the person I wanted to be at this age.
