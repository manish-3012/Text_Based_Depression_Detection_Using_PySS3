Its 3:25 AM, and I am coming to the realization that my life is effectively over.Hello, I'm a normal college student except for the bad grades, the ADHD, and the depression.    
    
Things got a lot harder for me to deal with when second semester came around. I have never really been able to effectively manage depression, but it wasn't a problem until I started classes that are truly difficult, not that first semester fluff.    
    
I can't even find the energy to write a detailed post. Sorry Reddit.    
TL;DR I am failing every class, it is too late in the semester to salvage my grades *(unless I get 100% on literally every assignment between now and summer, not gonna happen.)* Depression gets worse every day. I can't cope anymore. I am pretty done with my shitty life and wish it were over.    
    
Is there anyone up at this hour that wants to talk? Please?
