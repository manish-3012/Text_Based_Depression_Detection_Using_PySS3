I donâ€™t want support. I just want someone to listen and acknowledge what I have to say.Iâ€™m a bad person. How am I so narcissistic but also at the same time such a self-deprecating piece of shit? Iâ€™m fat, unhygienic, unmanly and have a horrible personality.

Some people like me and call me their friend. I donâ€™t know if their standards are super low or what, but I wish I had the heart to tell them how much I appreciate the fact they like me. I wish they would ignore me and go for better friends but at the same time, it feels like a knife going through my chest when I see them talk to other people, as if Iâ€™m selfish and need approval, even if it wonâ€™t do much.

I get jealous when I see the men around me. Theyâ€™re confident and responsible. I was beaten a lot by my uncles as a kid. I can tell one of them feels remorse over his actions since heâ€™s been too nice over the years, trying to buy me expensive things and whatever. 

The abuse ripped apart every inch of manhood I had. I wasnâ€™t strong, I wasnâ€™t dignified and I wasnâ€™t brave. Iâ€™ve bonded more with my sisters than any other men Iâ€™ve met in my life. They understood the abuse as they had gone through it as well, however they could be a bit stoic at times. 

Because of the abuse, Iâ€™ve grown to not trust many people and be extremely anxious and shy 24/7. I hear my family members, schoolmates, etc talk about how I lack ambition, how Iâ€™m too reserved and feminine, how Iâ€™m not as good as the other kids. Sorry I canâ€™t speak in a room full of people, sorry if my face flushes red when my name is called, sorry I feel more comfortable being alone for days than visiting some of the family but itâ€™s your fault for sitting back there and supporting the abuse when I was younger. Every time I took one step too far, Iâ€™d be threatened as you thought it was a good way to control me.

My father died when I was 4 and I was vulnerable. Beating and threatening me with violence are the two things you should definitely not be doing... All those punches that were thrown, tears Iâ€™ve shedded and lashes from your belts were for no benefit. And even then, my father probably wouldnâ€™t have treated me any nicer had he still been alive at that point. 

Iâ€™m the runt of the family now. Iâ€™m stupid, weak, shy and not manly enough. Why canâ€™t I be more like my fucking doctor aunts or lawyer uncles?! Iâ€™d kill myself if I didnâ€™t have two sisters and a few friends who care. Iâ€™m happy for my sisters, but their success still hurts... Good job graduating suma cum laude with a 4.0 GPA and degrees in mathematics and electrical engineering. I cried tears of joy because of how happy I was for you that night. If only I could make them as proud of me as you did.
