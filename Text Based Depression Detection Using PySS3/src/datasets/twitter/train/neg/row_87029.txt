I thought I wasn't suicidal but..I constantly think about the worst case scenario of everything in my life, especially my wonderful SO.

I have no one but her. No family contact, no friends, a few acquaintances at work. Don't think anyone would miss me.

Whenever I hit the hours at night when I am not keeping myself constantly busy, when I'm just laying in bed alone, my mind always seems to play out situations which turn into short dreams as I fall asleep where she dies or gets killed by someone. In every dream, I end up sitting at the end of a long dock stretching out over a lake with a cinderblock tied to my feet and a gun in my hand.

I've never considered suicide, and I have an incredible woman in my life who loves me dearly, but what if something happened to her? I wonder how far I would go to see her again.
