WafflingI feel like I straddling should I stay or should I go line. I am kinda thinking that people would get over it. Especially if I divorce my husband and give him some time to move on and start dating and then I could do it. If he and I don't talk for a really long time and then I kill myself, I doubt it will be as bad of a blow. I think my mom will just have to be sad or I could wait till she dies but she is pretty healthy.

I just did some research and it is gonna be between 20k and 60k to get all the skin removal surgery I would need and I would be past 35 by that point probably, which is like fucking elderly when you are a chick trying to get laid, if we are all being honest. Plus, people still look jacked up post skin removal. I'd been kinda thinking that I was stuck here cause I don't want to upset anyone. But then seeing those numbers made me think that holy fuck I shouldn't have to live like this to make a few people that I don't even like happy. So now I am thinking it's a go in a few years? I have no idea.

I wish I could sit people down and be like listen can you be cool? And try to have a rational discussion but no one does rational discussions about suicide. I hate pro-lifers, maybe more than I hate anyone, including me lol. I feel like this anti-suicide society makes dealing with this impossible. I have so many logistics to think about if I do this and no one to help.
