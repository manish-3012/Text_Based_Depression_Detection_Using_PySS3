no friendsi exist inside of my own head. no one pays any attention to my presence. i mean nothing to absolutely no one. i struggle to establish connections due to depression and anxiety. i feel as though iâ€™m too unattractive and weird to be acknowledged. iâ€™d rather be dead than live the rest of my life alone
