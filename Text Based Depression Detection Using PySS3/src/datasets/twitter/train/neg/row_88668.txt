VentilationI hate my job, I hate my housing situation, I hate that life is so fucking stupid for me. I hate that I can't enjoy going out because my anxiety turns everything good against me. I should be able to go out and buy some clothes without feeling like shit, or go to a county fair and not feel like I am a loser because I can't talk to anyone outside my small group. I'm so sick of myself. Nothing changes. I just want to get high or drunk or something to kill this numbing grayness that is my life. I'm tired of being negative and angry at work, feeling disliked, but having no idea how to change, I think I am just who I am and sadly I don't like that person. I don't like who I've become, but I don't change. Not really.
