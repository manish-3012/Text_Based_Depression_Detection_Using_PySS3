I need help.I keep feeling nothing, and then feeling so much that I might explode. I have lost all interest in anything. I feel restless, and then I'm like (for example) 'I should go paint something', and when I start doing that for about a minute I already think 'Why am I even doing this. What's the point.'

And when I feel a lot, I feel so much. My mind races, my feelings change. I've cried about dropping a spoon and I've gotten angry about forgetting the time. I feel so angry I start crying, and then I feel ridiculous for crying (cause it's a sign of weakness). 

I just feel so lost. I have a good life, I have a good job, good friends and a lovely boyfriend. I just want to dissapear.
