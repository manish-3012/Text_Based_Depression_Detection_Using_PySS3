I think this is it.Iâ€™m 15. And Iâ€™m so fucking tired of trying to get better. Like I know I can be happy and sometimes I am but I donâ€™t think itâ€™s worth the trouble. I donâ€™t think the happy moments make up for all the bad shit or months of emptiness. 

For context Iâ€™m basically a perfect student. Iâ€™ve been getting straight Aâ€™s since 7th grade and Iâ€™m taking the equivalent of 7 AP classes. And it fucking sucks. I couldnâ€™t care less about school right now. 

But I feel like I have no other irredeemable qualities. Like the only thing Iâ€™m good at in life is academia. But I canâ€™t tolerate it anymore. Iâ€™m running dangerously low on motivation, and Iâ€™m not sure I can keep this up. I just, Iâ€™ve barely survived my first year of high school (and I might just not) so how tf am I supposed to survive 3 more? 

And wtf happens after? I go after a meaningless career, jumping from goal to goal, trying to find something that makes me happy when deep down, it feels like nothing will? Not for forever. And maybe thatâ€™s life- but if it is- then Iâ€™m fucking tired of life. 

Iâ€™ve tried therapy. Iâ€™ve been going to a therapist for a couple months now, but if feels like nothing really has changed. I mean, it kinda of worked for awhile-I felt in control of my life and I stopped procrastinating. But I wasnâ€™t happy. Every week was still hell, except that I didnâ€™t have as much free time to think about how awful it was because I was too busy trying to get ahead on hw (which I never did). Weekends were slightly better I suppose. 

But now, here I am. With a final AP presentation and 2000 word essay due in two days, both unfinished. Wishing I was dead and looking up how to get that wish. 

For awhile, before therapy, the only thing that held me back from killing myself was fear or guilt of hurting my parents, my cat, friends, etc. But now I feel...detached from them. 

And I might just do it.
