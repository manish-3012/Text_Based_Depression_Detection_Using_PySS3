Everyone Hates MeThis is what has to happen. 
I know its inevitable. 
No one likes me, loves me, or thinks I'm worth anything. So many people saying bad things about me. I'm worthless and sucking the joy from everyone around me. I deserve this. I should've never been born and the world would be a better place.  

I just need to get the drugs. I can't do this anymore. I can't be the bad guy for the rest of my life. I can't justify staying alive when it comes at the cost of other people's happiness.
