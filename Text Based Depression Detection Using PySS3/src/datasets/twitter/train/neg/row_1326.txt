Things. Don't. Get. Better. For. Me.Contains Slurs. Many.

I'm 15 years old, life is fucking bullshit, things get better? No they fucking don't.
If I had a gun I would've already done it, I'm just too much of a fucking coward to cut my wrist or hang from the ceiling, a gun shot is much faster and less painful.
So, a backstory of my really optimistic, fun, beautiful life, sarcasm alert if not obvious enough.
I'm 15, dad doesn't live in the house, but that doesn't affect me, atleast I don't hear endless abuse and screaming now, that's a plus.
My mom gives around 1.5/10 shits which is really low on the shit giving scale (basically she doesn't give a fuck about how I feel).
School been going downhill ever since 9th grade when I realized I'm not into academics and just wasting my time which makes me more depressed if all is not enough.
Mom pressures me into studying which makes more anxious and depressed.
I think about suicide on hourly basis, actually that's a fucking joke... it's always on my mind not just hourly.
It's summer break now and I was supposed to work and pursue my hobby, but HAHAHA who the fuck would employ a failure, so now I can't pursue a hobby that I can enjoy when I get back to school, which makes me more depressed because I got nothing to do when school aka prison is back.


Oh but I don't have to worry... things get better, right? No that's the biggest lie I have ever been told. Things get better only when I die or get out of school which is in 2 years; impossible to survive.
There is absolutely no point in living, I wish I have a gun so I can shoot myself and be done with it.


Ye, that's my rant, I had to let the steam out, I'm already boiling though, so the steam is infinite, until I shut off the fire, which is my life rn.
