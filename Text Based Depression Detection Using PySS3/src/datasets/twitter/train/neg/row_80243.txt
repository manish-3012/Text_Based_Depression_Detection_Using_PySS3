Seeing thingsSo lately I've been having these daydream type things. I'd be looking at a glass of water or something and I'd see myself smash it against my head or someone else's. Or id be in the backseat of a car and over and over I'd see us crashing.or attacking a random person id see at a store. Am I crazy or....?idk
