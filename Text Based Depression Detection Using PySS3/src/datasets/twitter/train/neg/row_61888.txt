It's over, I'm all out of fight.I'm a waste of space, I'm trash. And trash should be thrown away. I have no friends, they all left me because they don't care about me. One of them wants to be a forensic scientist, I'll kill myself so she can have her first study, it's the only thing she'd want from me, a useless, ugly, stupid, worthless human. Everyone wants me dead, I'm just a burden for everyone. 
I know the combination to my mom's med box, I'll take a few pills and stuff them in my bag and lock myself in my first class and then do it.
