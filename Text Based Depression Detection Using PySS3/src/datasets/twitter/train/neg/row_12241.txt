It's getting to the tipping pointI can't even function properly anymore. I try to do stuff but end up thinking about suicide and go into my depressive state. I tried coming out to my family but they themselves are just depressed individuals. My mother was talking about suicide the other day and I am contemplating whether I should tell her anything about my state anymore. No one knows about my state. I cut off from anyone so that I don't hurt anyone when I ctb. This is just a rant. Sorry for bothering you.
