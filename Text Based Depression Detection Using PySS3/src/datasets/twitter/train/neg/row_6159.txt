Transitioning into the planning phase.I've been fighting depression for over 15 years, and late last year I finally took the first steps towards getting treated. Got officially diagnosed, got pills, started therapy.

And yet, 2016 has been the worst fucking year. New pills messing with my head, new boyfriend hit me so I broke up with him, my grandmother died, I was fired from my job less than a week after returning from her funeral, and that left me with two days remaining that month to use my insurance for oral surgery that had to be planned last-minute (I got VERY lucky with my dentist). And because I'm in the US, losing my job meant losing access to my doctor and therapist before I really made any progress at all. I have pills left, but those are expensive and being unemployed, there's not exactly a lot of spare cash to go around.

I've reached the point where I'm starting to plan. Method is easy, I have everything I need for that. I'll just unlock my front door so no one has to break it down, and the timing will be a few days after rent is due so I know someone will be coming to my door. Student loans go away upon death, so I don't have to worry about anyone being saddled with those. My only other debt is my car, and it's worth more than the loan so that doesn't really matter. Other than writing note(s) and giving my apartment a really solid cleaning, I don't see anything else to do to prepare.

I won't be going to a better place. I'll be going to a quiet place, where I have no awareness, where my treacherous mind can no longer eat me alive. I just won't wake up anymore. And that's okay.
