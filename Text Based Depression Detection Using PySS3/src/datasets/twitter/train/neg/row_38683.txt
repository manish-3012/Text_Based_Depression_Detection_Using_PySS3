I don't know what to do.I'm a 16 year old. I go in highschool and I dont know what to do. Everyday is shit and I get so much anxiety in school and at home because I overthink. I've been bullied and I'm genuenlly sad all the time. I dont see a reason to live, I dont want a future or anything. WHenever I think of my future I get stomach ache and it just hurts thinking about life. The only things I like to do in this world is doing life threatening stuff like skydiving or jumping of cliffs. I hate my life and I hate how everything is. I dont know why I havnt commited suicide yet because I've felt this way for years.  
I've been on meds and I have seen therapists and nothing helps. All I want is to die constantly.   
What do i do? It won't get better for the next few years and then I have new problems like getting a job, girlfriend, build a life, get a house, get a car and so on. I dont want a future I just want to be dead.  
Don't tell me it will get better because It won't.
