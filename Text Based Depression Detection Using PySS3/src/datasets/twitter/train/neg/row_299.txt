WelpIâ€™ve never felt so close to going thru with it but this week is the last straw Iâ€™m afraid. It just gets worse and worse and it feels like I shouldnâ€™t be depressed or anxious bc my life is great, but I still feel like I canâ€™t go on. 
One of the only friends I have is also depressed, but he has his reasons (shitty childhood, drugs, all that). I texted him a couple days ago saying I was close to going thru with it, we texted a bit, and suddenly he stopped. Hasnâ€™t checked in with me since. I canâ€™t help but think if Iâ€™d actually gone thru with it even he wouldnâ€™tve given a shit. People say thereâ€™s no where to go but up, but right Iâ€™m in the never ending abyss.
