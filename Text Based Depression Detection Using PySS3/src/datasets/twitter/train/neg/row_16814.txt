New Job Still DepressedMoved thousands of miles away to start a new life, to start working hard and find some enjoyment in life. I've been here for almost 2 years now, and it's been rough. Job is stressful, my "friends" are barely that, and I finally found a girl who sparked a light in my life, and the past 2 days has totally ghosted me. I found out because she ordered an uber from her house and was still logged into my phone and saw the trip. I feel so alone, so empty. The only thing stopping me from killing myself is my family who does love me, but since I'm so far away I still feel so alone. I tried getting back into video games, which kept me happy at home but I have lost the feeling for it. The cloud of depression that used to fog my brain is creeping ever so slowly to my vision again, I don't think I have much longer until it convinces me of the worst. Marijuana helped a lot when I was younger, but my new job drug tests for that so I can't even do that. I am fucked.
