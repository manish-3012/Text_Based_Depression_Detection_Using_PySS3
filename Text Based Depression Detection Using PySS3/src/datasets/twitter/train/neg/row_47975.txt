I don't deserve to be lovedI think I've finally come to that conclusion. I've never really been loved or even liked by anyone or anything (except my cat but that's probably because I'm the only one that feeds it) but it's no one else's fault but my own. Why would anyone wanna even care for me when I'm such a massive failure. God I hate myself so much there's nothing good about me at all. I don't know if I'm gonna make it to the new year and I don't even know if I want to, I have nothing going for me if anything 2019 is just gonna be another shit year.
