I am making a vow right now to get better by August 1st or I'm going to kill myselfI'm struggling with schizophrenia and panic attacks really bad. I have been my whole life. But these past 2 months I've been actively trying to get better. I'm working out, getting out of my comfort zone but I'm still lonely, I still can't get a job, and I still can't go farther than an hour from home.
