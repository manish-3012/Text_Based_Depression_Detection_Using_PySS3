Itâ€™s doneHi everyone. 
Iâ€™m writing this as my final goodbye, this is an anonymous way for me to finally say the things Iâ€™ve been keeping in. 
The date has been set, I will go through with my suicide soon. 
Itâ€™s been a really hard decision to make..I took everything into consideration and decided that this is the best thing to do for me. 
I hope that others never make this same conclusion, I hope anyone reading this will keep fighting. 
Just a few things Iâ€™d like to mention: 
1. My school is a big reason why Iâ€™m killing myself, Iâ€™m a student at USC and I genuinely believe nobody at that school cares about students. 
2. My boyfriend is another big contributor to my pain: heâ€™s cheating on me so many times, makes me feel like Iâ€™m nothing, emotional and mentally abused and manipulated me so much that my mind feels like mush. 
3. I am a rape survivor, I fought hard to raise awareness about rape, sexual harassment, and weâ€™d trafficking. But I never shared my own story, in fact, this post is the first time Iâ€™ve ever admitted what happen to me. Anyone reading this, please continue to raise awareness for me. 
4. Iâ€™m sorry to my mom and dad that Iâ€™m doing this, I know you guys love me but I hate myself so much that it doesnâ€™t even matter anymore. I hope you guys doing hurt too much, I hope youâ€™ll understand that this is the only way I can find peace. 

Everyone reading this thinking Iâ€™m making a mistake, 
Please understand that Iâ€™ve been thinking about this for a long time and it took a lot of courage for me to make this decision; nevertheless, Iâ€™ve still given myself a cool down time (from now till my suicide date) to once again rethink this decision. 

Last thing I want to mention: 
For anyone reading this who feels like giving up, please donâ€™t give up. As someone who has officially given up, I ask you to find a new way to survive, a new way to keep yourself going, and if you do, please share this method with yours because I wish people shared methods like that with me. 

If my mom and dad ever see this post and realize itâ€™s me: Iâ€™m sorry.
