I feel so bad and it just wonâ€™t stopPeople have always loved to treat me badly (insult me, beat me) for what reason? The worst of it was my first year of high school. My parents and the system the school had in place made me feel like there was nothing I could do but just let it happen. Now I realise that there was a way out, just standing my ground and not go to school. Look, it was much better off this instead of being beaten and coming home from school with blood pouring from my mouth and I donâ€™t care if it was â€œagainst the lawâ€. The fact that it was the class for the students with low intellect didnâ€™t really help me with anything and people still mock me for being there. That came to an end after a while but things kept on happening with the teachers and the other kids. I just finished school and Iâ€™m not sure how much more of it I can take. Iâ€™m not sure how long I can go on with carrying the stuff that happened to me and I just let it happen like the dumbass I am. I will go through my first year of University to see how that turns out and if itâ€™s bad then thatâ€™s it for me.
