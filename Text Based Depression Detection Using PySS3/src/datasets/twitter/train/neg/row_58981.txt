why not at this point honestlyi have 4 attempts under my belt already and kind of just want something to go right this next time. 

td:lr reasons are that i've been molested by my dad for about 8 years now, and i went to the police, and they didn't believe me because i didn't have any "proof". i now "owe" him for all the "trouble" i've caused him (making him momentarily look bad, he's all about appearances). touching and shit is still happening, and the other day i got choked as a 'warning' for flinching when he touched me. 

so what the fuck is the point in still being alive? what did i do to deserve all this? i have people tell me "it gets better" but i still have to wait another year to legally move out, as it's illegal to run away in my state, and i can't take it anymore.
