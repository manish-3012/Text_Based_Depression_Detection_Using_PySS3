i think im becoming a psychopathrecently I am completely insensitive to everything and everyone. I used to be a nice guy but now im being a total ass hole to everyone who tries to talk to me. I constantly have suicidal and homicidal thoughts. my dreams consist of killing people and gore. 
I don't talk to anyone except for my couple of friends. I'm also suffering from bipolar depression. can't put myself in anyone else's shoes and just want to be left alone. whenever someone angers me i have a burning rage inside me to cause them bodily harm. I am scared.
