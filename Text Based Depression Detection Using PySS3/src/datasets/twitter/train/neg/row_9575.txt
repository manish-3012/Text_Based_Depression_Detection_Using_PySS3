i've bottled up my emotions too much and i can't let go. i took it up on family and it all fell apart.my brain was too negative and I completely blew up on them, i blamed them for all the bad things they've done to me. ive had a huge quarrel with my family members, which i ended up hurting them more than before. my parents even said they're tired of putting up with me.

i am trying to push through my life but everything i do (or say) turns into a disaster. Everytime i work hard to make my parents proud, i end up disappointing them in some way. i don't know what is wrong with me. i've bottled up bad memories of my past and it seems to haunt me today. I can't let it go and i don't know how. even therapy isn't helping.

sometimes, I just want to end it all and kill myself, i've cuased too much pain.
