I hurt everywhere inside.Hi. I hurt. I go back and forth on whether or not I should kill myself a lot. Sometimes I set a date, an arbitrary date in the future. If my life is still crappy by such and such date then I'll do it.

See, I mean, I can go into why everything seems to suck. I'm homeless, I'm transitioning, I've lost most of my friends due to my identity and don't really have a good outlook here for the years to come. You know? That deep pit in your stomach that grows wide everytime you go to bed and wake up. You realize that you have to work tomorrow. Ouch.

So, yeah. For the last two days I've spent my evenings out on a bridge. Thinking of falilng off. Into the cool and dirty mississippi below. I want to become self reliant. Learn how to not "need" people to save me. I sometimes fear that these desires aren't about me "just" looking to kill myself but are about me seeking connection with other people. It's not so much invalidating as it is sad and pathetic. 

All I know right now is that I hurt. And I want that hurt to stop and I want to stop
