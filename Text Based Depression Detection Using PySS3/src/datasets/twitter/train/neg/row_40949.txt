Have lived with the effects of abuse for my whole life. Now my messed-up trauma behaviors are leading to the end of (yet another) relationship.Long history of childhood abuse/trauma. The experiences of my early life have basically made it impossible for me to sustain meaningful intimate relationships. I always get just far enough in to begin to hope a little, then my shitty trauma behaviors swiftly bring an end to things.

It's happening again. I really believed that this one was going to actually work out. Of course it wasn't going to. It was stupid to think otherwise. Now I'm right back where I started, alone again.

It really isn't going to get any better, is it? No matter how hard I try, no matter how much therapy I do, no matter how many stupid self-help books I read. Some things just can't be fixed after they've been broken so thoroughly.

I've been feeling tired lately. Very, very tired. I can no longer convince myself to get up and try again like I could in my 20s. I've got a feeling like being completely out of gas just a few miles into a marathon, having so many fucking miles left, and having zero--*zero*--faith in my ability to keep going to the finish.

So why not just quit now?
