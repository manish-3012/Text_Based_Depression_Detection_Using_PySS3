I really need help soonI've dealt with depression and suicidal/homicidal feelings for all of last year and although I've felt that I've been improving, I'm experience sort of a relapse. Right now, I feel especially angry and jealous of people who manage to have relationships and can barely stand to listen to people. Please, I just want someone who can help me through this, without any of the normal bullshit like: "It gets better" or some other bland bullshit. I want someone to actually listen to what I'm saying and at least attempt to sympathize with me, not telling me to go to a therapist or some other unhelpful generic cliche. I really need someone to talk to, fast.
