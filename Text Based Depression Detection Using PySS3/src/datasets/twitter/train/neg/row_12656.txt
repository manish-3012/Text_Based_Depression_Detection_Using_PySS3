What other option do I have....Im gonna keep this short cause I'm sick of listing off problems to therapists.

-Meet and then systematically bullied by 80+ people
-Have recieved death threats from former friends
-My friends never respond to me via anything (text, call, written letter), but in the off chance I do bump into them they never get off their phone
-I'm a fat piece of shit that can lose weight.
-Every time I excersize, I end up hurting myself even more than it helps
-My teachers hate me
-My classmates hate and ridicule me right infront of my face
-My ex left me, and then stole the friends I had worked so hard to make in college
-My friends from K-12 don't respond ever.
-My college friends ditch me at any chance they get and then post a snapchat of them out at a party, when they are "super busy with homework"
-I'm failing my major
-I have never held a real paying job
-My parents are 200,000 dollars in debt because I exist
-I have medical problems, (on 6 different meds and I'm 20) that put me in colossal pain every day
-My parents and brother hate me to the point that they go weeks without talking to me.

What else is there to say. I've appearently failed at this game we all call "life" while so many others, even those with such a less fortunate life then I do can have these simple human pleasures, that I will never had. I could end it all really simply since I work with N2 gas every day, just steal a small canister from my lab and never turn back and be dead by morning. So why shouldn't I?
