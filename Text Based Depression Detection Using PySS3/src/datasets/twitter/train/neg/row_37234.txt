Please it hurts, I can't keep living like thisI'm suffocating

I'm wishing things were back to how they were just a few months ago

I can't eat or sleep. 

I've let my classes fail again already because my constant panic attacks keep me crying in my room.

I have no friends, she was the only one i needed, I have nobody to talk to and she doesn't want to talk to me anymore. I don't blame her, I blame myself for not doing more for her. Now I'm lost.

In a few days I might end it, but the wait until then is painful.

Please don't go away from me. Please come back. Please stop.

I know none of this will happen, but my feelings will never change and they will hurt more and more every day knowing I'm further from you then I was yesterday.

I just want to sleep, sleep and not wake up. Please.
