No one listens to my pain. Help me...Im a human. Humans listen to eachother right?
Well not in my case. I told everyone my pain... No one listened to me. Im feeling lonely. I want to stop existing. They always ignore me and  i really want to suicide. Litteraly i hate life.everyone hates me.
You have two choices:
A) Tell me how to suicide
B)Help me to fight this pain and be happy.
Please!
