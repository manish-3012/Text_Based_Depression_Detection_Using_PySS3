27 years of abuseI have been abused sexually, physically, and psychologically for almost my entire life, starting at birth and stopping at 20. For the past 7 years Iâ€™ve just abused myself. I am haunted by the trauma every day. All of it just replays in my head over and over again. For years I shut it out with alcohol, but I havenâ€™t drank in a year. Iâ€™ve just stewed with my own thoughts day after day and itâ€™s only been worse since this fucking pandemic. Due to all the abuse I now have borderline pd, CPTSD, anxiety, and treatment resistant major depression. My mom severely abused me and my father for my entire childhood and adolescence. I also watched my parents kick, scream at, and even try to kill my pets as a small child. I hate myself so much for it but I ended up killing two of the pets so they wouldnâ€™t have to suffer anymore. At 18 within a span of 6 months my grandpa who was like a second father to me died, my mom killed our other dog, tried to kill herself, I was raped for a second time, and I lost my childhood home. I have been raped 3 times, twice by â€œboyfriendsâ€ and once by an older man who groomed me at 16. I also suspect I was molested by an uncle as a child who would say weird sexual shit to me to scare me. 

So now Iâ€™m a 27 year old sober junkie, alcoholic, unable to function on any significant level. I wish I just killed myself by drinking bleach when I was 12 like I wanted to. I have spent my whole life wanting to die. I canâ€™t fucking take it anymore. I donâ€™t really want to die I just want to stop the pain but nothing helps Iâ€™ve been to therapy for years even in patient and outpatient nothing helps Iâ€™m a lost cause Iâ€™m so sorry I just need to die
