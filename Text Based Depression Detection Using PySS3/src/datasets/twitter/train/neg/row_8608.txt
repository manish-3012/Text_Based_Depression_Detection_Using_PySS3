I have nothing leftIâ€™m 16 and for probably the past three years Iâ€™ve been really depressed like to points where I almost killed myself a few times but I always could stop mysef before I did it cuz I thought there must be something good out there and then I met a girl and we dated for over a year but then we broke up over some dumb shit and I didnâ€™t fight for her cuz I struggled too much woth mysef and then I realized what a fool I was and I tried to get her back but it was too late and I literally donâ€™t have anyone else at all, like all my â€œfriendsâ€ arenâ€™t actually friends itâ€™s not like they would never do anything with me itâ€™s just they donâ€™t really care about me I always have to hit them up and they donâ€™t show any affection towards me it seems like they wouldnâ€™t even notice if I would just disappear. Yeah and like rn Iâ€™m at such a low point I have nothing left to live, I have no friends or any other people who love me and I have nothing else either like nothing gives me joy anymore all I can think about is death, Iâ€™m in constant pain I even tried to self medicate with drugs but that just made everything worse tbh. I donâ€™t even know why I bother writing this or what Iâ€™m expecting from yâ€™all but I think maybe it will help if some people on the internet know my struggles before I die.
