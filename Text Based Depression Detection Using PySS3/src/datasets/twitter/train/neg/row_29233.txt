POCD or pedophile in denial?Recently the smash bros sex scandals (particularly those surrounding Zero, who I loved watching ) have refocused my attention to the possibility that Iâ€™m a pedophile, which I questioned almost two years ago at the age of 17. Even from when signs of OCD first manifested at the age of 5 to my current age, 18, I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve ever dealt with something so depressing and appalling. Iâ€™ve seen a psychologist and psychiatrist for other forms of OCD while in my freshman and sophomore years of high school, and have taken Zoloft 150 mg for about 3 years.

Most of my doubt comes from the strong arousal I had the few times I watched hentai of middle schoolers- those with underdeveloped bodies. Every time I do so, I fall into depression and experience a sense of queasiness- disgust in myself. When I think of elementary school girls I donâ€™t get aroused, though Iâ€™m not sure I wouldnâ€™t if I read/watched hentai sexualizing them. 
A fact I use to reassure myself is the exclusive attraction I had to developed bodies throughout middle school and most of high school. I also faced an obsession over being attracted to my father and feeling aroused while hearing his voice, but that faded away. Then again Iâ€™ve also read cases of late onset pedophilia. 
The thought of being chemically castrated brings me great relief, and the exchange of facing lifelong side effects for being guilt-free seems worth it. It would be hard explaining my choice to my parents, especially since they want me to date and eventually have kids, but I ultimately prioritize my own desires for major aspects of my life.
Iâ€™ve contemplated committing suicide at the thought of forever branding myself as a pedophile for masturbating to minors, even after being castrated. 

Sorry if this all seems incoherent and sort of monotonous, I canâ€™t think clearly right now and donâ€™t have the energy to organize this
