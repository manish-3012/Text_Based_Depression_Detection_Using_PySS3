about to loss my job because of forgetfulness and slownessso I've been having this problem for years and i don't know what it is and it's been ruining my life

I have a lot of mental breakdowns along with extreme forgetfulness and slowness it makes it harder and harder to do anything

I'm already having a hard time keeping my job as a housekeeper cause i really can't keep up with anyone and i feel like they're going to fire me because of it I'm also trying to learn how to drive but it's seemingly impossible for me

let it also be known my family was both physically, emotionally, and sexual abusive i live in fort lee Virginia
dose anyone have a idea what might be wrong with me or where I can get help I'm very poor and i might be fired soon and will be looking for a job I'm just very slow and can't remember things i also feel like I'm very bad with social skills if you have any questions just ask

I'm 20 years old I've done everything thing physically to help me like making sure I'm eating healthy, getting enough sleep, and have made sure to take proper vitamins

I'm so exhausted and done i just want to figure out what might be happening so i can have a idea of what path to start fixing this issue
