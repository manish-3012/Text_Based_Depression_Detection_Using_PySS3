Should I call 911?Hi Iâ€™m 17 and Iâ€™m really suicidal. Not sure I would actually go through with anything cause I have a million plans in my head and my ADHD makes planning hard. Iâ€™ve been to the hospital several times for attempts, I know what happens, sometimes I stay for a bit, other times Iâ€™m discharged right away. I have community supports that are unhelpful, but Iâ€™m trying. Iâ€™ve been feeling really bad lately, more unstable, more anxious, more depressed. Being a minor, my parents have a big role in my healthcare, and if I do take myself to the ER for suicidal ideation, theyâ€™ll have to come to talk to doctors at some point. But tomorrow is a very big day for them, and I donâ€™t want to be an inconvenience. (Weâ€™re buying a new house and itâ€™s getting inspected and other stuff relating to that). But I also donâ€™t want to spend another day worrying about hurting myself. Iâ€™m not sure what to do, I canâ€™t think coherently, itâ€™s been fucking rough and Iâ€™m exhausted trying to deal with it all on my own.
