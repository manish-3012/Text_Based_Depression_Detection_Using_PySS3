I realised something...Just a thought

I feel like I really should end my life. Well, because thereâ€™s no point to it and Iâ€™m not going to be better person than I am right now.
So why bother?
If Iâ€™m going to be a useless piece of shit forever 
then why not just end it here?

I have told myself to change 
But I never did
Iâ€™m still the lazy fucker that disappoints people
I probably will never change
So how about just end all of this?
