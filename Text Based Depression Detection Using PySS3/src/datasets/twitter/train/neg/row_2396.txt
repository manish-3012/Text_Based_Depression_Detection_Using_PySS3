Life is Hard.Most people wonâ€™t understand the way I feel. I feel empty, I feel alone, I feel sad, I feel useless, worthless. 
I donâ€™t feel nothing. I donâ€™t even remember the last time I was happy, I endured sexual abuse when I was a kid and it messed me up really bad, from people I thought had the best intentions for me. It left me with scares and Trauma I still deal with today. Itâ€™s effected me so much so that I have always had trouble relating and trusting people and Itâ€™s always felt like I was different but really all Iâ€™ve always wanted was to be like everyone else.... I wanted to be normal. I have no friends, no sexual relationships or anybody to talk to. Itâ€™s not because I donâ€™t  want to have these things itâ€™s because Iâ€™m to fucking Insecure and donâ€™t feel shit for anyone, Iâ€™m tired of feeling like this. Iâ€™m tired of feeling like shit all the time, the thought of death runs through my mind all the time, the quietness and the darkness brings me some time of Satisfaction and peace. Iâ€™ve been dealing with this feelings all my life and I just hope as I get older it gets better because I donâ€™t think I would be able to handle it for a whole life time. 
Stay strong guys, I LOVE YOU AND I CARE ABOUT YOU GUYS because In a weird way we all have something in common we are all Broken and damaged, Iâ€™m no longer the different one.
