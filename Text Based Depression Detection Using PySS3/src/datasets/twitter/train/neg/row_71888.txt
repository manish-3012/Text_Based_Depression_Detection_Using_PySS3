Life just has it out for me I guess...Everyone who hates me and abandoned me is doing so much better than me. They have lives-- love lives, careers, and so much more. I have nothing. No one loves me. I can't work. I am filled with emptiness and no one cares, and no one will ever care. I should just get out my parents' gun and get it over with.
