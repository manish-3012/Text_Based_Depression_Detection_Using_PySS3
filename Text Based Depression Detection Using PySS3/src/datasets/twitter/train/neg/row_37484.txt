The moment you know......your life is over. I swear, this isn't a joke post. But I guess when you're to the point of suicide, you gotta laugh where you can.

I was fine. Not fine, but you know, I wasn't in the middle of plotting my death at that moment. I was watching Roseanne. It was hysterical. You other Roseanne fans, it was the episode where Becky farted at the end of her speech to the student council. And that part where Dan was laughing about it. If laughter was lethal, my problems would be over. Then, the moment came. I realized, I'm never gonna have that. The family, the home, the love, nothing. My son is gone. Social services took him away when they found out I was suicidal. So, I had problems before he was gone. But now my son, my motivation to live, is gone. 

Guitar straps are perfect for hanging, and I got one calling my name. And I'm alone. No friends. No family. No job. I don't even have groceries. I went to the Random Acts of Pizza reddit, thinking maybe I could eat tonight. Wouldn't even let me post. Haven't been a member long enough. 

Funny... Losing my son was bad. The hunger is bad. The money is bad. Future looks bad. Roseanne looks good. I'll never have that. 

Hug your kids. Hey, do it for me. Go kiss them goodnight. I want to see my son so bad, it hurts. I'll never see him again...
