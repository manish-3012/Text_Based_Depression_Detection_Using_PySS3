I don't want to exist anymore.I'm in a starbucks, I'm just looking at a church roof thinking, "is that high enough to die if I jumped? They'd probably let me up on a tour".
I'm just running through my head all the possible ways i could probably kill myself in the next half an hour. Paracetemol seemed possible, but apparently it takes a couple days.
Monster/relentless seems like an option though. I don't want to be a burden anymore. My friends will get over it, they've got other people. I haven't known them for terribly long anyway. The only reason I haven't yet is cause I was gonna move out and disappear first. That way they don't need a funeral and can just get on with their lives. I'm just a resource drain anyway. the idea of a knife in my chest sounds like a relief.
This is a bit cringy, sorry. Don't really know what to say, thought getting it down might help.
