like a wave, crashing down on my heartI've never posted anything on reddit, barely even come here really.  But today i started looking things up on google about what my son would go through if i wasn't here anymore, and this sub came up.   Things havent always been bad for me, or maybe they were and i was just too naive/optimistic. But, the last few years have gotten to be increasingly heavier and harder.  I'm not a very good father, husband, employee/boss, or friend, i've got no education, and no marketable skills in life.  I feel like i dont matter, people dont listen to me, and it really would make no difference either way.  I dont have but one friend and i feel like a huge letdown to him all the time.  I dont want to tell my wife because she dealt with her ex playing the depressed card on her when they were having problems.   i sleep maybe 5 broken hours a night, commute 3+ hrs a day, when i get home i'm so tired i can barely keep my eyes open, let alone have a real coherent thought.  i dont feel like im really anywhere ever, between awake and nightmares.  where it only gets darker and more painful.

i never considered myself to be an optimist or a pessimist, more of a realist.  everything really is just what it is, theres no silver lining, there is no bad man out to get me.  Things just suck and thats how it is.  I just dont want to wake up anymore.
