I can't take this anymoreI don't want to hurt anyone but i've been extremely depressed for the past week (although let's be real, i've had depression for years) and i really really want to die. i don't know what to do to make it better. i just started college a couple days ago and i feel so lonely, i haven't made any friends and all of my friends from high school are busy. i've vented to my friends but it's so much pressure on them (i think) that i try to avoid doing it, but i don't have anywhere to express or cope with these feelings. my parents got so angry when i told them about the thoughts and i feel like such a burden. i tried the lifeline chat but it didn't help, i left the chat feeling worse than before.

recently the thoughts and impulses have gotten worse; i fantasize about suicide throughout the day and i can't stop thinking about it and planning for it. i've been crying myself to sleep for the last few days. i'm afraid that i'll go through with it, but i'm more afraid that every single fucking day is going to be the same. it's been years and it hasn't gotten better, i'm in therapy and taking meds and i still want to die, i long for death so much it feels like a physical ache in my chest. i'm not as smart as my friends i can barely handle school and they can handle working multiple jobs and still function, i'm mentally ill and stupid and useless and i don't know if i even have a future. i feel like i'm falling apart and i just want it to be over. please help me i don't know what to do i don't want to hurt anyone
