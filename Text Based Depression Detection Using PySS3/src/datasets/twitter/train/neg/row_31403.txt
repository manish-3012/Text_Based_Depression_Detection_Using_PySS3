I cannot live like thisEveryday i wish it would be raining.I hate "beautiful" days.Everyone is going out,having fun,meeting with friends.I'm just sitting and drowning in my sorrow.I have only one friend,whom i am in love with.She doesn't love me in the same way,she already has a boyfriend,one who treats her right,is good looking,and whose parents probably didn't force him to move with his grandparents because they were too dissapointed in him.I hate being heartbroken everyday,i hate having this burden of a mask and pretending that i'm okay,i enjoy life and all this crap.I hate seeing her,but yet it makes me so happy when she talks,looks at me.But i just cannot do this anymore.I haven't slept in 2 days,i've barely eaten,i just cannot do this.All i want to do is borrow some cash,buy heroin and fucking OD.Tomorrow or in this following week,i lived like this for years,but now it's just too much
