The more I try and be a functional human being the stronger my urge to hurt myself or end my life is.I have posted on reddit about 8 or so times, I just don't know how much more I can take. I really wish I could go to the hospital, but I can't bare thinking about suicide all day because I have nothing to focus my attention on (which happened last time I went). I really wish they would let me bring an mp3 player so atleast I would have my music to keep me calm. Last time I went I felt like no one cared and like the entire experience was based on what was in the employees best interest and on being tort-proof instead of being focused on the patient. The entire experience makes me really angry, at the time I spent all day trying to avoid the urge to break shit, hurt myself (there wasn't anyway to effectively do this so I just bit myself to try and calm me down which wasn't very effective), and suicidial ideation. I lost my cool 3 times and smashed a chair, broke the door of a shitty little night stand and bashed it on the night stand and threw the phone at the wall when my mom was acting like I was exaggerating when I was telling her about how I got zero counseling. After the last thing I broke I had to stay longer and took all of my control to keep from freaking out the last 3 days or so. I am sorry I am rambling, and re-reading this is just to depressing so I won't. So basically I have been working lately for my aunt and my suicidial urges are so fucking intense now that I just hope I can curb them with a few real deep slashes from my hunting knife (but I got to buy a new one first,...) idk this post is kind of stupid
