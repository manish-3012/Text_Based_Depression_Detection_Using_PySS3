SorryI feel so selfish posting here. I try replying to some heartfelt posts on here sometimes. Idk. I'm sorry, I don't exactly know why I'm posting this, I guess it just makes me feel like I'm still alive you know? I just feel so empty and worthless all the time. Being scared of connecting with people doesn't help. Many months go by without me speaking to a soul. I love people and the good they do, I love this planet, but I'm starting to lose the will and desire to go on. Everything seems so pointless. There's this someone who I've been neglecting and she's the only real reason why I'm still holding on. I'm so tired. I can't think straight. Thanks for reading. Wish you all the best.
