First post hereHi everyone,

Iâ€™m really struggling. My neighbour has set out to ruin my life and I think itâ€™s because I blocked him after he sent me creepy texts. Now Iâ€™m depressed again (Iâ€™d literally just got over a severe bout of depression), Iâ€™m scared to leave the house, scared to be in the house, anxious all the time, canâ€™t eat, canâ€™t sleep. I just donâ€™t see how things will ever get better. I see people on TV who are happy, or people at the shops who seem so carefree and I canâ€™t see my way to becoming one of those people. I just donâ€™t want to have to live like this anymore.
