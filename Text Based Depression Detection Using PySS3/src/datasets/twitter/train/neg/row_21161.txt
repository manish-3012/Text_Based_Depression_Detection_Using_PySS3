Worried about my friendHey guys,

My friend has had a history of depression. I know this because I know he was seeing a psychiatrist at some point, and maybe still is.

Anyway, in the last 6 months or so his life got a lot worse. He got kicked out of college because he wasn't getting good enough grades. I just found out today that he now has a brain tumor. 

I'm worried that he could hurt himself, is there anything I should do?
