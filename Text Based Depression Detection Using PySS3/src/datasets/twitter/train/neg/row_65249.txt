Suicidal ideation has significantly lowered my anxietyI used to be crippling insecure and constantly worried about what others would think of me and judge me for whatever I say or do. The last couple of years Iâ€™ve been casually suicidal and at times on the brink of suicide. Iâ€™ve realized that whenever I find myself worrying too much about doing something in fear of being judged my mind immediately shifts to â€œIâ€™m gonna kill myself soon anyway so fuck what anyone thinksâ€ 

Itâ€™s strangely liberating to know that I can screw up or make a complete fool of myself and not have to worry about living with the shame and consequences . My life is in my hands and I can end it if shit gets too unbearable.
