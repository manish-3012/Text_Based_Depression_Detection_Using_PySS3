Just had my birthday and I feel suicidal. Can barely make it through the work day.I donâ€™t know what to do. Everything hurts. I hurt myself last night in a fit of anger by hitting my fists against myself on my body and head... not my first time but the hardest. Iâ€™m falling behind at work. Iâ€™m arguing with my fiancÃ© endlessly to the point where I scream at him. 

I feel like I am ruining everything in my life and donâ€™t deserve to keep going. 
Or I donâ€™t deserve to keep going so I ruin everything. 

I really needed to get this outside of me and written down. Iâ€™ve Not openly shared this part of me before and I feel so scared. Iâ€™m scared of how I feel. Iâ€™m scared of how people will feel about me after sharing this. 

Nothing feels real anymore.
