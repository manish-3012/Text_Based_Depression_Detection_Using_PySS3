I only know how to blame othersI feel like I only know how to blame my past bullies, as well as my family for my depression, suicide attempts and self harm.

It makes me a selfish person. As if I am victimising myself.

My mum tells me that nothing will change unless I do something about it, such as going out, cleaning my room and I guess being normal.

It's true, but how can I do that without any motivation or will to keep on going?

Even if I only continue to point fingers at others despite being filled with guilt everytime, at least dying will remove all the emotional burden that comes with it.

Whether it's true or not, at the end of the day it's cycle of guilt that I can't break. I wish I had the courage to try to end it all again.
