Is it bizarre to find comfort in the fact that I could kill myself whenever I want?I have guns at my home. I've debated killing myself for years now. I generally find something to grasp on to and stay alive for months at a time, and when that's done or things get worse it's all I think about. In a way, pondering how I'd do it, who I'd write letters to, etc is almost therapeutic. I know that if thinhs get even worse, I can just end it all.

I don't know if this makes a whole lot of sense, but it's how I feel. And I feel like it'll be either before the new year or within the next 3 or 4 years. I have no reason to be sad, but I just am. All the time.
