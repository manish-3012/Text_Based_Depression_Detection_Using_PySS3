Going to kill myself in 1 hour Basically can't struggled far too long with depression, addiction, childhood trauma and I seem to keep on falling back into the same dark low state and its been happening for years. 
Every time I get clean, make positive choices in my life, start new happy relationships and feel like my life is actually going to improve and ill never have to look back on it, I seem to always fall back into the same fucking rut. Just recently I got a new job, girlfriend that I'm extremely grateful for and really care about, new motorbike and my mental health and depression seems to have improved greatly, same as my drug addiction and alcoholism but all in two fucking weeks, ive been let off my job since the business went under, my girlfriend moved out and suddenly said she wants something different, my motorbike got stolen by a bunch of filthy fucking hoodrats, ill slit their fucking throats and burn their houses down and gun the rest of those fuckers down, ive gone broke and the traumas from the past keep playing on repeat, I keep waking up every night with those memories on repeat, my mum trying to kill me, my friend who hung himself, I can't get that out of my head and its been years, my previous suicide attempets, watching my friend get raped at the age of ten. I just want to know how do I keep on losing everything so quickly and so many times. Every time I seem to get it together it falls apart. I don't really want to hurt myself or others but im so close to going for it, im already drunk as fuck believe it or not im a good typer and ive already got the rope tied and ready to go, got the plastic bag and drugs to put over my head and into me if it doesnt work and im doing it with the carbon monoxide going so I really can do it if I want to but for whoevers reading this. How can i stop falling into the same hole, I feel like im living in hell and ive got so much love to give and I want the best in life but I always seem to keep having it all fall apart and being abandoned. Im so desperate for help, I just need someone who can talk me through this, im just so tired of all my love and hard work falling apart  I just want to have a girlfriend with kids that I all love, a job and inner peace so my past no longer torments me. I can give my phone number too, lifelines just seem too generic, I know this is more of a call for help than me genuienly wanting to kill myself but im so close to it, I'm screaming inside for comfort and relief. Please help
