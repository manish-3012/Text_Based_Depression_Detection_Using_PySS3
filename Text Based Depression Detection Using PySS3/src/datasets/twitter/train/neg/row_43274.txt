Iâ€™m just so tired.Background: architecture bachelors + masters, well educated, just moved to Toronto as of September 2018.

Iâ€™ve done everything. Professional registration? Check. Seminars to self-educate when I got here? Check. Networking? Check. Employment counsellors that specialize in architecture AND ADHD? Check. 

But like...why? My brother, unlike me, studied in Canada, so he got to grow up to be a fully grown adult, whose parents respect him more than mine do. I keep feeling like my masters degree isnâ€™t worth a bucket of shit. And like, today, I just got word that I hurt someoneâ€™s feelings without even meaning to a few weeks ago, because Iâ€™m genuinely a toxic piece of shit. 

Iâ€™m deeply insecure- someone asked me some questions on can I do the easiest, simplest shit, and I was like, â€œyeah, I donâ€™t have professional experience, but I am competent in-â€œ shut the fuck up and say yes, Rana. Genuinely, Iâ€™ve been talked down to by my parents for so long until I proved myself, and itâ€™s been two years. I still genuinely cannot stand up for myself. 

Iâ€™m a waste of carbon and tuition money. Maybe I should fuck off before I waste any more of my parentâ€™s money while they support me as I try to find a job. I wouldnâ€™t be much better as an intimate partner or friend, trust. 

I have a cover letter to write, follow-up email, and a portfolio+resume to send, but like...why bother. Who the fuck cares. Iâ€™m already drunk and I want to sleep, fingers crossed I stop bleeding money and disappointing everyone around me and donâ€™t wake up the next morning.
