Please explain this part of humans.If this sounds like some kind of rallying thing, something calling for a change of thoughts, I'm sorry. This is not my intention.

I'm slowly getting into "the dark side". hehMy parents did their best to hammer... I don't know what to call it. Various ideas that suicide is evil and selfish and only cowards commit suicide, etc, etc.

Today, in an epilepsy moral support group, I saw somebody declare they've had enough with this disease. I can't blame them. But I'm not here to talk about epilepsy, I'm here to ask about the thought process of the kind of person who sees an "I've had enough" message and promptly jumps into that person's profile, gathers as much information as they can and start replying with "but look at your children! You're leaving your children! What will your mother say? Your poor children! You should force yourself to live for others!"Somewhat paraphrased, obviously.

I see this kind of people everywhere. I'm the kind of lunatic that believes that one can make a rational decision to end their life. I read this time and time again - a person tries to end their life, often because of a disease, and then these people show up, screaming how the person ending their life shouldn't do so because of... reasons, trying to guilt-trip them. Some of these people take an extra step, calling a nuthouse and have the person hauled into a mental ward and tortured.

Again, I'm trying to call for a change here, I'm simply asking what goes through that kind of person's mind.

I've read the rules but didn't quite understand some because I just took my meds and I'm kinda "high" right now, for lack of a better word.
