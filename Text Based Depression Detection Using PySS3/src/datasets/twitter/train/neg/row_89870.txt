I'm not suicidal, but...I'd be okay with it if I died tomorrow.

My story: I've struggled with depression since I was 15 (currently 23/F). My triggers are alcohol, relationship issues, body-image, loneliness, and boredom. Lately, things have been going smoothly. I broke up with my boyfriend of 6 months a couple of weeks ago because I realized that I didn't want him, I needed him. Since then, I've been on the self-improvement train: exercise (picking back up where I left off, running), diet (more fruits, vegetables, protein), therapy, getting outside, etc. I even started going to Sex and Love Addicts Anonymous meetings as a sort of group therapy.

But, I'm still tired of life. I'm successful, by many standards, but I just don't have the will to get out of bed, get dressed, and leave my apartment some days. If I don't have any obligations with serious consequences that day, I'm liable to sleep through to the next day (like I did today...). Every few weeks or so, I have a day where I just don't get out of bed, because, what's the point?

I just can't see a future living this way. I can't visualize myself as a 25 year old, 30 year old, fuckin' 50 year old, struggling with this same shit every single day. What kind of life is that? So, if I were to die tomorrow, it would be a relief.

tl;dr: tired of trying, death would be okay
