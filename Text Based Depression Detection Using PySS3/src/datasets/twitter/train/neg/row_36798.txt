Tips?Sorry if this is the wrong place to post this but I'm having a particularly shitty day today and was wondering if anyone had any tips/ideas of things I could do to make myself feel even a little bit better. I've struggled with clinical depression since I was a child but in the last year have been trying to seek help when I need it instead of being alone. 

Any advice is welcome!
