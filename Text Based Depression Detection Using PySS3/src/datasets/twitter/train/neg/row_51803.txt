I am going to kill myself soonI don't know when. But I know I will. My body and my mind are completely out of sync. I've convinced myself that I'm going to commit so much that even if my brain screamed not to, I'd still fucking kick the chair. I'm so fucking nauseated. I can't stand this. I can't stand having to breate for a second longer. I can't stand having to be trapped in this body, with this brain, these fucking thoughts. I need out. Someone please talk me out of it. Someone please talk to me
