Any advice how to stop compulsive thoughts?Itâ€™s not so much suicide but itâ€™s making me crazy. I keep getting these compulsive thoughts and I canâ€™t stop until I find out answer or switch it to another one. Iâ€™ll sit for hours just thinking a question or thinking something irrational and I get stuck and panicky and canâ€™t stop it. 
Iâ€™m really scared that itâ€™s going to break me because I feel like Iâ€™m already going crazy with it. Itâ€™s ruining my perception of people and Iâ€™m scared it will really ruin my relationships and in turn myself.
