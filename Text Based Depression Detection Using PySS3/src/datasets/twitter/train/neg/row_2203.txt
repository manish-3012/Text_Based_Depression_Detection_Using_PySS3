Feelings of suicide at workI feel so socially inept it wrecks me.

At work I feel left out, nobody jokes with me or smiles.

I have no friends, yet everyone seems to be good buddies enough to hang out.

I like my job and I don't want to quit but I hate coming to work and feeling like I am too ugly, too awkward, too shy to talk too.

One conversation was about something negative that everyone was experiencing I chimed in with something related and destroyed the conversation. Everyone immediately went back to work without response. It was like it would be better if I didn't exist at all. 

It's like people see me for the weak pathetic person I am and files me away as someone with no importance.

I'm the only clopener, and the only closer on a Saturday night.

They got everyone drinks but me yesterday.

I just feel like the piece of shit of the group.

I'd get help but therapy is awful been through 3 therapist.

I'm considering methods.
