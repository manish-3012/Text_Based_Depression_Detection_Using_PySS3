Hereâ€™s a writing I did yesterday. I wouldnâ€™t ever kill myself because Iâ€™m too much of a coward to do so.Why am I the one suffering so much when i should be free?
Why am I being punished for sins that are beyond me? 
Why must I feel that the only solution is my extermination to be taken seriously?
Why am I being crushed under the weight others have put on my back as if too pack a mule?
Why do I feel so miserable when i have no reason?
If I am far too young to be crushed under the real pressures of life, maybe I should not be in it.
Maybe I am far too weak to continue and this is my downward spiral to an escapeless void which will become my hell and eventually my end. 
I already feel too far down to get out.
The escape ropes being thrown down no longer work, I am now hanging by a thread made of guilt and fear.
Fear of causing pain to my lover and my pet.
Guilt of being a waste of riches of my parents.
Fear of feeling pain as I cease to exist. 
Like a coward, I am scared of the pain death brings as a gift with itself. 
I no longer see the light that shine as the exit from this never ending fall.
Soon I will be at the bottom of it as up is no longer my option. 
Soon I will be swallowed by the my worst sins.
Soon I will be none.
