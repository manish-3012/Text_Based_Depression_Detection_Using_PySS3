Iâ€™m not worth itIâ€™m not smart, not talented, useless, a waste of space. I want to die. Please tell me how. If I die, then everyone will be happy. They donâ€™t have to worry about my stupidity, my embarrassing behavior, me being a burden, and me just being a waste of space anymore.

Please tell me how to die.
