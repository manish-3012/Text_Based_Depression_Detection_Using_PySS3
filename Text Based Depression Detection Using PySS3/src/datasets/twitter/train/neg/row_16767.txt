But how?Things arenâ€™t great, Iâ€™m letting people down, wasting money and wasting time.
I recently made an attempt but failed, Iâ€™ve now left myself with nothing to overdoes on (how the hell did I survive???) and I juts donâ€™t know how to try in a way thatâ€™ll definitely get the job done.
My friend offered to over dose on their antidepressants together but I feel guilty letting her harm herself.
Iâ€™m not a fan of the idea of cutting my wrists and there isnâ€™t really a high place I can get to.
I assume hanging is the most logical and practical method but im open to other suggestions.
