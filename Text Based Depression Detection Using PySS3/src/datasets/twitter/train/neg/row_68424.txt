Will this kind of overdose kill me?Hi, I've been having very intrusive suical thoughts for almost a month now, and I just lost a job that I've wanted for years. I only managed to make it to two shifts, and the last time I came in a broke down in tears in front of everyone--the customers, my boss, coworkers, etc. My boss said it would be best if I got some help before trying to maintain working. I'm really frustrated because I haven't been working since the end of July this year. It's been 2 months and I've let so many job opportunities slip away from me because I can't bring myself to get out of bed. I just want to die. I'm not looking for any kind of attention. I just want to know if an overdose like this would kill me, and I'll be on my way. If I took 1,175 mg of Seroquel, 1,650 mg of Hydroxyzine, 220 mg of Lexapro, and 2,009 mg of Famotidine, would it kill me? I'd rather not have life long complications, like liver problems or brain problems. I just want to stop existing. This is all I have right now and just to make sure I'll be gone I'm going to cut my arms and let them bleed.
