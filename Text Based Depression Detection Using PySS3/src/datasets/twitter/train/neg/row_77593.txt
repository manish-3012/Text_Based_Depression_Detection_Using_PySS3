I want to talk about it , but no one cares to listen?Started my morning by taking my very last client .
Iâ€™ve always loved makeup, so I made it extreme.
Ate some quesadillas cause I love cheese.
Now Iâ€™ll go to work , on my way Iâ€™ll listen to my favourite playlist .
Iâ€™ll work my very last shift ,
I pray the money I make goes towards charity or to help feed the homeless. Iâ€™ve been starving before , itâ€™s not easy . Iâ€™ll write that as my last wish .
Maybe go to a park? But I donâ€™t want any children to be affected, therefore maybe Iâ€™ll go to a hidden path . Drink my favourite bottle of wine .
Moscato ofcourse .
And The razor blade is my weapon of choice.
I want to talk about it , but no one cares to listen . 
Atleast my plans out in the open .
All my life , Iâ€™ve had more than enough love to give .
But I never loved myself ..
If I canâ€™t love myself , ofcourse I canâ€™t expect anyone else to either .
Thank you for taking the time to read my schedule today .
This is the most important day of my life .
