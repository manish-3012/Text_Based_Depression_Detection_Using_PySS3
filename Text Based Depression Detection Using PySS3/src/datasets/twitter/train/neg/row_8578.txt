How do you think your death would affect the world?I didn't mean to sound so menacing. I genuinely want to know what do you think would change after you died. I think the "world" seems a bit farfetched so it's okay if you can answer in a smaller scale.

As for my answer to my own question, it probably would be a lot quieter in our home since I was always the one screaming and laughing my ass off for something silly.. My brother would probably hate me for leaving all the dishes to him. My parents would miss lecturing me for every mistake I made. My friends online from a game will probably wonder what the heck happened to me that I just quit the game so suddenly. My new puppy would be more loved by my parents since he would only remind them of me. My student loans will probably be wiped off the earth too.
