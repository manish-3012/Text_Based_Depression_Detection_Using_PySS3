What do I do with my life?I'm tired of my shitty life, being too shy to talk to girls, having bad teeth, being incompetent at everything, being a lazy fuck. The people that I thought were supposed to help, just prefer to mind-rape you even more. The people you think would do anything to make you do something bad in your life or try to do something bad to you have never hurt me or even tried to, to be grateful, I feel like giving back to them. Atleast I'll have accomplished something in my fucking low quality life.
