Suddenly, for the first time in my life I want to try staying alive and fighting.Even if I don't have any hope, I realized that my dreams are too beautiful to give up.   
If I die trying then I die.  
**But I will try. I realized I have nothing to lose.**

I've been extremely suicidal for years, I tried to kms three times.  


Hope y'all here will also feel it today, just for a moment.   
**We all have nothing to lose so we can try. We can actually do anything we want to do - if we'll be dead then who cares if something goes wrong?**   
Am I right?

(ngl, music and supportive people help me a lot.)
