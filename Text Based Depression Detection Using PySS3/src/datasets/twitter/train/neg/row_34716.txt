I don't enjoy anything anymore, and I don't have a friend to talk to.Hello, I would rather the company of internet strangers, than no company at all. I can't enjoy my life any longer. I loved playing video games and writing, and now I've lost that love in me. I'm a 21 year old male, my profession is a janitor, and although I love the people at my job, my job title can feel demeaning and the job itself tends to be a lonely one. I don't have much of a social life, I'm an introvert, and its hard to keep friendships for me. There are a few people around me that care, but they don't understand me. I'm absolutely DESPERATE for some form of socialization. I lost a lot of HS friends after I disappeared on them, that in itself is another story. My only hope is trying to get a career other than being a janitor. I'm trying to learn programming, and my depression is sort of helping. I'm not really sure if it is or not. Please dear redditors, I'm not sure how much of me is really left anymore. I'm at the point where Id be okay with dying, due to the emptiness inside of me. If there's anyone that has any advice, any thoughts, is suffering similarly, or just wants to say hello, then I welcome you. Anyways thank you. A few words will mean more to me then you know.
