I also might wait another five years.I want to share a little story with you.
The past month have been very hard for me.
I've thought about killing my self, planned everything and I've done a lot of research.

One thing that couldn't finish was the letter for my friends and family. I'm very bad in writing cause I always overthink every sentence I write. It was not my first letter I wrote but the structure was similar to my past letters. I wanted to write something that everybody could understand at least a bit why I've choosen that way.

As I was writing I came to a sentence where I've said that I would give anything for a other solution but didn't knew any. As I've written that sentance I noticed how dumb it was. If I would give anything for another way, why wouldn't I give myself the chance to change my life before I end it. Even if it would take years to accomplish something, it is worth a try. 

If you consider killing yourself, you have to know that you will leave a lot of pain behind. Even if you believe that no one likes you or if you think you're not important, there's always someone who will be hurt by your actions.

I want to improve myself and my life. It wont be easy and results might come after many months, but as I've said, it's worth a try.
