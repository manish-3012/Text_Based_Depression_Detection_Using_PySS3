I'm turning into a ghostI was always the background kid in school. I've been a semi hermit for a while now and when I went to my friend's party I realized that I CAN'T talk anymore. I have no idea what to say. I can't talk like a normie unless it's a special interest. I just don't fit in at all. It's probably my depression causing this as well. In any case not sure if I'll see 30. That's all.
