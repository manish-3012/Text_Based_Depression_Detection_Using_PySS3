Iâ€™m just so lost...I have worked for so many companies. Some I have stayed with for a while, but left because the money just wasnâ€™t enough. But the companies were good overall, and the companies whom I have thought were good, either had terrible bosses. The stress was so unbearable I was forced to quit or leave, or I was let go. What I just experienced with Windowrama just really did my head in, badly. I have worked for a total of 20 companies, I have yet to find a good one. And this sucks because now I can only stay a couple months at a time sometimes a month max... I have money saved up but itâ€™s scary because Iâ€™m tired of running into this issue. My fear is going completely broke with 0 income, coming in. My self esteem and confidence is just crushed. Iâ€™m starting to feel like a failure and a burden to my parents, I have so much to offer. So much talent, but it just seems irrelevant to all these people. I donâ€™t want to be stuck in this loop forever, I just want it to stop. Iâ€™ve been thinking of painless ways of killing myself but Iâ€™m too scared to do it, too scared to hurt my friends and family, and too scared to possibly do it and potentially miss out on a great life ahead, I also donâ€™t want to die in a painful way. I just feel so incompetent. I got an offer from this company, no official letter yet. I just donâ€™t feel right man. Lots of things scaring me... I donâ€™t know what to do. Itâ€™s not like we have control of us coming into this life, our parents give birth to us. If it was up to me. I wish I was never born. So I wouldnâ€™t be dealing with the shit Iâ€™m dealing with. I literally was in the bathroom wrapping a belt around my neck trying to visualize how it would play out, Iâ€™m just so lost.. Iâ€™m not going to end my life, Iâ€™m too afraid to even do that. Because if I fuck up, and turn myself into a vegetable, Iâ€™m stuck here. As a vegetable, forever. And that is also something I donâ€™t want...
