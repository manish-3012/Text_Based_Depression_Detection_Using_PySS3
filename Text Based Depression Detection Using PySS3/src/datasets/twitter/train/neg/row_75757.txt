I just need somebody to vent to (heartbreak)This is a throwaway for obvious reasons. 

A couple months ago I hurt somebody very dear to me. This person had suicidal depression and low self esteem. By the time I made my mistake I had finally gained their trust and built a stable relationship with them, just to ruin it all. We could've been so happy together and I ruined it. Gaining their trust took such hard work, and we had many ups and downs, and after I ruined everything it became worse than anything I've ever experienced with them. The heartache lasted a few more months and during that time I believe I've developed anxiety and depression, though I guess I can't be too sure. I do know that I've had mentle breakdowns over them and I hate myself so much to the point where I feel like dying sometimes. Recently they've decided that the heartache wasn't worth it and have found someone to replace me, but has also told me that they're not fully over me yet. I decided that I deserved to be replaced and that I owe it to them to help them move on from me, since it's all my fault. I tried my best to help them but being replaced like that was too much for me to handle and I ended up abandoning them instead. I should've never done it. They'll have a harder time without me and there's a fair possibility that they'll kill themself because I decided to leave their life. The guilt and uncertainty is too much to handle and I've found myself crying too many times in one day to keep track of now. I've tried reaching out to them again but they want nothing to do with me and told me that they can't promise me they'll be ok, but that they also don't want me in their life anymore. I just don't know what to do anymore or how to move on. I don't know who to talk to but I need help. The pain is too much.
