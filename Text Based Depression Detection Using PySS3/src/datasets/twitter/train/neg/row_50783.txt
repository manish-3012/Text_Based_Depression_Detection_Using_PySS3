I've been blind to my own truth.Since 7, I've been diagnosed with ASD, and throughout my entire life, I've had struggles socialising. In effect, I've basically taught myself "shortcuts" in all kinds of social interactions.
But that's not what I've been doing truly is.
What I've been doing is pure evil.
What I've been doing is lying.
Attacking people.
Shouting at people, punching people, trying to get my own way.
Manipulating people in any way I possibly can.
Destroying those that were once on my side by "seeking attention" when in reality all I was doing was tearing people apart by speaking to them individually rather than as a group. 
My GCSEs aren't even slightly on my mind right now, or my birthday tomorrow. I want to just end everything right now. This world doesn't deserve to have wasted semen on me. I'm an arsehole.
