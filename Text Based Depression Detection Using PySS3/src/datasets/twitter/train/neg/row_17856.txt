Why shouldn't I kill myself?Literally nobody cares, and even if someone did, they are too far away to help me now

I want to die so bad, I've been imagining how I'm going to do it for so long

I don't have a plan, but right now I feel like impulsively hurting myself

Even though I'm too chicken to do anything

But I still don't see a point to my life. I wouldn't mind if I got shot right now.   

My brother wants me dead, he's told me to jump off a cliff

My mother has encouraged me to kill myself

My father does nothing but watch me break down and then criticizes me 

My friends don't know me well enough to care, the most they'd mourn is for a few months...

"But I love you" "Things get better" "You've been strong for so long!" "Remember that one thing to live for" Classic examples of garbage reasons to live

 I've been fighting for a years for things to get better. And now I want to die. I'm done. 

The one thing I might live for doesn't love me, doesn't help me, it does nothing

And love is so artificial... save me the trouble and don't tell me that because I know\- behind my back you think I'm a useless liability 

I'm just going to live a mundane life forever. Why not die now? 

I can't miss stuff when I'm gone. Why not die now? 

Everyone around me might cry, \(against their hypocritical reactions towards me now\) but I won't be alive to see it. 

I'll be free. From my mind, from my life. 

Why shouldn't I die? 

TL;DR: I don't have a single reason to live. I'd like someone to change my mind, but..... I might just overdose on my medication tonight.
