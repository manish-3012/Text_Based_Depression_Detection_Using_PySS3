No reason not to.I never did have a reason. Because there was always something in me to keep pushing. 

But now I lost that drive because ... itâ€™s a long story, but I donâ€™t have it. So I canâ€™t just keep pushing forward. 

I want to die. And now I want to kill myself. It doesnâ€™t make a difference that I know it isnâ€™t right. Obviously that wonâ€™t matter once Iâ€™m gone. 

Nothing drives me anymore. I have no personality to inspire me anymore. Iâ€™m just lost and hopeless and so I know if I dwell on this too much Iâ€™ll do it and Iâ€™m not very good at not dwelling. 


I used to say that Iâ€™d just go drive somewhere else instead, and start life a new. But I did that and it sucks. 


I used to know Iâ€™d keep pushing no matter what because itâ€™s obvious, but thatâ€™s gone now. It isnâ€™t obvious anymore. I canâ€™t even empathize with who I was before. That aspect of me was obsessive crazy and I did work to break that and whoops I lost that survival instinct with it I guess. 

I know that if I go to bed Iâ€™ll wake up feeling better so thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m doing. But this isnâ€™t reliable to stop me from coming to these thoughts and these emotions again and just planning it out and doing it.

Without something worth living for, eventually...I wonâ€™t be.
