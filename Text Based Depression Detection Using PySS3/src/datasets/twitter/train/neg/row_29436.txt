Being broke and depressed makes me more broke and more depressedIt feels like im begging if I ask for help. So i basically hibernate. Which makes me more depressed. Then when i become lucid i realize i need things to survive and get accused of faking depression for charity, starting the cycle again. How do you ask for help without being shit on?
