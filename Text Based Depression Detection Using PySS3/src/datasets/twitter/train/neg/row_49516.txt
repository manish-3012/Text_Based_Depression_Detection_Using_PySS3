I just donâ€™t want to be foundIâ€™ve never posted here before, but I just need to get this out there. Iâ€™ve been wanting to die for so long. I legitimately hate myself and almost every day for the last 4 months has been unbearable and a struggle not to allow myself to fall into a void of depression and distress. 

I have a boyfriend who loves me and we recently bought a house together (it was something he was wanting to do, I manically followed behind him)

I have a plan and I know how I would do it, but I just canâ€™t go through with it because all I see is him finding me and being devastated. We almost broke up last year and he was the one who asked me to get back together with him. I wish I had stuck to my guns and cut it off then. 

I just canâ€™t imagine how fucked up he would feel if I killed myself, he found me and then he was no longer able to afford the house. Iâ€™m just so tired of being a burden and of being miserable. 

I just really wish he would have found someone who actually deserves him.
