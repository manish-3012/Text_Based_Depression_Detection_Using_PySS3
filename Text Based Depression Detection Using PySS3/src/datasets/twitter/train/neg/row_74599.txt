Getting a GunI'm 18 so I am able to get a gun. I'm just worried it will hurt and people will find me and be disturbed. I don't want to do anything ever but I have to. I am too lazy. I am too lazy to do homework. I am too lazy to get out of bed for classes. I am too lazy to clean my room. I am sometimes too lazy to eat. 

I just want to have no responsibilities and not worry about having no significant other to love me. I miss him. He was my reason I could live, but now he's gone. 

Should I leave a note to my friends and family? Should I leave a note to him too? I don't want to hurt them, but I know I will, so would a note help alleviate the pain?
