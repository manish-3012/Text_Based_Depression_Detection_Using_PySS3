I hate all the things people always tell suicidal peopleIt's always the same thing. Sometimes it might be something else but I can list them in a short list. 

1. "It'll get better." 
2. "Just give it time." 
3. "You're still young." 

I feel like I'm in a video game, with scripted messages. Every time is the same. This completely disregards the emotional pain I'm in. I understand why they say it, in reality they want to help but they just don't know how to help. So they give me false hope, that somehow, blindly, I'll make it. And I hope I do. But it still feels like my feelings are just being pushed aside.
