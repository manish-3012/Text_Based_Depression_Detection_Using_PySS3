Down to the bottom againI've been doing pretty well for the last 2 months. Today I had an argument with my mom again. The thing is that I'm right at something but she doesn't accept it so she takes it personal and gets me grounded. She's the kind of person that you can't speak rationally because will keep shouting just to not hear you.
