I donâ€™t really know what Iâ€™m waiting for.I officially graduate in a few months but I have nothing to look forward to. Deep down I know that Iâ€™m not capable of holding down a real job. Iâ€™m not really capable of anything. In the last four years I havenâ€™t made a single friend in my life. Not one. If I canâ€™t even get one person to like me, if I canâ€™t even put myself out there one single time, how can I ever be someone worthy of life. 

I donâ€™t know why I am this way but I always have been. It sucked being a little kid absolutely consumed by anxiety. But now it feels like a complete death sentence. I donâ€™t have anything to prove, and I donâ€™t have any anger. I just know that I canâ€™t exist in this world the way other people can. Itâ€™s not like I experienced something terrible or was raised badly. Iâ€™m just a defective person. I always was this way and I know I wonâ€™t ever stop because itâ€™s who I am. I donâ€™t want to be a person who commits suicide because they want everyone to feel bad, or whatever. I just want everyone to continue as they are. It would be the exact same whether Iâ€™m dead or alive, so I might as well just remove myself from the pain while I still have some dignity, right? My only other option is just to fall further down until I become desperate. I donâ€™t want to go out that way. 

I donâ€™t feel bad for the people who might miss me because they are all good, normal people. They can do things like move on. And go to the store. And go to work. And talk to people. Things that just fall between my fingers. I know that life isnâ€™t supposed to be fair and all but I donâ€™t really care about that. I just want to do something right, for once. The one thing that I know I can do right.
