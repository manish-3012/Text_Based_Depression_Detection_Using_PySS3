I'm young and ready to rest alreadyI'm 15 years old and I will (probably not) sit my GCSE'S in May. I've failed all of my mock exams which gets me anxious about applying to post 16 education.
 I have passed all deadlines for applications because of my gigantuan anxiety and to be honest I'm about ready to rest if you know what I mean. I'd rather just fall to my death which why I'm currently waiting for my sibling to leave their room.
