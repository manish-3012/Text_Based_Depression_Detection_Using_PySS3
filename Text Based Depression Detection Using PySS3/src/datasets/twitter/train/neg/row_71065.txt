Odds of this working?Leftover from a recent injury, I have 15 5mg pills of non-APAP oxycodone, and I drink every weekend with acquaintances. I'm a 6'1 male that weighs a bit under 120 lbs. If I get absolutely hammered on an empty stomach with like 8 shots in half an hour and take all the pills, will it work?

I've run out of reasons to keep going. I just need someone with more experience than me to do the math, as it were, of this method. Maybe severely burning my hand will have been the only good thing to have ever happened
