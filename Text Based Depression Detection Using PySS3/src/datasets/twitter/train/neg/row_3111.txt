If I was single I would end it allIm hurting so much inside. I see no point to live except for my partner. He is amazing to me. He makes me smile, every single day. But he is all I live for. I live for nothing else. 

I donâ€™t even know if we broke up that I could kill myself because I wouldnâ€™t want to hurt him. (unless he like cheated or sumn) But if I never knew him, it would be over for me. 

Everytime I think about suicide, the thoughts of him intervene. And I stop thinking about it. He doesnâ€™t know my thoughts this deep, but heâ€™s saving my life.
