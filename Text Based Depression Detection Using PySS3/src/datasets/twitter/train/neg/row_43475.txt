I just want someone in my life that I can always talk to no matter wat and someone that actually cares about meI am at a point in my life were I dont have alot of friends that care about me, i hardly end up talking to most of them and I am always the one person that starts the conversation.

I have been through alot and I just feel empty and that I have no one to turn too when I am in my feelings. All I want in my life is someone I am able to talk to everyday or just spend time with or even just hold cuz I need itðŸ˜”
