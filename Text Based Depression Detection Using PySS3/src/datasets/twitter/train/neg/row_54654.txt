I am worried about a student at my schoolI do not know him very well, but his Facebook posts have been getting very strange lately. They are usually pretty different, but lately they have gotten worse.

I screen-shotted most of the recent ones, as well as his cover photo. I have censored everything. Maybe I am just overreacting, but I could really use another opinion. This stuff is sort of scary.
