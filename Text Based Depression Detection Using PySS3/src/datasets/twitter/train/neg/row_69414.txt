What's the point?Every irl friend I have ever made has stopped talking to me slowly except one. My dog who was the only thing that could consistently make me happy died a few months ago. I recently had to drop out of school because I couldn't keep up due to a mix of depression, anxiety and recently diagnosed adhd. My parents have stopped supporting me financially in any way. My meds aren't even covered by my health care. I had to stop going to my psychologist because I can't afford to go anymore. My friends roommates for next year just said they don't want me to live with them, so I'm gonna have to find somewhere to live on my own. I don't enjoy anything on my own anymore, but have only 1 friend left and no confidence so I don't make friends easily. I am always sad at night and when I am alone on my own. All I want is the peaceful nothingness of death. I have tried before, but something stopped me, I think it was because my friend is my roommate until April and I don't want him to be the one to find me dead. But what's the point in me working at a job that I don't enjoy just so I can struggle to pay for a life that I don't even want to live?
