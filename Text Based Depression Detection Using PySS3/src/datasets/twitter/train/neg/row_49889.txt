Disconnected, thinking of harming myself brings me joyMy life isn't bad and people care about me. It just doesn't matter to me, I dont want things to get any better or wose I'm tired of waking up everyday. I'm not happy sad or stressed, just peaceful. There's nothing Id rather do then pop some potassium cyannide pills and vanish
