I want to dieI am so alone. No one cares about me except my son and he's so overwhelming to me because of his abusive dad. I saved up all my courage and I called the police today and they did nothing. I was ready. I had all my info together, all my photos and documentation of abuse. I told them everything and my abusive partner convinced them to leave. They didn't even get me my car keys so I could leave in my own car that is registered in my name and I have a valid DL and insurance and everything. They turned me down. They left me here. I can't take it. I'd rather die. I want to die right this minute. I can't take any more. I have no family. No one cares. No one cares. I feel so fucking bad for my son. I know I've failed him as a mother. I just want to fucking make it all stop as soon as possible. I need help and there is no way for me to get it. I did everything. I have no way out. I'm so angry and frustrated and hopeless. If I don't kill myself I'm going to kill my partner the next time he touches me and no one is going to care that I was abused then either. I wi go to prison or die then. I'd rather just die now. I need a way to go that won't make my face look too scary. I put my son in his room with a snack and a movie and I am ready.
