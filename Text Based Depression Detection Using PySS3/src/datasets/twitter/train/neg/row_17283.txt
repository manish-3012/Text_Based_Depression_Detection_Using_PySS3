I'm so indecisive. [LONG]When I was 10, my 5 year old half brother (severely mentally ill) molested me. My father was an alcoholic and in the same year he started getting loud and mean. I couldn't sleep at night with the music and fighting. The combination of the 2 kickstarted almost 10 years of depression and insomnia. I dropped out of school because of the weight and the toll of my insomnia. When I started cutting myself at 14 my parents refused to medicate me for my depression even though I couldn't function. I continued to struggle and became incredibly suicidal. I started having homicidal thoughts about my father when i was 16. He pointed a gun at me and I had made up my mind to kill him. My stepmother left my dad at that time and I was alone with him. A month before my dad's 39th birthday I found him dead in my front yard. He had shot himself in the head. I had a very sever case of PTSD and I was in a dissociative state for about 8 months after that. I was overwhelmed with guilt over the fact that I had wanted him dead. I started becoming suicidal to the point that i was drinking and taking lots of pills. 
I started therapy and started medication and although it helps with my day to day functioning I still want to kill myself. I skip my doses on purpose and I won't take my sleep medication because I'm scared to sleep. 
I live with my fiance and my stepmother. They both worry so much and I want to be there for them but my urges to kill myself are overwhelming me. I just don't know what to do. I'm ruining my relationships as an excuse to kill myself and I feel like I can't control it....
I don't know why I posted here... I guess I just wanted a fresh take on this all.... I'm at my wits end
