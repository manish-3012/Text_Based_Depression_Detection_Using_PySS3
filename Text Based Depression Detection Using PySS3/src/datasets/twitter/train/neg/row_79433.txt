Dont have a knife or pills at hand but im considering it almost everynight nowIve had deppression almost all my life, been lonely too. Anyone I befriend or get into a relationship with will and have ended up hating me or never even liking me in the first place. 

I honestly thought my life was getting better a few months ago. I met the love of my life where I worked and we quickly fell in love. Now I dont even know why he stays with me, we never do anything fun because all I do is sleep or sulk whenever we're out. The only condition of us staying together is if I get therapy, I got myself the documents but it requires me to sort out ID for it, I cant even be bothered to do that. I just need someone now. 

On tuesday, I had a very very stressful day. I almost broke down crying on the bus home. I sat there and thought 'when I get back, im going to have every pill ive got and see what happens' eventually I got back, decided sleep was better for me.

Last night I took 7 ibrupofen but knew nothing would happen, I considered taking more. I also considered calling a crisis line but I didnt want anyone hearing the conversation 

Im really fed up, my whole ive truly been miserable and cannot take it anymore, im a huge burden on my boyfriends life and would be much better off without me

I don't even know what else to write, it feels like nothingNess when im here so lets just have nothing...
