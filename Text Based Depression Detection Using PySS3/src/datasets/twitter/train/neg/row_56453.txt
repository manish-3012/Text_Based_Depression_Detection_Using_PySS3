Hopeless.I posted here a little while ago, but here is the outline of my story. The last 3 and a half years have been hell. My head hurts, my face feels congested and blocked, my ears crackle, pop, block and hurt with every swallow. Loud noises make my eardrums rattle like a blown out speaker. After seeing herbalists, ENTs, nutritionists, allergists, osteopaths, doctors and dieticians I was no closer to finding out why I had these symptoms. I was becoming a nervous wreck as I cut out dairy, sugar, wheat, chocolate, alcohol and basically every pleasurable food except for fruit. I was given every anti allergy and sinus drug, spray, tool and device you could think of. Nothing was helping it. I was stuck in bed, feeling more depressed with my constant head cold like symptoms, feeling lethargic, sad and desperate.                                                                                                          My anxiety was becoming horrendous, I was developing OCD because of the fear of touching/smelling/inhaling everything in case that was why I was having these symptoms. My doctor told me I could be like it for life and I may never get better. We finally found an ENT who took me seriously 18 months later. He scanned my sinuses and ears and said they are perfectly clear and diagnosed a jaw issue. Finally, I had a reasoning, a medical reason for feeling like I did. TMJ. I matched every symptom perfectly and there was hope. We found a dentist who specialised and he ordered a scan which showed significant damage to the TM joints and degeneration. A heavy programme of physio, rehabilitation, splint therapy and soft food followed as I finally got out of my lower, hopeless moods and anxieties and found a path to normality. The pain got worse and worse as I underwent treatment, and I went on painkillers daily. I was miserable, but hopeful. He retired last Christmas and I saw a colleague who referred me to the surgeon they use. He said the issue hadn't resolved at all non invasively and now it was time for surgery. I'm in the UK and the waiting lists over here for the NHS are exterminate, so we had to self fund. Lying in bed the night before, I knew I would either get my life back, or it would fail and I would feel worse than ever. The operation came, went and 4 months later I've not seen any improvement, and have now developed severe anxiety and PTSD symptoms after collapsing 2 days after the surgery. The nurses put it down to taking off the bandages and the heavy cocktail of drugs I was on, but it was terrifying. My head felt pressured, things felt surreal and it shook me. I now keep having panic attacks ever since. My anxiety daily is 100/100. I'm severely depressed, in pain, things feel surreal and I'm forgetful. I'm seeing a therapist who is trying to help me manage my pain and, although she is so lovely and helpful, it just is so tough talking about it. I'm empty, broken, hopeless and sad. I'm waiting for the next anxiety attack, living through the days terrified of my anxiety, avoiding everything because I'm now not 100% sure what is causing the symptoms, and waiting to go back to sleep. Things are a blur, and my therapist said I am severely anxious and depressed and struggling to find positivity as well as having flashbacks. Nothing is getting better and I don't know what to do anymore. Thank you to whoever reads this.
