Untalented, unlovable and a waste of space.Iâ€™m not good at anything. My personality and appearance are the actual worst. Iâ€™m just a burden on my family and friends, I know for a fact theyâ€™d be better off without me. 

I canâ€™t deal with existing anymore, I hate life. People say â€œit gets betterâ€ but for the past 4 years itâ€™s somehow managed to get worse and worse. I self harm, I starve myself, I have bad anger issues. 

Iâ€™m the worst person ever, no one will never love me, Iâ€™ll never accomplish anything. Iâ€™m just a sad, pathetic person who is a shitty writer, a shitty musician and a shitty friend.
