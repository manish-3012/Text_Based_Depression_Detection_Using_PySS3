I just wanna die so fucking muchBeen contemplating suicide everyday for the past 4 years. Not a single person in my life has their shit together. Or the ones that do don't give a fuck about anyone else. I have no one to turn to. I'm angry all the time, but if you met me you'd think I was the nicest person so I've been told. I hate my memories. All the good ones are overshadowed by the bad ones. I have so much debt. I hate the way I look. I've gotten plastic surgery in an attempt to look prettier, but it did nothing. I'm a failure. Can't stay motivated. I will probably attempt suicide for the first time in July or August. I used to be able to sleep it off, but the thoughts are still there in the morning now.
