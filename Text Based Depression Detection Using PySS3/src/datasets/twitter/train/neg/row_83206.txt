I don't want to live if life is going to shit all over me.My friend, one of two people who I trusted about telling about my depression with, tried to sexually harass me today (and semi-succeeded). I feel like anyone can backstab me now. I'm trying to sleep, but I can't and the kitchen knife I can grab and slit my veins with just comes back to my mind all the time. I'm afraid to tell my other friend about it, in fear they backstab me as well. God, I just want to end this shitty life.
