Iâ€™m close to it...Iâ€™m close to killing myself, I am nothing but a failure... 

I canâ€™t find a new job, I was accepted into my dream job but I couldnâ€™t handle the work load n got injured at training during a practice at my own time, that I left.

I miss my ex everyday, my trust issues run so deep I am scared to be happy n in love again... itâ€™s so hard being happy and keeping people happy, I just feel like killing myself, I am no good for anyone I left people down no matter how hard I try to keep everyone happy I hurt them in a way..  so i find it better if I leave the world I wonâ€™t let anyone down anymore, yes ppl will miss me and shit but they will move on. Itâ€™s not like anyone checks up on me anyways..
