Why do people get so depressed to the point of loneliness?Iâ€™m 16, slightly autistic, and Iâ€™m about to be going through my second sophomore year of hs. I dont go outside because Iâ€™m extremely asocial, and ive been told im a burden by many of those around me. I make electronic music. (Sorry to plug, but my soundcloud name is Kveta Decker) but because i go to school about once every week, I have my computer taken away. Music is the only way i feel happy and accomplished about myself. 

The only way i can feel some joy is with music and video games. With this token away, whatâ€™s the point of being happy anymore?

I donâ€™t want to die, but I havenâ€™t had much that makes me feel happy recently.

I just feel so alone not going outside. And itâ€™s not like I donâ€™t want to. I get ridiculed for being transgender by my neighbors and people i talk to while out in public.
