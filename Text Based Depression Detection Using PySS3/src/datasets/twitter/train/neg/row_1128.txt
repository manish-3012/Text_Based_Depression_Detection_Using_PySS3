Peace of MindOk. Deep breath.

Victim of years of abuse. Years. I won't go into specifics because some folks are sensitive to that. From 10-16 or so.

Met a girl, settled down and got married. Things were ok for a while, I started to change according to my wife. So I told her everything. Everything. She handled it as well as could be expected and suggested therapy. Which I took. I felt no better but took it anyways.

Spent years in therapy, with no change. Found out through people that several of my numerous abusers were dead, I felt sad.

I was depressed all the time, no answer, no help. Turned away from suicide lines in Can/US because they don't help straight white men, programs for lgbt, poc and youth, but not adult men. Not here to gripe, just matter of fact.

On a work trip, I had to pull over at a rest stop to make use of the facilities, and there was another man in there, pleasuring himself. I watched for a while before getting involved (stupidly) When it was over, it felt like a weight had lifted off of me. My depression cleared.

My wife noticed the change when I got home too. I didn't tell her why. We made love for the first time in over 6 months. I never lost attraction for her just function.

Cut to two weeks later, the depression is back. And with a vengeance. I'm out for a walk trying to clear my head and shake the darkness free in nature, when I stumble upon a group of men being intimate with each other. Again I watch from the sidelines, then again I join in. Then again I feel better.

I have zero attraction to any of these men, or really any other men for that matter.  It for some reason this action, this fulfillment of some sort of trauma bond, makes me feel better for short times.

I've always been safe about it, but I can't keep leading this double life. 

I've gone without that sort of contact for 4 weeks now and I'm staring very worryingly at firearms, ropes and such.

I can't tell her this, or my therapist. 

But I'm just about done
