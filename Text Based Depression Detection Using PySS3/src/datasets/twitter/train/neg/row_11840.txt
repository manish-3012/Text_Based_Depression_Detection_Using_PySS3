If i do it today, no one will find me until after im deadI'm away from home and the only person who will find me is not in this week. If i do it today, no one will even come find me until the week end, which is when my parents expect me home. But. Im not ready. Im scared. Im unprepared. I dont exactly know what i need to be ending my life. I wish i could just sleep and never wake up. Sorry if im posting a lot. I just dont know where else to share these thoughts on.
