Killing myself because I'm black.Doubt this will get much attention but here I am anyways. For all 16 years of my life I've found hate being black. No matter what I do, say, or act, I'll always just be judged based on my appearance. And yeah yeah I've heard all of the drivel about how "things aren't so bad." or how "not everyone feels this way". But to me the fact that a sizeable portion of society will treat me differently just because of how I was born is enough for me to know I don't want to live anymore.

If I could be white any other race I'd take it in a second. At least then I'd have a higher chance of being seen as an actual individual human being. I'm not even fully black I'm only about half, but I look the part. Even if things get better and I move past my depression I know I'll just be seen and treated differently. I've figured out if you're not the majority you're an outsider by default and people will easily pass judgment on you.

So I'm done with it. I'm done with living with these feelings. I just loathe the fact that I got so unlucky as to be born like this. I don't think there's anything wrong with humans of different races, religions, or creeds. After all we're all still people. But clearly the world doesn't think the same as I do.
