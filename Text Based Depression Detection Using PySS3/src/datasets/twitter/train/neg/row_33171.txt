Logically suicidal.I don't understand why everyone seems to think life is inherently valuable? I'm relatively young but I've already had a life time of experience, and now I'd like to die. There's nothing left here that I still want to experience. Given the choice between a lifetime of happiness, and dying and therefore not having to live, I'd chose death every time. Death to me is like this beautiful promise of peace, this relief from having to live. Life offers me nothing, death offers me a lot.
