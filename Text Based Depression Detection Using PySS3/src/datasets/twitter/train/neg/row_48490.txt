I kinda just want to also feel good sometimes, ya' know...I'm sick of only living in the range of almost killing myself and being barely functional, emotionally.

I'm sick of hating everyone.

I'm sick of being envious of people that have something/someone that makes them feel good.

I'm sick of not ever feeling safe when I'm not sleeping.

I'm sick of feeling so fucking lonely, even though there are groups that would take me in, had I wanted to.

I'm sick of not doing anything all day.

I'm sick of not enjoying anything.

I'm sick of the pain.

I'm sick of running away from the pain.

I'm sick of going to sleep after 6AM, missing most of the day.

I'm sick of not trusting anyone.

I'm sick of being too scared to touch anyone, even my girlfriend. If you could even call her that at this point.

I'm sick of not having anyone to touch and to touch me.

I'm sick of people that are clingy.

I'm sick of people that are distant.

I'm sick of being distant, yet clingy.

I'm sick of my life being so lame.

I'm sick of feeling frustrated all the time.

I'm sick of being sick of all of these things.

I'm sick of being sick.

I'm sick.
