I hate who I am.I put this is [/r/depression](http://www.reddit.com/r/depression) but I think it also belongs here. If not, sorry for this. I just can't stand it any more.

I hate being me. I hate being more concerned about myself than others. I hate that my parents are in their mid 70s and early 80s and I don't want to talk to them when the only thing they want to do is talk to their son. I hate that I don't feel anything for anyone. I hate that I'm married to a wonderful woman and I don't feel anything even for her. I hate that I feel selfish even writing about this. I hate always being disappointed in myself. I just hate being me and I don't want to keep feeling this way any more. It hurts too fucking much and no one understands how much I wish it would just stop. I wish my parents and wife would forget about me so I could finally stop hurting like I do.
