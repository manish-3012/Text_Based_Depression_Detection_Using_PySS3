Today is my cake day. Thank you to the kind people of /r/SuicideWatch.Over a year ago I joined Reddit and came to /r/SuicideWatch to seek help. I'm still struggling and there's many nights where I want to end it all. I've kept in touch with some of those I met on the subReddit and I cannot tell you how thankful I am for their friendship and kindness.

Thank you all for making a place where lost people can come and find help and a comforting word. Without you, I would not be celebrating my cake day.
