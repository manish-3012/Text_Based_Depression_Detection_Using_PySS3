Knowing that sometimes even love can't save a person scares me to my bones.I get this frequently and I hate how helpless I feel. I feel like there is no way you can tell what someone is thinking about if they choose not to show you. People I love, what of they chose not to show, not to tell? What am I supposed to do then?
