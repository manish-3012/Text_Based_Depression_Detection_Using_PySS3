getting suicidal triggers. scaredSo I started having serious suicidal thoughts today, which is a new twist that should not occur since I am on my meds and taking care of myself. Stayed in bed until 6 PM today. Have had this depression crap for a long time now but this is the first time I've actually gone so far as looking up what would happen if I took an overdose of my anti-anxiety stuff and mixed with alcohol, and started thinking how relieving it would be to just never have to work again, never have to deal with all this crap I'm going to have to deal with. All of a sudden it's a possibility.

Also have gotten impulses I haven't had before, to stop myself from thinking - bashing my head against the table, actually started hitting myself in the head this morning(I feel insane just typing it) until I managed to hold back. I've never cut myself, or starved myself seriously, or had any serious suicidal tendencies even in the worst throes of depression, but this week it's gone over the line. I'm scared.
