Hello ThereI have one question.

What's the fucking point? Life means suffering. The longer you exist, the more you suffer. I did not ask to be born into this sick fucking world.

I honestly can't wait to die. I'm not suicidal btw. Too much of a pussy to actually follow through lol.

I just hope that I don't have to spend much more time on this fucking planet.

That is all.
