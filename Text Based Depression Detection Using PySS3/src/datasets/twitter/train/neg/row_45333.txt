I don't see how I ever could be happy; I'm afraid of everything.I don't even know what I'm supposed to say here. I guess that I actually might be well off if it weren't for my extreme fright of social situations of any sort. Which doesn't exactly help my self-esteem either, though I'm quite aware that happiness can hardly be quantified.

Either way I'm not sure I belong in this subreddit - I'm pretty certain I don't have the guts to kill myself, even if I wanted to. But basically I just can't see myself getting over my social anxiety. It's pretty much what prevented me from doing whatever I wanted to do since I can remember, and I can't see it getting any better any time soon. 

Neither can I see myself ever getting happy before I'll kill myself, either just like that or slowly via drinking myself to death. I'm tired of it and I would rather die right now if I just had the balls to.

Knowing and seeing how much life has to offer while realizing that I'll never get to experience any of it is killing me. Or, I'd rather it'd kill me. I have a plan as for what I'll do to barely hang in there, but I'm not sure I'll make it, or even want to make it. Please help me out somehow. Right now I wish I were dead, even if I can't kill myself and just hurt my body instead. Even just posting this I feel stupid and shallow...
