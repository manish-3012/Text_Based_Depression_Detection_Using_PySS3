What the fuck is the point?I'm 17, no job, no friends, high school dropout. I just stay in bed all day and feel like shit. I'm too depressed to actually get up and try fix this, but it hurts too much to keep going. Maybe life just isn't for some people, idk. I'm scared but I really don't know what else to do at this point.
