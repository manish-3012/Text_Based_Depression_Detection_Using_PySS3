I am uselessI cant stand myself. I am a horrible human.
I love my fiance he can do so much better, such a sweet kind man and I am a miserable bitch.
I have no friends or family i never let people get to know me and now for years Ive no one to talk to. 
Everything in my life ive taken too far, addictions rule my brain i quit pot, drinking, and facebook all in one month. I hurt myself at a job i only held for two weeks and now i am alone at home all over again. 
How can i do this to him he is so amazing i want to go so he can have a nice beautiful life without me. 
I miscarried in 2017 and broke up with him and we got back and i feel so so bad all the things ive done wrong since too. 
Im scared we are codependant, i love him i want him to have such a good life. 
Hospital thought i was faking last attempt so i cant go there, no matter theres no money for anything. 
I want to walk into the woods and lay down to die it would be a good punishment for ecerythibg ive done. 
I am so fucked up I cant help me I cant do it. I have done nothing with my life i am 27 with grade 9 education, no car, no control over my emotions. Ive hit him he doesnt deserve it he gave me chances and why am i such a nasty human

I fantasize about death everyday for nearly a decade I know i wont have a good life why did i get involved with him he is too good. If i die i will hurt him, if i stay alive he is hurt too

I am so trapped, the woods and death are my only plan I want to die so bad
