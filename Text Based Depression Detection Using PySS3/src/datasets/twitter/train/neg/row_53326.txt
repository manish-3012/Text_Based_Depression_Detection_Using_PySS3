Life is ruined and tomorrow will clarify thatI got no job im on benefits i got poor qualifications my social skills are abysmal i get nervous talking to anyone and the other person always recognises that.

 if i dont get thrown a bone tomorrow then its over it has to be but then again fo i want to go back to school(college)? Then again do i deserve it? If something was to happen surely it would of happened by now? (Im 26 living in the UK. Been out of school since 16 and only gained one qualification in it and at a standard where everyone leaving school will need to be at that level as a mandatory thing, so thats the career gone) From january the 12th this year I've locked myself in a room playing a particular computer game estranging what friends i had theres one friend ive got left but we dont even seem close. 

My family reminds me of how much ive failed regularly and its true i have and being haunted after a particular circumstance really makes a person loose faith in people life morales that a person stands for, what makes them who they are, mutual respect for yourself ie. Appearence its no wonder i have thoughts every few hours of wanting to die practising tying nooses etc

Theres no immediate danger atm but after tomorrow can imagine there soon will be
