Life isn't going my way right now.Hey guys this is my first time posting here I lurked here for a while reading stuff and taking bits and pieces of what I read but my situation just keeps on getting worse and I'm getting closer to eating a bullet.
Basically this all started in my first year of high school when I got in to a school that wasn't that great (I could of gone to a much better school but was misinformed about the school and was lead on to believe it was a perfect fit for me, I had pretty good grades)and instantly hated it everyday was dreadful but I managed to weasel my way back into my middle schools 9th grade program which was only 1 class big and most of the kids were a bit on the slower side this was also not that great and it made me feel disconnected with my peers since no one had the same interests as me being an honors student with esl students most of them barley spoke English , but to make things worst they changed the program about the second month in and stop offering the regents(a New York standardized test that you take at the end of the year to move on to the next course) Which just made things worse on top of the grade size of 1 class now it would delay my courses by one year. After many visits with the board of education I finally got transferred to an academic high school... My zoned high school i happen to live in one of the worst neighborhood in New York and the school was one of the most violent and gang filled schools in the 90's but I went non the less and sucked it up in there honors pre-med program yea i got bullied pretty badly but I still had to go I wanted to improve my life so badly. At the end of the year I finished with an average in the 90's but now were catching up to my current situation , From the get go my mom told me to transfer out of that school asap and I was thinking the same thing so I followed her advice researched all the schools that were close enough to me that it wouldn't be a burden on me to get there and that they were good schools so I put down my current high school as my first option every one recommended it to me and said its a great school, since this is getting quite long and I'm running out of time I'll cut to the chase I hate the school,I hate my peers, I don't feel safe at the school,I hate the teachers,I hate the classes and I have given up I gave the school a shot and ive just plain quit I haven't gone in about 4 months yes I know its fucking stupid but I couldn't put up with it anymore, I've jeopardized my chance at college .For the last 4 months my mother and grandfather have been emotionally abusive, my mother is some times physically abusive,my few friends don't really care about me and have moved on and I hate my self I regret so many decisions and want to end it all,Some of the shit my mom has told me has really rocked me to my core I.e that I should of been aborted and I'm a failure she really doesn't care about me and says shes gonna kick me out every day.At this point I just feel like ending it all I don't really care about anything anymore my goal of going to a good college is shot no one cares for me my own mother has told me to kill my self and to top it all off most of my friends have abandoned me and the few that I do have will probably follow suit if I tell them my situation... If theirs anything you would like me to elaborate on just ask in the comments.

P.S I have sought professional help in the form of a therapist but honestly it doesn't help all of this is stemming from my school situation and I just wish it would change but my mother is making no effort towards that and the department of education only sees my as a small statistic and according who I do not know is lying or not they plan to put me in a worse school that children that get out of prison go to.Also sorry for any grammar mistakes I'm quite distraught and cant really do anything right now.
