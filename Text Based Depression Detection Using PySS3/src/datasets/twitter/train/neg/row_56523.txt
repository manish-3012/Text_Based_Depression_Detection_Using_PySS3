Sometimes it seems like too muchSometimes I can take the punches and come back up (metaphorical punches -- nobody's really beating me up) and everything's fine and I keep moving.

Other times, I get punched (or, I'm not gonna lie -- sometimes I just get nudged) and I completely fall apart, and start spinning out -- when that happens, I feel so scared and lost and out of control and ashamed for not being able to manage, and for wanting somebody to help tamp it all down, to help me contain the implosion -- because, see, I'm supposed to have a distress tolerance kit, I'm supposed to be doing things to help regulate my emotions (regular sleep, nutrition, exercise, self-care) and if I don't do those things myself, I don't deserve anybody's help.

I just 'fired' my counselor. It wasn't a firing, really, but she and I don't work well together. It's just not a good fit, you know? I'm not mad at her or hurt or anything. Disappointed because I couldn't make it work, I guess, but that's about the extent of the negative feelings.

But, see, because I failed to submit an application for the job I wanted, which would have brought me stable employment (and I likely would have gotten the job even though over 300 people applied for it), I will be losing my medical coverage in 8 weeks. Which means, whether or not I have time to actually find a new counselor, I'd have to stop seeing them until, like, August of 2021 (assuming I get the job next year, which is a big assumption -- there might not even be an opening next year). So I'm looking at over a year of being without mental health support (save my meds, which my GP will prescribe for me to renew for a year if I ask him -- save for the Adderall, which... I don't know. I'll have to figure that one out), and I'm already in crisis. I don't know how I'm going to make it.

I'm scared to do this by myself.
