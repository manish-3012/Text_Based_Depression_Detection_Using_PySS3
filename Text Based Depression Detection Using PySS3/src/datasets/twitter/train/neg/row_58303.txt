I need help but...I'm too afraid to tell my therapist what's wrong with me.  I need to tell because it's driving me to suicide but I haven't been able to bring myself to tell.  My problems are a mixture of things that are real, things that are imagined, things I'm not sure are real, thoughts that torment me daily and lies. I am so guilty I have lied to the one person who has ever taken me seriously and helped me that I want to end my life. I feel part of my problem is I have munchausen syndrome. (Sorry i can't spell) I also have real mental problems too. 
And I can't admit it to my therapist and its making me more and more guilty and I have a plan to kill myself and I want to confess to my therapist but I feel my therapist will be hurt and angry. Even though I have thoughts and a plan to kill myself I won't act on them. I'm afraid my therapist will not believe the true things I have told after they find out. This is tearing me apart and I feel guilty everyday and I'm in nearly constant mental torment and I hate myself.
I know I don't deserve help but I NEED IT.
I NEED IT AND THIS GUILT IS KILLING ME.
