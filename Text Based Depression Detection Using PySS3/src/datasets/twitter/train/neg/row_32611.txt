Why should we liveI always thought and still think life has no meaning, the only meaning it has is the meaning we give to it. And since that day i am trying to find my reason to live. And I just don't know why why should I do it being alive, I am only happy 10% of the time is it worth to life 90%of you're life just to be happy the 10%. I always wanted to help society that is the reason i have not yet killed myself, I am just a student so me dying know will be a net loss for my country and humanity. So my plan now is to join the military finish my education begin officer training and hope i will be shot on a mission. I hope that will give me fulfilling and give me rest, but every night I lay in bed and think why, why should I be alive.
