I'm surrounded by hunky football players that have crushed puss daily since 9th gradeAnd women who sexually liberate themselves, wearing revealing clothing to attract guys but of course the guys they choose are the dumb football players. I'm not interested in football or skipping class to smoke weed in the cafeteria bathroom. I'm not interested in anything anymore. I was interested in literature and history but the world of academia seems absolutely brutal and no one will ever care about my work on some obscure later-era Roman orator. And I could just get an MBA like the football players and their girlfriends and get a 70k starting salary and take a year long leave to travel across the nicer, touristy parts of the world, seeing the poverty and like really be changed, man, really have my eyes opened, dude,  and maybe become a buddhist and do service trips and marry my college sweetheart who has only blossomed further with age and also makes 80k a year so we can afford to live in a nice-ass house like normal liberal people. But if I do that I'll be on the same level as them - and my high school years of not finding success with women and with no friends and not going to single party or ever doing drugs and working my ass off in high school will be for nothing because these morons didn't work hard at all in high school and just had a great time fucking each other and they have the same income and lifestyle as me. 

There's no point in this shit. I'll end up doing neither thing. I'll just get nowhere. I'll just die soon.
