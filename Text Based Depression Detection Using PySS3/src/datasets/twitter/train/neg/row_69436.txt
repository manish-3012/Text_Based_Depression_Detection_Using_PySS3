triggered by fight w dadI'm 20 and moved back in w my parents bc of covid. Got in a fight w my dad about him wearing a mask (he made a comment like he wouldn't) and he threatened me saying I don't pay rent or anything. I've offered to multiple times even though I'm not working. (I could afford it for a few months and get a job, then move out. The only advantage to living here is no rent,I just clean up stuff because they're slobs.). I would have a job, just my parents don't want me to work while I'm in school. So I dont but now they belittle me for it. Anyways now my mom wants me to apologize for calling them science deniers and I just told them if the shoe fits .... Anyways. This has triggered me so bad. I just want to go to sleep and never wake up. I want to do it so bad and I'd been doing fine. It's just not worth it to live in this corporate hellscape and be worked like a dog for my entire life. I've just been fantasizing about writing a note and then letting them find my body with a note telling them how much they have fucked me up. There's just so much I can't get into. Anyways. I just needed a place to vent.
