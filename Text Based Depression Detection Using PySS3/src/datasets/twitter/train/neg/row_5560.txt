Suicidal facebook post - What should you do?A classmate of my niece (14 yr old girl), posted a suicidal message on her facebook page last night.  I didn't know the girl and had no idea if she's a drama queen or serious, but I was concerned enough that I called the non-emergency police # and had them do a wellness check on her.  And my sister in law contacted the school guidance counselor with the post so they could follow-up with her at school today.  Thankfully she's okay, at least for now.  

Did I overreact?  What would you do?

Here's an small portion of her post:
&gt; i don't think anyone knows how i feel i feel like im alone in the world i feel like theres nothing to live for im pathetic .....no matter how much i cry no matter how much i try to keep my mind in a happy place it all gets ruined i feel like i shouldnt keep on living.. &lt;
