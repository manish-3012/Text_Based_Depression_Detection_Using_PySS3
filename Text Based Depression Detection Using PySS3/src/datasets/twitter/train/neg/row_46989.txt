Nothing to live forIm literally so close to just finally giving up completely and ending it all. I'm a 22 year old male who happens to be very unattractive due to many things, mostly my teeth which I grinded a lot as a kid and never took good care of in general till it was too late. I refuse to even bother dating because I find myself so incredibly unattractive and unlikeable that there's nobody that will ever love me that also meets my standards, which unfortunately are quite high due to an overexposure of girls on social media and an addiction to porn. Any time I look in a mirror I cry inside and wish to look different. Also my life in general is just bad. I have no friends, no job, no money, nothing. I literally have become so pissed off at life seeing other people happy makes me hate them and wish they'd suffer. I used to be a kind person but I can't be anymore when life has continued to beat me down again and again. Im probably gonna do a fuck ton of cocaine and alcohol soon and hopefully it kills me because Im tired of this fucking life.
