Iâ€™m emotionally dependent on othersIâ€™m sorry itâ€™s so long. Itâ€™s just important to me. 

Itâ€™s hard for me to admit since I put on a huge facade of strong independent woman whatever. 

I started dating when I was 15. Iâ€™m 20 now. Iâ€™ve never been single for more than a month. With every breakup I quickly had a rebound to fill the hole in my heart. 

Iâ€™ve probably been in 5 serious relationships since then. The longest being one year. The current one being 8 months though itâ€™s over now. 

I always excused it as, â€œI donâ€™t look for relationships, they just happenâ€ when actually I definitely start putting more effort in pursuing someone once Iâ€™m single. 

I didnâ€™t break up with someone for a year because I was very comfortable just having emotional support from someone. 

I donâ€™t know if I do this because being broken up with hurts a lot and I want to numb the pain by having someone else give me attention 

Or itâ€™s something deeper where maybe my self esteem sucks and I donâ€™t love myself so I need someone elseâ€™s love 

I forget how much it hurts every time and Iâ€™m trying to not throw myself into another relationship again because for years itâ€™s all Iâ€™ve been living for
