I lost my soul mate in April.I lost my best friend, soul mate and husband of 12 years to suicide in April. Together 14 years, most everyday. I am so devestated. He was my everything! It was a muzzeloader in our bathroom I am laying 12 feet from. This sucks so much. Not sure how to go on? I am trying? I am so lonely. ðŸ˜”
