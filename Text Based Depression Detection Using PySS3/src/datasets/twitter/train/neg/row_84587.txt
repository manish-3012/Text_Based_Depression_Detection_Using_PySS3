Surviving 3 attempts has left me emptyMy last attempt was 4~ years ago now, I downed about 4000mg of quetiapine (Quetapel, seroquel).

My daily dosage was 500mg a night and I was only ever allowed to have a weeks supply given my history, thinking about it now, I kind of wish I had tried to hide an extra weeks worth.

At the time I'd just been made homeless, no friends, no family to stay with, no job to support myself.

I took my benefit payment out in cash, gave out small sums to some homeless people in Auckland central, I gave a $20 to a violinist but I made her take it from my hand.

She glared at me and at the time I didn't understand why, maybe she thought I was paying her to stop, or maybe she was just annoyed that she had to stop... I just wanted some positive human contact before I left.

Unfortunately I ended up in hospital in excruciating agony, hallucinating, heart trying to scream its way out of my chest, and once I woke up I could barely move.

Since then my suicidal thoughts haven't gone away... I want to die.

I just don't have it in me to fail a 4th time, I can barely muster the effort to feed and bathe myself regularly, I couldn't take waking up  in a hospital bed again.

I try my best to enjoy things like I used to, I've even taken up guitar lessons because I've wanted to learn for the longest time, but I still feel this insatiable need to not think anymore.

I just want this expanding feeling of emptiness and resentment towards myself to go away, even if I have to go down with the ship.
