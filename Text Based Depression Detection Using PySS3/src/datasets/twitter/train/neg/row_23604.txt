I just want outWhat the title says, honestly.

I wouldnâ€™t call my household abusive, but I donâ€™t want to live here. Iâ€™ve made it to 17 not telling anyone around me about how suicidal I am and stuff, but I have anxiety attacks over the smallest of things- but I just recently had my first good cry in years over a fight with my parents (one of many, this one just hit harder for some reason) and suicide just seems like my only way out.

Its just a constant cycle of.. everything- and if I have to live through one more fucking day of it I swear to god I will snap and kill everyone around me and then myself. The only thing stopping me is an available method, which is probably just whatever higher powerâ€™s way of adding to whatever hell has been created for me.

I promised myself Iâ€™d kill myself once I reached 18, but one year couldnâ€™t hurt. Iâ€™m sure Iâ€™ll find some way to die, we are nothing if not mortal, after all.
