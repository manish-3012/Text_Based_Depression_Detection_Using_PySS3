Uncontrollable bulimia, wrist slitting, stomach carving, and insomnia. I see no reason to stay.I just relapsed into bulimia again after battling it over the summer  (in which I vomited at least three times a day), and now it's back in full swing and I can't focus unless I throw up. I've been self harming for years now, but I no longer derive pleasure from it. I used to carve shapes and symbols into my flesh so at least the scars would be cool, but I've broken down and lost the willpower to do that. Now I just slit my wrists and stab and hack at random pieces of flesh. To top it all off, I go many nights without sleeping, and many days wishing I had slept more.

I have no friends and I'm too tired to continue living. Self destruction consumes almost all of my energy, and what I have remaining is controlled by bitterness and impatience. I want to begin speaking to people and forming relationships, but I'm tired. Not even sleep tired (although there is plenty of that), I'm just exhausted from trying so hard just to stay alive. I was going to wait until after Halloween to kill myself, but I just don't care about anything any more. I can't heal myself, and I don't think I should even bother trying.
