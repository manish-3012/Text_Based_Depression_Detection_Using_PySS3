Im completely lost at this pointHi, Im 27 married to a trans woman who just started HRT when our baby girl was born 3 months ago. We recently were able to pay our cars off because of her inheritance from her grandmother which was a huge financial relief and I moved away from my toxic family 2 years back. 

And I feel like I SHOULD be happy but Iâ€™m not? 

I donâ€™t know what to do at this point. Im taking 40mg of Prozac and recently tried Wellbutrin and it completely broke me down mentally. I was on it for 2 weeks and had constant headaches and always cried from it. I stopped taking it 2 weeks ago and it definitely helped. But for some reason every time I get sad I get more sad than I was before. 

My parents were really abusive growing up and Iâ€™m the oldest of 5 kids. Its affected my life terribly and I have severe ADHD (they wont treat me anymore) OCD and severe depression. 

I honestly donâ€™t understand the point of living anymore. Anything â€œnegative and jokingâ€ my spouse says about herself or anything affects me so much. She makes rude comments about us not having sex anymore (due to my depression and having a baby) as if itâ€™s something wrong with her or her body when in reality its only about me and my insecurities. I ask her to stop and she does for a while until she feels depressed about not being able to be out about her true self. 

And my Lucy. I love her more than I can explain but I feel completely worthless for her. 

Iâ€™m a bartender with almost a 2 year degree and no definite career choice. My spouse is a general manager at Dominos and makes good money. But for me it seems like Iâ€™m bot enough in so many ways for them. Everything just keeps getting harder and harder and I donâ€™t know what to do or try anymore. Therapy doesnâ€™t help me honestly not deep down. And normally talking to people doesnâ€™t help either.
