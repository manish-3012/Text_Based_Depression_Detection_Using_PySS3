Jesus Christ Iâ€™m a failure (Rant)Iâ€™m currently failing my classes, of which are so easy, but I just canâ€™t put the effort in, Iâ€™m too tired all the time but can never sleep. I failed at killing myself, like how the fuck can I manage to fuck up killing myself? Iâ€™m so damn pathetic, I make fake conversations in my head, and then think my friends hate me cause of said conversations. I then proceed to isolate myself, then I get super hyper out of no where and mad and hate my friends and stop isolating myself and argue and antagonize them beyond belief, then I go back to being depressed 24/7 and apologize, lose some friends cause their tired of my shit, rinse and repeat. Add in self harm, hallucinations and insomnia, then you got the prefect combination for me wanting to kill myself. Next time Iâ€™ll be successful, overdosing wasnâ€™t good enough. Sorry for ranting.
