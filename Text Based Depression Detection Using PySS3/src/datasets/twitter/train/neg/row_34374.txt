Can anyone relate?This thought just popped up in my head while riding the bus home.
Does anybody else perceive non-suicidal people as abnormal? Of course that's not the case, the statistics speak for themselves, but still to me it's just like I stated above. 
After ongoing years of suicidal thoughts and depression that eventually turned into numbness, it's just so alienating knowing that a lot of people enjoy being alive even though to me it's just pure hell. 
There is not one day I wouldn't wish that I was dead.
