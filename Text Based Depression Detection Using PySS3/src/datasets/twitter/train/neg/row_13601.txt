What happens if I fail to die after my overdose?I'm planning on taking 750mg of clomipramine, 280mg of citalopram and 175mg of amitriptyline. I could probably take triple the dose of clomipramine. But idk... These TCAs are so fucking useless.

I just want to OD. I want to feel that feeling I got the last I took too much of amitriptyline. I want to kill myself too but I'm scared. I'm not sure. I don't want to live. I want it to be guaranteed that I'll die. If I survive it'll be the worst fucking thing ever. Especially if I damage my insides.

Tell me... What will happen if I take these amounts? Will I die? Will I survive and have a failed kidney or liver or some shit?
