I want to kill myself in about a month, but I feel guilty because my life's not bad enough.I know it's stupid to want that. Especially because there's probably an afterlife, so it won't change much.

I just want to not exist. I know  i don't have it bad enough to want this, but i do.

i want to not exist now.
