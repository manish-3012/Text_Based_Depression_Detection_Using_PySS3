I kinda feel like there's a war against men or somethingIt makes me wanna die and I feel like as a guy my feelings don't matter at all. Maybe I should just go do it because it's obvious my feelings don't matter and no one is actually gonna try to be understanding. I have a gun and a knife and if I wanted to I could poison myself.
