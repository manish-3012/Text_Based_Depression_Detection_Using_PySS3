Not much time left, I feel.I hate you all.

Life is unfair and stupid.

I donâ€™t fit in anywhere.

Iâ€™m a freak. No friends. No family. Alone.

I can feel it,

It will be time soon and I will be free, amongst the stars and the universe, and hopefully with my dead cat who I miss dearly.

Seriously, fuck this place.
