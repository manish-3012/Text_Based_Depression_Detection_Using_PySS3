iâ€™m losti just donâ€™t know what to fucking do anymore, i want to end it all for good but the only 2 things stopping me are my dad and my religion, i would just feel too guilty to do it, even though my dad made my mental health worse with divorce and borderline child labor and constant arguing, i still love him to death, ive been thinking of running away too but iâ€™m waiting for my breaking point, my mental health has been fluctuating, iâ€™ve starved myself, i over-ate, i didnâ€™t shower for days and weeks multiple times because i have no motivation, my room has been extremely fucking gross, and half of my family is gone because of this divorce. i do not know what to do. this all started in 2018 but 2020 has been the worst year of my life. iâ€™m genuinely so tired.

i donâ€™t know where to mention this but iâ€™m a 16 y/o male for anyone that wants to ask
