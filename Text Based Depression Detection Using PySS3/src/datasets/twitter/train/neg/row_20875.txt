I'm ready to die. 

I've made up my mind. I'm sick of never knowing when the blackouts are coming. I'm sick of seeing everyone dead when I close my eyes. I'm sick of the voices telling me I'm worthless. I'm sick of cops screaming and hitting me when I ask for help. I'm sick of doctors and therapists that won't do anything to help me. I'm sick of my family telling me to just stop being a pussy. I'm sick of being sick. I'm sick of being in pain.

If I'm not allowed to get better, I'm just going to kill myself. I don't want your bullshit about how it gets better, it doesn't. It doesn't get better, I've been waiting, I've given it time. I've asked for help in every where I know how. I call the numbers, I text the lines, I go to the hospital, all just to be patronized and walked on. There is no help available, it's just a lie that the upper class tells to make themselves feel better. Mental health treatment is nothing but ridicule and bills no one can pay. My family won't miss me, they've told me how much of a burden I am. I have no friends to miss me, because all I'm permitted to do in life is work.

My life isn't my own anyway, this is the only way I can take it back.
