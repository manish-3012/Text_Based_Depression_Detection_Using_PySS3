I hate waking up everyday and realising I'm still here... I just want it to be over with...I've been dealing with mental health issues for a while as it is and have considered suicide numerous times in the past, but I'm getting so fucking close to doing it this year... nothing is going right.

Two of my best friends have passed away, I'm stuck all alone in my residence due to COVID and tomorrow I'm having my beloved dog put down... the only thing keeping me fucking sane throughout all of this horseshit...

What's the point in continuing if life wants nothing more than to throw bullshit your way constantly...? I just want it to finally stop... I can't deal with this anymore...
