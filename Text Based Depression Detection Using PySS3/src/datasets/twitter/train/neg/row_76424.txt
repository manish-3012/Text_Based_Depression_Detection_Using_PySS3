It's simply better if I just go.I don't think talking about this will help at all. My life has been a huge waste tbh. I'm tired of doing what's expected of me. I'm tired of pleasing other people. I'm not normal, I'm not smart, and I'm not ready to go out into the real world. And my so called family just sucks. I never had a place in this world. I never knew what I was doing. I just did what I did know. I don't have anyone worthwhile left. I'm just tired...of everything. I can't talk with anyone either cause they wouldn't understand me.
