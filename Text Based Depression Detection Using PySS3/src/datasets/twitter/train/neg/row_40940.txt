I donâ€™t know what to doI feel like iâ€™m lost. My life is a mess and suicide thoughts have come to mind too many times. 

I canâ€™t deal with family.
Failed to go to university.
I have a job with some future but i feel like Itâ€™s way too stressful and i donâ€™t like doing it. (Not easy to find a job like this here)(Robotic programmer)
Im 21 never dated anyone, used to be really fat, i started going to the gym and lost tons of weight now im fit but Im too shy to do anything. 
My bestfriend started dating and i feel like he doesnt have time for me.
A girl i actually liked aproached me but i messed up completely and now she might be dating someone and itâ€™s killing me from the inside. (I see her everyday) 
Donâ€™t really have many friends too.

I know itâ€™s not the worst of lives, but i didnt have day where i felt truly happy since i caught my mother with another man (8 years ago)

Iâ€™ve tried to keep the hopes high for the next day but this has been to much for me.

I used to think that life was made out of highs and lows and if you got way to low you would get way higher next. But i feel like this is totally wrong now it has been too many years.
