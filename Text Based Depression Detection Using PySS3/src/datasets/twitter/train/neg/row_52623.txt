It hurts so much as though my heart is being torn apartI keep coming here but I donâ€™t know why. Maybe writing it out makes me feel better but I just donâ€™t know what to do afterward.

Today it just kept building up. We were suppose to discuss answers but I sit alone so they asked me to discuss it with this girl. I had hurt her in the past because I was arrogant, selfish and quick-tempered. I couldnâ€™t talk to her. It hurt too much. The counselor had talked to her in the past and guess what? Sheâ€™s scared of me. She has nightmares about me. I kept saying I didnâ€™t want to but she just kept asking me. It hurt so much.

It just kept building up for the rest of the day. I just wanted to apologise to everyone. Tell them that Iâ€™m on medication and that Iâ€™ll be a better person. That Iâ€™m sorry for everything. But I know itâ€™ll just make them feel uncomfortable and itâ€™ll cause more problems. The right thing to do is to respect that decision and not affect their happiness but it hurts. I just want another chance. And the more I try to suppress this feeling, the more it hurts.

I couldnâ€™t take it so after one of my classes, I just locked myself in the toilet and started crying. The teachers took me to the office and Iâ€™m just waiting for the counselor. It hurts hoping that things will get better and Iâ€™m not sure that Iâ€™m strong enough.
