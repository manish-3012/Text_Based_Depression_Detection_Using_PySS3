Want my future, still want to kill myself nowI donâ€™t want to die. I have a lot to live for and things to be excited about. But those are years away. When I think about getting through the next week, the only goal I can visualize is bleeding out in the shower. Is there anything I can do to make this knee jerk suicidal spiral to stop?
