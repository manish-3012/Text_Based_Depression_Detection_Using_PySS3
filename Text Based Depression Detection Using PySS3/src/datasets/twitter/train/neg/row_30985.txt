So I made a bad decision and canâ€™t afford therapy(long)Hey, Iâ€™m here because honestly for the first time in my life I donâ€™t know what the fuck to do and my thoughts are becoming terrifying. You can find it in my previous posts Iâ€™m pretty sure but I went on a three-day DXM binge and posted about my trip on the last day yesterday. On the third day I found out my dad had lung cancer and proceeded to drop that night and following I either had a terrible 4th plateau trip with hints of a sigma or a terrible 4th plateau trip with a self-induced near psychotic break because I wasnâ€™t able to process what I found out and what was going to happen to my dad at the time since I was afterglowing and I oddly began to in the beginning of the trip that night. Itâ€™s been almost three weeks now and I still panic and shake when I think about moments in my trip and I have a hard time staying in the same room as my dad for a long period of time. Iâ€™m still horribly dissociated and my depression and mania are horrible. I canâ€™t even remember much of anything that happened this year besides finding out about my dad after that night.

I eventually told my mom because the whole dilated pupils thing ya know and it wasnâ€™t the best time for her to suspect I was on actual hard drugs, but mostly because I couldnâ€™t get the thoughts of my dad and vivid CEVâ€™s of him dying out of my head and I wanted it to stop. She wasnâ€™t mad she just said not to do it again and that she doesnâ€™t want to have to worry about me too but she really understand how bad it really is and how the trip went, even after telling her bits of what I saw and what I can still perfectly imagine. Iâ€™m afraid to tell her now how Iâ€™ve been processing it because she doesnâ€™t have the mental fortitude at the moment and she has a hard time understanding. 

My intrusive thoughts have become almost constant and I just have constant scenes of various methods of me dying playing in my head but I donâ€™t feel the urges to kill myself, I just have this constant feeling now that Iâ€™m watching myself through a camera instead and just feel void of any emotion whenever Im not having a dissociative episode of me thinking about my dad or trying to remember my trip. It definitely doesnâ€™t help either that I quit my job in the beginning of the year because for the first time in my life I was getting panic attacks and it was mentally taxing, and now my mom is refusing that I get a new job because she wants me to be there to take my dad to treatment appointments so all I can do at home all day is just sit in my room staring at the ceiling going in between bad thought loops and dissociative episodes. I want to be there for him I really do, like I said in my trip report I wrote, last year LSD taught me that my dad is pillar in my life even though he doesnâ€™t know it. But...itâ€™s almost unbearable seeing him in the condition he is in now. He is a strong hard-working man and now he can already barely talk or do much moving around or else he feels like heâ€™s going to pass out. I genuinely feel like this is going to kill me before it kills my dad. I just want this all to end, I want to feel like me again.

Iâ€™m sorry but I just need to talk about this and just get all this shit out. I donâ€™t have many friends to talk to but the ones I do have are all people that have had plenty of bad experiences with LSD, K, and DMT etc etc but again they donâ€™t know or understand how bad it really is and I donâ€™t want to freak them out or overshare. Thanks for reading and sorry if itâ€™s hard to understand but just mentioning the trip still makes me panic. Not even sure if this is the right subreddit for this but Iâ€™m getting desperate..
