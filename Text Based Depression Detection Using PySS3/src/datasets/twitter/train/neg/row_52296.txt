Had the best month of my life...still think about suicide constantly, now what?This entire summer has been pretty great I have a new job that it is satisfying and pays me well I have a solid group of friends around me and the first relationship in my life that didnt feel toxic but depression still hits me so hard most days and I don't know how life could possibly get better. Ive done everything i could to improve my mental health and I still genuinely don't want to live. 

I don't know what to do anymore.
