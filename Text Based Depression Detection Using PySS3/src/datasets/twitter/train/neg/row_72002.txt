I'm starting to feel mentally-ill and I'm tricking everyone. My whole life is a huge huge lie. I come across everyday as a stoic yet funny guy but whenever I am alone I just want to scream. Everyone thinks I am straight, but I am gay and I hate myself for it. I am the one sitting in the back of the room who always answers the question correctly or always knows the solution to a problem someone is having. But I everyday I try to destroy myself and become someone else who isn't me. My public persona is just an amalgam of 10 or 11 personalities from people I've liked or television characters I admire. No one has seen the real me in years.

I've been to through two rounds of psychotherapy with different therapists and it is complete bullshit. They just trick me into saying things that I don't believe just because "they make sense". Well, I'm as logical and rational as the next person, but just because I know certain things make sense doesn't mean that I can stop feeling emotions that say otherwise.

I'm 19 now. No one will give me a job. Everyone at college seems to adore me and think I'm hilarious or smart. But I actually just suck. I pretend that I know what I'm saying by saying it in a matter of fact way. I'm studying an artistic field, there is absolutely no way I'm going to succeed, I don't have an artistic bone in my body. I'm never inspired, I can't think visually, I just am setting myself up for failure as all my extremely talented friends glide past me without even know I've been left behind. I'm the guy no one ever asks "Is he going to be OK?" because I always am. They're going to keep thinking that until the time I decide to do something drastic.

I've fallen in love with my straight best friend. He's my best friend anyway, I'm sure I'm way down the list for him in terms of people he likes. I'd do anything to help him. Anything. He doesn't treat me with much kindness. I don't think I could ever talk to him about anything emotional. Our friendship revolves solely around our similar sense of humor. Every time I leave him, or I catch him in a white lie to get out of being around me, I cry and I fall immediately into depression. Partly because he's the only thing that makes me happy. Partly because I know he will never love me like I love him. Partly because I feel so alone sometimes and I know he is just leaving me to spend with people who he likes more, who are actually fun and don't just sit silently, quietly.

I can't convince myself to get away from him. He's the only thing that makes me happy. I've never felt love this strong before for anything. He fills my every waking thought. If something were to happen between us that we couldn't speak anymore, I really don't know what I would do. In my head, it makes sense to find something or someone else who truly makes me happy, but the way I feel right now makes it feel as if only he will bring me happiness. Even just being friends, even just riding the roller coaster of joy and depression is better than the alternatives. Escaping seems impossible besides suicide and I don't want to do that because happiness seem attainable, but it's possible for me to lose hope altogether.
