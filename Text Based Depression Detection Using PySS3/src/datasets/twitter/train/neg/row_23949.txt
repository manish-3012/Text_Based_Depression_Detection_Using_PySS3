EmptyI've been feeling really fucked up lately. No one has noticed though. Makes me wonder if any would notice if I disappeared. 
My depression keeps washing over me like a tidal wave of numbness. Nothing seems like its worth it anymore. Nothing is worth it anymore. I keep feeling more and more motivated to kill myself than not. I guess in one way the meds are working. 
But why does that matter
No one in my life believes that I'm not okay. They think I'll just snap out of it like it's a phase or something. I want to just end things. I dont want to be here anymore. It hurts too much. I dont want to be here. I just dont.
