I just have to accept the factsMy whole childhood I was told that I'm going to grow up to be nothing but a worthless piece of shit...I believed it for a while truer to kill myself then I though maybe they are wrong.g maybe I can prove them wrong I graduated high-school moved out when I was 17 and went right into college...couldn't pay for college had to drop out of that I'm now 20 work full time and am married to an amazing woman...but you all dont need to know my life story...just that everyone benefits in my life if I'm dead...iv truer talking about things that upset me but everyone tells me its my fault for feeling like that...for a month now iv been trying to think of one just one reason I have to keep living and I have not a single one...I needed someone to know for when I do kill myself...I'm sorry for any errors and how its on a block I'm on my cell and this is my first(and probably last post) thanks reddit you kept me occupied
