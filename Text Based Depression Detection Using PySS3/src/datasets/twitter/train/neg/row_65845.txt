Missed OpportunityLast year around this time I was presented with the perfect opportunity to kill myself. I really wanted to take it and I almost did, but before I could do any real damage I felt better and backed out of it. I walked back home but everything started coming back and by the time I was home I felt as horribly suicidal as when I left. I realized I didnâ€™t actually feel better about living, I just felt relieved because in that moment I was genuinely convinced I would be dead soon and would never have to deal with anything ever again. At that point I was too drained and exhausted to do anything but wallow on my floor the rest of the night.

Iâ€™ve tried to kill myself before, but for some reason I think about this particular time often. I guess Iâ€™m just regretful? Like, this was the most perfect scenario I couldâ€™ve been presented with and I made such a dumb mistake. 

Maybe Iâ€™m just being dramatic, I donâ€™t know. I guess if I really wanted to die so badly I could find a way. Iâ€™m a pussy I guess.
