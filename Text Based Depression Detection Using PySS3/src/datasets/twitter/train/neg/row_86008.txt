Iâ€™m tiredI think Iâ€™ve finally fucked up my relationship with my wonderful boyfriend that I donâ€™t deserve. I said a horrible jealous comment on our way home today and realized Iâ€™ve become the exact kind of person I hate. Donâ€™t think I can come back from this. This is the worst itâ€™s ever been. On our way home I was thinking of all the ways I could just end it tonight. Jumping off the bridge seemed easiest. Iâ€™ve been crying my eyes out since we got back and I think heâ€™s tired of it. Which is understandable, I am too. I think he turned up the TV in the living room to block out my crying sounds. Just so he didnâ€™t have to listen to it. I think itâ€™s my time. Just have to stop being a bitch about it and just do it.
