I wish I had the strength to end it now, once and for all.I canâ€™t ever do anything right. I feel empty and hopeless. Iâ€™m too exhausted to see another day. I canâ€™t see the point of living when everything hurts. The pain is just going to inevitably grow so much more. Loneliness is strangling me. Darkness is clouding my heart and soul. I donâ€™t feel anything. The light from within me is put out. How will I ever feel true happiness when thoughts of death accompany me everywhere I go? The door for me to leave this plane of Earth is here. I could leave now and see whatâ€™s on the other side. Maybe death will be the next great adventure. 

Only if I have the guts to do it now. When the time comes again, this time Iâ€™ll be ready to say goodbye
