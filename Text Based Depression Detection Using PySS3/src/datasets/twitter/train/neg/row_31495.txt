i kinda wish someone else would just do it for mei can't lie and say that life's been bad. its rlly not, i go to a good university, im relatively attractive, im not by any means stupid, i have a loving family and decent friends. sometimes i even have days where i love life. i haven't felt suicidal in years, sure ive been depressed all this time but tonight the though of doing it ran through my mind, to the point that it feels like im at the point where its something i want. i don't know how to explain it, i equally want it and don't. the way i would describe it is i just want to stop existing, not really die, not really live, just turn everything off, quietly, peacefully. the thoughts that run through my mind right now are "what if i just get into an accident" i just want to feel nothing
