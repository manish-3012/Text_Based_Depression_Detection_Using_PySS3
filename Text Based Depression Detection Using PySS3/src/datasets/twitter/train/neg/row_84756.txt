I need someone..It's 10 to 2 in the morning and I don't think I can do this any more.  Everyone I could maybe talk to is asleep but I know I'm gunna do something stupid soon. I can't stop being so destructive towards myself. I keep putting myself in stupid situations. I need someone to talk to before I leave this vile rock.
