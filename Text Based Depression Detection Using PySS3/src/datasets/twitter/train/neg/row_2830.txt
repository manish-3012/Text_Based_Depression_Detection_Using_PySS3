I am a 40-year-old failure who needs to be euthanizedThere is no fact-based argument anyone can make to debunk the reality that suicide is in my best interest and the best interests of those around me.

I have done my best and worked as hard as I can for 20-plus years. The result? I am a broke, washed-up joke who is six-figures in grad student loan debt, has been turned down for over 250 jobs in the past year, will never own a home, will never raise a family, and will always burden his loved ones with his failure.

This miserable, pathetic existence is the best I could do in this world. Therefore, I should be removed from it.

Spare me your lame "suicide is bad" and "people love you" bullshit. Feelings don't trump facts.

Some people have no value. Those people should be killed. I am one of those people. I should be killed. No one is going to do it for me, so I am going to do it myself.
