I'm almost thereYesterday I broke up with the guy I had only been seeing for a few weeks. He had been pulling back gradually and the final straw was hearing he had made snowboarding plans for one of the 4 full days off I get a month away from my son, and had no plans of including me. He tried to skate his way out of it by saying he derped or had another plan thought of, but the truth is, he had been planning this WHILE I WAS IN THE CAR WITH HIM ON THE 13th.

I'm too impossible to love, I'm too impossible for people to want to be around, and I'm just honestly done. I'm a terrible awful fucking bitchy cunt and I cannot take it any longer. I have been thinking about how to off myself ALL day. I just want to go home and take pills or bleach or even put out a craigslist ad for someone to come shoot me, and I'm close to doing it. I hate myself, I hate my life, I hate that I caused a scene at his sister's birthday, I hate that I'm so fucking awful enough that people feel the need to exclude me from fun plans. I cannot stand living this life any longer. My heart hurts so much right now. My thoughts are so overwhelming and I'm just done. I have no want to live.
