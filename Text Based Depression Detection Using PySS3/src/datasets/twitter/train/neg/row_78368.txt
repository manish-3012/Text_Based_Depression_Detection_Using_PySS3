People say suicide is for cowards but I feel like a coward for not committing itI think my suicidal thoughts that I've been having for about 5 years are not valid because I'm too afraid to actually go kill myself. It's not because I'd be afraid to die but I'm scared of leaving my sister and mom here. I know my sister is a fragile soul. I don't want to hurt her.
