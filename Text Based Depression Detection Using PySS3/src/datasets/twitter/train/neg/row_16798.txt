Fuck SocietyNSFW

You know what this whole shit iâ€™m going through right now is ridiculous and overall shouldnâ€™t have to happen. I (M19) have a suicidal girlfriend (F19) that has her mental health absolutely deteriorating due to so many factors that we face as youth and early adults that itâ€™s absurd that it is even possible to live through this shit. Like the stress of university, work, family, friends, significant others and already poor mental health all held under by COVID-19 restrictions is absolutely ridiculous. I have been this girls only outlet for almost seven months now because of this covid bull shit where, no matter what option the government pick, a group of people will die. And you know what fine thatâ€™s understandable but now having to deal with all the liability horseshit that makes suicide prevention so fucking unsuccessful has literally driven me to the edge. Like how on earth am I expected to do all of the above stressful things as well as a semi pro sport and my family being high risk for COVID-19. Like honestly what the fuck is wrong with society where â€œliability purposesâ€ and â€œinsurance reasonsâ€ dictate how fucking humane and actually fucking caring a suicide prevention line can be. Itâ€™s fucking ridiculous and I could not be more frustrated right now. I am in over my head with my own mental health beginning to deteriorate all because of these bull shit hotlines that can only answer with fucking links to resources like honestly what if I called them when i was ready to jump off a bridge or some shit. Are they just gonna send me some links so theyâ€™re â€œnot liableâ€ like for fucksakes just help me help my fucking girlfriend. Sorry for the rant boys and girls and non-binary just like honestly Im beginning to completely lose my shit about everything and I just have no idea where to turn.
