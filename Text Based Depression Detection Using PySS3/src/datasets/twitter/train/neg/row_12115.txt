Making some final preparations before I goThis weekend Iâ€™ve been cleaning out my room, getting rid journals or other things I donâ€™t want people to read or see when Iâ€™m gone. Iâ€™ve been trying to give life a chance for almost 3 years but it hasnâ€™t gotten better, if anything itâ€™s even worse now. I did try to get help but most of the therapists I had were very poorly trained or unprofessional and caused more damage. I hope I will actually be able to go through with it this time and not fail or back out.
