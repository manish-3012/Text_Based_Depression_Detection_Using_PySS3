I'm posting this in case there's anyone out there who can relate or maybe I guess as a "cry for help" or some bullshit. I don't know.I started writing a paper for school but my thoughts got the better of me and here we are. This is was came of it. Is this apathy I feel? I guess it's apathy. I've stopped truly caring.



Dear Me, 
I am here to tell you that I hate you and I think you should die. Die a horrible fucking death, you asshole. I think youâ€™re just the worst. Youâ€™re a talentless fuck who contributes nothing to society. Why are you here? Youâ€™re taking up valuable space and resources. People have to waste their time dealing with and talking to you. Thatâ€™s pretty shitty that youâ€™re that selfish. Youâ€™re just gonna live with that, you think thatâ€™s okay? Itâ€™s not. You shouldnâ€™t accept that as okay; it isnâ€™t. Most of the words that come out of your mouth are usually some tasteless and humorless â€œjoke,â€ or youâ€™re, once again, complaining about some trivial thing that everyone else on Earth deals with everyday and is fine. You fucking suck. You suck a lot. I hate you. If I had to pick someone to die right now, youâ€™d definitely be in the top ten, behind child molesters and other various torturers of people and/or animals. Itâ€™s a pain in peopleâ€™s asses to have to deal with you, but you know it sucks alone. 

Only solution: kill yourself.


P.S. Maybe this time youâ€™ll hang the fucking noose higher, you fuck, you pussy, you ass of a person.""
