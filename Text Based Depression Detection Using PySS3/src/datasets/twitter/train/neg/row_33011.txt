I am killing myself nowI have a bottle of sleeping pills and heavy duty scissors. I have a broken life, family that despises me, failed school career, tarnished future, crushing loneliness, and a rope around my neck. There is no reason to continue, no chance of recovery, no words to pull me back, no place for me on earth.
