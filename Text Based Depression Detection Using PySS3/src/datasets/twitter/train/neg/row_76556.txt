I just want to escapeIâ€™m a mess. My life is so random right now. Iâ€™ve been thinking of committing suicide lately but have been tempted multiple times to cut myself at the same time.  Itâ€™s bad. I know I shouldnâ€™t. Iâ€™ve been about 3-4 years clean. But everything is so random and shitty. I think my boyfriend is cheating on me but he wonâ€™t be honest. I donâ€™t even think he loves me anymore to begin with. Iâ€™m not satisfied with my job. I work as a waitress and itâ€™s draining putting on a fake smile let alone talk to people. Constantly tired. Iâ€™m been getting high and drinking alot to try to ignore my feelings. Idk how thats going. I ditched my major and now Iâ€™m in debt which was a complete waste of time. Iâ€™ve been having dreams again from when I was raped/sexually assaulted. The last time I had those dreams was 3 years ago. I wake up crying. I lose sleep. Iâ€™m constantly having health issues = expensive = skipping doctor appointments. I donâ€™t know what I want to do with my life. Idk. Iâ€™m tired of trying. Idk where I was going with this post but I just needed to vent. If you read all of this, thank you for your time. I canâ€™t tell anyone not even my mom or my closest friends about how Iâ€™m feeling. Reddit is my only source of help I guess. So again, thank you for reading. I somewhat feel a little better but who knows how Iâ€™m feeling/whats gonna happen these next few days or weeks or months.
