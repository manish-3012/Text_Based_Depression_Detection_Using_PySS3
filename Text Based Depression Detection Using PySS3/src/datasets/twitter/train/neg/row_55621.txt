I dont know anymoreI dont even know why I make this post. Everything feels so pointless. I fel like nothing is worth it. I am so lonely. I dunno what to do. I just want a hug once. Maybe that would make me feel better. But nobody would want that anyway. 

Every day I want to die more and more. I dunno how to handle it. I dont know how to survibe tomorrow. Or any day for that matter. I hate it. I dont want to live like this.
