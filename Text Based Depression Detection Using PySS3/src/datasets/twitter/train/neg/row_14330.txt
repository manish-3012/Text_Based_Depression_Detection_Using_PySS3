future seems bleaki normally drift away from school friends over the holidays. about to leave and have no idea what to do with no one around. i don't want to work or slave away for 40 years and don't want to spend years more revising in stupid shit for uni not that i can even get into a good uni. i don't have enough energy to do something in my life other than become a failure. being a failure now at my age is acceptable but it's not gonna be like that in a few years

i seriously cannot imagine myself living a life that i'd enjoy in any way whether i'm working at mcdonalds or as a rich banker

the way i plan on leaving is doing a shit ton of drugs and go to a shit ton of raves and end it all on an overdose this summer
