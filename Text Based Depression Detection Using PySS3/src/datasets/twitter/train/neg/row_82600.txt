I've Come To The Conclusion That I'm Just A Bad Person.I'm finally seeing what's causing me to fail in life -- my character is fundamentally flawed. I have no sympathy and even get angry at people who ask for help or seem weak. Thing is, I'm probably the most spineless person you'd ever meet.  

I have no conviction or moral compass. I lie habitually for no reason at all. It's engrained in me to a point where I can't trust myself in conversations with people. I say what I think they want to hear and I always end up contradicting myself and left looking foolish. 

I've been driving people away with lies and deceit my entire life and I've always deluded myself into thinking it was never my fault. This last bout of depression has been an awakening to all this. The problem is: I don't think I can change and I can't live life being the person I am today. 

I don't know why I'm posting this. Maybe I'm looking for sympathy, which is unfair and manipulative behavior. Not a big surprise considering who I am though. 

So come next Wednesday, I'll be looking for nice tall place to jump from to end my life.

I am a coward.
