My country doesn't have a suicide hotline.My whole body is aching, my skin is itching from the urge to stab myself, my brain feel like burning and arguing with itself over and over.
I hate my family and they hate me. I don't have any friend, I don't have anyone. I'm all alone, I can't take it anymore.
