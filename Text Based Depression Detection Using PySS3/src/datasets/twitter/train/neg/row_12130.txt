A Year On, I've Run Out Of Excuses To Not End It.Having spent years fighting disability, ptsd, physical pain and isolation I've run out of excuses to keep going against the odds. 

Everytime I look at the profile of a Middle Age Suicide I find it comical that I fit the profile so completely. It may seem odd, but I'm fighting to not be resentful so that I can have a quiet and peaceful end. It seems that no matter what I do I will be angry as I slip away so I'm not even to have a peaceful end.

I wish I had a quick way to end it, like having a pistol, but am limited to overdose with drugs that will take time. What a pain in the ass.
