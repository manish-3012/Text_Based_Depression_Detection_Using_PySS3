I almost killed myself todayA few hours ago I was so close. Iâ€™ve thought about doing it for ages, but it was always abstract, like â€yeah, Iâ€™d probably be better off deadâ€. But today I saw it in my head, and I was so close to doing it. Today it became real. I was ready. 

Itâ€™s fucking terrifying. Iâ€™m not ready to die. Or at least I think Iâ€™m not. Depression and alcoholism really does things to you. Now Iâ€™m afraid that one day Iâ€™ll be drunk enough to do it. 

I donâ€™t even have it bad. I have a job I like, I have a partner who loves me (and I love her), I have great friends who would do anything for me. My economic situation is at least alright. Nothing in my life is worth complaining over, yet Iâ€™m still here, ready to kill myself. There are so many other people in this world who have it so much worse than I do, yet here I am, and I canâ€™t even handle everyday life.

Iâ€™m sorry for the ramble, but I needed to vent.
