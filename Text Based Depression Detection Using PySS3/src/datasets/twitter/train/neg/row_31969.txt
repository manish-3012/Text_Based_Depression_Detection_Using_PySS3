Fighting suicidal ideationThis is my first time posting here so I hope Iâ€™m following all the rules ok. Iâ€™ve only shared my thoughts of suicide in private, but things have been getting really difficult and wanted to hear what other people do in their own life to fight thoughts of suicide. Not necessarily looking for help or tips but just to hear other peopleâ€™s experiences. 

For those interested Iâ€™ll include some background: I deal with sex addiction and recently my ex found out that I had been cheating on them, amongst other allegations. Due to that I lost all my friends, my job, and Iâ€™m essentially ostracized from anyone in my community outside my recovery support system. Iâ€™ve dealt with thoughts of suicide for a long time but these feelings have been exacerbated by these issues, isolation, the seasons changing, COVID, and the fact that my ex has repeatedly told me to â€œdo the world a favor and kill myselfâ€. Put it simply, Iâ€™m really struggling. 

For me what has helped fight hopelessness has been:
- make lists of reasons NOT to kill my self, including anything silly that makes me feel even slightly happier 
- hiking and connecting with nature 
- being mindful about the things I cook/eat
- being more mindful about my body and health, recently started doing yoga and more exercise 
- regular phone calls and contact with my support system 


Curious to hear what others do to get themselves out of a rut. Hope everyoneâ€™s doing well
