Iâ€™m doneI try so hard every fucking day to just do SOMETHING but am always shut down by everybody I have ever met.  Whether itâ€™s a video game or just an everyday acquaintance I get fucked over and treated like shit no matter what I do.

I havenâ€™t killed myself yet but Iâ€™m just scared Iâ€™ll hurt the people I know and (supposedly) care for me
