I'm getting bad againIdk what to do. I've been sleeping either way too long (12 hours+) or not enough. I've been missing assignments and some of my classes. I just can't focus on them. I'm just so tired of hating myself. I have a shitty paraphilia. Everyday something reminds me of it and makes me feel like complete garbage. My own sexual fantasies feel like torture. When i get excited enough suddenly the my original disgust goes away. I recognize that now, so I won't make the same mistakes that I have in the past. But it always hurts so much when I come back to reality and have to accept that those are fantasies that I have. I've had nightmares about it. I'm not good in social situations. I have trouble getting close to new people. I've seen a therapist in the past for depression and suicidal ideation but i never talked about my paraphilia. My mom always asks me if I'm ok and I never know if I should tell her that i can feel myself getting worse. I always say that i'm doing fine. I don't want to worry my parents. I'm sorry this is so rambly but Ive been sitting here for hours deleting my post over and over.
