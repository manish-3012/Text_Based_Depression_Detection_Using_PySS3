Iâ€™m so tired..Iâ€™m tired of waking up every day and feeling the same feeling in my chest; that feeling of emptiness, the ache that feels like itâ€™s going to eat me alive. 

I have a child, and Iâ€™m in a relationship, but none of it even feels like happiness. 

I canâ€™t protect my daughter, not even when I was carrying her for 7 1/2 months. She was born early, and broken. I couldnâ€™t hold her for more than 90 days and I was all alone through it all. She was attacked by a dog on her 3rd birthday, I feel like it was my fault.. I will never be able to protect her, so whatâ€™s the point anymore?

My relationship is a terrible one, he makes me feel like I â€œneedâ€ him to survive. That Iâ€™m nothing without him. Heâ€™s the father of my child, and he uses her against me. He tells me that I canâ€™t give her what she needs, that Iâ€™m a terrible mother because I check out, or because I donâ€™t feel like cleaning that day. 

I have no friends.. no one ever calls me or text me. When I do get phone calls itâ€™s just those stupid scam robo calls. The only text messages I receive are appointment reminders or if Iâ€™ve logged in somewhere and need a code. 

I do get random messages on social media sometimes.. but they come from creepy guys trying to be gross and cringy, and it just makes me feel even less of a person. 

I sit at home alone most of the day, the only person who speaks to me on a daily basis is my 3 year old. Her father is either never home, or sits in another room most of the time. 

I just want to die. I want to stop feeling. Iâ€™m tired of my emotions, Iâ€™m tired of feeling crazy, or sad, or angry. I just want to feel nothing. 

Sometimes I wish Iâ€™d get cancer, or get hit by a car, or have some tragic accident happen and survive, so I can feel like I mean something for once. 

No one ever makes me feel like I matter. Iâ€™m always going out of my way to make other people feel important, but no one ever tells me â€œI love youâ€ or â€œyou matterâ€ â€œIâ€™m proud of youâ€ â€œI need youâ€ â€œyouâ€™re importantâ€ â€œIâ€™m thankful for youâ€ 

I just want to hear those fucking words 

I WANT TO MEAN SOMETHING AND IT FUCKING HURTS 

I canâ€™t stand this feeling anymore. I want to end all of this. My head feels like itâ€™s going to explode, and my chest feels as if itâ€™s going to just collapse. 

I just want to be set free. Thatâ€™s all Iâ€™ve ever wanted. I think about it every day.
