Feeling suicidal.Last night I was sitting down at dinner when this person made a joke about me going to the funny farm and being in a padded room. I am actually depressed and this person knows that. So I got upset at the comment(its stigmatizing) then later when I was trying to explain that it wasn't funny somebody else at dinner was like "why is not funny do you know somebody in the funny farm? 
Anyway to make a long story short my family knows that I am depressed and yet they continue to make jokes about things like this which is preventing me from getting help. I had a mental breakdown last night about it and tried to kill myself but didn't do it right and failed.
Tonight i may try again
