I feel selfish.Is it selfish of me to want a painless death? 

I know deep down, my worthless body deserves to suffer. To get what it deserves for living a pathetic, wasteful life. For accomplishing nothing in its 17 years of existence. For only being a burden upon her fellow human. For only brinding good things down. For being a waste of resources and space. 

Is it selfish of me to want to die painlessly and quickly, inspite of all of this? I deserve a slow, torturous end, and yet I  have the audacity to feel I deserve to end my life better.
