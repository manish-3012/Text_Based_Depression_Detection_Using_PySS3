Sexually Assaulted, Jobless, and HomelessThis is going to be long... There is a TL;DR version at the end.

I am male, in my thirties, recently identified as queer, and up until very recently a successful graduate student.  I suppose the situation I find myself in started six months ago when I was sexually assaulted by my former partner, let's call him Ed.

I had slept with several men in the past.  However, Ed was my first homosexual relationship. Ed was usually respectful of my boundaries.  The sole exception had been the things he would talk to me about.  Ed would tell me really disturbing things sometimes and seemed to relish watching me squirm as he kept talking after I had told him I wasn't interested and was visibly uncomfortable.  Sometimes the subject was taxidermy, other times it was his past work as a male escort, other times it was our shared history growing up in repressive Christian families, a subject I would rather forget.

[...flashback to spring 2014...]

Ed and I dated briefly a year ago.  It was my first experience dating in a homosexual relationship, I was really nervous and sometimes not altogether sure that I was attracted to men.  However, that was not why I broke up with Ed.  I broke up with him because he seemed somewhat disturbed.

One day while we were dating he and I were talking about crazy things we had done in past relationships. He confided in me that after a former lover had walked into the bar where he works accompanied by their new beau. He had been working the door and had a screaming match with them at the entrance.  To retaliate against his ex for upsetting him at work he stalked back to their apartment that night.  Ed is interested in animal taxidermy he has a freezer full of dead furry things. He had recently found a dead raccoon in the later stages of decay. He left the raccoon corpse and various animal corpses from his freezer festooning the hood and wind shield of his former lover's car.

I decided very soon after hearing that story that I didn't want to see him anymore.  I noticed he kept coming into a pub I had introduced him to where I was a regular.  I didn't make much of it since he didn't make an effort to talk to me.  One day all of the bar stools were taken so I sat at one adjacent to him across the area where people order.  We didn't talk but I noticed something next to me when he left.  He had left a dismembered doll's arm on the bar next to me.  The next time I saw him in the same bar I made eye contact and flipped him off as I left.  I got followed out of the bar by one of his friends as they screamed at me in the parking lot in front of the bar. I tried to explain to them that he had stalked others in the past and that I just wanted him to leave me alone.

[...fast forward six months...]

There are few dance venues where I live, and fewer queer bars. I decided to go to the bar where he works irregularly as a DJ.  I still knew his schedule from when we had been dating so I knew he would probably not be there.  Wrong! He was there as a patron having a drink.  I normally am not an angry person, some time had passed and I felt bad about being so cold when we broke up and for flipping him off at the bar.  I asked him how he was doing.  Not a minute later he was talking to me at length.  He told me that I had inspired him to go to college and that he was now in attendance at the same institution as me as an undergraduate student.  He also told me about a friend who had recently committed suicide.  I had been acquainted with the person, I had met them though only once. He was there the first time Ed and I met, they had been hanging out together.  His friend had been smitten with me and made a clown of himself trying to get my attention.  I felt bad for Ed and after a few drinks and more conversation... I took him home.

A few days later I was lonely and craving distraction so I texted Ed to see if he wanted to get together.  We ended visiting many of the bars downtown. We drank an insane amount that night including my first glass of absinthe.  As we stumbled out of the bar I realized that I was blackout drunk when I couldn't locate my vehicle.  Ed doesn't have a vehicle and rides a bike around.  He seemed to be more sober than me so I asked him to drive me home.

**&lt;triggerwarning&gt;**

Ed brought me home, I was really drunk and had to be helped to my door.  I told him I was going to take a shower then go to bed.  I had to hold the wall as I walked to the bathroom.  As I was showering Ed poked his head in and asked if he could join me.  I responded in the positive and he got in the shower with me.  Ed started touching me while I was showering but I was too drunk to be interested or reciprocate.  It was right about then that I lost my balance and fell in the shower.  As I was falling I tried to grab the shower head, it came out from the wall and I badly lacerated my hand.  Ed saw that I had cut myself and was bleeding all over the floor of the tub, however that did not deter him from pushing his penis in my face.  I was extremely disoriented from the alcohol, the fall, and the fact I was bleeding.  Despite all of this I took him in my mouth.  As he started thrusting he got more and more forceful. He had always let me go at my own pace in the past.  The force of him pushing his penis so far down my throat was making me gag. It was all too much for my alcohol filled tummy.  I ended up throwing up all over him, and myself.

Vomiting helped me regain a little bit of a grasp on the situation.  I remained kneeling in the shower for a while as Ed cleaned himself off and got out.  I was shocked by what had just happened, I was still bleeding, and at no point had I really consented to what was going on.  I cleaned myself off, brushed my teeth, and shakily got out of the shower.

When I came to my room Ed was waiting sitting on the edge of my bed waiting for me.  He asked if he could stay the night, I said alright but that I needed to pass out.  I still felt shaken up by what had occurred in the shower. I tried to kiss him in a non-sexual way to just make myself feel better. However, he was clearly still aroused he started getting pushy again so I pulled away.  He kept fondling my genitals and grinding his hips against me.  I spent almost an hour telling him "no", "not tonight", "I don't feel good".  Several times he got up on top of me and I had to physically push him off.  When he finally retreated to one side of the bed I assumed I had convinced him to go to sleep, I then rolled over and passed out.

I "woke up" (regained consciousness) to see the red numbers of my clock glaring inches from my face.  The time read 4:15.  As I reoriented myself to the situation I became aware of the weight on top of me and the un-lubricated penis slowly thrusting in me.  I was tired, the additional weight on my stomach was unbearable, so I re-positioned myself and took it.  I even gave some words of encouragement hoping he would finish sooner.  I choke every time I recall this last detail, it makes me want to douse myself in gasoline and light myself on fire.

**&lt;/triggerwarning&gt;**

I was so sick when I woke up.  Ed asked if I wanted him to leave.  I asked him to bring me some water and learned the unsettling fact that I couldn't even hold down water without vomiting.  I didn't want to move so I asked him to stay.  At some point I recalled the events of the evening before and I told him never too be pushy with me again.  He shrugged and acted as if he didn't know what I was talking about.  Eventually, around 6:00 PM we ventured out to find something I might be able to eat.  I settled on tom yum a spicy soup from a Thai restaurant near me.  It proved too much, I had to run to the bathroom to throw up again but afterwards I was finally able to get some calories in me in the form of white rice.

I will never forgive myself but I kept seeing him after that.  This was mostly motivated by the fact that another friend of his, a coworker killed themselves later that week.  I cared about him and I was afraid he would hurt himself.  We kept hanging out but whatever veneer of affection there was on our interactions wore off almost entirely.  I would call him every couple of weeks, I would buy him drinks and talk with him to see if he was okay, when I was lonely I would consent to fuck.

This all ended after two months of seeing each other irregularly for drinks and/or sex.  His frequent talk of death (taxidermy, jokes about dead babies, and his friends' suicides) was leaving a bitter taste in my mouth.  I was in the Marines in the early 2000's and I have seen enough death to know it isn't something to focus on.  You see it, you process as best you can, and you move on.  One evening bringing him home after a night of drinking I told him in a tearful confession that I couldn't handle it anymore.  That his constant talk about death was bringing me down.  He was completely unapologetic, I also noticed a change in his tone.  He turned to me and told me that his coworker's recent death hadn't affected him in the slightest "she was an alcoholic and it was bound to happen eventually".  I was shocked by his callousness If she had been an alcoholic, then what were we?  If he didn't care about her then had all the feelings he had shared with me been lies?  I then saw something I had been missing, it was as if a gigantic neon sign suddenly came alight, which I had only seen the silhouette of previously.  "Manipulator" it read.

I told him to get out of my car.  As he collected his bike and other things from my vehicle he hurled insults at me. One comment in particular hit me as if I had been slapped, "Bitch." he said as he slammed my door.  I recalled the night two months prior when he had forced himself on me without my consent when I had been passed out drunk.  I got out of my car and followed him to where he was.  Without a word I threw a punch which landed squarely in his chest, he threw me to the ground, as I got up, he yelled "rape" to get someone's attention from the surrounding houses.  His alarm call nearly drove me over the edge of restraint as I thought about him using that word, my word.  It was at that moment that I finally realized how I had been mistreated.

I had been in fights in the past but they had been in self defense.  This was the first time I had thrown the first blow.  I wish the story could end there with a victim of sexual assault getting vengeance but of course it does not.  Violence begets violence and there is no end to it.  I was on my way to school one day to work on one of my papers for finals week in my master's program when I received a text message.  It said that I had to talk with one of the school administration immediately that I would be under threat of expulsion if I was seen on campus before the meeting.  I was scared I was not really sure what could have happened.  Had some prudish person seen me posting black and white nudes on my Tumblr page and reported it?

I went to the administration office which was strangely located in the college dormitories.  The person was a liaison for student affairs.  I was not exactly shocked when I heard that Ed had reported our altercation to the school.  It seemed the kind of thing he might do.  I was instructed that I would no longer be allowed to use shared facilities when he was present.  Furthermore, there was a schedule for when I would be able to access the facilities, and my involvement in the altercation would be investigated.  I felt a lot of things at that moment. I was panicked over being outed, I was angry that Ed would be given greater access to the facilities that myself, and I was frightened at the prospect of further investigation into my private life.  On top of it all this was occurring during finals week, weeks after the fight between Ed and I.

I began looking for someone to talk to about the earlier sexual assault I was given information for an organization downtown.  I found out that the organization which had regular support for women survivors of sexual assault did not have any such support for men.  I was given the contact information of a psychologist and asked as an after-thought whether I had any insurance.

I spent several months with no one to talk to about what had happened.  Every night I slept in the same bed and showered in the same shower where the events had occured.  My mind started to run in frantic circles.  Occasionally, I would break down and overshare with members of my graduate program.  They were always sympathetic but I could tell no one wanted to hear about it.  As the investigation at campus continued I had to meet with a number of counselors and administration.  I eventually opened up about the full history of my relationship with Ed and the sexual assault which occurred.

I had told one of my housemates about the physical altercation and that Ed would not be welcome at the house under any circumstances.  I could tell that her perception of me changed immediately.  She had liked Ed, so she was chilly whenever I entered the room and would talk to me with a pained look on her face as if it was hard work.  I was sad to lose a friend especially one whom I lived with.  I spent long mornings laying in bed neglecting my research. I would sometimes spontaneously start sobbing in the shower when I finally got myself out of bed.  I felt like I was living with unfriendly ghosts.  I decided to share the full story with my housemate as she went about her chores one morning.  She surprised me with her reaction.  She told me that she had been raped in the past and was extremely angry at me for triggering her.  I wanted to shoot myself, I apologized gave her a hug, and stalked back to my room.  Determining then that I would move out as soon as the academic year was over.

Events continued to escalate because I am a dramatic bastard.  One night a bunch of my friends from my graduate program cohort wanted to go to the same bar where Ed worked as DJ.  I knew he would not be working there so I decided "what the hell?" when I came to the door I was stopped by the doorman and told I was eighty-sixed.  I asked why and was told it was coming from the owner.  This was two days after I had reported the sexual assault to my school.  I came back home that night hot under the collar, I hopped on Facebook and sent a message to the bar's page.  I said I would be leading a boycott against their establishment for harboring and defending rapists.  They asked me who and I responded Ed.  They then blocked me from sending anything further but sent me a series of harassing messages suggesting that I get counselling for my sexual identity and that "emotional butthurt stemming from rejection is not rape". As I read the screen I thought "OH NO YOU DIDN'T!" **BITCH SWITCH ACTIVATE!**

I already mentioned that I am a dramatic bastard, following in that vein the next day I went around my campus where the bar had advertisements plastered on all the message boards.  I tore down all the advertisements scanned each unique one altering it in Photoshop.  I found that if I just changed two letters of their business' title it spelled "Rapes".  I took these altered flyers and posted them all over campus.

I don't know what I was expecting to happen.   When I heard a knock at my door several days later I was not expecting police officers.  The bar had issued me a cease and desist order written on neat legal letterhead by whatever lawyer they have on retainer.  I was also several days later served a notice for a restraining order hearing.  The notice was dated the same day as the cease and desist from the bar.  I could just picture Ed and the owner of the bar trotting down the street side by side down to the attorney's office.

The cease and desist order didn't lead anywhere it was just a threat.  I did however attend the restraining order hearing, a friend of mine went with me and held my hand as Ed entered the court room.  I immediately started crying and had difficulty maintaining my composure as I took the stand and gave the judge my testimony in front of court room full of random strangers.  I recounted the events of the sexual assault and how that had acted as an impetus for the physical altercation between Ed and I.   The judge seemed sympathetic to my story however in the end he awarded Ed the restraining order.  He suggested that I get a restraining order of my own against Ed. I couldn't see the point of escalating things further. I also knew that criminal changes for the rape would be out of the question there would be no evidence other than my testimony.

As you may imagine my academic performance floundered during the investigation by my academic institution and the later legal activities.  My long days spent in bed hiding from the world caught up with me.  Fortunately, I only lost credit in one of my electives.  The end of the quarter came and went and suddenly the day on which I had said I would move out of my house was upon me.  I have been applying to quite a few jobs however, I have no idea where I am headed.  I will go wherever work takes me.  For the last week and a half I have been couch surfing with random friends and sleeping in my van while I wait.

The waiting is taking its toll on me.  Long hours spent at the gym, cafes, bars, the coast, anything which gives me some vestige of a normal life.  It's in the morning that the weight of my situation hits me, my money is fast disappearing and I've worn out my welcome everywhere.  The climbing rope I keep in my van with all of my other sports equipment looks like it would make a strong noose, the clock tower at my college looks like a good diving board, and the bottles of pain killers I kept from an injury several years ago all look like an easy way out.  However, I cannot justify harming myself. As hard as all of this has been nothing will ever be harder than coming out was.  I love myself and I know that somehow I will find myself on the other side of this.

TL;DR - I was raped by my ex-boyfriend, I got revenge several months later by fighting him, I was given a restraining order for my actions but he suffered no repercussions for his and I have no recourse, I am now so uncomfortable on the campus where we both go to school that I am withdrawing from my graduate program and moving, I don't have a job at the moment so I am living in my van. Strangely, I am discovering how beautiful life is from the experience.
