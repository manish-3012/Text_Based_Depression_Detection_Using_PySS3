im scared of growing upi turned 18 a week ago and I have so many things to say. Iâ€™m sorry itâ€™s 2 am where I am and Some of the sentences might not make sense. i knew I wasnâ€™t born in the right body when i was in elementary school. Iâ€™m scared to tell my parents and grandmother as they all live with me. I hate being called by my deadname and I hate being called a â€œgood sonâ€ . id rather not be a human at all and live in seclusion than go outside and see people. i donâ€™t feel like I mean anything the world is so small how could it mean something. all these years I hate the condition of human nature and how easy it is to push people away and see them as ugly. I donâ€™t want to cry anymore but Iâ€™m the biggest waste of money from my parents and relatives. my grandmother doesnâ€™t give a fuck about if I live or die. im ugly i donâ€™t care what the hell society thinks is not and I donâ€™t want anyone to lick my wounds. Iâ€™m stuck in my body. i think I already cried all my tears already. I donâ€™t see myself in the mirror anymore Iâ€™ve always been an outsider even among people like me. I donâ€™t want to go outside. i put people too high up on pedestals and I realize no one really loves anybody. I spent my birthdays crying myself to sleep scared of what the next year will bring me. I donâ€™t know where to throw this numb dull pain. itâ€™s consumed me. im happy for all of you I really am live your genuine selves and be free from the things that shackle you down. some people donâ€™t have happy endings and thatâ€™s okay. Iâ€™ll have to live as a cis guy for the rest of my life to be treated with any sort of fucjing essence of love or respect Iâ€™ll do it until I finally break. nobody really loves any one
