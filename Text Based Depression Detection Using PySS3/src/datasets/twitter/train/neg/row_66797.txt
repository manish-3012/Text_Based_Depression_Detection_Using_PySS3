ExcludedI love my family, I donâ€™t feel excluded at home. But in school everyone is just battling it out to become the most â€œfamousâ€. 

There is no friendship there. I feel like i donâ€™t belong. I donâ€™t like people that talk down upon others, is that wrong? 

I donâ€™t like people that act friendly but arenâ€™t, is that wrong? They donâ€™t want to spend time with you because it would ruin their â€œsocialâ€ status. 

But I respect them and I wish they respected me as well, as a fellow human being. 

I donâ€™t like â€œhanging outâ€ at parties or spending time in big groups, I want to get to know the person I spend my time with, not just be with them. 

Maybe thatâ€™s why I am so weird. I love people to much.  Every evening I wish I could selfishly die, so that I donâ€™t have to live through the pain of loneliness and depression. 

(Have a good evening/day, donâ€™t know your time zone )
