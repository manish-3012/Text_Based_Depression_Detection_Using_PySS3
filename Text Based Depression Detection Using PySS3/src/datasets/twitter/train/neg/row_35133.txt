UghIâ€™ve been crying for the past probably 20 minutes thinking if I should, I get told even by my parents â€œI donâ€™t do anythingâ€ and other things, while trying to stem for academic success and I always feel worthless like everything would be better without me. I can be deemed as popular but Iâ€™m so alone, I have no actual friends, never got to form bonds like this so Iâ€™m thinking itâ€™ll be best if I just fucking die, nothing would be affected in this world by me just dying. A year to 2 ago Iâ€™ve tried before to kill myself and got held to where I couldnâ€™t. Whatâ€™s the point in living if there is nothing in my life?  Everything seems like Iâ€™m just a burden, I feel singled out most of the time . I wouldâ€™ve probably done it already if there was something in here that would be quick and with the 100% chance of me dying. Do I give my life any hope? If so why?
