I wish I had better parentsMy parents constantly ridicule and mock me, even though Iâ€™m in my 20s. All I ever want is their love and support, but all they do is criticise me. 

For a bit of context, my parents repeatedly fight and argue with one another. My mother used to beat me quite a lot when I was younger, whereas she never did that to my younger brother. 

For a bit of context, I have Aspergers. And my speech patterns tend to be monotonous where I have a habit of giving one word answers to things. Then my mom goes off into a rant and says that I act liked a spoiled kid doing that because she has to keep on trying to get me to converse. 

Then she tells me that I never am concerned about her or ask about her well being. She tells me that she has to keep on trying to get me engaged in things. 

I am tired of having such a horrible life and maybe suicide is the way out. I donâ€™t know whoâ€™s right or wrong anymore.
