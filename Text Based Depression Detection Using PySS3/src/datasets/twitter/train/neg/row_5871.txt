What should I do ?So i will brief it as much as possible.
I'm a dropout, suffer from schizophrenia, ocd and anxiety disorder , i attempted suicide twice , now my daily routine is to play video games,watch tv and try to cope with my mental illnesses every single day is the same ,I'm not enjoying video games anymore , I force my self to watch tv to not think about suicide I'm 17 , I won't consider suicide is an option cuz i get a weird paranoid fear of the possibility of a hell afterward,so what should I do why i'm so trapped like what is this should i be like this forever? but i can't ?
