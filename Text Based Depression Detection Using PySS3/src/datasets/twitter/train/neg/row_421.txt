Cooking.

Hungr.

Watching her do nothing while i struggle.

Watching her hurt, every day, with no hope in sight.

Choosing between gas, cigarettes, or chicken. Cigarettes win and i walk.

Brakes, oil, tires.

"Get a real job" they think. "Leave her" they think.

I hear your thoughts. I hear your message. "Always be happy".

I want to k***. I want to eliminate my problems. I want to become a hurricane and devour the coast. I want to soar through the air like lightning and crash like thunder against a miserable sky.

I want to fucking matter. I want to eat.
