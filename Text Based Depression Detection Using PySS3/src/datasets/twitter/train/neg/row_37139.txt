Been suicidal for a really long time and now i have the last strawJust got rejected from the only medical school i can afford. I come from a family of nobodies and make I suppose being a doctor really was just a pipedream fantasy for people of our background and wealth (orlackthereof). I use to be smart and be able to have scholarships but I think I let college ruined me and I struggled a lot resulting to my grades to be mediocre. I've decided I want to kill myself as I do not dream of labor and please dont think its a "stupid superficial" reason as there are other factors (such as my mom being abusive). I do not want to be stuck living another 40 years working my ass off to be not being able to afford basic human needs. I have no date set yet as I do not have the materials for my preferred way of dying. I just want to say please dont be like me and have a good life everyone.
