I'm staring at the razor and have lost any real reason not to use it.I've lost the woman I love, I'm losing my home, and I've been told that my firing is an inevitability. I don't have a future anymore. I really didn't want it to end like this, but I don't seem to have a choice or an option. This is my only real way out...my only regret is hurting the people I love and care about as badly as I have. I just don't have a reason to go on anymore.
