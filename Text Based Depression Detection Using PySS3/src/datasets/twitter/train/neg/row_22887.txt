Sometimes I wish I wasn't so scared of death, so I could just kill myselfI'm just so overwhelmed by everything in my life. Stress from work and an uncertain career. Loss of the only love I've ever had. Loneliness. Social anxiety. etc. 

I'm always hurting so much, but I'm also so scared of death and nothingness. It's one of the only things stopping me from doing anything to myself. But I wish I wasn't scared. Sometimes I feel like I should harm myself in other ways too.
