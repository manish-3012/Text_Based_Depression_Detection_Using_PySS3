i'm going to try to liveit's hard not having HRT and it's hard knowing my body isn't right, but i'll get over it and power through so that someday i can have the pleasure of disowning my emotionally abusive parents. someday i can be a role model for younger trans kids who were in my situation. it hurts so much every day but i'm going to be stronger than it.
