16/M, No social life, complete loserDon't really know how to begin this, but to put it simply; I'm 16 and I'm a fucking loser. I've always been the guy without many friends. The guy without a social life who spends all of his time infront of the computer. 

Why? I don't know, maybe it's because i was bullied for pretty much all of middle school. Maybe it's because i didn't bother to sign up for any sports when I was younger. Or maybe it's because of the fact that i'm just not attractive. Or because of my shit personality.

I hate going on Instagram or Snapchat and seeing all of these people, usually 3 years younger than me living the fucking life. People with proper social lives and who actually will become something when they grow up. I mean, i have friends who are also gamers and the like, but they also do shit besides sitting there all day. 

I don't know, i've been wanting to vent about this since i was 14, but never really did it. Maybe i still had hopes for the future. I've tried to do some self-improvement, but it never really seems to work. Maybe people just don't pay attention to that, or I just give of a bad impression.

It's 2am and i really should go to bed, but i really had to get this out of my head first, so i'm sorry if it seems like i'm just rambling.

thanks
