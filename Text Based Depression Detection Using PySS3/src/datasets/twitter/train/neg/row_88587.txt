I think I'm going to die tonight.My girlfriend is having sex with one of my best friends, my grades are plummeting, I've been kicked out of my family and I'm tired of the depression and anxiety.
After 4 straight fucking years of depression I thought that I had beaten it, but as always, I was wrong.
 I'm at the point that I was at when I first met my girlfriend...she saved my life three times, and I consoled her through her depression. But now it's falling apart, I'm lost and broken.
I have no purpose.
My dreams were nothing but dreams.
I will have no career.
My heart has beendestroyed twice now.
I cannot take one more stressor in my life without completely falling apart.
I need a motivation to live, it used to be who I thought was the love of my life, but now she's gone forever.
Now the question is, should I kill my Pseudo-Brutus of a friend and then kill myself? Or should I kill myself in front of her? I still love her, but I don't love myself.
I don't want to cause psychological strife for her and I don't want her to feel guilty.
Should I just drive my car into a light post at 120 miles an hour?
That could appear to be an accident.

I'm somewhat giddy and I don't know why.
I just found out about her and him.
I'm overreacting, but I don't know how else to react
