Alright. Hereâ€™s my story, itâ€™s not long.I was recently diagnosed with depression. Now I can 100% tell you Iâ€™ve had it for a few years now I just havenâ€™t really cared. I got into psychiatry and got the help I need. Still going actually. Iâ€™ll keep this short tho. I left my old life behind because of a loved one wanted me to live with them elsewhere so I decided I would. Ended up slowly deteriorating and attempted suicide a multitude of times. I moved back to my old life and realized that Iâ€™d changed. I was no longer happy me. I was always sad. Friends left me but the good ones stayed. I have an issue when people leave my life because of my biological father. I wonâ€™t elaborate. Anyway, time went on and I got worse. I asked for help from friends and told them I wanted to die and they didnâ€™t understand so they shunned me. Told me I was selfish. And suicide truly is the most selfish act you can commit. Itâ€™s that cold hard truth. If you kill yourself your worthless. So thatâ€™s why I made the change. I got better. Less suicidal etc. I didnâ€™t want to be worthless so I gave myself worth. Now I just suffer from depression and itâ€™s hard but I believe Iâ€™ve beaten life. I conquered the hardest thing Iâ€™ll ever have to. Lifeâ€™s hard but lifeâ€™s my bitch. Now Iâ€™m still lonely but Iâ€™ve learned that it makes not being lonely at times much better. I beat the quo. I made it passed my shit and survived.now I have a fun job and Iâ€™m starting a hobby business 3d printing stuff. So yeah thatâ€™s it. I just want everyone going through shit to best their inner demons. Because itâ€™s the hardest thing youâ€™ll ever do but when you win your unstoppable.
