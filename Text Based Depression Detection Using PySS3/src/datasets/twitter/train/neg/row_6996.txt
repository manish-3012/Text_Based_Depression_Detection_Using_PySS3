I need helpDon't have the intention of killing myself, but I think of it everyday. Someone please just talk to me, my world is spiralling out of control and I'm throwing my life away and everyday becomes another reason for me to just end it all. I'm not one to cry often, but I'm crying uncontrollably right now and I don't know what to do.
