It's Sunday NightThat means tomorrow is Monday.

I always go to bed hoping I don't wake up on Sunday night. I daydream about going to bed and waking up in a place where I have self control and where I do not feel as if everyone around me looks down on me; where I haven't by my own actions caused people to see me as unreliable. It leads me to wonder if eating a bullet would take me away to this fictional place, or at least make the overwhelming ache in my joints in the morning never again come.

I don't like talking about suicide. It's been romanticized and turned into a tool for emotional manipulation. I do not want to be guilty of doing the same, so I do not tell anyone how I feel except for the times I cannot help but let feelings slip through the cracks in the form of off color jokes.

I'm trying so hard to make myself better, but it takes so much energy to merely stay afloat. It leads me to wonder if I should just let myself drown.
