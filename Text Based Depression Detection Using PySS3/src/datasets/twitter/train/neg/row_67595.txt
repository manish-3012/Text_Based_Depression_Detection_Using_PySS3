iâ€™m so tired, iâ€™m so tired of trying to fix everything, iâ€™m so tired that i canâ€™t even be tired enough to do anything about ityou make friends, you trust them, you think you can, and they show you every time why you canâ€™t trust anyone. but you still trust the next batch because you donâ€™t want to be cynical, and letâ€™s face it, you canâ€™t stand to be alone. but at the end of the day you are alone, you canâ€™t trust anyone, you canâ€™t trust yourself on anything but the fact that you are tired. youâ€™re so tired that you muster up the energy to leave and head down to the local train tracks, but you only make it halfway there because you just arenâ€™t tired enough. so now you sit on reddit, hoping to god one of the people you donâ€™t trust calls you,
comes looking for you, cares about you, but you know itâ€™s just not going to happen. no one will call, no one will look, no one will care. because really no one will notice at all until you donâ€™t show up for work tomorrow.
