Nov-25,2015 or Nov-1,2016Those are the dates I have chosen as possible dates for the end of my life. I'm not sure how I'd do it, Ive considered stabbing myself, overdosing, falling of a building, hanging, and starving. The first four leave no room for turning back, and the last is too slow.

Please forgive me, P, T, L, and M.
