I can't kill myself yet because my parents have already paid for this year of collegeI've just started college and so far I forced myself to go out one time, then spent the next two nights hiding in my room, curled up in a ball of anxiety, crying my eyes out and wishing it could all just be over. I've missed dinner and breakfast two days in a row because I'm too scared to go into the dining hall where everyone else is. But my parents have already paid over 20k for me to go here, I can't fucking kill myself or starve to death this early in the year. Fucking hell, why am I like this? Why can everyone else go out while I pretend to be sleeping so that they don't knock on my door? Why can't I just sleep forever and never wake up again?
