Loosing hope.My life is fucked. Girlfriend cheated, 5 years wasted, 2 year old sons family now destroyed. And my now ex even tho she said it  was a mistake keeps going back to the guy. I've begged her not to because. Of what it's doing to me. If things between them got serious and my Son ends up forming a bond with the man that destroyed my life. I'm not sure I could take it. My son is the only thing I have left to my self that is mine, if I loose that then I have nothing.
