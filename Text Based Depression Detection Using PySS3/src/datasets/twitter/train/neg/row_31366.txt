Why?I am having suicidal thoughts and have been having then for a month now they are not strong just an occasional thought of how I would do it and thinking what would happen and sometimes feeling like it. I dont have strong depression either and I live a great life and I feel kinda bad for feeling like this like I'm ungrateful because my parents try so hard. But anyway is this normal I'm a 15 yrs old Male btw or should I seek help.
