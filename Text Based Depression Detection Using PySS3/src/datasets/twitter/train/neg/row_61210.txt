ConflictedI jinxed myself.

Yesterday I thought "Well life is finally going okay I am glad I stuck to it."

Then a lot of drama happened over a small instagram story I posted as a joke.

I lost two friends. Two people, who werent involved in the story at all, because a third guy got triggered by it and they were closer to him than to me.

My girlfriend told me she was leaving me because I had "Made her look bad". This was when I told her I had felt like dying all day and I needed her to comfort me. It took all my willpower not to snap and stab or slit myself right then.

And so, here I am again. A depressed suicidal wreck. I pulled out my swiss again, and there's cuts all over my arm. I keep thinking of making that one cut but cant find the balls to do it.

I really want to. Nobody seems to care one way or the other either.
