Feeling unsafe UKIâ€™m not planning to do anything, I just feel really unsafe and had a query. 
If I say Iâ€™m suicidal, go through the procedures but say the only hospital available are outside my country, do I still have the right to back out? I canâ€™t afford to spend a few days out of my country due to feeling unsafe.
