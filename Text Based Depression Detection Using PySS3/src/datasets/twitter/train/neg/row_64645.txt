I donâ€™t knowYou donâ€™t have to read this, I just wanted to post this somewhere.

Iâ€™ve been thinking about this for some time now. I just donâ€™t know. I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m doing. Iâ€™ve lost motivation to come out of my bed and go to sleep. Iâ€™ve lost motivation to do things with friends and do activities/work. I donâ€™t know if I want to die. I know I want something. I just canâ€™t describe it.
In the past Iâ€™ve had the same thoughts, but they went away eventually. Now they have come back. Normally I was able to suppress these feelings. Itâ€™s getting harder to do this now. I donâ€™t want to be the next person complaining about how hard my life is and how depressed I am. I donâ€™t think that I have depression. I feel like if I just took more responsibility I would fix this. If I wasnâ€™t slacking so much at life everything would be fine. I just wanted to post this somewhere to get it of my chest. I just canâ€™t keep it in anymore.
Iâ€™ve noticed that the thoughts are getting heavier than before. Iâ€™m at the point that with a little emotion I break down. I just say that I need to go to the toilet or go call someone.
I find myself a failure. Whenever Iâ€™m with friends I put on a mask to hide my emotions. My â€œmaskâ€ is getting weaker, I donâ€™t hang out with friends as much as before.
I donâ€™t want to put my emotions on the shoulders of my friends/family.
I havenâ€™t really told anyone about this.

I donâ€™t know if this makes any sense, Iâ€™m just typing whatever comes up in my head.
