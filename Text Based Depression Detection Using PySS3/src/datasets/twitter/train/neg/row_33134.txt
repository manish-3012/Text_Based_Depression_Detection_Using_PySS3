Life feels so unfulfillingI get so bored all the time feeling like there's nothing left. I'm 24, and I can feel my life beginning to crash to the ground, and it'll be my death. I don't care about money or anything like that in and of itself, but I need to feel like I'm doing something, and it isn't happening.

I miss and worry about my family all the time lately when I honestly just used to ignore then apart from my identical twin. Speaking of him, we had so many plans of places to go and see together, and he's suddenly not interested anymore. He just wants to work a 9-5 and play games all night every night.

I'm so stuck and don't know what to do.
