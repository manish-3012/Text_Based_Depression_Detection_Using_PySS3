Scared of the Mental Health SystemI feel trapped right now. I have spent some fairly significant time in a lock in mental health facility and i am scared to end up locked up again. I've been having suicidal thoughts though i hate that concept like shit cant just suck something  has to be fundamentally broken in my brain. That's neither here nor there. I feel like i should call the hotline but i know they are going to ask if i have a plan so i have to lie to them, then they can do shit anyway. I feel like i should can my mental health provider, but they will ask the same question and i know i might end up getting locked up again. I feel like im a criminal for not thinking like they do.I dont want to get locked up again for even one day, that scares me so much. I dont know man, if anyone one here has some thoughts about that id appreciate it
