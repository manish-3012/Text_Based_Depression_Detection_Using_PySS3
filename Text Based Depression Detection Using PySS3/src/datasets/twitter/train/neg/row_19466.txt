Anyone else feel suicidal but also kind of okay?I have a lot of good things in my life, I'm not feeling relentless pain, don't even feel that hopeless, I'm just kind of sick of myself and my life and not having any energy to do things or enjoy things, and I want to kill myself. I feel kind of stupid about it, like, I'm not even crying and I was keeping up with my emails? Is this a thing? Do people feel like this and actually manage to go through with it? I'm planning out methods and I can't find it in myself to even be that concerned about what my wife or parents would think. Objectively speaking they'd be sad, I guess? There would be some drama? I'm sure it would be upsetting to find me dead and have to tell people but I just can't get to the point where that feels any more important than being mad that I didn't feed the cats
