I tried to get help for years.Multiple therapists telling me to get higher and higher help each time, being trapped, being damaged.  

I don't even want to read the replies here. All I've seen on Reddit is a big group of people who'd love to hit you for being down.

I'm just unable to be helped by professionals, and always get trolls or whoever thought it was funny, or just flat out rude people when trying to talk online.  I'm grateful for the few kind people that I'd met.

I'm just sick. I'm angry. I'm upset.

I kept trying to tell myself that it get's better for years... It just doesn't. 



It's been too long. I can't do this anymore.    I want to die.
