I think it's time.I was just forced to resign from my job. I've tried to date 2 girls who have both gone on exactly one date with me, then turned me away over text. The second one even got a boyfriend about a week after she stopped talking to me. I'm in a downwards spiral to nowhere. I don't get to see my dad much, between working his teaching job, coaching football and running his side business. My mom also works late every day, so that leaves me alone with my thoughts every evening. My brother seems to think that I'm weird, and constantly treats me like dirt. They don't know the pain. I've feigned happiness for a friend as her parents divorced and her boyfriend of a year dumped her. Her constant state of pain and negativity has worn on me. I don't know how many more sleepless nights I can go as my teachers shout at me in class to pay attention. I don't know where to go. My dad is punishing me from resigning form a job where I was left to angry adult customers by myself at a grocery store 4 nights a week. This past summer was spent almost exclusively at work to build up money for college. However, I don't know how long it will last since I have to pay car insurance despite not being able to use my car. I've been to numerous counselors who all claim they were once in my position, but their words of wisdom are to just "get over it", as I've seen them up to 6 times a week. If anyone here can give me a reason not to end it tonight, I'd be appreciative. I know that Internet strangers aren't professionals, so rip on me all you want for that. Not like I'm not used to it at this point.
