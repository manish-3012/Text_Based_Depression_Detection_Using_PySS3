Iâ€™m so fucking tired of everythingI swear to god one day Iâ€™ll start up my car and drive at 60+ miles per hour into a fucking tree. Iâ€™ve fucking had it. Fuck college. Fuck getting a job. Fuck everything to do with life. Itâ€™s all just a giant steaming pile of shit. Iâ€™m tired of attempting to help myself only to sink back in. Iâ€™m just clearly not cut out to be alive. I donâ€™t belong here with the rest of society. Hopefully Iâ€™ll get the courage to kill myself tomorrow instead of going to class
