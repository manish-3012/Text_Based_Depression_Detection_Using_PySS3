I won't say life sucks, I think its just not for me.Hey I'm 18 years old and I've done a lot of stupid things.. otherwise I wouldn't think I would be here right ^^

Now. I do have a loving family, my parents try to support me in all my life choices my brother and I happen to like the same hobby and we have a lot of fun doing our hobbies together but..

Everytime I just look at the future, I don't see any reason to stay alive. there is no job that I really want, no education I want to follow. Everything is just so boring to me. Now I know I've said that I like doing this hobby but its no where near a realistic "Job" option. and I don't think its worth living for eather, 

 I can't be having 0 income so I have to do atleast something. but I cannot figger out what. I tried a lot of things and afthere some time I keep on dropping it. and now for next school year I've got nothing... nothing at all, no job, no school, no money, no plan... My parents can't understand it and there quiet mad at me for not finishing any education.

So now I'm left to do nothing all day. normaly I would be called crazy for complaining for not have to do anything, but for me its a an othere reason to kms.

As a mentioned in the beginning I've done quiet some stupid stuff, I basically lost all my friends over mistakes I've made, for example I once went to Japan with my 2 best friends but I was acting such childish and annoying that when we got back both my friend never wanted to talk to me again. 

Ive got noone, and Im mostly left lonely, so today I've desided that I will finally put a end to this. 

Good bye ^^ live a happy life.
