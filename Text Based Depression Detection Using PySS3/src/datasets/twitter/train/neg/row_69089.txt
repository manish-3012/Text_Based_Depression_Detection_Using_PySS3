I wish I never met herShe showed me what happiness truly was. For my whole life I never knew how it felt. I've been depressed and suicidal the past few years, but when I was her, I felt good. But now she's gone.

I wish I never met her so I would have never known happiness. They say ignorance is bliss. I won't be able to experience that anymore, so in the end, her being gone was the straw that broke the camel's back. The rest of my life is a mess. I only had her. Now I have nothing.

I'm going to put an end to this suffering. I think my last day will be next year. If by then she really is done with me, I will also be done with myself. 

For those who say I'll get many more opportunities, you don't understand. There's a long story with her and I won't be able to get over her. And it's not the rest of my life is good. It's a complete mess and I just want to give up.
