I don't want helpI don't want help 
I don't want support
I don't want to live 
I don't want the pain to stop
I don't care about who I'll leave behind
I don't want to feel loved
I don't want fulfillment in life
I don't want money
I don't want power
I don't want status
I don't want jobs
I don't want a partner
I don't want to change the world 


I want to die ASAP. Really. That's it. That's all I want. It's not some cryptic emotional impulsive thing. It's my desire, my goal, my calling. Shooting myself in the head is the only thing I want to do.
