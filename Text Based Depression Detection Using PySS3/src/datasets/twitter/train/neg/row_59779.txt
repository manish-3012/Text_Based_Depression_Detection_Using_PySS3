I want to kill othersToday when I was walking, I saw two very happy girls chatting and laughing, enjoying life. Instead of being happy about that, I immediately thought about murdering both of them. With a knife. I don't think I'll ever do something like this but ever since I became suicidal these kind of thoughts became something ordinary for me.
