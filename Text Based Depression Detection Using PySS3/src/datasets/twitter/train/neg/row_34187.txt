It Gets A Little Harder Every DayEvery day its a little harder to get out of bed. 

Every day its a little harder to take the Prozac that suddenly doesn't do anything anymore. 

Every day its a little harder to check the mail to see what bill collectors are hounding me today. 

Every day its a little harder to not jump off the bridge on the way to the bank.

Every day its a little harder to not lay down on the train tracks on the way to the bus station. 

Every day its a little harder to say "I can  make it through tonight."

Every day its a little easier to say "I love you, goodbye" and slit my wrists in the bathtub.
