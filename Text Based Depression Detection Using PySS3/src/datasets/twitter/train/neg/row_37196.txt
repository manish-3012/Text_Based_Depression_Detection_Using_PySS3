Am I suicidal if I am committed to a plan to kill myself many years from now?I have a set of conditions for when I'll kill myself, the biggest condition being that I'll wait until my parents die of old age. I'm their only child, and I don't want to put them through me dying like that. Once they're gone though, and I don't have any direct family left, and nobody on the planet left that loves me, that is when I plan to kill myself. I'm not a lovable person, the only people that love me are my parents, due to me being biologically related to them, so I already know these events are inevitable. So given that these conditions are (likely to be) many years away and pretty much guaranteed to occur, am I suicidal?
