What happens to our human conscious when we die?I could end my life - and my conscious/soul could continue to live on. W hat would be the point of ending my life? I don't want to "live on" thru any sort of means. Some say our soul carries on and our energy never dies. Then why end the human physical form if the spiritual form doesn't die? I think I may just wait for my human body to break down on its own. Do people actually believe us humans have a soul/conscious? I know most of you will tell me there is nothing after death. That sounds way better than never ceasing to exist.
