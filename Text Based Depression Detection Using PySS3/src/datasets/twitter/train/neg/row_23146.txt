I feel I've just lost the one thing I was clinging on to: my jobI've made a huge mistake at work and I expect to be fired. I have very little self esteem anyway and this mistake has just obliterated that. The only friends I have are at work and work is the only place I get to see them. I just feel like I've run out of reasons to keep trying at life.
