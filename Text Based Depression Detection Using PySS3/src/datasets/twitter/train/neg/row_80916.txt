Got hit with the Big Sadâ„¢ï¸to preface: Don't worry about me! I have a meeting with my therapist in a couple hours and she and I will get it figured out! I just need to get this out of my head so I can stop obsessing over it!

my seasonal depression hit me like a truck this morning, I had a really bad week last week that was extremely stressful and triggered a lot of PTSD but before that I was genuinely content and happy with my life for the first time ever??? for months??? it was so completely wild. I ended a couple toxic relationships, and made some really wonderful and loving new friends, and I live in a dream apartment and have a wonderful job that I regularly look forward to, I'm on medication that helps me get out of bed and Function better than I ever have before, I have energy to work on projects and do things that make me happy?? 

And yet?? 

Every so often I can't help but think about how much easier and how lovely it would be if I just died in my sleep. Just a gentle fade to black. I don't really believe in a afterlife, so just dying? and then it's done and I can finally know peace? Not have feelings, or worries or concerns? I just stop existing? 
I almost want to start self harming again just for the relief, the release of tension. Seeing blood and knowing I'm real, having a scar to remember that I worked through it before. I've been clean for months but Boy Howdy do I miss it. I just want everything to Stop
