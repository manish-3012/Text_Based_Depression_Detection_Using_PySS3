To think that people used to tell me I had a bright future.I keep on mentally flipping back the pages of my memory. To the times when I still retained my childhood innocence and had hope that things would turn out alright. How people would praise me so: how excellent of a student I was, how kind of a person I was, how successful my future self would become... If only they could see the failure I am now. 

Even though I've lost touch with many of the people back then, I can still envision the faces they'd give me. Mostly of disappointment, some of a condescending pity that wordlessly tells me, "at least I'm not you." I know they wouldn't do that. But my brain still taunts me with my own imagination. 

It's sickening. I'm so pathetic. I should be grateful that I'm better off than most despite the pandemic and the many troubles the world is facing right now, shouldn't I? Yet I'm still failing classes that were once easy to me, I'm still becoming bitter and envious of the rightful successes of my hard-working friends, I'm still biting my lip at the family I have that does not understand. I'm still suicidal.

They say that a classic god blesses those who regard them highly and reckons those who blaspheme them. But then, what exactly have I done to you, God? Is my mistake of an existence too great of a sin to you that you've teased me with this bright childhood only to rid me of such blessings the moment you've seen it fit? Or am I simply fulfilling a self-fulfilled prophecy, too stupid and too slothful to make lemonade out of air? The words that were once praises from others feel so silly now.
