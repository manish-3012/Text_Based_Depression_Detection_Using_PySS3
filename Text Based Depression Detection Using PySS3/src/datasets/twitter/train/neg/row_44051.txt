I'm literally going to the edge of the world to end my life.I've made up my mind. I'm either going to fly to Antarctica to die of hypothermia or fly to Egypt and walk through the desert until I collapse. I've already researched and roughly planned it all. My life has never amounted to anything. No girlfriend, no actual friends, I've literally put on a persona my whole life to survive social situations (no I'm not gay), I've never connected with people, and I'd rather go out some adventurous way than simple conventional methods. 

If locals ask me what I'm doing, I'll tell them the truth. I came here to die and walk into the unmerciful elements of mother nature.

I have the right budget to pull this off and I feel at peace whenever it comes to mind.
