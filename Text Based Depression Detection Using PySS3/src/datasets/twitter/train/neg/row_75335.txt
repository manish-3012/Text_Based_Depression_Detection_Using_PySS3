It's almost Christmas time and I'm feeling really downMy cousins told me that they don't want to do anything with with us they completely cut us off and they dont ever want to reconnect. This happened last Christmas, they always pick on my brother just talk about him behind his back for like the past 2 years now so I had enough. I yelled at cousin and told her to stop, later on in the week my brother came back from University and mind you everything her brother comes back from uni they cut a cake for him saying congrats on finishing first year of med school etc.. and then my other cousins wife had a Christmas party and my brother asked my cousin for a ride and they made some excuse up. I got really mad because I just came back from work after a 12 hr shift at a job I hate and was super sick. I got super mad told my dad to call my uncle to ask wth is wrong with their kids. Imagine being scapegoated and disrespected 24x7 with side comments thats what my brother was going through for like a couple of years. She invited us to her Christmas dinner crap and my other cousins took their side and we're acting passive aggressive to us. My dad simply asked a question to me saying did they deny him a ride i said yes because I wanted to defend my brother and the passive aggressive nature pissed me off. All of a sudden my cousin started going after my brother calling him a druggie, a retard, you ruined my image etc. My brother got up and cussed her off told her to stfu you cunt and then my other cousin and uncle tried to beat up my brother. And my brother said if you don't respect me why should I respect you.
