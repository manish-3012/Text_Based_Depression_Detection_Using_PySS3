Im just tired of being meI guess I'm a monster. I suffer from big polar depression and have ruined my life completely . I no longer deserve regular human treatment but have giving none myself . I'm a burden and I PRAY  I die in my sleep because it would be better for my family. They agree so no sadness there like.... At all
