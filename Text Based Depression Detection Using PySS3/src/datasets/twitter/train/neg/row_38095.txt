All I can think about is dying.It's been probably 2 weeks since my last post.

This week I've had friends over, which was fun. We spent most of the week drinking, playing poker and blackjack. Despite them being over, I still felt incredibly lonely.

I feel so empty and dead inside, the thing that's always at the front of my mind is killing myself. I still can't bring myself to do it, I don't want to hurt my family. As each day comes I feel more sad and lonely, so I drink to lighten my head; for the most part it helps. I know I need to stop drinking, but I just can't, I like the feeling of being drunk too much and don't want to part with it.

I still talk with my ex, as she is a good friend and our breakup was on mutual terms of not wanting a relationship while she was away at boarding school for long amounts of time, but today she told me about a new guy that she met and was interested in. I still have feelings for her, and she did for me, so it hurt a lot to hear; my heart raced and there was pain deep in my chest. I am happy for her, but I can't help the pain. I'm finding it difficult to move on.

I'm so alone.
