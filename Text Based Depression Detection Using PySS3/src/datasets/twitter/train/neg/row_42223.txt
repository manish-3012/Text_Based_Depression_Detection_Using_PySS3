i cant handle quarantine.maybe the coronavirus was a sign that i still have the ability to check out at anytime. i want to kill myself. not because i hate myself or my life is spiraling out of control. the opposite. the monotony, everyday feels the same so why should i keep living it? itâ€™s a groundhog day from hell. i want to see my boyfriend n know everythingâ€™s gonna be ok. canâ€™t even do that lmao. calls are not the same no matter how much anyone says they are. i feel untouchable, empty, cold. sitting in my room with my parents telling me to get off my ass is tiring. what else is there to do? take a fucking walk? read a book??  like thatâ€™ll fix anything. iâ€™m being punished and maybe this is gods way of telling me itâ€™s quitting time. i cant handle this. things arenâ€™t going to blow over like everyone says. iâ€™m so alone and when i kill myself over this iâ€™ll die alone too.
