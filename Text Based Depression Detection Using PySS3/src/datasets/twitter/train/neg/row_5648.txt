Want to kill myself becausei have no future.Is it really worth it to work in a dead end minimum wage? Because i believe that i can't get a better job because of my disability. I do many times think about suicide. Why? Because i dont want to work in a minimum wage job all my life. That would be very Depressing. I would always be dirt poor. Is  such a lvie really worth living? Working in a dead end minimum wage job all your life? What do you think? Is it worth it? The pay is so low that you cant afford any luxuries, or maybe a few but you will never live a normal middle class life. Its just existing. Then you will need to work till you are dead because you will never able to retire on a minimum wage job. But because im disabled i believe i can't get something better.  Only unskilled work. So should i kill myself?
