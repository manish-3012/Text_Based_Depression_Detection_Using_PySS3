Do I need help?I've never considered myself a suicidal person but I've been thinking a lot about it in the last few months.

A friend came to know about my concerns and they said I'm faking it and I'm actually perfectly fine.

I don't know wether I need help or not, but maybe I could use some help figuring that out?

I don't want to be a burden on anyone else so if you think I'm just being stupid feel free to ignore me.

I don't want to be disrespectful to those who actually have it bad.

I'm sorry for taking your time
