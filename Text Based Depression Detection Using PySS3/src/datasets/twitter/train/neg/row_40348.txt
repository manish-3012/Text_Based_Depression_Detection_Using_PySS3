What should I doIn life I'm so young but I feel dead. It used to not be like this but things happened and I don't even feel real anymore. I cry myself to sleep, and just living hurts. It's like I never feel happiness anymore when I used to feel like that all the time. I'm trying but I don't know what to do.
