mentally willing oneself to die does not work, and yet......part of me must believe it does work, or I wouldn't spend so much time doing it. I spend hours lying in bed praying for God to kill me, or reading about suicide methods, but when it comes down to it I don't think I will ever actually kill myself. So why can't I stop obsessing about it?
