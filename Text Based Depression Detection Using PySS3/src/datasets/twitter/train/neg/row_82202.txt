Feeling TrappedI was diagnosed with bipolar disorder a couple of months ago, but the suicide thoughts have returned. I recently made a purchase which required a large (for me) loan. I also have a car loan, and credit card debt. I feel trapped at work, and I think that is the reason why I feel suicidal. I am drunk right now...I know I should not drink, especially with the medication...but I feel so stressed out, so trapped at a job that I don't like with a boss that I am close to blowing out. I am sure I will lose my job the next time she presses me. I just want to be left alone, treated like everyone else. I don't know what I am typing. I'm going word by word, hardly comprehending...anything? I don't know what that means. I'm sorry. I want to hang myself. I want to die. I know how to hang myself without pain. I have studied this and have gone through tests last winter. I was going to finish this last spring, but the good weather stopped me...and my family. My sister and her boyfriend in particular. If they were not here, I would be dead. They don't even know it. I wish I could express my gratitude towards them, but I am not good at expressing anything, except sarcasm and trolling. Real life trolling, by the way. Not reddit/voat/youtube trolling. I'm sorry. I'm really drunk. I think I'll take another shot and go ahead with the hanging...but all I have is a belt. I removed the rope and sheeps fur because of my past activity. Cuttont off my windpiep and suffering for 12 minutes will not be so bad. Right now I do not think I will do it. I don't know why I am typing this. What the fuick is wrong with me? I am such a fucking idiot.
