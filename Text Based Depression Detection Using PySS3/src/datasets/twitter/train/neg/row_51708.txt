Back, even though it feels like I never leftI spent today like Iâ€™ve spent the last three days, in bed. I thought my dog had pissed somewhere in my room this morning. I only just now realized it was my sweaty sheets. I must smell like a sewer.

Academically Im doing mediocre, just barely scraping by. Iâ€™m completely disinterested in everything about university. Im so deep in debt that it doesnâ€™t matter at this point. Nothing has for a few years now. 

I did the unthinkable last summer and cheated on my girlfriend. She found out earlier this week. Weâ€™re still together, but she hasnâ€™t spoken to me for a couple of days.  Iâ€™ve agreed to relationship counseling, but I dont know if itâ€™ll help anything.

â€”Judge me all you want, I spend every minute Im awake punishing myself anyway. I realize now more than ever that I am too insufferable to liveâ€”

Iâ€™ve alienated all 6 of my friends (2 of them being the couple I had my affair with) and mostly keep to myself. 

I think itâ€™s time to either leave the US or kill myself. Iâ€™ve hurt so many people, including those that loved me the most. Iâ€™m a monster.
