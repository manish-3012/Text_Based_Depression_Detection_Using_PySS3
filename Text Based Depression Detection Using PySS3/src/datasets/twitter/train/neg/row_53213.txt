I'm tired of the painI got alot going on and yet a little. You see my life is pretty ok. I got friends, a job, family, even a boyfriend. So far all seems well. 

Yet I'm extremely unhappy. I keep considering harming myself, just ending the pain.

My reason for this is because I see monsters. They tell me my friends don't care about me, my family is better off without me, I'll soon get fired from my job and my boyfriend doesnt love me. Overall I'm doing well not listening to those but lately that's getting harder. 

I've tried getting help. I told my parents. They said it was just a phase, and it'll pass. I tols my ex-boyfriend in the past. He broke up with me over it because he thought it was fucked up. I told my closest friends about the monsters, they were suprised when I told them, but after that never spoke about it again, and I'm pretty sure they've forgotten. I tried seeing a psychologist, but I didn't have the courage to tell him about the monsters. 

The pain is tiring me. For every good thing that happens to me the monsters hurt me. They sometimes even tell me to hurt myself like scratching myself or burning myself when a candle is near.

Now last weekend I was done. I told my current boyfriend about how I felt. About how I just want to die and be rid of the pain. He told me I'd be a pussy if I'd kill myself. He also said I was just being dramatic and should quit it. 

It still stings. I want to die and he says I'm overreacting and should just find something fun to do in life. I feel lost. I'm in pain and still people tell me to simply stop being that way.
