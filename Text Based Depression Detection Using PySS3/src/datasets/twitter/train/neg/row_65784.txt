I'm scaredI lost all I thought it was good, my friends are gone, my family doesn't even care, my girlfriend is tired and I  understand her, I'm such a waste of time, and all I feel is pain, sadness, it feels like a nightmare, I'm 22 and ever since I was a kid I had this anxiety problems, I've been diagnosed with ocd 5 years ago, I've been a bad person, and there is nothing that can make me get out of this, I feel sorry for my mom, my sister and my girlfriend but I can't take this anymore, I have horrible thoughts about hurting myself, my eyes are burning because of the tears, I stopped eating, even drinking water, I just want to kill myself but I'm a coward, I have nothing, this is pathetic I can't even afford a therapist because I lost my job, I'm alone and nothing will change that, there is no need for you to respond to this, I just wanted to leave something about how I was feeling if someday I'm missing, thank you if you read this
