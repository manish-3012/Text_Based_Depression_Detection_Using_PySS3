Iâ€™m struggling...Iâ€™m struggling really hard to think like me, be like me and well just be me.

But itâ€™s a losing fight. I look myself in the mirror, and all I see is a pit. I try to be positive, I really do. But itâ€™s hard when work-life is pressuring me.
My friends keep pressuring me and I feel like I just dont matter anymore. Like they are all using me one way or another...

But yeah whenever I feel this way itâ€™s usually triggered by something that might be mundane to you. But to me ever so harsh; losing in a game. What is suppossed to give me relief from thoughts and whatnot becomes an thought provacitive experience.

I lose a game and usually I just shrug it off and keep playing. But these times that this happens, I see everything wrong with me.

How bad I am at everything, that whatever I learn just drifts away, no matter what it may be. I donâ€™t even know how to cook food anymore.
My hands shake and I can barely hold anything. Constant short of breath. Memory is also getting worse. and its getting harder to even remember simple stuff.

It makes me mad at myself that I regress instead of progressing and I fucking hate myself becuase I dont know why this happens... 

Maybe there is light at the end of this tunnel but I wanna go off now.
