Previous attempts have failed, and left me scared to try again. I just want a way to stop feeling like thisThrough previous attempts I've ended up hospitalised, in the ICU, embarrassing my whole family.

Another failed attempt would just me humiliating at this point, nobody fails three times if they really want to die.  

I wish I could see a way to feel better through therapy, but I can't.  I've been trying for 7 years, with many different doctors and specialists and medications and treatments.  I've tried giving it 110% and putting in solid effort.  It doesn't work. It doesn't improve.  

I don't want to die, but I really can't see any other way out of this feeling.
