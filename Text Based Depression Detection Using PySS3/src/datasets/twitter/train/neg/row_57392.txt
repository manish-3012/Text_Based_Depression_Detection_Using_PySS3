I canâ€™t even kill myselfTried to overdose but I still somehow fucked that up, honestly donâ€™t know what to do with myself just tired of being used for my money I guess. My mom said once I get out of here I can finally get a tattoo which is good. Thinking about getting a rose on my hand. I honestly feel so selfish for what I did but I canâ€™t help it, I just feel like a burden on everybody and everything around me. Iâ€™m finally able to support my family with my business but being in hs at the same time is just too much. I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m posting here honestly, I just want to die. thanks for your time.
