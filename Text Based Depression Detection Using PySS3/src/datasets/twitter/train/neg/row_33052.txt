I donâ€™t have a life, so why not end it?Iâ€™ve done nothing with my life, and probably never will with the attitude I have. It doesnâ€™t feel right for someone as worthless as me to carry on living in this world.

Every day is the same. I wake up sometime in the afternoon, do nothing except take my antidepressants (which Iâ€™ve been on for several months with no sign of improvement,) go on the internet and then sleep at 4am. I donâ€™t have a job, and I left school with no qualifications halfway through year 11 (which I think is sophomore year in the US) because I was too weak and pathetic to cope with it.

I want to go back to school to actually try and do something with my life, but I despise being around other people. I donâ€™t even leave the house anymore because other people terrify me. I have no friends but thatâ€™s not surprising with my personality and outlook on life. Iâ€™m a depressing person, and no one wants to hear that stuff when they have a good life themselves. 

When I kill myself I wonâ€™t be a liability to anyone anymore. Thereâ€™s no point to carrying on, in 10 years Iâ€™ll still be in the same position if Iâ€™m not dead. No one will ever love me, and Iâ€™m just another waste of oxygen.
