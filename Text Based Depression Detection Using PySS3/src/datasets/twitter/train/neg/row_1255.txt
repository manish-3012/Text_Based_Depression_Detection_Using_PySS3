what the fuck is "reaching out for help"I keep seeing and hearing it every where. what is "asking for help"? why do I keep getting to told to do that when it feels like no one cares enough to help me anyway? how am I even supposed to do it, and how is someone supposed to respond to "I need help". it just feels like I'm forcing myself onto people. and I don't even know what would work in terms of helping me. unsure if this question even makes sense but I'm genuinely curious as to what it means to get help.
sorry for saying "help" so much.
