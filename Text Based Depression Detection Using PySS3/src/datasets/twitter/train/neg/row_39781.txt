i keep thinking about doing it, but unfortunately iâ€™m scared.i pushed my boyfriend away because iâ€™m so fucked up and now he needs space and is probably going to break up with me. iâ€™m so afraid to be alone again. 

iâ€™ve been thinking about it whenever iâ€™ve gotten sad since august. iâ€™ve thought of different ways. i started researching.

but i canâ€™t bring myself to do it. and i feel like too much of a burden to call a hotline. i tried texting one and after an hour and a half no one responded so i canceled it.

i hate myself. iâ€™m an emotionally manipulative partner and i couldnâ€™t stop until i really fucked it up. i donâ€™t want to live anymore.
