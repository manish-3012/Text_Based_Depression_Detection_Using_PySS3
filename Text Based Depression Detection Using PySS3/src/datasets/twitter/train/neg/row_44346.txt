It's never going to get better and I don't think I deserve to live.I don't want to get into a ton of detail and you can look at my post history to see more detail. My newborn son who I loved more then anything died and it's completely my fault. It was an accidental death but it's still my fault. I can't and won't ever forgive myself, I'm starting to hate my husband for not blaming me, I hate everyone telling me it's not my fault. He was amazing and now he's gone and it's my fault. I loved him so much, I would joke that he made it very hard to not have a favorite. I don't see why I should be alive. If their is an after life I need to beg for his forgiveness and if there isn't then so be it. I don't want to be alive anymore.
