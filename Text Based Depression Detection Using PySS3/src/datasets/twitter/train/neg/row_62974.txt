I feel like I should have committed suicide a long time agoIâ€™m miserable and unable to fix my life, I keep trying but since maybe 20 years ago itâ€™s been all down hill. Even when I succeed at things I donâ€™t feel happy, I just feel empty. 

My therapist doesnâ€™t think I am depressed. Iâ€™m not on any medication. Iâ€™m successful at work and I have a family that loves me. 

Iâ€™m deeply unhappy about my sexuality. The only thing that stopped me from doing it in the past is thinking people will think I did it because Iâ€™m gay or was molested or Iâ€™m a pervert.
