The Ultimate Way OutIt's my second post here and sad to say, things get even worse. And sad to say, i am still alive.

It may sounds odd, but sometimes i'd prefer to be just an emo-phase-kid pretending to have suicidal thoughts. I'd really rather prefer to post here as an attention seeker feeling "suicidal" for a couple of hours, than to post here as me. I just came to conclusion, that everything i have left is to keep living next months, next years, in a loop of soothing suicidal phantasies, desperately searching the smallest reasons for "not today" scenario. Just as earlier.

I don't know what am i doing with my life in this shitty job, but i keep doing it, because i must keep fucking biologically functioning, no matter how deadly i want to choose the ultimate way out. Doesn't it even sounds nice? The ultimate way out.

I must keep going for my friends, for my family. I don't want to ruin their lives, i don't want them to cry. As simple as that. I am tired. I don't really want to keep going anymore. I don't want to do all this shit again. I don't want to be me. I want to be a stupid animal and just enjoy eating and mating, without being able to think about life.

Just wanted to throw that here, thanks. Now go and keep scrolling.
