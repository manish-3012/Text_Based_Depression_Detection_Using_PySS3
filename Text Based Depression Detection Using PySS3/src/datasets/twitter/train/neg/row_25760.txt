Iâ€™m scared.I want to die and Iâ€™m terrified. The medication isnâ€™t working, the counselling isnâ€™t working, the daily meditation and mindfulness isnâ€™t working. Doing the things I love most isnâ€™t working and I donâ€™t know what to do. I want to rip my brain out because itâ€™s causing me too much pain. I just want the pain to stop.
