Feeling suicidal due to severe anxietySaturday is the only respite I get. I don't get respite Sunday because the dread starts to kick in about work on Monday. 

I feel a burning butterflies tingling sensation in my chest and am sitting here crying in this bathroom for two hours instead of entering my work place. Sitting there makes me burn and tingle, I dread emails coming in that I don't have the answers for, I dread that burning itching feeling I get sitting in an open plan office, I hate hyperventilating and panicking on the train on my commute because I know it is getting closer to work. 

You know how anytime someone kills themselves people come out and say oh why didn't they "reach out"? I have reached out multiple times to my GP doctor, to charities, to local mental health support groups. Nothing stops the anxiety. I do mindfullness, I do therapy, I do breathing excercises, I do hobbies in the two hours I have when I get home from work and and on the weekend, I've taken four different SSRIs. The severe anxiety trundles on regardless, I simply can't get it to stop. I can't go on anymore, I'm tired, I'm tired of crying everyday before work, I'm tired of this prickly heat feeling when I sit in the office and all eyes can see me. I hate feeling a wave of nausea any time the crowds descend while commuting. I am not built for this world. I dread every day except Saturday where I can sit along in peace and write, read and do things that don't cause me severe anxiety like everything in this world does.

The only time I feel peace is away from others but everyone must work to live so that's not an option. I am so tired.
