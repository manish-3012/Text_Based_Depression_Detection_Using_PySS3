Everyday I bring up the thought of just killing myself, sometimes I wonder if Iâ€™m actually going to do it one day cause I canâ€™t live this type of life style?I canâ€™t live this 9-5 life, I been depressed for so long, ever since I was 15 I think was depressed but thru out those years things got harder since I had to start working but I never been able to hold a job, Iâ€™m 19 now and had over 10 jobs.. 

Iâ€™m working right now and had this job for a month and half doing landscaping work, itâ€™s not bad but for some reason Iâ€™m just fucking hate working. Yeah I understand people donâ€™t like working, but I just hate it so much. I donâ€™t know how to explain it, I tried to explain it to my doctor and parents but nobody seems to understand? Itâ€™s like they think itâ€™s so easy, but it feels so hard for me? I got put on anti depressants they help, but donâ€™t take the feeling of wanting to kill my self everyday so I donâ€™t have to work...
