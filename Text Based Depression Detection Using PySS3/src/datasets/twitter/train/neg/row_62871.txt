I'm currently writing my own suicide note because I don't find anything worthwhile anymore.First off, throwaway for soon to be obvious reasons.   
Now that that's out of the way,   
I'm 19M, almost 20M, living in a Midwestern state that will remain unnamed for further anonymity (Hint: It's the one with the big city that has the big round thing).   
Everything in my life is going downhill, and I don't know how to stop it.   


Today, I crashed my car into a utility pole. Repairs are estimated at anywhere between 4 and 6 thousand dollars. I don't really have that kind of money lying around, so I'm out of a car.   
With no car, I have no reliable transport to and from work, which is the only good thing I have going for myself in life, but more on that later.   


My group of friends has abandoned me. They were incredibly toxic, but they were all that I had in life. Without them, they have left me feeling hollow, and like I have nothing in the world left.   


Whenever I try making new friends, they are detracted by the fact that I almost attract toxic, horrible people. Whenever I talk to anyone, the conversation almost always leads to drama, and it hurts. I could be talking about the new video game that came out, and next thing I know I'm being berated for being a worthless piece of shit.   


I have no prospects of my own. The car's title isn't mine, the title belongs to my mother. I do not have a house or an apartment of my own, I still live with my parents. Even my cell phone is under someone else's phone plan (although I pay for it).

I genuinely feel like nothing is worth living for anymore, and that nothing would be lost if I were to just be... gone.   
My only problem is the fact that I'd create a bloody mess, which I don't want anyone else to have to clean up.
