Once again, life finds a way to kick me when I'm down.On my last post here I told you all what was to be my last goodbye before I finally ended my miserable existence. In the moments leading up to me pulling the trigger, for the first time ever in my life I felt like I was at peace with myself. All the hardship and pain I've endured in my life was about to be lifted.

However after I shot myself, I woke up to the most god awful pain I've ever physically and emotional pain I've ever felt in my life. And to make matters worse, my parents have not visited me once during my stay.

I have never felt so lonely and sad in my entire life. Why must this happen to m?. Why must I live a life of darkness and despair?

I'm sorry for posting this, but I have to get it out. I literally have no one to talk to.
