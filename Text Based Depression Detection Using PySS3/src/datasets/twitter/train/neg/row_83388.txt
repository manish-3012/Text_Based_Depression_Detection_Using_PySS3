today should've been our 15th month anniversarytoday we should've been celebrating our 15 month anniversary, but sadly, we're not. your love for me is gone, and i guess i am nothing to you anymore. from our plans of one day being together physically, and the hours on end planning how we were going to get married and even have a kid, despite our hate for little kids. sweet, sweet memories, but they hurt, more and more as time pass. i fucked everything up, and i hurt you, but i swear, i never cheated, and my love for you was pure, but you never believed me. i tried my best, i swear, i really did, but i guess i wasn't good enough. i'm sorry for everything. last night i went to bed hoping i wouldn't wake up anymore, that i wouldn't wake up to live today's date, but sadly, here i am again, spilling my thoughts out on a random subreddit. i miss you every moment, every second. i love you, and even though you hate me now probably and want me gone, i'll always be here for you. i care for you more than life itself, and i'm sorry for making so many mistakes and being so naive, dumb and foolish. but i really tried my best. i swear it on my life. i don't know how much longer i can go on, the thoughts of ending my life are getting stronger and stronger, and they're giving me more and more courage to do it. but life is not for everyone, and i for sure don't deserve it. i love you, sweet angel. please stay safe.
