I can leave without anyone taking the blameI did it. I told them it wasnâ€™t their fault, that they tried, and it was my decision. They wonâ€™t blame themselves when it happens and it means so much. I can go in peace now. Iâ€™m done with this world and the failed promise of everything will get better for the past 5 years.
