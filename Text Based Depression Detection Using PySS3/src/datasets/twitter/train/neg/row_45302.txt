I want to kill myself, but at the same time I don'tRight now I want the attention that comes with committing suicide but I also really do want to die. For the past month I've had too much going on, and it's only gotten worse. I want people to know that I'm in pain and struggling but at the same time I just want it all to end. I have the recourses with which to kill myself, but I almost feel like I'm too much of a pussy and that I'll fuck something up anyways. I don't know what to do. My meds aren't helping anymore, and I don't even know when I'm supposed to see my therapist next. I've been suicidal for five years and I'm so tired of just all of this. I really need some help, but I don't know where to go. Can someone help?
