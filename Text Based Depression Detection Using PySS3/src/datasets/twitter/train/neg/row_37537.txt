September 1st 2020Iâ€™m taking my life on 9/1/20. My life is completely hopeless and itâ€™s not gonna get any better. My family is ruined and itâ€™s all my fault. I canâ€™t just fucking accept the consequences to my actions. Last time I attempted suicide, I failed. I ruined my family. I ruined everything. Next time, I wont fail. Iâ€™ll finally be able to let go. Iâ€™ll finally be at peace. I just have to pretend Iâ€™m okay until then. I just have to pretend so no one stops me. If I fail this time, the consequences will be far worse. I know I still have a month. I know this isnâ€™t well written and Iâ€™m sorry for that.
