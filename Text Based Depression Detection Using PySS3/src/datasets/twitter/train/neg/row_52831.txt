I hate myself because I'm socially awkward and I hate people. This world sucks.I made a mistake because I need money and am strapped for cash.

I found something on eBay for half the price it usually goes for so I bought it and am waiting to ship.

And I don't know how or why I thought it was a good idea (probably because I'm socially awkward), but I ended up telling people in a discord group I was in that I was gonna eBay flip, and someone told me it was incredibly despicable and disgusting.

I immediately felt bad, but I decided not to retaliate, so I just simply replied with a straight face and left.

Now I'm incredibly hurt and I hate both people and myself. How could I think this was a good idea. How could I think it was a good idea to tell people. Why must I be like this. And why must everyone assume that I'm a bad person.

I don't allow myself to feel hate directly towards the people who told me that's disgusting, and they're probably right and I'm in the wrong for trying to earn some extra money.

I hate this world.

I hate people. I hate myself, for what I intended to do. And I'm someone who can't understand other people.
