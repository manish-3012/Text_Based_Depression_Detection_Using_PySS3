This thing they call 'LIFE' is way too hard for me, not for me and I just want OUTGENERAL LIFE UPKEEP FOR ME IS FAR TOO DIFFICULT AND TIRESOME FOR ME. No I don't have a physical disability but this is all far too mentally draining

Remember it only takes one thing to ruin everything as well

I hope others are more suited to this bullshit than what I am!
