im starting to think about suicide againim kind of confused in what direction I should go in now. ive had periods of depression throughout the last couple of years in my life (im 17) and anxiety. I've had suicidal thoughts but i was able to get through them and I feel like the "episodes" lasted a few weeks at most. I started school again about a month ago and I've been pretty miserable. im keeping most of my shit together while going through this but i feel like I've changed for the worse since that first day back to school. i have a therapist and what I've learned is that part of my anxiety is thinking that people automatically hate me. it makes me unable to feel comfortable in school and I'm constantly in a flight or fight state of mind. 

i feel like a lot of stuff has changed in my life (figuring colleges out, friends) and it's fucking me up. ive been thinking about bringing up medication to my doctor because im starting to feel like I've had enough. im honestly tired of getting into these deep low periods of my life where I want to die and I think of dying constantly and only the most negative thoughts are formed in my head. ive been trying some mindfulness/meditation but i feel like it doesn't improve anything for me
