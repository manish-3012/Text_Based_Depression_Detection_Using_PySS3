Is it weird that Iâ€™m excited?Iâ€™m leaving tonight, and Iâ€™m excited. Itâ€™s currently 11:44 pm. As soon as my brother goes to sleep, Iâ€™m going to do it. Iâ€™ve been planning this moment for a long time. Iâ€™ve been in pain for so long, and now, itâ€™s all going to end. I wonâ€™t have to worry about anything ever again. I havenâ€™t been happy in a long time, but at least I have tonight. Itâ€™s going to be so peaceful.
