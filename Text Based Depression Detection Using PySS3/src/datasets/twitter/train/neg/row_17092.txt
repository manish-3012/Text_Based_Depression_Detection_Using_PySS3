The progression of my outlookI used to spend every waking moment thinking about the world in a state of numbness and involuntarily still sometimes come back to this point of view. I would think everyone was selfish. Kindness doesnâ€™t exist; itâ€™s just an attempt to make someone feel better about themselves to provide an excuse for manipulating others. I thought the world was nothing more than a crudely oiled machine.

This was my ultimate coping mechanism. In almost any situation, an answer like â€œit doesnâ€™t matterâ€ would cleanly wrap up my perspective on the situation. To me, nothing mattered. Love was artificial, happiness was ignorance, kindness was selfishness. 

In the rawest element, I was right. Looking from the outside in shows a society structured on ignorance and selfishness. The world as a whole seems like nothing more than a â€œcultâ€ where individuality is sacrificed for blissful ignorance. 

But I think this outlook on life is too vague. 

To constantly lump people into categories and dehumanize those around you is to completely overlook everything that makes up that individual. 

I remember walking around in high school and looking into the faces of those who passed me by and thinking of them as ignorant morons. I would see someone smile and think to myself â€œthat was fake, youâ€™re hiding from reality.â€ it was easy for me to say this, since I was never really feeling anything and the easiest assumption to draw was that everyone else was creating facades.

Over time I began to realize that my use of easy solutions like â€œnothing mattersâ€ and â€œeveryone is ignorantâ€ was my impenetrable wall of defense. I had so much anger, loneliness, frustration, and disparity built up that feeling nothing became better than feeling. And with an answer so conclusive, I never had to feel anything. At least it seemed. 

One day during my finals week, I got a call from my sister to let me know my brother was ODing on fentanyl and would most likely die. I could no longer devalue everything around me. Someone I loved; someone I genuinely cared for was dying and there was nothing I could do. This was a breaking point. I suddenly felt everything that i has been repressing my whole life. The worst part seemed to be that I couldnâ€™t kill myself since I couldnâ€™t put my family through 2 deaths in the same day. 

Fortunately, my brother survived and life continued. But this intense wave of emotion that I had felt during my reaction was enough to bring feeling back into me. When the numbness had initially been broken I was flushed with a wave of pure darkness and anger but Iâ€™m glad now that I stuck through it. I didnâ€™t kill myself even though I VERY much wanted to. 

As time passed and as I regained my sense of emotion, I began to value the life I have been given and the lives of those around me. Regarding my outlook on life, i realized that no simple answer like â€œit doesnâ€™t matterâ€ will be as conclusive as one may presume. I (very) slowly began to take off the shit colored glasses that had managed to keep me blind to the world around me. 

Iâ€™m not saying all this to make you feel like any sort of progression will be easy or neat or structured. Iâ€™m just trying to remind you that to allow yourself to be, you must allow yourself to feel.
