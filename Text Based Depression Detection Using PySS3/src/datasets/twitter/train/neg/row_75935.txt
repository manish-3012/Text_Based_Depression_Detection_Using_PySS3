driving testi have my third driving test coming up on tuesday. i donâ€™t think i can do it. i very nearly killed myself after my first driving test and attempted after the second. itâ€™s humiliating. in my driving lessons, the instructors are incredibly comfortable, giving me virtually no instructions and even going on their phones while i drive. iâ€™ve had multiple different instructors tell me i didnâ€™t need to come back for any more lessons and that i was bound to pass. and yet i havenâ€™t. i donâ€™t know whatâ€™s wrong with me. absolute idiots and assholes who learned to drive after me have passed before me - and they speed, do burnouts, have even crashed once, and they passed. i feel like the world is against me. tuesday will decide if i live or die.
