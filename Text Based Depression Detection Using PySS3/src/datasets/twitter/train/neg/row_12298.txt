i want to be betterwhenever i encounter a small issue my first response tends towards suicide. i just think "I don't want to deal with this issue. i don't want to deal with the life I'm living." I don't take action on these thoughts but I do end up not moving at all (depression, not showering, stuck in bed). i don't want to live like this, so i want to live better. any advice on suicide as the first resort or the resulting actions (or lack thereof)?
