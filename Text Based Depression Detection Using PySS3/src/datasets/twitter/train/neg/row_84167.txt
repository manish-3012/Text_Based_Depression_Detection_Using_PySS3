I want do die for being a manI just don't understand how any guy is able to live their lives happily in this day and age. Rampant misandry, an ever increasing state of loneliness and a god-awful dating scene, i would say that its actually stupid not to blow your brains out if you're a guy. Looks define absoloutely everything in life and it's only going to get worse. I dont want to live in a society that treats me this way. On top of climate change and general poverty everywhere thats going to fuck everyone in a few decades, i'd rather just die now. I fucking hate being a man.
