I think I'm going to off myself over a cat.
The toll this is taking on me is phenomenal, like absolutely batshit crazy. That little shit was my best fucking friend and she recently went missing. As of now, there's not a single night I don't cry myself to sleep. 
As pathetic as this will sound, she was the only thing keeping me going. Not my friends or family, however a cat named Persephone. 
I miss her so much, every aspect of her. She was the drawer that hid the sharp things away, the only thing in my life that gave me the favor of equally returned love.
I am so sickeningly alone and all I could ever want is for my best friend to come back home to me.
