Letting fate decideSo long story short me and my boyfriend broke up back in February. We've remained friends as much as we can and we've continued to have sex. Honestly indont think he ever liked me like a girlfriend, and I think he feels guilty for dumping me which is why he still sometimes hangs around me. So he has been ignoring me for weeks on end, barely talking to me, not wanting to hang out which is fine. So imma let fate decide. If he rejects hanging out with me again I'm gonna do it. If not I'll postpone it  either way I'm not going to tell him any of that because he doesn't need guilt over something not his fault.
