once again i am a failure in every aspect of my lifeim stuck in a full time job that isnt gonna get me anywhere
ive taken such a long break from school that i dont know if i have the drive to go back
im singlehandedly driving my relationship into the ground
i have exactly 2 friends who i still talk to
i feel like theres no hope for me and that ill never get better and that theres no point in me getting better cause nothing in my life will go well
