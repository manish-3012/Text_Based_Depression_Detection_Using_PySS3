This life isn't for meI get it im not perfect, ive got my flaws but when i say i spend majority of my time thinking of how to help people i mean it. As a kid all i thought of was how to be of help to anyone, its as if i chose that as a career, but for someone who strives to see people happy I am not happy....im a huge disappointment to my dad, who for my whole life ive always wanted to impress....i just want him to be proud of me, but with the way things are going with my education, my health everything i think its about time i gave up and just left for good :(
