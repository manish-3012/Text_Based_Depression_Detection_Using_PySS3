i just want to be reassuredI feel like everything is pointless right now. 

People probably don't care who I am and just treat me good because I'm just there.

I wish I had more friends, but the one I thought I could trust left me for better popular people.

I wish I could say that after graduating with top grades I'd be happy, but after high school is college and after college is a job which would put me in an endless cycle. I don't want to grow up but I want to be free.

I want to run away but I know that people would try to find me and treat me better after because of pity. What if I want to be liked better without running away?

I've contemplated before but I'm scared to die and leave the ones I like. But do they even like me back? Am I secretly a burden to them?

I don't know what to do right now. I'm lost.
