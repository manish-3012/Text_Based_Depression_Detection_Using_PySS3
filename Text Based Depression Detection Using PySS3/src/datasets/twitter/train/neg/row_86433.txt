Life after death is good right?uh-uh. Iâ€™m done. Life feels like iâ€™m burning inside a closed casket. There is nowhere to run, nowhere to breathe, nowhere to feel. Death canâ€™t be worse than living in a hell. Death will take care of me. He will set me free to a better life. I was once close to killing myself and all I saw was love. So much better than staying inside this brain made to fuck itself up. I wasnâ€™t meant to excell. Iâ€™m one of the bad apples and death should let me accept that and forgive me.
