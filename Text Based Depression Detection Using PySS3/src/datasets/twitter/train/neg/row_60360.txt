I wish I had killed myself years ago when I was youngerAt least then people wouldâ€™ve at the very least pretended to feel sad, if only because I was young and â€œhad potentialâ€, now Iâ€™m a fat, ugly, unlikable, uneducated, 19 year old loser working a dead end job as a grocery store cashier who nobody in my entire personal life will miss or care about being dead. Goodbye forever.
