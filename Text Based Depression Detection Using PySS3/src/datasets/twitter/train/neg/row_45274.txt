Failed attempts at Suicide twice...I'm tired and jaded. I never feel good enough and my life seems to go in circles. My heart is too big and I love too much. Problem is, it never lasts.... I want out and I have unsuccessfully tried to end it twice. I intend on trying once more....but I want to do it with pills that way it's like Im just going to sleep. What can I mix and take to accomplish this?
