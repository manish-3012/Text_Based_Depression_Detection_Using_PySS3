I keep hurting peopleFuck man I really tried. I tried so hard to communicate, to be a better person, to help people. But now no one wants to talk to me. I tried so so hard

I realized Iâ€™m an aspie recently and I always end up like this with all my friendships. I have nowhere to go, and everyone will just think its an excuse. Iâ€™m so tired of trying and I canâ€™t even see when I do bad shit until its too late or someone tells me.
What the fuck is wrong with me 

Iâ€™m so angry at myself and no one wants to help me because im a despicable human being!!! People Get to know me and then im just a toxic influence on them and people think i use them. They think i dont care

Fuck!!! Fuck What the fuck do i do . please hjelp me im so tired of this. Im tired of being bad. Its so hard to be a good guy
