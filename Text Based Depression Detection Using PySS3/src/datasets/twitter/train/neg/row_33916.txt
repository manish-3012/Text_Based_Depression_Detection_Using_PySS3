The most perfect girl I've ever known, an angel, left me. We stopped talking entirely. I am empty. I can't go on.I promised her if she left I wouldn't kill myself but she's gone and I'm weaker than I thought. Maybe when she learns one day that I did it she will be a little happy that I literally could not live without her. I love you honey. I can't go on. You won't respond to my email. I don't know why. I just can't go on like this.
