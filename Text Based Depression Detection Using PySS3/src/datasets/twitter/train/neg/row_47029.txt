i have the pills and the beer - just give me one more reason.i'll never end up going through transition
quit my job and was denied for welfare because my waste of an anxiety ridden ass didn't hand in the papers and now I have no money again.
I'm just wasting my counsellor and doctor's time, they don't know how to help me and I Don't blame them.

Please. I've ruined everything and I'm too shity to fix it and I don't know what to do I just wasted everyones time for 20 years and I'm so mixed up and fucking negative to everyone about everything and I deny all attempts to help me. I'm so fucking burnt out on life.

I'm just fucking done.
