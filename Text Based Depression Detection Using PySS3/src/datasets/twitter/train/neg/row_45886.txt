Scientific evidence shows I'll never be happy and I should dieI'm in my late 20s still no friends or girlfriend. I suck at socializing. Despite a degree, I'm stuck in high stress low salary work. My mother is sick and disabled and I'm stuck with my sister caring for her until she finally dies. I live in the south and am not a part of its culture. I wasn't born rich and my education was just mediocre. I've accomplished nothing of note in my years. I never did anything productive as a child. The evidence shows people like me are impossible to save so I really should die to escape the misery and torment.
