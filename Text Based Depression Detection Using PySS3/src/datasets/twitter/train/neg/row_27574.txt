WorthlessI 30 last month.

 I look at my sisters, and feel inadequate. Tturnedhey've all accomplished great things. Me? Nothing. Not a damn thing. Even my sister who has neglected her children and abandoned them gets praise from my family for her intelligence (she went through undergrad and law school on full ride scholarships) and her skill in crochet (award winning).

 I'm just a vet tech. I might feel good sometimes about rescuing animals, rehabbing them, finding them homes. All I get is criticism from my family. "ANOTHER animal?" Still treated as a ten year old. I have no discernable skills. Nothing I can show and say,  "Hey, look at this great thing I can do!" 

My boyfriend, he doesn't love me in the way a boyfriend should love his girlfriend. I am too broke to move out. Sometimes I think he knows that and that's why I'm still here. 

I think people just feel sorry for me sometimes because I have illnesses and injuries that prevent me from doing things other people can do. Things I love to do. I don't want that to be who I am. I want people to be PROUD of me. I want to LOVE life, and I just don't. 

I have no friends. No hopes anymore. Everything I wanted to achieve dashed by bad lungs and chronic pain. 

I can't even cry. Oh how I wish I could. 

I feel sick. What's the point anymore. Why do I keep going. Every day, that question looms over me like a monster, getting closer and closer to me. I can barely get it out of my mind now. I'm a waste of space. My days off I've started spending laying in bed, doing nothing, because I just don't have the will or the energy to do anything else. 

Therapy hasn't helped. I stopped going. I felt like my psychologist felt the same way about me... that I'm useless. 

This fucking cat sitting in my lap is my only source of comfort. The only thing in life that I KNOW wants me here. Pathetic. 

Now I'm exhausted.
