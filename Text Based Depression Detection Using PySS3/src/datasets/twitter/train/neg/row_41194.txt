I don't know what to sayI hurt someone, really bad. And now they've had to cut me out of their life for a while and I don't know when they'll be back.

The thing is, this person was my only support system. Other people try to help me and I can't thank them enough for trying but this person knew me inside out. They kept me stable, they made me happy, I made them happy and I threw it all away.

It's taken all my willpower to not message them because they've made so much progress but I don't have the strength anymore. I'm just scared I'm too tired to carry on I can't deal with it and I feel like I'm going to end it, this was the last straw on top of everything else in my life. I hate myself for being so selfish.
