I want to die because life is too painful and Iâ€™m sick of livingI canâ€™t live like this, depression, anxiety, paranoia, voices in my head. Itâ€™s too painful. My psychologist tells me to just change my perspective on things but itâ€™s not that easy, I just want to die so that the pain could dissapear once and for all, Iâ€™m sick of living like this. Donâ€™t tell me that life gets better because I have been waiting for so many years, 6 years of crippling depression has destroyed me
