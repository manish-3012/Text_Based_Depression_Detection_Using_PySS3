I just want to finally end it.Things won't get better because they've been the same for the past 3 years. Everday is filled with agony because of my rare disease (don't ask me which one) and my mental illness. Everyday I feel so light headed and like I'm about to faint. I'm sad all the time but only a few notice it.

Mental illness can go away,
but a medical condition will stay forever, why suffer?
