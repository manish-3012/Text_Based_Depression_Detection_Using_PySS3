Done With LivingIt has been the 1000th time I've tried committing suicide this day.
It is absolutely amazing and frustrating how I have not died yet.
I currently have a psychotic ex looking to kill me...
Should I just let her catch up to me?
I've been running for a very long time...
Maybe it's time to stop...
