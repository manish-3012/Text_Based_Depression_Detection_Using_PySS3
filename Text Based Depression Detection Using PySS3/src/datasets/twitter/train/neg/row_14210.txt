Need Constructive AdviceAlright so, I've been struggling with depression for many many years. Similar to a lot of you I would imagine. I've managed to get through the days as they come, but the last couple of months have been excruciating. Perhaps COVID-19 has a big contribution towards what's happening for me here, but I'm in a head space again where suicide seems very reasonable and appealing.

I detest my job. I work hard as fuck and have been demanding full time hours for a long time now. Over three years. I need the income now more then anything. I've tried working other jobs here and there. But obviously nothing is enjoying or fulfilling. I have a successful career as drummer also regarding popularity and demand for my work... But even that has been taxing at best. I struggle to enjoy it anymore after all these years. My social life sees a lot of people contacting me... But they all want something and don't seem to care for legitament friendship. 

I know these probably sound like trivial as fuck problems, but the reason I think those things fuck me up mentally so badly is because I also link them to my well being and having a successful future for a family to rest on in the long run.

Do you guys have any advice on how to improve this fucking mindset? Or contribute any comments? Hit me with criticism too. I'm not a fucking mess, but I sure as fuck am not happy with my life anymore. I'm happy to hear what people have to say.
