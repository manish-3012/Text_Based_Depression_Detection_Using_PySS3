Just want to die, the usualI am autistic and I go to a special ed school. Let me tell you that it's hell for an autistic person. There are so many cracks in their system and so many fail school because their system sucks ass. It's never clear what the fuck you're supposed to do, your weekly schedule changes every damn week and the teacher is yelling at kids all the time. Not to mention the fights that happen nearly every week. And there's nothing I can do about it. Literally nothing. I go to my therapist once a week and I've told her so many times that 1 hour is never enough because every week is an uphill battle. I asked for meds because I want to get rid of these fucking highs and lows everyday. It takes four weeks before I get an answer back. I've made countless plans to kill myself but I never fucking do it even though I should. Right now I just wanna cut my wrists and bleed to death. Or go to sleep and never wake up. I hate being told "we want you to live" because it means I have to suffer in order for them to be satisfied. I have already decided months ago I'm going to kill myself before my next birthday which is in may.
Nobody listens and I wanna get out. I've been getting therapy since around march this year and I've been suicidal since at least the start of 2018, not to mention the years of depression before that. It doesn't ever get better.
