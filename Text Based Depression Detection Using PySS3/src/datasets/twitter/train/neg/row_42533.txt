someone please give me a reason to stay aliveive been spiraling recently. i dont see much in my future anymore. im 19, but i think ill have to drop out of college soon because of my dads cancer. or ill have to enroll in a community college, i dont know yet. im giving myself til january to decide.

i feel so done. having covid in october fucked me up so bad. it had such a huge toll on me that just hearing a cough (and oh.. do my parents cough) makes me tear up. ive been enjoying the time i have alone because i dont have to hear anyone and its just me. 

i feel like its over for me. i dont know if ill actually attempt, but i just wish things could change. as of right now, things arent looking very good for my family, and it will get worse. its so difficult going my day to day knowing it hasnt even gotten to the worst part yet. its like every day im getting closer to the climax of the story - my dad passing. then after that, i dont know what ill do. i really dont. 

my childhood insurance is expiring in 2021 when i turn 20. i live in a red state, so there really isnt much for me in terms of mental health help. ive looked, trust me. even my buddy says the psych hospitals suck. i dont see a way out.

i just wish i was like the other 19 year olds. i wish i didnt have to have these worries. i wish i could have had a normal transition to adulthood.

i wanna be a teacher, but i did some googling, and apparently teaching is a really competitive job. so even if i study really hard, theres no guarantee i get the job. then whats the point? ill just be broke? 

does it get better? does it really get better? or is that something people just tell us so we dont kill ourselves? 

my family doesnt speak english so ive been doing all of this myself. fafsa, insurance, appealing claims with said insurance, dealing with our landlord, hospital bills, its so overwhelming, i feel crushed. 

i dont even know what i want. i just wish time would stop.

im rambling. ill stop.
