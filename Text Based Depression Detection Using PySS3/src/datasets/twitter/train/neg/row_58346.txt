advice much needed from those of you who are suicidal/ have been suicidalone of my closest friends is planning on killing themselves, and I would love advice from those who feel similarly. theyâ€™re such a beautiful person and I want to help them before itâ€™s to late or I donâ€™t know how Iâ€™ll live with myself. Whatâ€™s the best thing I can tell someone that has no will to live? If I was your friend, is there anything I can say that might make you change your mind. anything is much appreciated, thank you :)
