Iâ€™m doneItâ€™s  too much, thereâ€™s too much happening and I canâ€™t cope. Maybe this is a cry for help but damn if I donâ€™t need it. Iâ€™ve been depressed for so long and read so many goodbyes on this subreddit, I donâ€™t want to die but I donâ€™t see another option. Iâ€™ve built this image to other people of having myself togetherness so well but after everything thatâ€™s happened Iâ€™m falling apart. I lost my job four months ago, and my roommates were able to help me until now, weâ€™re getting evicted on Monday and Iâ€™m not going back to being homeless. Iâ€™ve let them down, Iâ€™ve let my family down and itâ€™s not going to continue any more. If my family finds this, then know Iâ€™m sorry. But I canâ€™t be a failure anymore.
