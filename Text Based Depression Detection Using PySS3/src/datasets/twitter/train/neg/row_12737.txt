I know I should tell someone but I'm so scaredI'm 22 years old and I don't know what to do with myself anymore. It seems like every other day for the past year I've seriously contemplated suicide. It could be longer but my sense of time has become so skewed from my depression. I barely graduated high school and it's been 5 years in college and I still haven't completed my gen ed. I feel like my family is just waiting for me to finally kill myself like my mother did. My brother even admitted that he doesn't see me ending up any other way.

My dad recently told me where he keeps his guns. They're not even under lock and key, and he and my sister are often out of the house. I know I should tell my dad what's going on, but I'm afraid of what he'll say to me. I was going to tonight, but then I realized there was no proper fallback for my dogs and even in death I don't want anything bad to happen to them.

I'm so scared that by admitting I'm still like this, I'll be abused again for it. But I'm also so afraid of trying again and failing and having to continue on.
