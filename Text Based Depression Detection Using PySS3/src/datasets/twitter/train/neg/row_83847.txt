Why the stigma against suicide for ugly and foreveralone guys and girls?We hear the "this will improve" bullshit a lot. But it never will. You're always going to be destined for a life of suffering and rejection. You will never be someone's first choice. Always the last one.

This is stuck in skin, bones, and muscle. People will bring up plastic surgery, but the technology just isn't there in 2018 to make an significant differences to actually ugly people. It will help, but it won't be enough. Many people will jump on the "technology is improving" bandwagon which also is a load of nonsense since medical technology advancement is measured in decades, not years. And you'll be far gone when you're in your 40s and 50s.

When your life is only suffering, what's the point of even living? Maybe hell exists. Maybe you may reincarnate in a worse state. But for some people, that's probably not worse than living this life. 

I'll never be normal. I'll always be someone's last choice. I can never live a life of normal romantic relationships. I'll always have to accept that if I ever get in a relationship, its either since the other side has to settle for me or because the other side wants to use me for something else.

I'll never be wanted and loved for me.
