My toxic bf is suicidalSo I (17f) been in a relationship with this man (18m) for about 6 months now. He is extremely depressed and has these suicidal episodes at least 3 times a week. Heâ€™s also very toxic about it to, saying that he hates me and that he wishes I was gone so he could kill himself without feeling any guilt. He refuses to go to a therapist or confront his family about it. His toxicity has made me want to break up with him, but I know that if I leave he will commit suicide. I care about him so I donâ€™t want him to die, but I need to get out of this relationship before he pulls me down with him. I have no way to contact his family or anyone around him because we have only dated online. Can I contact officials or something so that will help him? I donâ€™t know what to do.
