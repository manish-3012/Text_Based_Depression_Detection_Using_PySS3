I want to kill myselfI've been feeling shittier than usual lately, and i honestly don't want to continue.  
I am so, so............. tired. I don't have energy for all this. I didn't ask for any of it.  
The only reason I am still alive is because my mom would literally have a stroke if i did it.

I hate that i should stick around just so it won't disappoint others, when i am miserable.
