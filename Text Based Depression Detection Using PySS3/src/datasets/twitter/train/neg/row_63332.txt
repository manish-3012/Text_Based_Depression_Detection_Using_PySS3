Iâ€™ve successfully convinced myself that I am a horrible person.I seriously wish death upon myself because I am a waste of space and air. Iâ€™m almost 19 but Iâ€™ve been fucked up for most of my life. Being sexually abused by multiple men at the age of 6 really fucks someone up. I describe myself as a realist I guess? Iâ€™m just so blunt and negative sometimes I want myself to shut the fuck up. Most of my so called friends have given up on me. I donâ€™t know how Iâ€™ve made it this far but Iâ€™m always so close to doing it. I think about suicide all the time. Whenever I look at my ceiling I like to picture myself hanging. Sometimes I think about what would happen if I just cut my throat and how it would take minutes for me to pass but I get scared. I donâ€™t want my parents walking in on a mess. I cry and I cry and I cry so fucking much Iâ€™m just so tired. Iâ€™m tired of being myself. I always wish I was normal and that those bad things didnâ€™t happen to me when I was little. I fucking hate how my brain plays tricks on me and manages to find the bad in everything. I hope to end things soon because Iâ€™ve suffered enough. I just made a reddit account right now to post this. I hope when I die,, my sister or someone snoops in my phone and finds this post. I love you.
