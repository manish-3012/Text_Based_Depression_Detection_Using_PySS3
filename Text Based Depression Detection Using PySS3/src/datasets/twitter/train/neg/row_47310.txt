UnbelievableI made a post earlier when I was obviously in a very dark place. I received a message from someone shortly after and right away felt a little better that someone took the time out of their day to actually attempt to talk with me, only to read that this person completely ignored what I had to say and instead said "hey man, I feel bad asking this but could I have 50 dollars. You'll probably end your life anyway, you don't need it." Like thanks man, thanks for making me feel even more worthless than I did before. He didn't say anything to even attempt to be sympathetic, just wanted to use a lost soul for their money. It just seems like no one really cares, everyone uses me... ðŸ˜”
