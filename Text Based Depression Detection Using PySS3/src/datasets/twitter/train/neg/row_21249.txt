Need some courageI feel so hopeless, worthless, I don't understand how if god the universe or what ever it is that's throwing all this bad things in life at me why isn't giving me the courage to act on it and just die.. just when I feel the need to do something my heart breaks even more in a million pieces just to think I'll leave my daughter's with out a mother and I would be leaving them with a heartless father, I can't just kill my self and leave them with one of the person's that has helped brought me down to this but I can't leave him cause I don't have a job or a car I don't have a mother or a father for support I lost all my friends to give my life to this man and my only people are my elderly grandparents that can't work or help me with my kids I'm scared for my daughter's and for them I am still alive but I'm destroyed inside living with a man that doesn't understand my feelings where my only answer to him is a yes even if I want to say no where sex is a must because if I deny he gets mad and makes my life even more miserable a man I doesn't understand that my daughters go first but even if he tries to understand he still upset that they need mom a man that runs in my face I don't have a job but when I try to get one he makes me.feel insecure that no one will hire me cause I'm fat a guy that screams at me get a job I can't do this anymore I dyeng inside but I must force a smile for my daughter's and grandparents I feel like I help everyone around me but no one is there to help me with out judging me and also asking me why this why that why isn't help offer with out judgement why is it that no one listens with out thinking your dum for staying in that situation..
