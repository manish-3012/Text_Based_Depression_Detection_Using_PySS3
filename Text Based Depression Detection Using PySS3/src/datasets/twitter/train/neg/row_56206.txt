I should be dead right nowRead my post history and realize the mindset I was in last night. That is how I've been feeling for the last year. The voice in my head grew more and more dominant and brutal. Yesterday, I tried to end it. 

Its still surreal and scary to think about even a couple hours later. It was two in the morning, I got my keys and went down to my garage. I sat in the driver seat and thought for a minute, thinking this was for the betterment of the human race. 

I turned the key, not even thirty seconds later the same voice telling me to kill myself starts fucking SCREAMING at me to stop. Apologizing for being so mean to me, and BEGGING me to open the garage door. I panicked and opened the door and ran out of the garage coughing, my head felt light, my arms were shaking as this fucking voice in my head is telling me all these positive things and how im not genetic waste, im just someone who is in a rut and needs help. Then tell me to wait here, someone is coming. 

So there I am, leaning against the wall, car is off, just crying my ass off. When two of these college aged dudes walk over and one asks if im ok. I say I am, I just hit a rough patch and need to calm down, he looks at me like he knows this is more than a fucking rough patch, but still invites me up to his apartment with some other dudes, we smoked some weed, played some halo, it was overall a good night. The voice in my head was silent, and when it did talk, it was so overwhelmingly positive. 

I'm still feeling really surreal right now. Like I should be dead. But here I am. 

I'm going to improve myself to my fullest from now on. I'm going to start loving life :)
