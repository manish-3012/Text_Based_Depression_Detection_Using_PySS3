its been 6 months into the year and ive had 3 attemptsright now im just trying to pretend that im okay so that i can successfully kill myself without worrying people beforehand.

i just really want to die

ive written my letter 

ive said my goodbyes a million times already

i just can't do anything because someones going to find me and 'save' me then ill be an even bigger fuck-up that what i am already. 

im tired and done
