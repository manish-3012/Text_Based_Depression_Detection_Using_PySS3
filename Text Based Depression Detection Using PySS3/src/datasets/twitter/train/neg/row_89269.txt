One persons joys can be anotherâ€™s misery.Most people enjoy music right? When you listen to a band perform, you feel excited and intrigued. Thatâ€™s not how I feel. I am a junior in high school who plays an instrument. I used to really enjoy playing music. Everything changed when I entered high school. I have been unsuccessful every time I try to get into marching band, when I know I can handle it. My band director has said that Iâ€™m not good enough on multiple occasions, and it has lower my thoughts of myself. To try and combat this, I have started exercising and eating healthier to make me feel better about myself, but itâ€™s not stopped me from constantly thinking of how shitty I am as a musician. It just makes me sad and upset every time I have to listen to bands as a group. Is there anything I can do to get out of this depressing situation? Thanks for listening. (I donâ€™t plan on committing suicide as I have a lot of anime and video games to play still).
