iâ€™m going to kill myself on halloweeni have struggled for years and years with depression, anxiety, self harm, ptsd and suicide. i lost my teenage years to mental illness and i hate it. 

iâ€™ve had three attempts at ending my life but obviously they didnâ€™t work.. i ended up being hospitalised for one of them and i really hope i donâ€™t fuck up with this one and fail because thereâ€™s absolutely no way iâ€™m going back to a hospital.

iâ€™ve been thinking about it for quite some time on when iâ€™m going to do it, and last week i got some rope and new blades and decided iâ€™m doing it on the 31st. in the early hours of the morning iâ€™m going to get up and drive to the tallest bridge in my state and hang myself. itâ€™s been closed for years, but people still go check it out even though itâ€™s illegal. 

i have everything planned out. i have my notes written out to my family and roommate and i have special instructions for one of my family members on what to do with my belongings. 

i donâ€™t know if this is weird to say, but iâ€™m kind of excited for saturday. i finally get relief after all these years. no more pain. no more sadness. no more terrible withdrawals from drug use. itâ€™ll be all gone. i feel a sense of calmness for once in my life. 

thanks for reading. i guess this is my goodbye.
