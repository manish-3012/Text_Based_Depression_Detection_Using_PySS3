I'm not sure how much longer I can go on.I suffer from depression and after 10+ years of being on some anti-deppresant or another, I'm tired of fighting. I have been living day to day for 10 long years, hoping that if I held out, and tried to pull myself out of this hole, things would get better. But the reality is I'm 30, overweight, an alcoholic, and live in a tiny apartment alone. Work was the only bright side to my life, then I was fired. I'm working at a new job, and I feel like the axe will fall at any time. I'm expendable in every way. I have never been in a relationship, ever, I've never felt love in that way. I've been rejected countless times. The only thing that has kept me alive is my family, my brother and my parents. Ending it will finally bring me peace, but I know it will destroy their lives and hurt the people around them. My family knows of my condition, but I hide a lot of it from them because I know they can't save me, they have their own problems to deal with anyway. Only I can save myself. Unfortunately feeling that I am trapped in a world I no longer want to live in, but at the same time cannot die has led me to feel worse. It's gotten to the point that I have started to become selfish in not caring what happens after I die, knowing I will not care once I am dead. All I see when I reflect on my life is sadness, anger, and regret. The problems I had when I was a child/teenager are the same as the problems I have today, they've only become more sophisticated with age. I'm tired of fighting it, of telling myself things will get better when I know they won't. I'm trying to hold on to hope as long as possible, but I feel it slipping away.
