Arenâ€™t you tired of reading from me?And once again Iâ€™m here, in bed early to hide from my wife, wishing I could die. The only thing that therapy had achieved is that now I can patiently observe myself as I have an episode, and look down on myself as I think to how pathetic I am. Tired of my own thoughts and my own writing. Praying for death as my saviour. Looking for some relief in one of you feeling pity of me and writing a one-liner of sympathy. Small things can be a major achievement when youâ€™ve been depressed for two years. In reality, I still donâ€™t believe that depression is a thing, I just believe I see the world more clearly than all you fools that look forward to tomorrow. If killing oneself was easy Iâ€™d be dead a hundred times by now. What a waste of oxygen and food.
