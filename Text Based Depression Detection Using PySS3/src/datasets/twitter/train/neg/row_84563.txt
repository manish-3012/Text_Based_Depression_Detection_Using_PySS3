Want to commit Suicide but scaredFor a long time now, Iâ€™ve been struggling. Iâ€™m 19. In grade 11, I tried committing suicide after everything became too much. I swallowed a bunch of pills. I was taken to the hospital, almost admitted into a psych ward, but I managed to tell them I didnâ€™t mean it, that it was a mistake, and they just kept me overnight instead. Ever since, I just think â€œwhat if I didnâ€™t surviveâ€ or â€œwhat if I doubled the amount I tookâ€. I wouldnâ€™t be here then. And Iâ€™d like that. Because ever since, Iâ€™ve been too scared to do it. To die. Iâ€™m scared of what comes after. Or what Iâ€™ll miss out on. But at the same time, I canâ€™t take it much longer. Iâ€™m so sad, so numb. I hide it, fairly well. If someone asks how Iâ€™m doing I say â€œgreat, hbu?â€.  But thereâ€™s only so much I can do. Every time I have a rough night, which happens a lot, I take my medication, over the dose that Iâ€™m supposed to. Iâ€™m working my way up. Working my way up to the dose that will end it all. Im rambling. I know. Iâ€™m just asking for advice, how do I quit being afraid of dying?
