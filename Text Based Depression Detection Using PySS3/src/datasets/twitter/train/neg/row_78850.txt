Do you ever be like â€œthis is a perfect time to kill myself.â€This happens all the time and when Iâ€™m alone my brain shows a complete plan in my head how to kill myself, if itâ€™s late at night and Iâ€™m about to get in the tub i have thoughts about getting my blade and yeah...If Iâ€™m taking my medication, my brain is like â€œTake more and die, your parents wonâ€™t notice til the morning.â€ 
Am I the only one who has experiences like this ? Or no ? Is this even normal ?
