I need helpI've been thinking about killing myself for some years now, I could go on in life and get to college but everything seems to get worse and worse as time goes by.

I've never had a real girlfriend and the girl that I'm so in love with lives in another continent, she lately has been ignoring me to be with her friends, and I don't have any money to go see her. 

I'm doing bad in college and I don't want to lose my opportunity to study there because it is my dream to end my carreer there, but I think that's coming to an end at the end of this month. 

My mom doesn't understand how I feel, or anyone around me for that matter, I feel alone all the time and it feels like the world is about to end. I'm seriously thinking about jumping off a bridge but I'm fearful of what could happen, I don't know what to do at this point I've never felt so empty in my life. 

I wish this all was just a bad dream.
