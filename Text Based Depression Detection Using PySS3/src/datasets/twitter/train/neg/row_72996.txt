I'm 27 and still live at homeMy parents don't take me seriously and my father is verbally abusive. Last week I cut my finger accidentally while chopping ginger. I went to put a band aid on it and he joked that it looked like a suicide attempt. I said suicide is nothing to joke about, yet he said I had no sense of humor. 

My family's Evangelical Christian while I'm agnostic. I am also bisexual, yet prefer women over men. My last partner said I was humiliating and embarrassing to be around. I've never had a fulfilling relationship where I can look back with good memories. The partners I've had before her were also abusive. One raped me as well and fucked with my mind. One case: he knew I have a phobia against dolls and mannequins and would joke that he'd lock me in a room full of them in the dark. 

My family combined with a lack of a love life drive me to believe I shouldn't be alive. The only thing I have going on is my school. My family do not help me with paying for college. I've worked full-time through college to pay for my tuition and text books. I started at a community college, and am finishing at an elite private school. 

I just need love and support, especially when I'm at the restaurant answering phone calls and taking shit from bad customers. I wish I could have my own life, but the money I make isn't enough to support myself outside the home. I grew up and still live in NYC. The rent is way too expensive, even with a roommate, and I'm on a waiting list for affordable housing. I don't want to bother people I know to sleep on their couch. My father is too invested in his own projects to help me, none of which are successful and make him file for bankruptcy. 

I'm debating if I should check myself into a hospital, but that'd overturn my heavy school/work schedule. I don't know what to do.
