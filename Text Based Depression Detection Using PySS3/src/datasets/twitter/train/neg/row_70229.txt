WHY ARE PEOPLE SO STUPID ?!?!?!?!?!Okay I've been on this for quite some time and I appreciate how people try to help one another and give away their time in hope to change someone's mind for the better. But what I dont understand is WHY ARE SOME PEOPLE ENCOURAGING SUICIDE under every thread ? 

I see many posts that say "I hope you find peace on the other side" blah blah "I hope you find something better" blah blah blah "See you on the other side" blah blah blah like what the fuck is wrong with such people ? The first pinned post warns us about accidentally encouraging suicide by using such words. Still some fucking idiots do that almost under every thread.
