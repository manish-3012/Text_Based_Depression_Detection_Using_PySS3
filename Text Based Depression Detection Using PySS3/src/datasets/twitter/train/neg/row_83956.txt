Daily ThoughtsI am 36. I co-own a successful company. I am married, have college degrees, have had a relatively stable life sans a divorce. However, since I was 14/15 I can remember thinking of suicide at least once a day, sometimes more. I would fantasize while doing 80 on the highway of Jerking the wheel and sending my truck flipping, or blowing my brains out, getting lost intentionally in remote locations and dying alone. I have found that "success" has made these thoughts stronger and more vivid. My employees are loving life, and I feel I take care of them, but they could give 2 shits about the toll they have on me. And then the clients,  partner, everything, it all sucks, and I fucking hate it. I don't know what it will take, if anything to make these thoughts go away. I don't plan on it, but sometimes I want to.
