I can't ask for help/How do you ask for help?I'm not really sure what to say. I've had thoughts of killing myself since on(80%) and off(20%) since I started working for an attorney as a legal secretary. That part isn't really relevant, but I have trouble remembering what year it was, so that is my "time." I think it might have been 2011 or 2012. 

Good things and bad things have happened since then. I got married; had to live with my in-laws because of money issues; had a baby; bought a house; get to stay home with my child. Through the good and bad things, suicide has been on my mind many times. Usually when I see any opportunity, I think to myself, oh I could do it now. Then I always think to myself that I know I can't/won't do it. When will I get past that, though? Is it just going to click one day?

I want to ask for help, but something is holding me back. I don't know what it is. I think I'm going to say something to someone, then nothing comes out.
