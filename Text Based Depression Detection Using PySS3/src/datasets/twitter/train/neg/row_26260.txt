The nightmares are returningI'm falling back into depression again and I'm scared. I don't like it... I don't like being depressed. I'm having nightmares like clockwork and that's a huge sign I'm falling back into it. I called out of work today and I feel ashamed. I love my job. I like what I do. I'm just not feeling good again and I hate it. I don't like being alone. It's making me feel suicidal. I spend like 70% of my time alone. The other 30% is working. I eat alone, sleep alone, spend free time alone. Alone alone alone. I wish my friends cared about me more. Nobody has messaged me in over a week. Am I just destined to live and die alone? Fuck. I hate my life.
