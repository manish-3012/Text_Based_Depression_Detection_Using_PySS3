Last note..I am 18.. and I will commit suicide today, 26th of September~ My story you want to hear? Simple, I am getting abused my family us abusing me, my classmates is making fun of me. 

before I die I wanted to tell you this guys, don't trust people you don't know, they are cruel one of them pretended to be my friend what did I get ? I got stabbed with a knife on my chest. I tried everything I had a bad past with drugs.. my boyfriend knows of'et and he thinks that I am all right.

nothing is going as I wished, I just wanted to smile for once in my life after 5 years of depression I came to the point wher I will say goodbye.

You may think this is not a reason? Ive been abused so often in any way, none can imagine.

I will take my life by cutting my wrist open and taking sleeping pills.
My boyfriend... I love you so much I just wanted to thank all of you reading this and
I love you, I never meant to make you sad...
