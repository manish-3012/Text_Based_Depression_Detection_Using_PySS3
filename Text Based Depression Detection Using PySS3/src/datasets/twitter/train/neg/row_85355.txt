Iâ€™m Mentally Insane and Life Is OverwhelmingFor some background context, Iâ€™m a 16M who works on music and has a long distance relationship. Basically, my life is stuck and I donâ€™t feel like Iâ€™m making any progress in my career or in my relationship. Iâ€™m so depressed and I overthink so fucking much, and it makes me feel like a burden for everyone around me. To make it worse I see and hear things constantly. Things that arenâ€™t really there, and itâ€™s so fucking scary. I donâ€™t know what the hell Iâ€™m doing anymore. No matter how much Iâ€™ve worked on achieving my goals, I havenâ€™t gotten anywhere simply because life wonâ€™t allow for it. Iâ€™ve kept trying so hard to be optimistic, and Iâ€™ve been going to the gym because I was told itâ€™d help, but itâ€™s done nothing for me except make me healthier. I know this post is a damn mess, but this is how my life feels right now and I donâ€™t know where to take myself. I feel like that if this is my future, then Iâ€™d be better off dead. Things feel like theyâ€™ll only get worse from here
