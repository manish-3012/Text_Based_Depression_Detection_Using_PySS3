I'm scared for my little sister, she just sent me a message saying she's fighting suicidal thoughts.She's 21/F, 1 year post partum. She did have post partum depression, and she's been going to the emergency room every week for a pain in her stomach that they've never been able to diagnose. She'll get to the point where she's in tears and HAVE to go to the hospital because she's tired of being in pain, but they think it's all in her head.

Because of all this, she feels hopeless. This is her message.


&gt;I need help

&gt;I am fighting suicidal thoughts and I'm so afraid I'm gonna lose everything

&gt;I don't want to lose [1 yr old baby].

&gt;[Husband] keeps trying to help but he just keeps telling me its going to get better and it's not

&gt;I don't know what to do

&gt;My house is a mess and disgusting and I'm having pains

&gt;My body hurts and I can't clean

&gt;The people at the hospital didn't know what to do for me about my pain and now I feel like there's no help

&gt;I'm afraid if I try to get to help they will take baby from me



**I don't know how to help.** (I'm also leaving across the country in February)
