What friendship for :)I've a friend. I used to think that she was the one that I could put my trust. I trust and love her. She also said she loved me. And I always told her everything. She know about how suicidal I am. And how my family is. But she never cares. Even the simple "are you ok?" from her, is hard to hear. I always the one, who asks her, when the things go down for her. And what to expect? She never cares to ask. And now, she treat me like stranger. It hurts so much. Friendship never works for me :)

never thought that i will post here
