Oh god I need to die so badI can't do this. I can't keep living. Everything hurts so bad. I just need to make it stop. I need everything to stop. How can I stop the voices in my head that are ripping me apart inside. Death is the only way I can silence them. I need to end it. I wish I never existed.
