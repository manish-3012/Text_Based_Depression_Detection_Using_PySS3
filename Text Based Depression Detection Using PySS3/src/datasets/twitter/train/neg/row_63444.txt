Another manâ€™s car in my drivewayCame home to another manâ€™s car in my driveway of the home I helped to build. Received all the information I needed via text. 

My birthday was this week. Another decade gone of no friends to celebrate with, barely any family anymore, no reason to keep going so spent the day thinking about how I can go.
