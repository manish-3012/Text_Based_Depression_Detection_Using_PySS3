I can't do this much longer...The pain... Waking up everyday just to be greeted by overwhelming sadness and self-hating thoughts. How long am I supposed to just push on until "it gets better"? 

I managed to go away to college and make 0 friends... I hate this place. People always give me dirty, mean looks. I'm such a loser. 

I can't even focus on my school work anymore.... I just think about how I should do it...how I should end it all.  Laying in bed every night I just wish and hope I won't wake up in the morning, but of course I always do...just to be disappointed...
