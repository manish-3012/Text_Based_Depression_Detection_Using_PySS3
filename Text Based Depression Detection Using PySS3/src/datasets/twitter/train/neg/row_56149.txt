Why are you alive?A question I ask myself a million times a day. What makes other people live?

I'm not actively suicidal but I have no reason to live, not even one.
My family and friends (not that I have friends) don't matter because one day they'll see me die. So why not now?
Happiness doesn't matter, pleasure in life doesn't matter because it doesn't last. So why should I live?
Sorting out the problems in my life makes no difference because if I do end up sorting them out I'll die and if I don't I'll still die, so it's all pointless.
So why does it matter? Why does life matter? Why should I get through all of this just to get to the same outcome of death each time? I don't know my answer.

But why do you?
