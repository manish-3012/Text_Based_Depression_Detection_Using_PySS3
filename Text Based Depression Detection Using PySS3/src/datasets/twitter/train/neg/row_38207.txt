I don't knowI just don't know I can't handle anything I just feel so sad and empty I don't know what I feel, I can't believe I'm writing this I just can't handle anything I just cry and cry and destroy everything out of pure anger and sadness why am I writing this why I'm unwanted I just can't do it sometimes I'm happy I think I don't know what I feel i feel useless and I will probably leave this mood and feel something else then this will happen again then I won't know again I just don't know anything I'm a mistake why do I exist only to embaress myself to feel anger sadness I just don't know someone will probably comment something and someone will read the notification and then what's next sadness even more of a reason to end it I just don't know.
