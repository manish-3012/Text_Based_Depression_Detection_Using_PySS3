I've no drive, nothing keeping me hereI'm 25, mom stole my identity at 18 and gave me debt. emotional struggles when I tried college so I failed. all I've ever known was minimum wage work. body is in near constant pain from arthritis. physical labor is hard. been out of work for 3 years, back to living with my dad. medication was making me feel worse. therapy hit a wall and became a point of constant anger. family says they care but I havent gotten positive interactions from them in years. people only contact me to nag me.   
the last time I felt anything other than sadness or anger was when I was high on marijuana 5 years ago.  
all I have is the internet to distract me from walking to the nearest expressway and jumping off an overpass.   
I've no reason to be here anymore. I've never had a loved one. attempted suicide in the past and my cat was my only thing I had that made me hesitate and hang on. she's gone now.   
I've constant nightmares.  
my family wont say it but I know they feel like I'm a failure. and they're right.  
when I try to get work again and think I'm feeling a little better I get anxiety and vomit.   
I'm 102lbs at 5'6 and hardly eat. I often think about just letting myself starve to death because I'm already close to not eating anyways. nobody would notice I'm killing myself until it was too late. nobody checks in on me. I have no irl friends. I have internet friends but I don't like to bother them and at the end of the day my death wouldn't make a difference in their life.   
I hate who I see in the mirror. I'm 25 and I've accomplished nothing. I've no goals. I don't see a tomorrow for me so what difference does it make if that tomorrow never comes. I'm not going to talk to a suicide prevention hotline because if you show too much intent they call the cops on you.
