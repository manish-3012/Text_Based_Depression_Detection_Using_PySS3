why shouldn't i kill myself tonight?i'm 18, i'm a senior in high school and my boyfriend committed suicide. i called 911 for him because he sent me a picture with a cord tied around his neck but they didn't get to him fast enough. he was in a coma for a week and his parents took him off of life support because he didn't have enough brain activity. his parents didn't allow me at the funeral and wouldn't tell me why. i was the last person to ever talk to him. my ex boyfriend who i dated a few years ago and have stayed friends with since then got a new girlfriend and since has shut me out. my friends are flakey, my one true friend lives an hour away at college and only visits a few times a year. i have literally no one to talk to. my parents care about me and love me a lot and that's the only thing keeping me here. i can't see how my life can ever change for the better. how am i ever going to meet new people and improve anything?
