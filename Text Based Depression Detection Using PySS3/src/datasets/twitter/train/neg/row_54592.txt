Stop cutting now suicide urges are even strongerI have tried to quit cutting. I have self harmed for a very long time and I am not sure I am ready to give it up. But it has been one week now and I haven't cut. 

My hands are shaking, my head hurts, and I am more irritable than ever. 

More importantly my suicidal urges are ramped up. I have started writing my suicide note and planning my farewells. I hate my crazy brain
