I think Iâ€™m going to do it.I might do it. Iâ€™ve been in the worst depressive episode of my life, for probably over 2 months. Iâ€™ve been chronically depressed for 3 years, and I havenâ€™t been happy for as long as I can remember. I havenâ€™t been able to get out of bed or leave the house in days. My medication doesnâ€™t work. There isnâ€™t a single gender therapist in my immediate 15 miles that takes my insurance. I got aged out by my primary care provider who was a pediatrician, and havenâ€™t been able to get a doctor. Every time I try to get better, I realize that whatever being there is clearly doesnâ€™t want me to. So I might just end it all. Jump in front of a train. Iâ€™m fine with traumatizing the conductor. My friends will be sad, but theyâ€™ll forget about me eventually. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
