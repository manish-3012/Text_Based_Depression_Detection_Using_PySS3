Boredom and HappinessSo I'm in my mid twenties. I'm smart, athletic, attractive and bored. I don't get happy or sad the way other people do and I'm fairly sure i never have. The only way i can describe it is i am either bored or entertained. The only way i can stay entertained for very long is by solving puzzles. As I've gotten older solving puzzles is less and less effective until I recently completed degrees in Maths and Physics and am stumped what to do next. I have completed the hardest things i can think of. I know there are people out there like me. I know those of you don't give a shit about anyone else because i don't either but in a last ditched effort to find entertainment i want to ask you. Why do you wake up in the morning? What do you do in your spare time? Or are you already gone?
