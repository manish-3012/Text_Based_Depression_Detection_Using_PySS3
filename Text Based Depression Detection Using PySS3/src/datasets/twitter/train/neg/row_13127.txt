i hate feeling like i want to diei really and truly wish i didn't want to die. I wish I didn't think about my death when I'm alone. I can have my daily distractions of going out, hanging with friends and working but when i'm alone, that need to die is so loud and so strong. I just don't know how to cope with it. Like its almost like my body has a physical symptom of the ideations that feel like a pit in my stomach that won't go away. I feel like I will always feel like this and I hate it. Whenever I look towards the future I don't see a life for myself because I feel like i will be the cause of my demise.
