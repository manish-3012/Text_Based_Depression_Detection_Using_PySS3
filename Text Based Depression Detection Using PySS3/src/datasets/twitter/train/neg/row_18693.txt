SuicideHey Im not to sure how this works but all I can is that I've been feeling this way for a long time now. I believe it's finally come to the time to end my life forever from my depression/bi-polar/ anxiety makes it hard for me to even find a job or love someone I cant even tell the people that I do love whats going on inside my head because I'm afraid they will just take it as a joke or some way of trying to get out of my duties. I'm 21 &amp; today I will be living this earth .
