The only reason why i wouldnt end my own lifeThe only reason why i wouldnt end my own life is because of my mom. A lot of the times when we hear news about the death of people my age, my mom would exclaim that she cant fathom the amount of suffering their parents have to endure. I dont want my mom to go through this. But at times i just cant stand anything and would often wonder what it would be like if i werent around, what it would be like to end the immense loneliness and emptiness i feel everyday. Despite the fact that i have friends, i just cant control the negative thoughts that go through my head that always interpret anything as being bad
