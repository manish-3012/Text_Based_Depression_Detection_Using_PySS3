Why people? Please stop.When I smile I seem fake. My peers hate me cause they think i'm fake. But when I'm sad I'm called depressed, and my friends say to stop acting. I do't know how to act genuine anymore. I laugh at things that other people don't find funny, I smile too much people move away from me. And when I feel like crying I smile, but when I realised I need to cry because it's healthy, I can't cry. If people just stopped judging and shut their mouths I would be fine. But that's the present world and no-one will change. Because the end is coming soon...
