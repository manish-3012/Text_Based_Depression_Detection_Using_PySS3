Struggling, I hate my birthday.So todayâ€™s my birthday and Iâ€™m all alone in my room depressed. I hate this day because it means one more birthday wish to finally be happy to not come true. Iâ€™ve been crying all day and want this day to pass. I was hoping I wasnâ€™t going to have to be alone contemplating suicide all day.
