I do not really know what to write about..I came here for my last words several months ago but I was helped once again. And once again I just got here. I fuck up relationships, friendship whatever by my paranoid behaviour, probably insanity and regrets. I have so much to say, and please try to not help me it just gets worse, I just happen to make so many fucking mistakes everyone is throwing at me I did not even fucking remember. Now I feel like sticking a gun under my mouth and pulling the trigger because of the shame I am put in every day. I tried commiting suicide 2 years ago but failed and nobody found out. Since then it has been on my mind each week at least. Also running away to foreign countries, it may sound like I am a crybaby but I just happen to keep all my secrets for myself and I am not the first and the last to do that. I feel like where people will not recognize me I could start over. Finally. Thanks for your time. Do not contact me in any way, shape or form. Thank you. I was threatened by some cannibals too lol.
