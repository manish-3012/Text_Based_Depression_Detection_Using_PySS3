What do I do?Me and my ex girlfriend of 14 months broke up 3 weeks ago.. We were sitting, eating lunch at school (high school) and she just texted me saying we should break up.. I was devastated.. Ever since, i've been depressed, not knowing what to do with my life. I now have chronic insomnia from it and find my self sleeping 1-2 hours a night and seeing things at school. She moved on practically the next day and is talking to a whole bunch of guys. The other day I saw a picture on facebook of her and another guy alone in his room and I just lost it.. I broke my ceiling fan and all the lights in it and threw it on the ground. I really don't know what to do anymore.. advice please?
