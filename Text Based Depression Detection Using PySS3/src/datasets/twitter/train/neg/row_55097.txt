Can I just have someone to talk to please?I don't have any friends awake and I have just realized that I just need to talk to someone. I have had an epiphany about my life and I think I am spiraling into failure. 

I don't know why I'm afraid of this. I just want to kill myself before it gets worse. 

I care about what my family will think and feel. I know that the depression will pass onto them when I kill myself. Frankly, I care, and it's going to be difficult, but I think if I put aside my feelings I can go away into the blackness with ease.

I consider myself pretty good at suicide. I've tried and failed twice. I know the do's and do not do's. I know that I can go to the pawn shop and wait for them to background check me and walk out with a pistol tomorrow. Or Walmart. Or the hunting store. Or just a straight up gun store. 

I just want to talk. Maybe you can convince me that I can pull my life together, but you'll be fighting against a very hopeless person so I doubt it. And I also just want to vent about my life.
