I know I don't say it much but..I am glad I'm still here after my many suicide attempts..These last few years have been some of the hardest that I could ever go through. And I wasn't sure that I would ever accept the fact that I have a purpose. Though, I am still finding that purpose, I know I won't stop breathing cause that happiness is out there somewhere, I just know itðŸ˜Š
