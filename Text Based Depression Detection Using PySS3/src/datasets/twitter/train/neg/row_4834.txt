helpidk what to anymore, im 13 for those wondering, my social life collapsed as well as with my life, idk what to do anymore, im lost, cold, sad. I want to hold someone. I want to be close to someone, im thinking of writing suicide notes to my only friend and family, i plan on leaving this world with one last good memory. I want to go out having the time of my life. im stuck, i changed who i was because i wanted to but no one cared no one saw. I just want to die. Im lost in this world i donâ€™t understand. I cant ever see it getting better for me. i just want to hold someone and cuddle with them, and have them hear my sobs and listen to my problems. im done, i dont want to live anymore.
