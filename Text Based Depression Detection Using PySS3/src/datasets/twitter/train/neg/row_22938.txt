I exist, and I do not. I just want to close my eyes and sleep forever.This past week has been the toughest of my life so far. I have two very important academic job talks coming up, I have broken up with my partner (or I haven't, still unclear), I left our apartment and I'm staying at different a friends' place every other day. Now I'm at a friend's who is traveling so I'm alone. I live in a foreign country far from my family. My boyfriend tells me he loves me but does nothing to repair our relationship or even show me that I matter. I have 18 years of failed relationships, pain and loss burdening me, I'm in my mid-thirties now and see my beauty fleeing, no future, no chance for happiness. My parents love me but are unable to offer any support. I'm going through the worst time of my life and no one seems to care. I am exhausted of trying to make my own happiness. I have a box of pills next to me. I've taken two so far, mixed with alcohol and managed to sleep through half of the day. I want to take the remaining ones and make this excruciating pain go away.
