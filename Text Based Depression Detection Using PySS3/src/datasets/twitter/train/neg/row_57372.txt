I can't stand day-to-day life anymoreBasic day for me:

I go to work, get off around 3 pm, go home to a cranky pregnant wife who keeps getting fatter because she wants to use the credit card on pizza delivery instead of cooking at home like she agreed to 3 years ago.

I make less money than I did (pursued my dream of joining the Army back in 2016, quitting my comfy 55k salary engineering job, so probably a bad idea). We have credit card debt and student loans, and we are expecting a second child. My wife constantly gets onto me for us having so much debt, but shoots me down when I say she needs to stop using the credit card and when I talk about getting a civilian job that pays more when my military contract ends.

I regret knowing the woman I'm married to. I regret having a kid with her, and I regret getting her pregnant again. I seriously cannot handle being nagged at every day, which can last from 1 hr to 3 hrs a night. I'm not exaggerating.

Please give me several reasons not to kill myself. I don't feel comfortable at my own home, and I constantly fantasize about her dying so it can just be me and my son living together. Married life fucking sucks. I miss my bachelor years.
