Left alone on my bdaytold myself that iâ€™d just kill myself on my bday and well today it is...


had planned to meet up with two people and see a movie, one of them said he goes with a other group.. 


i was supposed to meet with the other guy 1-2h before the movie, i just called him now to ask if we still meet, he said he is shopping and he maybe comes later..


this day is so shit.. i swear..


the last friend that i have, i asked him too late and he already had other plans but we will meet tomorrow..at least this.. i think.. he was the only one that seemed to care..


i feel so alone... i swear...
