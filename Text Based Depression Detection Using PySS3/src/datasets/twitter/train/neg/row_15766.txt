I want to catch covid and die but I live with my parents.24M here, current living with my parents (both part of risk group) and my sister, I ABSOLUTELY HATE my entire existence, I live in a horrible country (Brazil) and see no future for myself ( a part from working until I die). 

I just wanna catch this shit and let it kill me, I've been a smoker since 17 so I know it might kill me if I refuse treatment but I'm so scared of passing this to my family... It's the only thing holding me back from going to a public space and purposely doing things to get it... 

I've tried to kill myself before but no luck... 

I just want to vent... Why should I stay here?? Working like a slave to some company until I die and living is this disgusting country. 

I see no way out of here to find a better life, more so now that this pandemic is going to make it harder to imigrate.
