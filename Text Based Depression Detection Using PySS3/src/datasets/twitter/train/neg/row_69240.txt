Everyone I know goes away in the end.I have no one. I know that might sound like an over-exaggeration, but I'll explain what I mean. I'm 20, and for 19 years I was brought up by my grandparents. I've never met my mum or dad, and I don't want to at this point. My grandparents raised me in a small town outside of Winchester, in southern England. I was always really disjointed from my schooling and I was never really a  part of that particular world, though I wish I was. I think that if I had perhaps tried harder in school I might not be in the position that I'm in. I took a gap year when I finished college and travelled around Europe, America, and Canada. Whilst in Canada, my grandparents both passed on. They were 95. I was, and am, still absolutely gutted by their deaths. I flew back to England and after their affairs were settled and their final wishes fulfilled (they had their ashes spread into the Thames), I went on a massive bender. I was wankered nearly 24/7. Drink, drugs, and a few fights were an attempt to deal with the pain that I felt. 


At the end of my escapade, I wanted to leave Britain. I couldn't stand being around so many memories, good and bad. I flew back to Canada, to Victoria. I met a really nice girl whom I'll call Kitty. She was about a year younger than I was, and we both fell absolutely, thoroughly, madly in love with each other. We broke up after 4 months, we hadn't spoken for a week after a pretty massive fight and have yet to speak to each other since.

I fall in love quickly and deeply, and I'm always left burnt out, hurt, and I'm sick of it. Hell, my parents didn't even want me. What's it supposed to mean when the two people who were meant to love you unconditionally and without question just don't?

So where am I now? I live in a hostel. I smoke too much, I spend my days either working or sleeping. I don't go out and I don't want to make friends. If I make friends, they'll leave. 

Instead, I'll be the one that leaves.
