iâ€™m tired of trying. I will never amount to anything.mentally ill 19 year old. already washed up and useless. depressed since I was 12. hospitalised twice on suicide attempts and was in a psych unit for a week. made it worse. pretended to be fine. have been cutting for years on and off. meds donâ€™t work. canâ€™t get transpo or afford therapy, which didnâ€™t work when I tried several over the last few years. no jobs nearby. done trying. i still wish i could just fucking erase any trace of myself from existence completely.
