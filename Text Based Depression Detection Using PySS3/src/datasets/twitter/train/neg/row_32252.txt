I regret not killing myself on my last birthday.My birthday is Dec. 3rd, and Iâ€™ve been suffering for depression for way over a year now. If it matters at all, Iâ€™m 16. Anyway, I know people love and care about me and stuff. But Iâ€™m so sick of getting low, yâ€™know? Itâ€™s so exhausting. Iâ€™m sick of feeling like a mistake and like a burden. I canâ€™t help feeling like everyone would be better off without me in the long run. I wish I had killed myself on my last birthday because I wouldnâ€™t have gotten a boyfriend, and I wouldnâ€™t feel guilty about hurting him by killing myself. I know he needs me. It just hurts so much, yâ€™know? Every day hurts so bad. I just want it all to stop. But now I feel trapped. Like I canâ€™t kill myself because I have no clue how my boyfriend would react to it (heâ€™s got mental health issues too) but living feels like torture. I donâ€™t know anymore. I couldâ€™ve avoided all of this if I had just killed myself.
