I'm so exhausted and the thought of dying feels so natural and so right.I'm tired of the unfairness of the world, I'm tired of being sad and lonely, I'm tired of never having enough money to get by. I just want to kill myself. I want to go back to the nothingness like before I was born. This world and this life was something I was never meant to experience. It's all hurt, and sadness and decay and rot. I don't care. There's a certain freedom in that. Fuck life. It's short and shitty. Fuck people. They don't give a fuck about anyone else. Fuck the universe and existence and their cold indifference. The sooner I can end my life the better. I'm sick if this shit. I hope I die in my sleep tonight.
