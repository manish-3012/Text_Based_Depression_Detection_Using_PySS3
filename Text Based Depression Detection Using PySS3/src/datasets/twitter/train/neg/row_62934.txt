Reddit, what should I do INSTEAD of killing myself?SO... I am 15 years old. Long story short, I hate my life. I have severe depression and anxiety. Seriously nothing seems good to me anymore, and I feel sad almost 100% of the time.
I just can't deal with this and I need a way out.
I have tried to feel better by: talking to people about my issues, doing drugs (weed, ambien..nothing hardcore), cutting myself, watching inspirational videos online, writing in a journal, listening to music, taking a bath with a bath bomb, etc.
All those things did not work.
I do really want to die.. but I know I shouldn't kill myself.
So any ideas for what I can do instead?
