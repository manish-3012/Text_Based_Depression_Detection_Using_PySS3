having a hard time finding any motivation to livei (f19) just started college last week in the hopes of moving forward in life. i have these "great goals" of going to med school after i get a bs in psychology. the thing is that i dont care, im sad, and im very much alone.
i dont care if i live or die, honestly if i stay alive i would care about my grades and shit because those things are important in this world and frankly i dont want to end up on the street.
im sad because im just really fucking sad. there are reasons and there arent reasons but no matter what happens i know that fucking sadness isnt going to leave its been around for almost three years i doubt it has any plans on vacating the premises anytime soon. 
im alone, yeah whatever im surrounded by people but no one really gives a fuck about me. i cannot even picture me finding anyone friendship wise or relationship wise because im shy as hell (i have social anxiety disorder) and im honestly just not attractive at all. i dont fit in with the "friends" i have now. 
ive been seriously considering suicide this past week as i am having a hard time seeing anything positive happening to me or me even being able to succeed. all i see is a bleak grey lonely future ahead of me and id rather end it now than have to endure it. 
im not really reaching out for help here im just ranting because, guess what? i have no one to talk to. fml
