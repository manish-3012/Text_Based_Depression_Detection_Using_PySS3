You want to know why we haven't killed ourselves yet but want to die so badly?I came to the final conclusion we are cursed or born cursed to live the rest of our days here on earth in pain, mental torture, desperate and humiliated/embarrassment. It seems like the people who dont want to die, end up dying and the people wishing for death wont come. Personally...for me....Im too pussycat to do it. Even with nothing to lose, im still too scared to do it.
