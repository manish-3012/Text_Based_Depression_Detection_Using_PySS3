I'm so sadI'm just so fucking sad and lonely. I had an okay day today but it crashed so hard. I've literally 0 friends not even online ones cos no one's likes me. I've a boyfriend but he feels like a mistake but I just can't loose him. 
I'm so lonely and sad I just don't know what to do anymore tbh. I'm really fucking struggling, I don't go to school and I don't rly do anything, I never leave my house. I'm so fucking ugly someone help me
