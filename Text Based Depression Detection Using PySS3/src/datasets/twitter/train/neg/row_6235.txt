My old house gave me my first suicidal thoughtsI was going to make an alt account for this but decided that it doesn't matter.

I've been depressed for about, I'd say 5 years? Maybe 6? I've stopped counting. I don't really know how it started, or rather I don't remember. I used to be so happy. No matter what I was never as sad as I am now. We just moved into a new house, my dad and I, when it started. We didn't move towns or anything, same town, same school, same friends. The house was quite nice as well, not the best but it definitely wasn't terrible. Back then it was just sadness. I didn't want to die, or distance myself from others because I felt I didn't deserve them, I didn't have abandonment issues.

 It wasn't until about a year later when I started thinking about suicide. I pretty much lived in my room upstairs, it's not like I had anything else to do. My window was technically the highest in the house. I can't tell you how many times I looked out that window and thought about jumping. It would be so easy, to just open it and jump. One second of fear, then it would be over. No more sadness. No more anger. No more pain. Just sweet and silent nothingness. I used to dangle my feet outside and sit on the window sill, wondering if anyone would even notice. I would always get as close to the edge as I could without falling. Sometimes I hoped that I would slip. 

I haven't attempted suicide since then, and I don't know if I ever will. I've harmed myself multiple times, I still have a scar on my arm from the only time I've ever cut myself. I have a lot of bruises on my thighs from pinching. I don't know what to do anymore. I can't seem to find any meaning to my life. I think the only reason I haven't offed myself yet was because of how my family would handle it. I'm not sure how long I can keep doing this for. I'm so tired.
