i'm tired of tryingdropped out of college because it was too much stress and made me want to die. family life is shitty so i look for a job to help support myself while trying to figure out where to go next. searching for months cant even get a single interview. finally get one at walmart, told i got the job at the spot and they'll call me in a few days. wait eagerly, finally get the call, told they can't reach any of my references or they 'dont remember me'. i'm an antisocial fuck i barely leave the house, i've never had a job, and my head is a constant storm of who knows what since i can't afford to stay on the medication  i was prescribed by a psychologist who i havent bothered to visit anymore in over a year. they said they tried again but im jsut tired of this. every single time. even if it's something small, seems t obe going right in my life it gets shot down. i'm done and i accept that i am utterly worthless and i won't ever get anywhere. i've known this for a long time really i just chose to ignore it but i can't anymore and i just want to rot away.
