im so fucking lonelygod i want to hang out with people. im so sick of being alone all the time. all of my friends keep leaving me on read and it hurts. i ask if we could hang out for them to cancel it last minute. i just want people to care. ive been dealing with so much bullshit for the last few months and i want to just escape. if im being honest, everyone ignoring me is pushing me to the edge. i dont want to keep feeling like this. everyone my age has a nicotine addiction or thinks smoking is a personality trait. im sick of this fucking place and im so ready to quit lol. any suggestions on how to end it?
