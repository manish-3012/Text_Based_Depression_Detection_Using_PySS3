I hate myself and wanna dieIâ€™m a fat, disgusting whore. I hate my body, I hate my mind. Itâ€™s all wrong and bad and gross. Everything I do is terrible. All I feel is paranoia and pain and anger. Iâ€™m not myself anymore. I wanna run away and hide. Iâ€™m mentally ill and nothing ever works. I just keep getting worse. No amount of pills or therapy will ever help me. There is no amount of pain I can inflict on myself, no wound I can make that will encompass how much pain Iâ€™m in and how much I detest myself. I should drink alcohol and take all my sleeping pills.
