I've become an unemployed Neckbeard at 17. What else is there to lose?Honestly haven't got anything going for me anymore. Everything's just one punch to the face after the other. I've got no real friends, only ones behind a screen. And none of them talk to me at all. I can't go outside because I just have no reason to, there's nothing out there. I've tried to come out of unemployment, because I feel like, if I'm a wagie, then I'd at least be useful to society somewhat. But have you ever tried to write a CV when you have no qualifications and no life experiences? It's impossible. So I just gave up and cried. As I do with anything. I lost hope of ever having a friendship circle, I lost hope of ever finding love. I mean, all a woman would ever have to do is say hello and I'd fall for her. You know how people joke about how they watch porn for the plot? Well, I genuinely do sometimes. Just to know what it's like to be wanted, I guess. 
I only wanted to do one thing in my life, learn to drive. But after doing that, it's not fun. The humour wore off pretty quickly on that. I just wanna die now. I don't want to do anything else. I don't want things to get better because it's not worth it, and don't lie saying it is because it's false. I know the whole thing is doomerpilled. But it's just how life is for me. It's not how it feels, it's how it *is*. Goodbye
