I don't want to dieI don't want to die. I want happiness. I want that little kid I once was to know what it's like to be in love with living. To smile at the sun every day, to find someone to love, to be fulfilled. But I can't. It isn't an option. The universe is telling me to kill myself in every little thing. I'm getting closer to listening. It's getting worse. I want to give that kid the life he once deserved. But I'm powerless.
