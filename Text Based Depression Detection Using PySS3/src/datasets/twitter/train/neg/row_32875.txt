i don't know what i'm going to do if trump is re-electedIf you're here to counter my political stance, please don't. I know how I feel and I know why I'm worried. 

I'm posting this as a vent, but I guess I'm also wondering if anyone is in a similar position. 

I'm a white trans male (16) and live in an area whose population is largely pro-Trump. I have a large number of friends who are minorities and are in potential danger. It's difficult enough to live here as a trans person, but if Trump is re-elected, the bigotry and hatred against us will only multiply. Our rights and protections will indefinitely be at stake. 

I fight my school and district often. I revoked a transphobic district policy. I'm fighting for our Health, History, and English curriculums to be recreated to be more inclusive and less shitty. I'm a leader of our GSA club. I always wanted to be a high school teacher and work as an activist. Fighting injustice has been the only thing keeping me going. But I'm so so so so so tired. 

I don't know what I will do if Trump is elected. I can't do it. I've been starting to prepare and think of ways to off myself. It's so degrading and it makes me feel so worthless and humiliated and threatened and frightened. Everything is so fucked up. I know that the whole point is to fight, but I seriously don't know if I can. I've already stopped doing most of my homework in the past month and I can hardly focus in class because I feel so horrible. 

I've been waiting to take a breath for four years. I can't wait another four. I'm scared.
