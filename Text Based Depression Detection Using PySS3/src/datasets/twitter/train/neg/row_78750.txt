I'm tired of waiting for someone to help me kill myselfFor the past year, when I'm alone, I have been having these shame-outbursts where I think of someone from my past and shout for them to come and help me commit suicide.

I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. My observation of how the illness works is that I only have two ways of seeing the people who I get in fights with; either as destructive, shitty people or as absolute saints who are in the right as **I** am in the wrong. Since both of these extremes are irrational, I am left to conclude that there **are some** people who actually **are** treating/have treated me badly and my inability to recognize it and address it correctly is making me more sick in the head. I want to believe in this moment that I am simply over-thinking as a result of the mental illness itself.

Nevertheless, I feel that i am surrounded by normal people--people like you--who can immediately recognize when you are being treated badly by someone and deal with it accordingly. I am convinced that my inability to see my anger through or to, at the very least, own my anger as a valid emotion is a weakness that is too late to fix. 

I can't stop thinking about guns and explosives and exhaust pipes and all of the other fantastic modern ways to make it quick and painless
