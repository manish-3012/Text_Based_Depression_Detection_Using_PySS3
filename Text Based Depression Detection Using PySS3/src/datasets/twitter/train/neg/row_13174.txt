I'm breaking down and I need helpI have AVPD and bipolar disorder. I've been managing but I finally feel like I'm at the end of my rope. I don't have any hope for my future. I've had grand plans- to be a cartoonist, a writer, etc) but I'm terrified of talking to the people that would help me succeed. I feel like everything I do is WRONG. Last night I broke down in front of my boyfriend and now I feel like he must think I'm a pathetic piece of shit and I don't blame him. He told me he hopes I will find what makes me happy and now I feel like he clearly must think less of me- here I am a 24 year old not even graduated college and I don't know what makes me happy. Fucking failure! I fantasized about slitting my wrists all day yesterday while everyone was having fun at a pool party. PLEASE tell me something to give me some hope. I can't do it much longer.

If I tell a therapist or someone how I am feeling they will just put me back into a mental hospital. I went to one 2 years ago. They deprived me of food and forced me to take medications that made me terribly sick. And then I left worse than before. I don't know who to turn to and I feel like anyone I confide in will think less of me for being pathetic.
