the light came half looseSo I've been trying to psych myself up multiple times this year to hang myself and always got so close but decided to backdown. I've had problems for the last 6-7 years and it's only ever been downhill. Tonight I managed to get to the point of knotting the noose around both the light and my neck, I took one step off the chair and heard an unmistakable clunking noise. Putting my weight back onto the chair I looked up to confirm my suspicions that the light had come half off the ceiling and would surely come full off if I took the leap.

I'm a very small guy and simply rolled my eyes at this act of either divine intervention or pure bad luck. I haven't another place to privately end my life so my option which I had be deliberating for so long had just been taken from me. It's hillarious that even when trying to end my pitiful life I am not allowed the chance or choice. Though I didn't laugh.
