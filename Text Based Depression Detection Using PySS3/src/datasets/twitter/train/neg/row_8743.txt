Relapsing, past issues are still hereI feel ashamed of my mental health issues. I started struggling at 15 years old, with social anxiety, self harm, depressive episodes, suicidal thoughts and ideation...never talked about my problems, my family still doesnt know.  Now I'm 22, still struggle with social anxiety but its better...but I feel ashamed bc I'm self harming again, I self harmed 2 weeks ago, I got angry with my father that always criticize me. I also feel depressed again, I'm studying at university but I doubt myself a lot. How can I find jobs with social anxiety? I still struggle when I talk with others. I feel lost, I think about suicide, I'm afraid I'll kill myself if I don't find my path, my purpose. I wanted a job where I could help people, I did 3 years at university for this and I really wanted to and still want to help! But how can I help if I'm struggling? 

I feel like a burden...I'm wasting my parents money. If I kill myself they don't have to waste money for me anymore. Tomorrow I'll call a new therapist I really need one!...I'm ashamed because I'm relapsing with everything. But I'm afraid I'll start therapy and don't get better then what?ï»¿
