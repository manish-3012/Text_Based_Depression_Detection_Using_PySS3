I'm exhausting.I can tell I'm losing the patience of my (2 only) friends. They're kind and supporting, but I am a broken fucking record. I'm self loathing, narcissistic, and self pitying. I can't stop it. They say they want me to tell them how in feeling but I always feel the same. I've always felt the same. My first botched suicide attempt was at 8 and I've tried about every 4 years since. I think about it every day. I know they'd all be better off without me. I'm just a vibrating force of negativity. I know I'll eventually just do it, it's just a matter of when. I've always know that. I know they'll be heartbroken about it, but grief fades and I feel like it's better now than after even more time they've wasted trying to save me. 

I'm on mobile so sorry about the wall of text. I'm just over it.
