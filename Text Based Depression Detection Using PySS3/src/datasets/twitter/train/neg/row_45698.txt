trying not to dieI feel like Iâ€™m going absolutely crazy, wish I could get the balls to attempt though. I feel like Iâ€™ve been face to face with death for a while and Iâ€™m just too scared. I canâ€™t take this anymore and I canâ€™t get out of this situation. I wish I didnâ€™t have to die but I just canâ€™t escape this!!!!!!! I feel dramatic for this but holy fuck I canâ€™t take it anymore and I have absolutely nothing. I know people say â€œsee you have some will to live so thatâ€™s good!!â€ but okay great, tell me how to make this nightmare stop instead of telling me something I already know
