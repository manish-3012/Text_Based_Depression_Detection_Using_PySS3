Being a feminine man is a death sentence in this societyTitle. 

This is I believe my third time posting on this sub.
The only thing that are keeping me alive right now are music and the fact that in September I'll buy myself a gaming PC. I don't know if I'll live for that long tbh. 

I am completely unwanted by women. I get 0 basic respect from anyone- both men and women. Every day is painful.

Honestly I don't know why am I even posting this here. You guys obviously can't help me.
