No immediate threatI suffer from almost constant suicidal ideation.  I am generally happy (with some flaws I could work on).  Nothing is hopeless in my life, yet I am constantly battling against an internal monologue that seems to want to die.  "I am going to kill myself" is an unbidden thought that goes through my mind countless times per day.  Sometimes this thought is accompanied by poorly laid out plans.  I don't feel suicidal, nor can I imagine ever following through on these thoughts.  Is this normal?
