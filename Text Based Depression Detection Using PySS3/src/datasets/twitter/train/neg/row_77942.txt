will they disclose to the police?I used a helpline (shout UK). They have a text service and disclosed being raped a few days ago. I told them I was 16 (they asked). They wanted to know if the guy that did it was over or under 18 as they were worried about me. I told them he was a few months older. I'm scared they are going to report it to the police or social services or something. They said they asked me age cos they were worried and had a duty of care. i said i wasnt suicidal (not strictly true) and that i wasnt in any danger now. I told them i had texted my friend to let her know during the chat (another lie). im scared they are going to track me and report it. Are they likely to do this?? please help im freaking out
