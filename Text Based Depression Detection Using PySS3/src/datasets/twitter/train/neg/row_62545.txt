Truth is I donâ€™t think I canI donâ€™t think I can make it till New Years, for months I have felt broken and depressed.

I finally got a new job with a awesome title (VP) after 9 months of Unemployment. 

But Dec is the worst month for me itâ€™s the time I met my now ex fiancÃ©e 9years ago, itâ€™s the month we got engaged 2 (almost 3yrs ago) shit slowed down because I was in a career change trying to get a better job and shit.

In July/Aug she left me and cut all ties of communication with me. I miss her everyday I dream about her and shit.

So I can sleep, I feel broken and lost I honestly just want to die so I donâ€™t have this feeling anymore
