Questioning Life..Okay, idk if u believe in God or not, i don't mean to cause doubt or fear or anything of that nature... 

i Really had some questioning. and i wanted to see what you thought about this

The illusory truth effect 

(also known as the illusion of truth effect, validity effect, truth effect, or the reiteration effect) 

is the tendency to believe false information to be correct after repeated exposure. 

scary topic

&amp;#x200B;

Hmm, i don't mean disrespect towards God or anything, but lately.

i started wondering why is it that 

Every Faith based or Religious belief is fear based, and if u dont follow there is consequences

&amp;#x200B;

I Believe JESUS And what he did for me and my sins and was risen 

i'm here questioning life and the world we live in - by the corruption of 

"FEAR,MANIPULATION,GUILT,SHAME"
