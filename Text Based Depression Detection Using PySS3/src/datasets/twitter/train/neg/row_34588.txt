idki've been dealing with basically chronic suicidal urges since i was maybe twelve and i just don't see the point any more. it's always lingering in the back of my mind how badly i want to die but i've always been too cowardly to do it and i can't tell anyone anymore (people don't take it seriously because i'm "always like this"/people get annoyed and tell me to grow up/i just don't want to be a burden anymore)

i've made a half dozen throwaway accounts on really bad nights just to complain about how miserable i am and find support but even on here it's like people can sense my desperation (and just underneath that, that i'm for some reason unworthy of compassion) and avoid saying anything--at most one or two people view me with pity and throw some kind of platitude my way but there's no underlying concern in it and it's hollow and feels more like somebody fulfilling an obligation than something borne of concern or that involves recognizing that i'm a human being who's in unbearable pain

and i feel so entitled and unfair even being upset about this because so many people have it worse and i'm just upset because i feel like nobody cares about me when i'm like this even though i guess i must get so annoying and unbearable that even the most patient people get sick of it and leave

if i seem like i'm feeling down people just get annoyed with me and angry and it hurts knowing that there are people who have others in their lives who care and treat them with love and worry and want them to be okay... but i'm just an annoyance to anyone around me who's unfortunate enough to see me when i'm in a bad place

all of my cries for help fall on deaf ears and ultimately go unanswered and i'm starting to feel like maybe it's a sign from the universe that i just need to get over myself and die
