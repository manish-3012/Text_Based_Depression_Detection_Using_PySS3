I'm seriously considering suicide and but one thing always keeps me backMy mom. The only reason I'm still here. I live in shitty conditions in a third world country. I have low salary job even though I'm in high school and have SATs, and my employer often gets pressured and takes it out on me and my coworker. I can't leave my job because I'll literally have no money because my father is a deadbeat. My school administration knows I have a history with impulsivity and self harm and they suspect I'm on the brink of hurting myself again, so they're on the lookout for any evidence they can use against me. At this point the only things I enjoy in life are alcohol and nicotine. I'm seriously impulsive and feel like one day this will drive me off the cliff. I don't need generic advice, maybe insight is all.
