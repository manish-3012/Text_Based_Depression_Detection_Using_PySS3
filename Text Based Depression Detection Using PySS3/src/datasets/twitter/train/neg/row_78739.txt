Is it worth persevering?Is it really? I havenâ€™t made anything of my life yet. I feel like Iâ€™m wasting my days. I want to change, but even if I change, Iâ€™m still this person, marred by these thoughts.

I canâ€™t see even a glimpse of success in my future. I know Iâ€™m not intelligent or accomplished or interesting enough to make anything of my life or to achieve any of my fast-fading aspirations.

So why stay? Isnâ€™t it illogical? Iâ€™m a waste of resources, a useless body thus contributes nothing worthwhile. I may as well leave, as soon as possible.

I wish I knew how to.
