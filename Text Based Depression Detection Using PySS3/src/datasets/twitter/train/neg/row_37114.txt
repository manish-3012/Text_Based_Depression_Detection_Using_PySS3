I feel like suicide for me is inevitableI have struggled with suicidal thoughts since middle school. In the past year I have gone to the Psych ward twice for suicidal intent. It doesn't help. They keep you there for a bit and then release you. I am currently going to school and doing well there and play video games as a hobby I enjoy but it all seems meaningless to me. I feel like one day I am going to wake up and decide that today is the day and kill myself. I have no real friends anymore, the only ones I have left are the ones I have met on video games. I just don't see a point in living. Can anyone help me change my mindset?
