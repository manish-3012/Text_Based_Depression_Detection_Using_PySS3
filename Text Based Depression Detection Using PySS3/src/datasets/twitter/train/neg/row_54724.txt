I think I'm gonna do itfor real this time. I really might

I'm just so tired of trying over and over again, i try endlessly to help the entire world and fail

everyone is constantly in a better place than me and I'm sick of dissasociating for weeks, and I can't snap out of it, I just go numb for weeks, and then I'll wake up one day and realize I'm still alive, I don't even understand reality anymore. I hate myself and everyone else. and I'm gonna do it
