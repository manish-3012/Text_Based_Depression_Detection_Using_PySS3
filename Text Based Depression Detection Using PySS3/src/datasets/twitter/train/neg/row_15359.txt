Would making suicide look like an accident make it easier on my familyI've never particularly loved the idea of living, and the only thing I've ever looked forward to is an ideal future that seems fucking ridiculous every time I look back on what I hoped to accomplish based on the work I put in and the skills that I had at that or any point. But I've still got people that care about me and have their own problems in life and I don't want to make it harder by making them wonder what they could have done differently or why they didn't see the signs. But venting aside if I could make it look like an accident, just me being stupid, would that make it easier for them to cope and just move on from?
