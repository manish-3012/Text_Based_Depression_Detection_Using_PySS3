Death seems like the only way out.I feel like a waste of oxygen. I feel hated and sick. I want everything to just stop but it wonâ€™t unless I commit suicide. Iâ€™ll have to get a job someday, Iâ€™ll be a slave to society just like everyone else. The only thing that makes me truly happy is when I get to sleep. Imagine if I could do that forever and not have to worry about anything anymore. Feeling nothing is better than feeling pain imo. Everyone else has a life ahead of them, I however, am a lost cause and Iâ€™ve finally come to accept that. I am a waste of space and I should have been the one that died at birth instead of my sister.  I wish my life could be full of sleep and just relaxing things all around. No responsibilities, no discourse, and no stress. The way the â€œworld worksâ€ stops me from living that blissful life so Iâ€™ll either die this year and get it over with, or try to fix myself now and live the most relaxing life until finally killing my self when my parents want me to move out. Living off of them forever will make me feel guilty, but taking responsibility and getting my own place and job sounds 10x worse so Iâ€™ll take the death route. No shame in nothing.
