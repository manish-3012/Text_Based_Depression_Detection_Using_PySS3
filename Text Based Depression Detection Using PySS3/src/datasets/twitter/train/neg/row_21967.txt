I've been there.I've hit that low, that hopeless feeling that most or all of you feel. For some, this subreddit is an outlet, a place to get unbiased, honest help. 

I don't doubt that there has been an abundance of "PM me if you want to talk!" posts/comments, but I'm making this anyway. I know how bad it feels.

A little background; I've struggled with self harm for 4 years, hospitalized on one instance, and underwent therapy for a good while. It started with tiny cuts and progressed to slicing my arm, and anywhere else, just so I could get the release, feel the rush and the pain. It was a way out. It got worse, though, when I started contemplating suicide. Even now I struggle with the thought, but I know I wouldn't do it. I didn't have the best childhood or home life, but nobodies lives are perfect. 

I am better now, however, for the most part. Despite some re-occurring thoughts and urges, I haven't self mutilated in almost a year. I've increased my standard of living, and after dealing with critically low self esteem for months, I decided it was time for a change of view, and completely turned myself around. This would not have been possible without the help of my friends and family, proving everyone does need someone.

I'm offering to be that someone, someone with insight to what you could possibly be feeling. Even if it seems like it doesn't, it does get better. If anyone needs something, I am ALWAYS available for a message, even if it's just to be confided in. I love you all, stay strong.
