I think ive had my fill and am ready to clock out.At this point in my life, I honestly feel like I've lived enough and in some cases, squandered my time here. Now I'm at that point where I just don't feel like I have anything worth giving anymore. And after a lengthy spat of depression, I've never felt such a sense of relief in deciding its finally time. 

Working as a security guard, I know I'm easily replaceable. I live on my own with two cats, who I'm planning on rehoming before the time so they're well kept, and I've never considered myself close to family. While I know they'll suffer, I know they can move on as they're stronger than me. 

As for a reason, I can't pinpoint one exact one. Could be that I learned my parents had me by accident and never planned on 4 kids leading me to be the somewhat neglected child. Could be that I've grown to despise the general public I dealt with for years in my shitty security job. Could be the fact that I've read too much into the next generation of humans and realized I can't stand the people that are growing and becoming either anxiety ridden messes themselves or the SJW types who'd rather rip you apart for whatever reason they deem rather than grow as people themselves. 

I guess you could just say I just hate this era were in. And that I'd rather not be apart of any of it than suffer through it.  

I've already chosen a method that I'm sure will work. I just need to make sure those cats are safe and cared for. They don't deserve me.
