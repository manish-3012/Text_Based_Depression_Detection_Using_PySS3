When I was 16, I almost killed myself. I'm starting to feel the same wayAnd I told my best friend at the time that I was about to do it. I guess she thought I was saying all of this for attention, because she responded my telling me that if I did it then people would get over it, that my death would just brush off in a couple weeks. All I ever wanted was to prove her wrong. And now, two years later, I'm beginning to feel the same way I felt back tw years ago when I was ready to die
