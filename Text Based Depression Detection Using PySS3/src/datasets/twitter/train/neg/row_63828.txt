My Best Friend Desperately Needs HelpHello everyone 

I thought posting here might make me understand what my suicidal best friend is really going through. We are both late teens, not sure if that has any relevance. They have been feeling depressed and suicidal for a number of months, after the breakdown of their relationship. They say they are only in the world for others and that they hate themselves. This obviously breaks my heart because I love them so much. I have tried to get them help but they refuse, they donâ€™t want to see a doctor however much i try and encourage them. I stay up late at night with them while they tell me how much they want to die. I feel helpless and I donâ€™t know how to deal with it. They are on my mind all the time and I am constantly worried. I repeatedly say how much i care and all the other things you would say to someone who was suicidal, but they donâ€™t really believe it. 

Does anyone have any advice on what I can do?
