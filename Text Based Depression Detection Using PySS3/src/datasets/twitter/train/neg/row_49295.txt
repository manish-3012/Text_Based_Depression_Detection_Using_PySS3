I know thereâ€™s no other way for me to have peace of mind.Itâ€™s so hard. I have pure obsessive OCD and Iâ€™ve been obsessing about this for about a year and a half now. I never understood suicide but it clicked for me. The only way I will ever have peace of mind and stop feeling so anxious and tortured is when I die. 

I have two reasons not to make this happen myself, my husband and my dog. Itâ€™s still so hard.
