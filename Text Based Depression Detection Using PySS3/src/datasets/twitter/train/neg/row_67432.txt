UndecidedI'm about to transition to college, but I don't see the point. My scholarships don't allow for my tuition to be completely covered, so I'm going to stay at my mom's an hour away, though it'd be cool to get an apartment. Both options have their drawbacks and ultimately waste everyone's time because I have no interests or quality, so it's really a waste of time. I feel as if I should stop wasting my, my parents', and the state's resources on a child that will always be a child playing at improving himself. Idk, I just objectively feel like the best thing for me to do is kill myself. There are too many proletariats and I don't have the skill to fulfill any other job. Moreover, I would hate to waste my time on a job that doesn't help people in need. Just losing motive
