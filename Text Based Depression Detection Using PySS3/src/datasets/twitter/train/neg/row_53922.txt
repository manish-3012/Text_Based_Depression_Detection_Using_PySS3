Close to losing my sonI posted in suicide bereavement asking for advice on my son, who had an attempt earlier in Sept. Someone suggested this sub, so here I am. My 29 year old son wants to kill himself. Point blank. He does not want to be here anymore. He has deep depression and his meds are not touching it. That is, if he is really taking them. I have my doubts. After getting out of hospital, he promised, he would call me before ever letting things go that far again. I do not believe that either. He just wanted to tell me what I wanted to hear. He confessed, that he has tried about 4 hardcore attempts, including hanging himself with a belt from a transom (which he broke and had to pay to get fixed), hanging by necktie and 2 od's. This last OD was by far the worst. He was found unresponsive and barely survived. He looked so disappointed when he woke up in icu tethered to the bed and ventilated. He does not want to be alive and I just can not figure out how to help. I guess I am silently shouting for help by coming online looking for answers. He is alive and I selfishly want to keep him alive. It is gut-wrenching thinking about losing him. I am so scared for him. If I don't hear from him every couple of hours I think the worst and freak out. I read that words like "think about your family" are not encouraged in responses here, but if you are suicidal and think that taking your own life will only effect yourself, No.
