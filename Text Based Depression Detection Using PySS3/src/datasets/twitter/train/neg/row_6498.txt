I don't know what to expectI'm not sure what I expect. Someone linked me to this subreddit from /r/FreeCompliments after I had posted about how I was feeling. I've been struggling with depression for just about my entire adult life (I'm about to turn 27, I'd say I've been depressed since I was 14/15). It's made it hard for me to function because even since then it felt like I knew my life would end by my own hand. Every horrible thing that's come my way has been easy to blow off with the excuse, "Well, I'm probably going to kill myself anyways." The last couple years have been particularly rough, it's clear that life won't get any easier. I think about suicide every day, even though I tell myself I can persevere. But some days I just can't find the will to continue, and I feel like sharing those feelings with my friends and family only turns me into a burden, then it seems like it would be better for all of them if I just stopped hesitating.

I don't know what I'm looking for, I just know I want to do better. It feels like I'm capable of so much more but I can't escape the prison of my own mind.
