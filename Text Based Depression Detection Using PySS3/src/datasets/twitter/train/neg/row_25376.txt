Told to come here from CMV. Just wanna discuss the "importance" of lifeI posted on r/changemyview but was directed here. I already had everything typed. So here it is.

I'm sick of continuing to live. And please spare me the "oh it gets better" or "it's only temporary" bullshit. The very people saying that are the same ones who can just type it in 5 seconds, and move on. Meanwhile, I'm forced to exist purely so the hypocritical self righteous morality police can sit on their high ground.

My argument is this: Existence was forced upon me without my consent, and because of a decision my parents made years ago, I'm forced to exist and perpetuate a life I don't even enjoy. Literally NOTHING makes me happy for a long time. Every single day in school is complete hell. 

I believe it is my **right** as a human being to end my life through euthanasia.  I don't feel happy, I don't even enjoy eating. I'll literally eat a bunch and get no satisfaction whatsoever. All of this serves to further prove my point. I'm just a product of faulty evolution. Natural selection needs to take its course. I'm unfit to be alive, and there's no reason to keep me here

16 years ago, if my mother wanted to, she could have gotten an abortion, and that's acceptable. However, 16 years later, when I'm a sapient human being, I don't have that same right? My mother was 17 when she was pregnant with my brother. How is it ok for her to make a decision about another human being, but I cannot make that same decision for myself? I've been hospitalized twice, and doctors have given me depression meds and have told me and my family that they don't understand why it's not working.

People are only against this because it goes against the norm and their natural self preservation instinct. But honestly, it's sad. Why is it acceptable to force me to live a life I don't enjoy, go to school where every minute I just want to die, a better alternative than simply letting out of this world?
