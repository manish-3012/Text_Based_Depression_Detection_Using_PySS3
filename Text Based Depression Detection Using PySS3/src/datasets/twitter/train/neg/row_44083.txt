My mom just burst into my room with scissors to threaten to cut my tongue.I was doing nothing. Iâ€™m a student filmmaker and I was just waiting to hear back from film festivals I submitted to. I was tired of waiting and I sighed. Then my mom yelled outside my room, saying sheâ€™s sick of dealing with me moping around. She yelled I should apologize her for making her â€œcare about youâ€ all the time. I thought she was joking so I said â€œWhat?â€ She then told me that if I donâ€™t say sorry to her on the count of five, she will come and cut my tongue and slash my throat. I still thought she was joking, so I said â€œHuh?â€ Then she took her big scissors, kicked my door and ran into my room. She waved the scissors in front of me and near my mouth and yelled that I should apologize. I know this sounds insane and made up. And I canâ€™t believe it just happened as Iâ€™m writing this. I did apologize her. Then she yelled even more because â€œyouâ€™re not genuine enough and say â€˜Iâ€™m sorryâ€™ like a robot,â€ I apologized again and again, but she still wasnâ€™t satisfied. She stood and yelled for 30 minutes until she was fully convinced that I know what I have done wrong. Even when I cry for forgiveness, she says Iâ€™m acting like a self-pitying drama queen.

I used to think she was the sweetest mother and that itâ€™s my fault that she is angry, but Iâ€™m starting to think she is just going insane. I thought of calling suicide hotline, but they might recognize my number. I called there twice before and the same lady answered. I donâ€™t want to speak with the same lady and disappoint her. Also my mom will hear me talking.
