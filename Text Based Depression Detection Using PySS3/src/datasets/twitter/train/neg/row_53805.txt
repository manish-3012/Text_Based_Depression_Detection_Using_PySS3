Well, I fucked up, I deserve it, and I'm killing myself over it. It'll be a good thing.I make $44k/yr. a bit out of college and have $13k in high-interest credit card debt with $10k in a loan my parents are paying the monthly payments for (as of recently). I'm at least a full month behind on my credit card and power bills. My credit is probably fucked now. No one knows about my credit card debt. 

I've always been a little suicidal and have attempted before, but this is a hole I don't see myself getting out of. 

Not that I can never get out of debt. I know I can eventually. It's that I also got fired from my father's company, one I had been promised 8 years ago. I will no longer get the company after focusing all my studies in college to that specific job. I was fired in under a year. 

I thought I could pay my debts off as I progressed quickly through the company. That was not smart. I can't go back to a normal job with so much debts. I'm going to be so, so poor. All my friends got amazing jobs, and I'm on the verge of collapse. I don't think anyone realizes it. My life is ruined. 

So, yeah, an entitled piece of shit is getting what he deserves. And I have such a bad mix of fucking anxiety and doucheness that I'm terrified of people agreeing with me. I do think the world will be a better place at least. I like that thought. 

I don't know why I'm posting this. Maybe it helps some people feel more comfortable in their dark times. It has for me, especially trying to help others. It's nice to have some semblance of control. But my life has no control. The career is gone. The finances are fucked in a social group revolving around money. All I have is a quiet corner of the Internet to hang my head and whisper my obituary. 

Pretty sure I'm rambling. It feels nice.
