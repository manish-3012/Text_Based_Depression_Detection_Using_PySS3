Just a thoughtMaybe one of the reason people want to end their life is because they feel no one cares about them. They feel alone. And maybe if they go through with it, in their mind, thatâ€™s the only way they can get people to feel anything for them. Last stand to get attention from people they think theyâ€™re invisible to. Idk jat 

Sb sorry for all the â€œtâ€ words
