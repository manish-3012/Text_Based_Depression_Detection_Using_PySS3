Today is the dayI thought I could wait until my birthday but now I see thatâ€™s impossible. Iâ€™m done hurting people who, for some reason, care about me. Iâ€™m tired of feeling so alone all the time but Iâ€™m just a poison that infects anyone who gets too close. I donâ€™t have any friends but thatâ€™s probably for the best, less people for me to hurt. There is no future for me. Iâ€™m a terrible selfish piece of garbage and itâ€™s time for me to go. 

I feel horrible about how this will effect my family and S/O. I know Iâ€™m just a burden so this is the right choice in the long run. Im so sorry to have to disappoint them one last time. Iâ€™m sorry
