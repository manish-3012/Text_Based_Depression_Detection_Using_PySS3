Why can I 'turn off' my emotions?So I cry like all the time, mainly at night because I know that nobody in my house is awake. When I cry in the day, which isnt as often, and I hear someone coming upstairs, I just instantly stop crying and just watch the TV with nothing on my mind.
Am I just blocking out my emotions and burying them?
