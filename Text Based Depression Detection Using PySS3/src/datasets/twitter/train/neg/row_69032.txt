Nobody to fuckin listen to what I gotta sayI was never ever gonna have a Reddit account. Lol I've lurked Reddit since before dinosaurs... Yet here I am. With an account. I don't even know how to fuckin post or what I even want or why the fuck posting on Reddit suddenly became an option. 20 years I've been fighting this on again/off again depression. Thought I was pretty fuckin good at it by now... Thought I'd been through it enough times that I had the strength to just keep fighting it when times were bad. BOOM ENTER 2.5 years of incessant, ever worsening dark black... Burned alllllll dem bridges with useless lies. Burned all dem people with lies too. Guess I'm a flamethrower. Also, anxiety. Also, my soul fucking hurts and I'm tired of being tired. So. Fucking. Tired. 
It gets blacker and blacker and I'm doing all the appropriate things for someone as fucked as me but it KEEPS GETTING blacker. Like wtf I needed a break about 2 years ago and it never comes. Surely silence is better. Surely.
