LossThe urge to kill myself is strong. I miss the love of my life so much. Its been a month. I just want to be with him again. I at first cared about how my friends and family would feel if I offed myself so I just didn't do it. I'm not living for myself anymore. I'm just living for other people so they won't be sad. I've never lived for myself.. I don't care anymore.. &amp; I still won't kill myself and it makes me angry how much I care about other people and how they would feel. I just want to die. I don't want anybody to care if I die. I just want them to let me go. I'm empty and a shell. I get a little happy sometimes but then I get sad and depressed again. I just want to talk to him and hold him and have him hold me forever and tell me that he loves. Just want to be wrapped up in his embrace for eternity. My heart broke when he passed. Its still broken and always will be. I'll always be broken.
