I regret letting someone into my life knowing I am mentally illI really really regret it. I wish and should have stayed alone. When we first spoke I said I was scared to get close to him because I knew this was too big of a mess to bring someone else into. He understood, he empathised, he was so gentle and kind. I let him in and I wish I could go back. 

He accepted me, all my flaws, all my issues with ease, but I guess some of that was only on surface level. Too much painful stuff has happened apparently as a result of my mental state and how we treated one another as a result. It's hard to communicate with someone the complete opposite. Super sensitive vs no emotion at all. It changed from that empathy to apathy. 

I'm just hurt beyond belief. I wish in the past he saw how his actions hurt instead of just seeing only the things I did wrong. It's horrible, it's like I can't live with or without him. I thought we were doing good, I was making strides in getting better and it's such a knock back. I feel so humiliated and this was on top of a mountain of (mental &amp; physical) issues I had/have to face. I just hate how every time I feel like my heart has shattered and to him, like I never mattered. It's hard to keep getting over it again and again when it keeps happening. 

I regret letting him in, making his life miserable and myself as a byproduct - although, I already was. He's not to blame for all of this; I had a lot of preexisting issues. I guess all I'm saying is sometimes when you're vulnerable and have been in a bad place for a long time, maybe go with your head and not your heart. At least then you don't risk ruining two lives like I did.
