Realisation / time to vanishWe're to start.

I've got bipolar and whilst writing this I'm on a serious down so it's a struggle to even attempt to express my feelings. But I feel kinds hopeless. I believe I'm only truly happy when I've got something to look forward too. That thing was university. This has suddenly been snatched from me as I was not invited to join back the second year of my college course. Reasoning behind this is because I work 50 odd miles away from the college and unlike students there I'm older ( 21 ) so have responsibilities and such. Luckily I've been offered a position at another college to do their send year. This means though my job I currently have wouldn't be possible to do anymore as its too much of a journey. 

So that part is really getting me down and also I've had a really rough time whilst being at my parents house. My mother despises me and my farther left before I was born and refuses to acknowledge my existence. Meaning the 2 people who are meant to be there for me don't give a shit. It sucks because me and my mum used to be inseparable and she was like my best friend. Now she won't even answer me when I talk to her just ignores me. So leaves me feeling alone. I also have a girl I've been seeing but because of my bipolar it makes not so hard to even show emotion towards her. I don't miss her. And that worries me but I just don't feel it. I wouldn't be upset if she left me but I don't want her too. I just want to feel normal and not 
A emotionless twat.

Feel like there's nothing left. We live. We die. 

What's the point of waking up unhappy.
