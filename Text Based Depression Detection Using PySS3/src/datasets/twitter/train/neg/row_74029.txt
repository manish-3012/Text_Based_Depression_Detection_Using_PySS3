I'm done saving others when I cant save myself..This looping end of tragedy. Love. Hate. Fear. I'm so overwhelmed. I keep having panic attacks. Panic attacks so bad I cant move or think I'm just stuck sobbing and wishing I could slip into forever sleep. I fall in love every time I wake up  and they ruin me before i lay down. I'm so tired of being everyone's play thing. I wanna get married get a house and start a small animal sanctuary. I give my heart away every hour of my waking day. But all i can find in its place at night is an empty bottle and a half smoked cigarette. I want to disappear and see if anyone would notice. I'm sorry to come here and cry. Please dont feel anything for me. I am an obligation not a friend or human. I'm controlled trash
