I'm not suicidal now, but there's something I can't shake. I've struggled with the thought for years, and sometimes come close to going through with it. I recently had a really bad couple of days. I finally pulled myself off my dorm room floor and went outside to meet with some people I sort of knew to watch the Oscars.  Within thirty minutes of meeting up with them, people who were on laptops/smart phones/ et cetera got an e-mail informing us a student passed away in the past day. Knowing there was a death when I was struggling with those thoughts gave me chills. A few days later it was revealed that the student committed suicide. When I read that I was immediately dizzy and nauseous  and had to stop what I'd been doing. I didn't know him, but the fact that he killed himself when I was having those thoughts myself has just been... I don't even know. Like I said, I just can't shake it.
