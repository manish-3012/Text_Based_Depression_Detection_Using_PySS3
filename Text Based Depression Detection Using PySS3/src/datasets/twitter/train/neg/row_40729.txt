Since the start of 2020 , there hasn't been a single day I haven't thaught about suicideEven before Covid struck 2020 and ruined my life even more , I was already in despair . I smoked 6 - 7 cigarettes everyday and smoked weed and drank alcohol at every oppurtunity I got as if staying high was the only purpose in my life . My big dreams and failure at every aspect of life has made even normal days as nightmarish . Today is the last day of 2020 and this entire year truly took a great toll on my heart . My family is poor , I don't have a girlfriend , my first job that will start soon is very low paying and I see all my dreams crashing down , and this just gives me more despair and an urge to end my life . But I am strong , but still these thaughts haunt me everyday .
