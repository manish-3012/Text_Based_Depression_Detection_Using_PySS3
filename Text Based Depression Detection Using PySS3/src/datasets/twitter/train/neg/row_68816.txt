So long, and thanks for all the fish.Does it hurt to disappear?


Is it fast or is it slow? 


Does it happen in a spectacular burst of light, harrowing and wild and frenzied?


Does it happen as calmly as an exhaled breath, hushed and simple and unremarkable?


Will it feel cold, like shards of ice are in your blood, around your lungs, behind your eyes?


Will it feel warm, like dappled sunlight on your bare feet, your shoulders, the nape of your neck?


I wonder.


I used to wonder only a handful of times a year. It turned into every month, then every week, then every day. Now, every hour.


How easy, how simple it's going to be to just stop, to just let go, to just give up.


To close my eyes and sink down, down, deep down,

where itâ€™s dark and quiet and calm,

where I can stay forever,

where I can finally go to a place that I belong.
