Want do do it.I am so done. Iâ€™ve fucked up my body with SH. I lie to my parents and tell them Iâ€™m happy. I lie to my Psychiatrist and Therapist and seem like their easiest patient ever. I am so close to killing myself. My birthday is on Sunday. Turning 15. I now see suicide as a permanent solution to every problem I ever had, have, and will have. It is not selfish. They are selfish for making me put their feeling above my own. I donâ€™t know what to do. I want to die but am scared of whatâ€™s after, if itâ€™s worse? Better? Or just the same..
