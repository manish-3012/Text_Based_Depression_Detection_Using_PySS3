I want to be dead, I just don't want to kill myself. One day, the will to die will override my resistance of suicide.Better dead than disabled.

I live a shitty life, trapped, dependent,  stripped of my freedom. Everyday experiencing medically mandated molestation by tubes, suppositories, and caregivers who dress and undress me.

With all that I love stripped from my life, eventually I'll run out of the ability to endure being care for and end this life of imprisonment and embarrassment. 

I resisted today, but will regret that decision tonight.
