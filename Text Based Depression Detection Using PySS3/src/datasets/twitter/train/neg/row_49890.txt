Need advice/someone to talk toAlright well Iâ€™ll start out with Iâ€™m pathetic. Iâ€™m a 19 male college freshman. Have a supportive family and friends (atleast I think they are my friends). Iâ€™m a premed student and about to finish my first semester with a 4.0 but Iâ€™ve struggled with suicidal thoughts all year, and not because of stress. Everything is on track for the future except the fact that living each day is miserable. For some reason the root of my suicidal thoughts is because Iâ€™ve never had a relationship. Iâ€™ve been called ugly and made fun of solely based on my appearance. My self confidence is non existent and whenever Iâ€™m happy itâ€™s just me pretending to not be upset so I donâ€™t but anyone. Iâ€™ve only ever been liked by one girl in my entire life and I ruined it, but she moved on in a week anyway. Iâ€™m unlovable. I have no problem making people laugh (hence why I have male friends) but my appearance instantly turns away all females. Iâ€™ve posted on amiugly just to get lied to by people calling me average. All I want is someone to love, not even sexually, I just want to have an attachment to someone. I canâ€™t live on longer like this, I feel as the single best thing in this life is unobtainable for me and it makes me want to kill myself.
