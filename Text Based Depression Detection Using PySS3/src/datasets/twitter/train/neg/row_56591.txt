I'm currently 50/50 on trying to kill myself tonightI don't really have anything in my future that makes me want to stay here. I have people who say they care but only when it seems to suit them. I'm a 30 year old male, no interest in having kids. I'm in a relationship but I don't see the point. I have a bunch of different depression medication stockpiled and i'm currently getting drunk think about if i just lock myself in a room in the house tonight and take it all in the hopes to take the pain away.

I don't have anything left to give the world, i can't be bothered. I want the voices in my head telling me that im not worthy to stop gnawing at me. Right now i could flip a coin for if i try it or not. I'm just done
