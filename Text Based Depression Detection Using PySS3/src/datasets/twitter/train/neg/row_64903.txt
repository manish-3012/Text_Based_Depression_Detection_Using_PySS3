Hey I need a friendHi, Iâ€™m Kadence. And I could really use someone to talk to. I really want to kill myself but the only thing that is stopping me is my parents. Just the thought of them coming into my room and finding me dead breaks my heart. But itâ€™s to much right now. I found out I have schizophrenia and my parents donâ€™t know yet, Iâ€™ve had a couple episodes where I really just want to hurt someone. And Iâ€™m afraid that I might someday. It feels like I have no real friends that I can truly sit down and have a conversation with. Iâ€™m obese and super insecure about my self. My grandma constantly hounds  me about my weight, finances, and constantly plays the victim card to make me feel bad. It feels like I have nowhere to go. Just looking for a friend.
