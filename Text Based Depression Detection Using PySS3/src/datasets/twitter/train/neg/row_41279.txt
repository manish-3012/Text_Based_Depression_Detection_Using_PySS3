Iâ€™m at my breaking point.Iâ€™m 30. Single. Broke. Unemployed. And having absolutely nothing to show for my shitty life. 

Iâ€™m afraid of heights, at this point Iâ€™m not afraid of jumping off the highest point downtown in the next few weeks. Too bad it got cold so fast otherwise it wouldâ€™ve been a beautiful day for a sky dive.
