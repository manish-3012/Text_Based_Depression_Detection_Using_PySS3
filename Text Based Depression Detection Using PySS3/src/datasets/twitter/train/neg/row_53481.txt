Do You Ever Have Those Days Where You're Just...Tired...I'm exhausted. Physically and mentally.

I push myself to try and get my ideal body type every day or so, and work to try and be able to look at myself in the mirror, but I see no progress. And I want to do certain things that I'm just not physically capable of for reasons I can't figure out...

I'm worn out trying to make myself happy, and I'm worn out trying to pretend that I'm enjoying life.

I fucking hate it. I am miserable in my own skin - who the fuck would enjoy that?

I'm too much of a coward to actually kill myself, but I'm crazy depressed. Not the crying-self-to-sleep kind, but the life-is-just-dull-and-colorless kind. I'm just tired.

Tired of living up to expectations. Tired of trying. Tired of seeing no progress. Tired of being anxious. Tired of hearing my mom say "you're not depressed, you're fine". Tired of trying to make friends. Tired of preparing for college. Tired of knowing that my soon-to-be-roommate is cooler than me and I'm a piece of shit. Tired of living in a world where I can't get my dream job and do something that I truly enjoy simply because I'm transgender.

I'm *fucking exhausted*...
