Need help, but not for meI have a friend that I met not many time before, when we started talking I knew he was too smart and it was very fun to talk with him, with the pass of the time we got confidence in each other and he started talking me about some deeper things about him, and then i discovered he harm himself, I tried to give him tips and encouraged him to take therapy and I knew he has suicide thoughts , I donâ€™t really know what to do anymore and Iâ€™m worried about my friend, can you guys give me tips to help him?
