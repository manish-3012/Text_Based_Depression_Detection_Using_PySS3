my therapist told me she can't help mei've got a loving family. they support me and are worried about me everytime i look sad.
normally id say that i dont care if im alive or not. id prefer not to, but hey, my family would be sad if id die.
but lately my mood is getting worse and worse. ive heavily self-harm last monday (i cant say if it was a proper suicide attempt, i felt nothing before, during and after it). i was hospitalised.
my therapist says that if i won't try to get better i never will get better. as i said, i dont really care about my life, but my family does. currently, i regulary attend the therapy sessions but it doesn't help me at all (my family doesn't know that those sessions are pointless).
i don't know how long ill be able to fight for something that i dont care about (my life). the fact, that my family cares is making me feel so much worse.
