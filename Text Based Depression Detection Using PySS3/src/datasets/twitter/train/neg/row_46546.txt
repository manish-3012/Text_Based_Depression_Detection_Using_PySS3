An ugly girl with no friends or giftsAs title says, I have nothing to offer and I only plan to stay alive until my mom dies from her stage 4 cancer. 

Every day is an uphill battle. I cannot remember the last time my birthday was ever celebrated. Well, I actually spent this years birthday in a psych hospital and I think someone told me happy birthday. 

If someone were to offer to be my friend, I wouldnâ€™t follow through because thereâ€™s nothing I can offer. Iâ€™ve cried every day for how long? I dont know. I guess Iâ€™m weak minded because I cannot stop the pity party I keep throwing for myself, but any one who sees me in person would have similar mean things to say about me so I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m very different than most other people.

Idk why Iâ€™m writing this. Iâ€™m in pain.
