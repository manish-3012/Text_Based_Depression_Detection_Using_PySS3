I'm just done with everythingI'm so tired of my life. I'm so tired of life in general. Every time I do anything i just have this thought in the back of my head "why am i doing this?" What's the point of all this?" And i just don't wanna do anything anymore because what's the point? I don't like being in the life i have been givin. It's not other people, I love my family and friends. I just feel like there's no point in anything.
