im a hopeless wreck and i wish i were dead--diagnosed GAD w/ panic, and secondary depression and psychosis

im mid twenties male, i barely scraped by in highschool, i flunked out of community college, ive been fired from the two jobs ive had since graduating highschool

im such a burden

im so useless

i cant even promise anyone i wont do anything stupid ; i looked up the other night how to make a suicide bag, ive got the supplies and the gear now. i could do it.

i could but im too aware of the repercussions.

that my partner would blame herself, that she'd end up in hospital herself

that my parents will blame themselves, but what could have they done?

my two pets are old and dying,

when they are gone i will go too
