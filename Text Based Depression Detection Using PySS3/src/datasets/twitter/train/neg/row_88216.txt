I ask my self why do it... But then it reminds me(M29)It reminds me its the only true thing a person can own, the one thing no one can take away from you but you,The pain. Will it all end before the madness fully sets in ? Burning on course through my life, Dissolving everything i touch , ripping away every measure of brightness and joy before i can grasp it. Seems i always fumble face first into the darkness where i belong, but that has grown to become a familiar place in the past decade of this life. A place so dark , so cold , so familiar that i want to call it home... I wanna go home forever
