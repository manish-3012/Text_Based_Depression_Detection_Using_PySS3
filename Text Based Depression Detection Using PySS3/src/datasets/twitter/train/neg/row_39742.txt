I havenâ€™t tried to kill myself yet because I know Iâ€™ll failIâ€™ve been feeling suicidal for 7 months now and Iâ€™ve had the blade up to my wrist many times. I just canâ€™t, because I know itâ€™ll fail. I donâ€™t think I will be able to press hard enough. I donâ€™t have the heart to have my mother find me all bloody and expose myself like that. I feel invalid in many ways because of this. I just want help but I know I wonâ€™t ask for it. I want to die but Iâ€™m too scared. Iâ€™m such a fucking loser
