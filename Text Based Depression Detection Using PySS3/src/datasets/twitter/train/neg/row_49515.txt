I'm just so angryIn the past few weeks it seems I have just been spiraling down and down.

I'm not sad about it I'm just angry and I keep thinking of taking out on myself. I know I'm not gonna do it but it scares me that it keeps coming back and that in turn makes me more upset.

I just want to relax and not feel so anxious and stressed out.
