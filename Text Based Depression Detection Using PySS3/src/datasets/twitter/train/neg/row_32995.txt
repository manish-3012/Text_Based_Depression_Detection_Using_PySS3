whats the point?when i am happy i dream of finding somebody that cares about me. not some stranger from the internet that i dont even know if they exist or not, but somebody irl. time after time, the people in my real life suggest that they dont want me around, whether its explicitly or implicitly. ive spent about 20 years on this earth and i think thats enough. i dont want to spend 10 more years hoping im gonna find somebody thats not gonna throw me away. i dont even know why im posting this. if anyone has any suggestions for the method let me know
