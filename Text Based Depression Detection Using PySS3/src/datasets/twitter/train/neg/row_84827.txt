My suicide will be my familyâ€™s cross to bearFamily is bullshit. Every one of them can and will turn on you if it suits them. Even your parents. I hate my mother* for having me before she was ready and emotionally fucking me up from a young age. I hate my cousin for molesting me. I hate my dad for leaving, even though heâ€™s the only one that made me feel safe and happy. I hate my stepdad for treating me like shit and making me feel illegitimate. I hate my grandmother for having so many chances to fucking help me but not putting her stupid politics aside. Everyone in my family is a fucking boomer apart from my mom and dad, who should have been older when I was born. 

Honourable mention: My aunt for dragging out the molestation drama and telling me Iâ€™m a liar, forcing me to face my abuser in a he-said she-said. 



*Honestly, my mom could have her own fucking page. She used to shout at me so loud that Iâ€™d shake instinctively. Iâ€™m 19 and still canâ€™t talk to her or ask her for things because I never know when sheâ€™ll snap at me and send me on a suicidal tirade like this. She told me there was nothing wrong with me. She is a narcissistic pos who put me through a private school where teachers could assault you and call you stupid if you did the slightest thing wrong, and I was bullied and even abused by other students, mostly for being the only one who wasnâ€™t rich. My mom should have known it wasnâ€™t right for me, but she wanted to live through me. 

Just fuck them all. Every single person in my family is a manipulative piece of shit psycho. Theyâ€™re genuine white trash. 

Iâ€™ve been affected to the point where I want myself to be dead. Itâ€™s not because of pain or depression, but a genuine hatred of myself from always being told Iâ€™m weak and unwanted etc. Fuck it. Itâ€™s truly a pity that I wonâ€™t see their reactions.
