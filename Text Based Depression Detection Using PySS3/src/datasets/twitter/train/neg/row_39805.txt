An improvement.I've been feeling.. not myself.. for a while now, even having more than occasional thoughts of suicide. Was having a particularly bad day so went for a long drive (6 hours, just me, the car, and the radio). 

After finally clearing my head a bit, I decided to try and talk to a friend. (I was hesitant to do so for a couple of reasons;  1) I (wrongfully) thought this friend wanted nothing to do with me anymore (the pessimistic side of me convinced myself that a minor occurrence was a major one, and it sorta snowballed from there.
2) I've attempted to talk to a couple of people before, and was basically told to "keep my shit to myself ". (Or hit with a bunch of Bible verses, which I appreciate the thought, but it's not really all that helpful.)
3) I convinced myself that even if we were still good, and if they were willing to listen, it wasn't my place to cause them worry.) 

Long story short, I finally managed to make myself talk. She's agreed to hold onto my gun and told me about a place not too far from where I'm at that will see me, I just have to figure out a schedule that won't interfere with work. 

I'm just starting, and there's obviously a ways to go, but this is something I guess. Hoping things go well from here.
