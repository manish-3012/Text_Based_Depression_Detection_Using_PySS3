Carrying my suicide notesI keep my suicide notes (on my case, more like goodbye letters) in my camera bag that I carry everywhere. In the case I can't take it anymore and resort to killing myself in a brief instant, I want those messages on my person so they're found.

I don't think it's helping me by having them always so close, encouraging me to just run out of wherever I am and into oncoming traffic or off a bridge.

But at the same time, I need these messages, as well as my will which is also in my bad, found. It's the only way I can guarantee giving people conclusion.
