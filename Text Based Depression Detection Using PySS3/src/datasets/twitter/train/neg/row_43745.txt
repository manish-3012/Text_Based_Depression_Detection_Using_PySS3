Suicide breakupI'm beginning to change my mind about wanting to stay on earth for my dreams and such. 

1: 0 fear of death
2: 0 joy or happiness or contentment. 
3: Love every possible outcome of death
4: Hate every possible outcome of life
5: No longer concerned with how people mourn me. Death is an illusion and the dead are more alive than the living.
6: Suicide doesn't even hurt and the more I imagine it the better I feel.
