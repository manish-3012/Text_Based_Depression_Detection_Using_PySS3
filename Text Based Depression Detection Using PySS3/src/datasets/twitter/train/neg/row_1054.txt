Is assisted suicide an option at this pointIs it possible, for me, a 15 year old undiagnosed jersey kid to apply for the Death with Dignity in the state of New Jersey? I'm assuming likely not, but is there a way to get assisted suicide any other way? I'm too scared to do it on my own, and I understand all the consequences of suicide, but I am confident that I wish to, and have been for years.
