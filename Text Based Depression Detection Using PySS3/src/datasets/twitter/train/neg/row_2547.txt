26 years old who messed up everything...Hi there. Just looking for somebody to hear my story and get it out of my chest. 

I'm a 26 years old guy right now. During 2009, I enrolled in a medical school outside of my country. The normal time to complete my study are 6 years. I failed my first year study and had to repeat a year for it. Sadly, i failed it again but this time I did not tell my parents. I live a pretend life. I did not go to the uni, did not go to the exam andlost a lot of friends and a girl i love so much. I was lost and i did nothing about it. 

Now, i told my parents everything. I know how much i have failed them. Being the only son just made it hurt more. Seeing my friends the same age as me starting to get work, married and having children, I know i will never have all that. 

I was always fascinated by medicine but everytime i got the exam results, it does not potray it correctly. Why...

Thinking about suicide is for sure prohibitted in all religion but i can't stop thinking about it and putting me in a state of depression and denial. 

My parents said they need to face it as it is the reality right now. Regardless, I am still their son. I love them so much but why can't i show it to them? Why can't i appreciate them more? I have failed a lot of people who loves me so much.
