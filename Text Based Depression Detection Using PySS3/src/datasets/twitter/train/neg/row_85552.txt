I don't know what to do with my lifeDropped out of college twice, can't get a job after almost 2 years of looking for one, don't have any friends that I trust with this issues, and there was a girl that helped me through a lot, she started seeing someone else and now acts as if I'm making my problems up.

I don't know how to continue with my life, everytime I think about what I want to do, the first thing I think it's that I want to die, my family doesn't think that mental illness is a real thing, and getting help in my country costs a fortune, every day I search for jobs but nothing comes up, and I can feel how my family looks at me like I'm just a dissapointment, I just want to kill myself but I don't know how, everytime I think about it, I just want to die so much, but I also feel like I'm scared of doing it.

I really don't know what to do, I just want this to end.
