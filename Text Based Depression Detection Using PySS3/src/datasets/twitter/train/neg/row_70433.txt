Chronic prostatitis/CPPSI donâ€™t know what to do. You see my coping strategy. I very very very want to die but I try to find the exit from my pain. Each second I read about chronic pelvic pain syndrome I read about suicide I hate my life. I write it right now to live one more minute. I try to cling to life but unsuccessfully. Now I again took diazepam with hydroxizine. Iâ€™ve been suffering from prostate pain and ruination problem since 13 yo. My parents didnâ€™t believe me in that age. On tv was an advertisement that prostatitis happens after 40 yo. And now Iâ€™m 27 yo and Iâ€™m tired of enduring these problems. I am isolated from the outside world. The only person who was in my life and supported me left me. She doesnâ€™t need unhealthy, depressive man like me. Unfortunately in Russia I donâ€™t have gun to kill myself. Itâ€™s unbearable.
