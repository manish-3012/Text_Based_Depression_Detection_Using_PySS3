I feel like I can't talk to my significant other about my suicidal thoughts.  Hi. I've been seriously contemplating suicide. To put it shortly, every action I've taken for the past few months has had a suicide fantasy attached to it. 

Lately me and my girlfriend of 8 years have been in a very strained relationship. It's at the point to where if I cause her to have even a slightly bad mood, I have to leave and go home. I have no family, no friends to talk to, just her. 

Months ago I told her that I've thought about it and she didn't seem concerned, but I'm sure she was. Since then though, she's felt like I'm just emotional baggage. I don't want to ruin our relationship further and I don't want to stress her out any further either. I just can't stop thinking about this though, and I don't have anyone else to talk to. Funny enough, she used to volunteer at a suicide hotline. 

P.S. I'm not willing to seek professional help because my only values in life are her and the chance to become a Doctor. Having been on suicide watch before would destroy any chance I have at being a Doctor.
