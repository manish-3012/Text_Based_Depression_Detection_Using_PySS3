Just getting deeper into thisI'm just getting deeper and deeper into this pit. I just cant handle it. I thought I was getting stronger but I'm not. I'm trying my hardest, seeing my therapist and taking my medication but nothing is working.

I just want this noise in my head to end. The only thing stopping me is my cat, I dont want to leave her alone.
