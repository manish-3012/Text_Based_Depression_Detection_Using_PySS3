Suicide note.I'm going to die next week. Trying to make it look like an accident, I have to, there are people who care about me and this will make it a little easier to handle for them at least. I'm ashamed of what I'm going to put them through, but they'll be much better off when I'm just a memory. I can't handle living anymore and my pathetic emotions, I only ever burden others with them. This has been going on for too long.

I don't really know why I'm posting this here, I probably won't reply to anyone. I just needed somewhere to vent. Maybe it'll give me a little more clarity. I know this is what I need to do.
