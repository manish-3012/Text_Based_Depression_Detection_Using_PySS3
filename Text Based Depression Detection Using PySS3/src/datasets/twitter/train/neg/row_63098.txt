I Have Nothing Left To Look Forward ToI graduated from college about a week ago. I should be out celebrating and looking forward to the future, but Iâ€™m not. In order to celebrate you need to have friends. 

It took five years to finish my undergrad education. I spent most of my time completely alone. I already have a job and I managed to graduate without any significant debt so it isnâ€™t so much that Iâ€™m overwhelmed as it is Iâ€™m just empty. Iâ€™m at a place in my life where I could do anything I wanted and that should be exciting. But I donâ€™t care. 

At the end of the day I come home to my cat. And my cat wonâ€™t live forever. I have no ambition, no desire to make anything of myself. In the past I stayed alive so I could graduate, stayed alive to see that movie that was coming out next year, stayed alive because maybe the day after I killed myself would be the day I met my future wife, or got hired for my dream job, or finally stopped being sad all the fucking time. But I donâ€™t think that day is coming and I donâ€™t know if I can bear it anymore. The thought of going home to nothing and watching YouTube videos to numb myself until I have to go to sleep to wake up for work the next day is enough to make me want to kill myself. The truth is Iâ€™m just tired. Iâ€™m tired of not fitting in anywhere. Iâ€™m tired of volunteering, and going to therapy, and going to the gym, and doing all these things that are supposed to help me get better just to feel the same way Iâ€™ve felt since I was a little kid. I donâ€™t want to wake up anymore. 

With school out of the way, thereâ€™s nothing for me to look forward to anymore. I graduated. I finally did it. And I feel exactly the same as always.
