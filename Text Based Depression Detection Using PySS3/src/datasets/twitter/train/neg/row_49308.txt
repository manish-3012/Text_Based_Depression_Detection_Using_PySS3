Always AloneHey...I am a two time suicide survivor...I want to try again and they say the third time is a charm right? I have no friends...I have tried reaching out to people online and it always ends in shit. The last "friend" I had threw me away basically. I keep trying to reach out to no avail. I feel like there is something wrong with me, like I attach to people way too fast and hard. Then I become too much to deal with and they drop me...it hurts so bad. Everytime it's harder than the last. I hate waking up and knowing day after day I will be alone and friendless...I would give anything to not be able to feel...I don't know when, how, or where but I do feel it coming...the urge to get away from it all and be done is really strong...
