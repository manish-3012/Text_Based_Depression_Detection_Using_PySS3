Least painful way to go?I have lots of sertraline and mirtazapine also have some sedatives oxazepam and lorazepam and I'm wondering which combination would be least painful to end it all with. I currently use 200mg sertraline and 30mg mirtazapine daily.

And no it won't get better I been living that lie since I have been 17 and now at 22 I'm ready to give up.
