I think my friend may have committed suicide or maybe she is in rehab I donâ€™t knowMy online friend who lives in Florida (I live in jersey) havenâ€™t responded since Saturday a few days before that I found out she tried to commit suicide thatâ€™s why I havenâ€™t heard from her but I thought it was her phone because she stated that she had broken it with all of these recent events I think she maybe have committed Iâ€™m really worried and I only have her first name I canâ€™t just call 911 and ask them to do a wellness vist when I have no info Iâ€™m really scared
