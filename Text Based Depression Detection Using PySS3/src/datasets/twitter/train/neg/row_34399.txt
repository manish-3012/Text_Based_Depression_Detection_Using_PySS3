Suicidal 24/7, anyone want to talk?I've been suicidal pretty much constantly for days now, I've been doing things to hurt myself without caring, I've been on the edge of doing something to die pretty much whenever I get spare time, idk what's stopping me, nothing really I'm not sure. I think I'm just lonely all the time. And sad.

Does anyone want to chat?

I don't deserve anyone's time, I know I'm worthless, but I just like talking to people so much. I'm so lonely in real life. I sound so pathetic, I'm sorry. I just still want to die. Idk. I'm sorry.
