I hate myself and I want to dieI hate myself more and more every day. I don't want to be this way to people. I'm a burden and I don't care. I'm a parasite and I refuse to change.

It's been like this for years, I've tried to change. I've tried medication, therapy, friends, family, I just don't want to wake up anymore. Im done.
