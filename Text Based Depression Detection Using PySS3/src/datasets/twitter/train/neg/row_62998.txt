My mother says I'm worthlessMy mom never misses a chance to tell me how worthless I am. And she definitely shows her opinion. Except of course when she wants me to do something for her...so what's the point? I mean, if the one person who is supposed to love me forever hates me what the hell is the point of living. I've been hanging on by a thread for my entire life and I'm about to give up... because I'm fucking over it.
