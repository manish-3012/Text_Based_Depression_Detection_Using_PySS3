I don't know how to reach for helpI'm a person who holds many things from everyone around me.  I don't know how to reach out and tell the people around me or the people close to me.  I have tried to commit suicide in the past but either failed or back out at the last second.  I want to keep on living, but I don't really see any reason then how it would affect other people. 

I don't have a reason for living which is crushing me right now.  I don't feel my normal range of emotions, and the things that I would enjoy at one point seemed to just not interest me.  I'm only in my early 20s but my body is falling apart with multiple nervous system problems.  My joy was doing physical activity and doing martial arts.

I don't want live a life without being able to do the things I enjoy.  I don't care how long my life is but that I enjoyed my life.  I'm trying to find something to enjoy and have found a release in reading but the more I read the less enjoyment I receive.

Right now I'm just waiting until 2 of my sisters visit before I do anything because I want to see them.

In my mind, I don't understand if I'm being selfish for wanting it over or I feel like I'm not selfish enough because I don't want to make other people hurt to end my misery?

I'm also afraid of how my loved ones will view how I feel.  I know this is irrational but I can't get past how I was raised to try and hide weakness.  I don't know how to get passed this block.  I know that I need there help but my own emotional hang ups prevent seeking said help.  I want help in being able to get the aid that I need from my loved one.
