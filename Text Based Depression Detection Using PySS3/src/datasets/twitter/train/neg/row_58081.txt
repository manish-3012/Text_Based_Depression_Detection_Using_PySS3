I lack the courage.Hello everyone. 

I'm Rebecca. I started self harming a while back as a way of trying to manage my internal pain and struggle I suffer through on a daily basis. I've become addicted to it now, I crave it so much. And yet on my really bad days, like today, all I want to do is go too far when I'm doing it. Going past the point of no return and allowing the pain and suffering to be gone forever. I just lack the courage. I'm not brave enough. All I want is the courage to do what I know is best, what I know is right. What do I do?
