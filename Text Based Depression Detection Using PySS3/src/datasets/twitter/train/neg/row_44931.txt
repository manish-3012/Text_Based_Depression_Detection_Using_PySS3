I just told my best friend I want to die.She said that I was being stupid. That I shouldn't be feeling like this. That other people are worse off than I am. She blamed it on exam stress, but I've been feeling this way for 6 months. I wish when I go to sleep that I just won't wake up.
I have this kind if mask though, which might be why she didn't take it that seriously, that portrays me as a happy-go-lucky girl, with no cares in the world. Little do they know that I am in my own world, where everyone hates me, where I obsess about everything morbid, where sometimes I don't even know where reality starts and my dreams end. 
I guess I shouldn't be angry with her. She doesn't know any of that. All she sees is me, with my loving family and all my friends, with my perfect life. She just doesn't know what's going on in my head.
