it only makes sense that he stopped talking to everyone. waiting to die while everyone else waits for him to speak.tell me itâ€™s okay to fall to let the boulder that i carry fall on my head and crush me to death tell me itâ€™s okay to give up this fucking diet and exercise bullshit when there is nothing and no one to live for anyway stop giving a damn about my grades and finances and just let it all collapse on me.  put up with others and it kills me just as much so kick them to the curb and call it loneliness. some friend. no friends? your son is hanging in the basement! or maybe heâ€™s running on the treadmill? these things, the devil laughs but at least im smiling this time.
