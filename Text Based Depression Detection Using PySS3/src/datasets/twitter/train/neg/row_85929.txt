24 hour suicide online chat?I have googled and googled but they all have a cut off time.  Because of course crises always happen before 1 am.  I cannot talk on the phone either.  Everyone is asleep and I am just not good at the phone.  Phone anxiety, I suppose. I also never know what to say.  Typing helps me collect my thoughts better.  Also, I don;t suppose I really want to say it all out loud.
 
I had a small glimmer hope today when a friend was gonna come see me.  That didn't work out.  My daughter is pissed off at me.

My youngest left for a month and that just adds to the depression.  

I just want to feel nothing.  I've done a pretty good job at it.  A couple of hours ago, I took 3 mg of klonopin, my last quarter xanax bar, and a bupap. Then everything fell apart and I took 1 more bupap, 1 150 mg trazadone, 2 50mg of tramadal, and 10 mg of klonopin.  
That was besides my Symbyax, lamotrigine, and lovastatin.

I'm pretty loopy already, but I took the big list at 1:15 am.  Is an hour and a half long enough for it to all kick in?  

Honestly I'm not trying to kill myself with these, I just want to be numb.  Everything hurts so bad right now I can't handle it.
I find myself thinking I need to make a will, find a place for my youngest daughter.  I live in a town where trains come through all the time.  Watching them makes me have dark thoughts about jumping in front of one.

I cried all day today.  I've had small periods when I wasn't but for the most part it was full on tears.

TL;DR **does anyone know of a 24 hour suicide chat line?**
