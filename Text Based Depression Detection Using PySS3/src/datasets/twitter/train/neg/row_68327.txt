haha, fucki have been surrounded by a dark cloud for years now, and i wanted to get rid of it but it just kept showing up when i didnt distract myself. i've been feeling worse and worse but i haven't talked about my mental health once in my life with anyone. i used to try killing myself but not really making a big effort because i didn't want to be selfish, but i am constantly making elaborate plans to get rid of myself. i tried to kill myself last week by taking upwards of 100 different pills, mostly tylenol or melatonin, but it did absolutely nothing and i kept taking pills, eating vitamins, nothign killed me. i told someone about my true feelings for the first time in my life a few days ago and she sent me to the hospital for tests to make sure i didn't die, but LITERALLY NOTHING WAS WRONG. after sitting in the hospital bed for 6 hours, i came back home and felt the same. today i am searching up if mouthwash can kill me because they hid all the medicine. i just don't want to hurt my mom anymore, she would get over my death fast anyways because i cause so many problems and im just a burden on everyone.
