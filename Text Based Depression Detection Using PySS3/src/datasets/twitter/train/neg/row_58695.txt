Not knowing what the future holds felt like potential when I was young. Not anymore. Itâ€™s just crushing uncertainty and anxiety.Iâ€™m not going anywhere with my life. I know Iâ€™m fairly intelligent, but Iâ€™m somehow not going anywhere. Iâ€™ve never placed below 96th percentile on any standardized exam Iâ€™ve ever taken from undergrad to graduate and professional level, and yet Iâ€™m somehow unable to advance to a school or find a job. I used to be so full of passion and hope, eager to make a difference. Now I just want people to leave me the fuck alone so I can finally die and nobody would care. Iâ€™m not looking for jobs because Iâ€™m not motivated to do anything, and thereâ€™s nothing Iâ€™d like to do, for living or for fun. I just want to be released from this curse of a life that I was brought into against my will.
