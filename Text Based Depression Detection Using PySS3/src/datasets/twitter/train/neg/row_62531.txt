No will to live anymoreI've been depressed since I was 15 that I remember.  I'm sure it was before that, but I'm honestly not sure how long.  15 was when I first really had a name for this.  I've been on meds and therapy and combinations there of, nothing helped.  I've had enough.  I have very few friends (less than 5), am over 30 and never been in a relationship, family is a royal disaster and I'm trying to distance myself as much as possible because really they just make everything worse.  I have a crap dead end job that I can't get out of, mounting debt issues and a lack of anything decent in my life anymore.  I've tried getting out and meeting people, I've tried to be positive, I've tried to find things to keep me busy.  Nothing helps anymore.  These days it's a fight to just get out of bed.  A couple years ago I lost 135 lbs, thinking the weight loss would help because I'd been overweight all of my life.  I've gained it all but 10 lbs back and no, the weight loss didn't help.  I'm tired of being alive and trying to find some reason to breathe every day.  I'm not going to put a gun to my head or anything, but if I were to get hit by a car or something tomorrow I wouldn't be overly upset over it.
