do you ever feel like...the days are blending together 
the time is runing fast
no one got the time to hear you out
no one is understanding
no body to share your life with
the sky looks dark
everything in your eyes looks hollow and meaningless
even tho you used to believe in yourself
now you don't know who you are 
you can't separate between reality and dreams...
you feel like your heart is beating fast getting out of your chest sometimes
and times you feel so cold and heavy you can not lift a finger...
you can't trust anyone because everyone failed you and you failed them
you might used to believe in god and stuff but now you just feel like he really can't hear you out screaming...
the times were you felt normal and happy in the past now doesn't feel real to you anymore
you see the wars and the kills around you and think about how crule and cold we really are

selfish and self centered creatures we can't deny the ugly truth...
