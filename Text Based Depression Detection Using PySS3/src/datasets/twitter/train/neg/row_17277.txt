Does people really kill themselves?I know this may sound weird..
But i just don't feel  like its real.. 
 I have seen  it irl 
So its doesn't feel o real to me
Even tho I know its happening. 
 I've seen some YouTube videos(mrcaringuy about people who lost their their lives to suicide and i just feel so bad for them
Its so sad :(
 Like its sad for me to think that people struggled and gave up
