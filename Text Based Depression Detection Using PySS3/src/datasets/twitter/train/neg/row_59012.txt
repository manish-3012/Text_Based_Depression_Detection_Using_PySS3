I just want my life to get better. Hi,  my name doesn't matter, and I do not know why I'm saying this

   I just don't know how to really go on,   my boyfriend and I are dealing with a huge issue,  I sometimes think I am falling out of love with him, and after I break up with him; I want to end myself.     I know it seems stupid, but I have been trying meds for almost a year.   I don't want to break up with my boyfriend and I don't want to die.  I just want a normal life.  I want a life where weed is okay, because sometimes it does help.   I don't smoke it to escape from the pain.   I just want to relax for a little bit.  I am 3k in debt because my friend called the police on me for a wellness check.    I don't want to bring my boyfriend down with me.    Please help.
