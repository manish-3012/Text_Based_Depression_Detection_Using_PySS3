Whatâ€™s the point.I feel so miserable. I hate that Iâ€™m even thinking about this again. I feel anxious around everybody, I always cancel plans, my job wonâ€™t give me hours, Iâ€™m ugly, nobody likes me, Iâ€™m always unhappy. I wish there was a painless and instant way to die. I just want to get out of here I hate this. I want to go TODAY. 
Iâ€™m so alone. Nobody cares about me.
