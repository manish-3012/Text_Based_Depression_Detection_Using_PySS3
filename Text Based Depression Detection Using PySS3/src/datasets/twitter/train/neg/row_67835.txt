I would rather kill myself than spend another night alone.So, I guess the title pretty well sums it up. 

I recently went through a bad breakup and have no friends whatsoever. Come to think about it, I haven't had a friend since high school. I spend every day alone at home with my 2 young kids and every night completely alone. Its not from lack of trying, hell I've posted 13 ads on craigslist, a few on reddit, and even joined those ridiculous dating apps. All to no avail. Its like walking around with a giant open sore on my face. People just have no desire to be around me. I think I'm an interesting dude, not overly unattractive, I like to talk and do fun things. 

I've spent the past 4 weeks contemplating putting a bullet in my face just so I don't have to be lonely anymore. I really don't know how much longer I can resist.



Update: Hey all, still here. As if things couldn't get any worse I had a major tragedy(to me) happen soon after posting this. 

I was in the bathroom trying to convince myself not to follow through with suicide and my autistic son killed my pet chameleon. He has never approached his cage in any way that would make me think he would cause trouble before. 


That chameleon was the closest thing I've had to a friend for 6 months. Now in my darkest times he's dead. 
I'm working on replying to everyone now so don't think all of your advice fell on deaf ears. All of you helped more than you know just by replying.
