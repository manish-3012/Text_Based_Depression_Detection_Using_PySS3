I'm tired of livingBefore you start saying it will get better, it won't... I live in a bankrupt country with zero chance of getting a job, zero chance of starting a family, have literally zero irl friends (only one but he only messages me if he wants something for himself), my 2 cousins that I hang out with always ignore me and never text me even if I text them they didn't even care when I told them about my birthday. I have no hope for a future, and no hope for a job and I end up most likely homeless.

Imagine growing up knowing you will be homeless and end up dying alone and no one will give a shit about you and will probably be forgotten in 2 week.
