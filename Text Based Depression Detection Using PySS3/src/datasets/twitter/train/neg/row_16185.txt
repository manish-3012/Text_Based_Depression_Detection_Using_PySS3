Iâ€™m gonna finally kill this pain and sorrowIâ€™ve never felt so alone before. I am in my early 20â€™s. I donâ€™t have a car. I donâ€™t work. Within the past year Iâ€™ve been diagnosed with 2 chronic diseases and have about $5000 in hospital bills (thankfully after insurance) that I donâ€™t have money for, while one of the hospitals have a debt collecting agency looking for their money. So there goes my credit score before I even attempt to build credit. I feel every time I try to talk to someone they donâ€™t listen.. My empathy runs deep. To the point that even if I donâ€™t want to see tomorrow, I donâ€™t want to leave the 4-5 loved ones I have with pain and guilt. So I will continue to fight, even if their silence has contributed to my pain. I know what that guilt of losing someone to mental health feels like. But itâ€™s getting to a point where irrational thoughts are becoming rational. I just want this pain to stop. At the very least I just want someone to actually care enough about me to listen to me. Iâ€™ve been dealing with depression and suicidal thoughts for over half my life. Iâ€™m just getting to the point where Iâ€™m ready to throw in the towel. Iâ€™m sorry if this is all over the place, my head is still spinning. I might as well be honest here, one thing I would do when I was 13 would be to tie a belt around my neck, wrap it around a pull-up bar or something, and hold the other end while I drop my body down. I did that throughout the first year after my first and only suicide attempt where the pull-up bar ended up collapsing. I would do it to just feel that numbness and condition my body/mind by going to my â€œhappy placeâ€ for when I finally decided to go through with it. I havenâ€™t done that since I was 14. I donâ€™t know if I did it tonight just to feel something or if I wanted to be reminded of that feeling so I know whether thatâ€™s the way I want to go when/if I decide to end it all. I donâ€™t know, I just want to escape my head. Iâ€™m sorry for such a long post. Iâ€™m not quite sure what Iâ€™m looking to get out of this post, but itâ€™s worth a shot and Iâ€™m sure itâ€™s better than weeping alone.
