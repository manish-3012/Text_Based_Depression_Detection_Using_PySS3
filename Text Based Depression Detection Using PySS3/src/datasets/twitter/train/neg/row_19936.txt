Heading Towards River of StyxI just graduated high school and was gonna join the Navy, I had my life all set out for me. I made an 83 on the ASVAB but I was permanently disqualified to join because of an autoimmune disease. Now I just feel so lost like a ship without a compass. I try to better myself but nothing works out for me. I can't help but lay in bed awake all night and think what have I become? I've been working at McDonalds for a year now and I still live at home. This can't be what my life is supposed to be, I'm meant to be someone great and to do great things but I have a shit job and no plans for the future. The only thing keeping me from setting myself free is the thought of the pain I'd put my family through. If I can't find a better job here soon I'm gonna take my own life because I'm tired of dealing with all this shit.
