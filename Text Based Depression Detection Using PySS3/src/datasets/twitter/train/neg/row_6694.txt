Last try at life before I give upI swear, if treatment doesn't work this time around, I have no option but to kill myself. I can't fucking hold down school or job stuff for more than 3 years at a time without some fucking breakdown. "Get help" sounds so fucking easy. People say it like it is some automatic cure. I've gotten lots of help and yes people care about me, etc.


Well, fuck that, mental illness does not have a "cure" and is as complicated as any disease. In writing it off as some stage 3 hopelessness. I'm almost 31, no SO, no kids, just my apartment and vomit. Fuck all of this, this isn't living.


I'm a selfish twat. I emailed a former supervisor who is paralyzed from the neck down that I can't visit her because of this self-induced illness. Pathetic. I should have left out the details.  I'm a monster, pathetic. Almost 31 years old and I'm too lazy to do something like mail something out. And now I'm going to a place where I'm going to learn to fucking eat. What the hell, how old am I and what value do I add to this Earth
