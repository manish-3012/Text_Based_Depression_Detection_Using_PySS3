I don't want to traumatize my younger brother with my stupid dead face at all. If only there were a easy way to pulverise my body.He's a fantastic talented young man who is studying for a postgraduate degree. I'm the last and the most insignificant thing he should care about in his life. But I'm afraid that the authorities will force him to recognize my identity in the mortuary, or worse, at the scene.

It would be perfect if my death wouldn't bother him at all, but it would hardly be the case.

I hope there were some kind of device I could set up to grind my body into powder right after my death, so no one I care for would witness it.
