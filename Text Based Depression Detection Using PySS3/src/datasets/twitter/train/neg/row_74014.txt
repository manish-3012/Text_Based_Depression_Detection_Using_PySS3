My Entire Life has Been a Series of MistakesIâ€™m 18. I barely passed highschool with all Dâ€™s except for one C. I wasnâ€™t planned. My birth was premature, fucking up pretty much every one of my mental functions, from social/emotional to logical. Iâ€™m anxious, Iâ€™m unmotivated to go anywhere in life, and Iâ€™m emotionally weak. My parents coddled and overprotected me, making shit even worse for me. Yâ€™know that scrawny kid, buzz cut, ugly glasses, no one likes him? Thatâ€™s me. Iâ€™ve always been the stupid kid who always fucked up. I was and am the kid who did something for no logical reason, the kid who has no idea what to say in any social situations, the kid who gets stared at for saying something idiotic shit or something completely unrelated to the conversation entirely. Iâ€™m the kid who kept breaking his glasses, Iâ€™m the kid who would always drop things, Iâ€™m the kid who couldnâ€™t catch or throw a ball for shit. Iâ€™m the kid whoâ€™s still nervous to talk to new people in any capacity, Iâ€™m the kid who still pisses the fucking bed sometimes. Iâ€™m the kid who doesnâ€™t think before I do anything, Iâ€™m the kid who overshares and doesnâ€™t realize it. Iâ€™m the kid whoâ€™s sitting here crying cuz I just found out about all the effects of being premature, and that Iâ€™m gonna be fucked up my entire life, and instead of doing something to change that Iâ€™m the kid realizing my entire life, even before my birth, was a mistake, and contemplating whether I should be alive right now. The only thing keeping me from putting one in my head is my best friend who appreciates the good in me, even though sheâ€™s also annoyed at my constant incompetence. I want to believe that I can get past my disabilities, that I can become better, but donâ€™t think itâ€™s medically or psychologically possible. I feel obligated to be alive, for her, but I donâ€™t think I should be alive.
