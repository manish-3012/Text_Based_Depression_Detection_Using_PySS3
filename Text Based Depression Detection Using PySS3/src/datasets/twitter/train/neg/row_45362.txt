I fucked upSo ya, long story short, I'm a fuckin miserable human being. I cheated on my husband and pushed him away and asked for a divorce. Why? Idk. Maybe the paxil I was on made me feel emotionless. Maybe the postpartum depression that I never took care of finally got to me. Maybe I'm a miserable piece of shit to hurt the only man that has ever loved me.  Im off meds now and honestly feel normal and feel regret and sadness and hatred for myself. Im trying to be a good mom. Trying to show my ex that i really do love him. Yet all i do is pray secretly for death because i am literally all alone and hate myself. But i know i made mistakes. I know i deserve this. I truly am only living for my children.  Self sabotage is a real thing. Mental health is important.  I wish i wouldve taken care of mine.
