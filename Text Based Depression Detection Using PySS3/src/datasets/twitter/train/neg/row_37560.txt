NothingIâ€™m not sure what I came here to write, exactly I just feel like I needed to let this shit out somewhere. Itâ€™s Saturday 11:11 am Iâ€™m sitting in my car at a Dunkinâ€™ Donuts in Atlanta I have no money no gas Iâ€™m totally stuck I just chant figure out what Iâ€™m going to do. Iâ€™m very bipolar and I feel like I might kill myself on impulse one time, Everything is adding up to be so fucked Iâ€™ve wronged so many people in my life Iâ€™ve hurt people mislead people I honestly know that nobody would actually miss me, Iâ€™m nothing special, I left my home, my job, my girlfriend, for no reason a foolish insecure thing to do now my girlfriend has moved on Iâ€™ve lost my job and house and Iâ€™m stuck here with no money I did this to myself and I donâ€™t think I can get out I have a gun with me and it daunts me everyday the nights are the worst just wondering what the person who finds me will think whatâ€™s going to happen to my soul, Iâ€™m so lost Iâ€™m breaking down I just canâ€™t cope, I canâ€™t.
