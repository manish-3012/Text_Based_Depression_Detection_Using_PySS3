Don't know what to do.About 8 months ago I realized that I really just wasn't that happy with my life and what was going on.  I felt worthless, dumb, and just overall useless.  About 6 months ago I started dating this wonderful girl who brought me so much happiness.  And about a month after we started dating on a road trip we crashed my car.  It was a stupid and dumb decision but the way I see it is that it happened and now there's nothing I can do about it and sulking on that matter won't help at all.  I was dating her secretly but then my parents found out when this incident happened and I was banned from seeing her.  We have school together however so there isn't to much they can do about that.  Anyway, after that event life just got harder again and I realized how bad of a mental state I really am in.  Nothing really brings me joy now except for her and I can't see her 80% of the time.  It feels so hard just to keep myself breathing let alone go from a day to day basis.  I feel like if she is gone I will have no problem ending it cause the thought of death doesn't scare me.  The actual process and the pain i'll feel while dying actually scares me more.  I just wish I could find joy in something other then her.  I just feel so stressed about school, and concerning the future.  I want to work hard to secure but it just feels so pointless to actually try cause I feel like no matter what I do I'll just be a failure.
