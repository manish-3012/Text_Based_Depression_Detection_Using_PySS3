Anorexic and suicidalI have Anorexia but I am at a healthy weight and eating normally. I just hate the way I look and I want to die so bad. I think I am disgusting. When I was skinny I wasn't happy but at least my body looked good. I have never hated myself so much. Even just seeing girls who are skinnier than me in public makes me feel terrible.
