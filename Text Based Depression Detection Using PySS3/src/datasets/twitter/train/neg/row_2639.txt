Don't want to die, but I must suffer.I fucking hate myself. I'm an overly aggressive asshole who picks fights with people on the internet. I'm a pathetic POS who can't get over losing his mommy. What a complete 180 from a view years ago, such a fucking disappointment and embarrassment.

Like the title says. I don't want to die, but I sure as shit feel like I must suffer. Both mentally and physically. I deserve it for not saving my mom. If I only knew CPR she might not have died.

Edit: Hurting myself just always seems like the right thing to do.
