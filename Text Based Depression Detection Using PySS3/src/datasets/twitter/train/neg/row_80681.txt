Almost homeless, gambled all my money, no job, can't get GED. Why bother.Honestly. I Just gambled 800 dollars, I have no job, that money was to pay rent and get my GED with. I have no job and have been unemployed for sometime, can't get hired. I don't even know why I gambled it. I walked in with the intention of spending maybe 100 bucks max and I just kept putting money in. Spent maybe 4 hours spending that much.

I just need money
