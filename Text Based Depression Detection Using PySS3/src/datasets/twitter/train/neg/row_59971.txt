Benzo + Rooftop?I tried to commit suicide yesterday with 15 2MG pills of Klonopin and alcohol on an empty stomach but my tolerance for it was too high. I ended up just being a zombie, falling down and into things the whole day. Funny because some people noticed but they must have just thought I lost my balance. My new plan is to take the rest of my 30 day supply, chug rum and fall off my 3 story building. It won't be a painful death but at least it'll be a little number and get the job done. Background, I'm 21, would be turning 22 on June 16th. I recently got laid off, have no college degree (Dropped out because I couldn't handle being in a class with my rapist while the university did nothing), and no prospects. I was the breadwinner in my household to an extent though we aren't currently living in poverty. I don't know, I wrote my will up and made sure it would be executed. I guess I'm looking for a reason between today and tomorrow night to not jump off my rooftop.
