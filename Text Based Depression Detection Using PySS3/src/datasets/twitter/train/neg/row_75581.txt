FridayI have plans to end my life on Friday, itâ€™s been two years to the day since my last attempt and I still havenâ€™t felt better since. I donâ€™t see hope anymore. Iâ€™m hoping if Iâ€™m successful this time my family will be okay especially my little girl. It hurts me so much that I canâ€™t live with my own pain to be there for her
