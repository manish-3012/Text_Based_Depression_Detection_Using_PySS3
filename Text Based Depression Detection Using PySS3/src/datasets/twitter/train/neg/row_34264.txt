Scared I'm going to commit suicide? I don't want to but what if I didThis constantly goes through my mind. I'm scared I'm going to hang myself one day, I don't know why I always think about it. The last I can remember, it started popping up after my best friend commited suicide by hanging. I love life, and I never want it to end. I just need someone who I can relate to... Not many people lose a close friend to suicide.
