Not quite sure what else to do.I'm currently researching ways to commit suicide easily and painlessly. I don't really know what else to do and can't handle being on this planet anymore. The woman I felt like I was going to marry left me for someone who is religious like her, and the woman I dated after her left me because she said she just needed to grow alone. I have no friends left in the city that I live in, so no one to talk to or share my feelings with. I just sit and stare at the floor and want everything to end. The idea of continuing forward in this life knowing that pain easily lurks around the corner the moment something good happens to me is not worth living for. Life seems cruel.
