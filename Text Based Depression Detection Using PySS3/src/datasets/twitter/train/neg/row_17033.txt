arson suicideDisclaimer: i have no intention to harm myself or others


The house my father died in is full of skeletons. Maybe the house killed him, the stress and anxiety of facing homelessness was more than he could take. The debt was insurmountable. 

The disturbing instinct i have is to douse the unoccupied foreclosured home in gasoline and die on the spacious property with everything in it. There is nothing left to lose anymore. The bank  robbed my father of the home he worked so hard for. Why should these institutions be rewarded for their lethal greed, with anything more than ash and rubble?
