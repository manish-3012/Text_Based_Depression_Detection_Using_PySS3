Therapy just makes me feel stupidIn December of last year I think, I got a new GP since I needed someone to prescribe me my hormones. I wanted to discuss getting a new antidepressant as well, so she referred me to a psychiatrist.

I talked to the psychiatrist in January and, like an idiot, I mentioned my plan to kill myself the summer of that year, which resulted in me being handcuffed and dragged to Emergency Psychological Services, where I was repeatedly misgendered by staff when I wasn't being totally ignored, the only vegetarian options for dinner were bread and carrots, and I was just generally made to feel broken and subhuman. I was let out 24 hours later when I said I didn't plan to kill myself in the immediate future, which is something I had never planned to do in the first place. What I learned was that if I was honest about the severity of my suicidal thoughts, I would be punished.

After that, I went shopping for a therapist, but none of the ones who seemed like a good fit were covered by my insurance. So eventually the hospital set me up with a psychologist. Our first meeting, she asked me what aspects of my body made me dysphoric and then laughed at me when I included my feet on the list. That same meeting, after I expressed concerns that if I scheduled a vaginoplasty, my insurance would change before I reached the scheduled date and I would no longer have any hope of affording it, she told me it would be possible to get the surgery within a year, which was a bold-faced lie since even the required electrolysis in preparation takes at least a year, and she would know this since she also works at the gender health clinic.

Every subsequent meeting has involved her trying to get me to talk about my self-loathing and hopelessness and then telling me I'm being irrational the moment I even begin to articulate anything. This is apparently what cognitive behavioral therapy is. When I tell her this all makes me feel stupid, she retorts that that too is irrational since even though I've never had my IQ tested, it's probably fairly high according to her magical powers of psychometric clairvoyance. In other words, I'm stupid for feeling stupid.

&amp;#x200B;

And now my homework is to imagine a set of life circumstances which will make me happy and which I can realistically achieve, which I'm too stupid to do. I've ruined some of the most important friendships in my life along with the only romantic relationship I've ever had with my incessant self-loathing ramblings, and that whole episode of my life ended with me being told to get therapy, yet apparently, I'm too stupid for therapy to even work at all. The only solution I can see is to kill myself, but I can't tell any mental health professional how badly I want to or I'll be sent to Crazy People Jail again.

Why can't I just get the virus and die already?
