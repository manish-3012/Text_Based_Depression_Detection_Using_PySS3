Never before did I have such a temptation to just slice my wrist and be over with itMade a secondary account because I donâ€™t want people I know on here to be worried. I know thatâ€™d Iâ€™d never get myself far enough to actually do it, but the urge can be so overwhelming at times it scares me. Just need to vent I guess. 

I donâ€™t know what I should do anymore. Iâ€™m stuck here at home where I live with the biggest sources of negativity and sadness in my life, yet I cannot leave because Iâ€™m still too dependent.

It will be 3 years till I have a degree and can leave this place for good, I just hope Iâ€™ll live to see that happen. Iâ€™m done, my flame is slowly dying out and I canâ€™t bring up the energy to keep fighting for it.

Didnâ€™t check the rules of the sub, just searched for a sub concerning suicide and went for it.
If this is against the rules, mods please do delete this and Iâ€™m sorry for the inconvenience. I needed this out of my head.
