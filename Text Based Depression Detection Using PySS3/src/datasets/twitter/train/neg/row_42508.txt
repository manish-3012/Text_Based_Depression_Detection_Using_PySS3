I'm giving myself two more yearsI always think about it, just ending everything after college. I love life, as strange as that sounds. I think it's cool, ya know? it's just messy garbage and its fun to dive into it sometimes but I haven't ever been able to shake the feeling of just not wanting to be here. 

Ever since I was younger, it's always been like this. I just feel like dipping my toes into situations but never sticking around long enough. I've always thought about disappearing. The suicidal thoughts came when I was 15, back then it wasn't as bad (I mean I did attempt back when i was 16 but that's a different story). Ever since college started, every few weeks I just want to off myself. No matter what, I can be having a great time hanging out with friends(virtually) or hear some good news but all I want is to just not be on earth, i want to leave so fucking badly. I was so incredibly close to jumping in January of this year, then back in March, then May. Im back at home currently so I can't do much without my family barging in but once i get out and graduate I am so fucking tempted. I've always been tempted. 

On the outside, my life isn't that bad, just slightly mental old parents (but thats a given with age) and a physical disability. I have a warm home, amazing friends, decent roommates (back at college), attend a four year university with average af grades, and some accomplishments under my belt. I am incredibly grateful for what i have.

Every time I go to a therapist, no one's been able to really place it. I just fucking don't want to be here. 

Two more years and unless something crazy happens, I think I finally want to say goodbye
