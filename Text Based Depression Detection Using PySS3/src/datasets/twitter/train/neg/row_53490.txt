I feel like my days are numbered
 So I received a letter from my university saying that they're pulling me in for a "supportive" informal fitness to practice meeting on Friday because I (stupidly) posted on twitter about a negative bullying experience I had whilst I was on a placement .. it was all confidential ect. 

  The thing is... This university experience was the last chance I gave myself to live and now I've ruined it by talking about an experience. I'm going to be kicked out, I've written my end letter.. I don't know if I should even bother going to an exam tomorrow morning. Everything is ruined. My life is shit. 

  I can't believe I've lost my place. My parents are useless - father says he should've drowned me at birth like a puppy. My mother is an alcoholic - doesn't care.
