Have you made your paz with death?Death is now my best friend, what keeps me going everyday is to know i'm not gonna be here anymore one day, you know being depressed for so many years has made me realize that death is not to be feared but a escape from a twisted reality, and now i can do everything i feared because i don't even care if i die or live anymore, and everyday im thankful to be alive, have a good day reader i hope you doing fine, and remember you're not alone and i fucking love you bro, be safe ;)
