A short ventI cant I am high functioning and I am so tired I cant I cant I am trying. Things are going so well in my life why am I like this I don't see myself getting better. the one thing that makes me feel better at the moment is thinking about ending this I am trying to fight to get better I could hurt so many people so I try. but I don't know how long I have left.  I haven't told anyone I have gotten worse again I don't want to go back to the ward I just want out.
