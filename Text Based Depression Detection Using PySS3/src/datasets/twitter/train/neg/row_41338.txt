What a joke!They say "if you're feeling suicidal, call the help line." Yeah, every time I call it, the other person seems so uninterested on their end, based on their greeting alone. They don't care, they really don't. I just hang up. If I feel I'm wasting their time, why should I even talk to them? No one truly wants to help. Suicide is the better option.
