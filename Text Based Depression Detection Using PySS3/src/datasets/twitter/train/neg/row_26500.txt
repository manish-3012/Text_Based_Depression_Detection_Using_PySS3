I hate Valentineâ€™s DayBrowsing through my social media I see all these appreciation posts for peopleâ€™s significant others and it just reinforces how lonely I am. Iâ€™m frustrated. Itâ€™s difficult for me to even go to class anymore but I manage to go to my third class after skipping the first two and I see people with stuffed bears and Crush sodas, meanwhile Iâ€™m gonna go home, eat leftover spaghetti if I eat at all, and go to bed. I donâ€™t want it to be like this anymore.
