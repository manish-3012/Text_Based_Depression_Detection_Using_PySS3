I donâ€™t get itIâ€™ve had a long battle with depression. Most of my 28 years, unfortunately.

Never thought Iâ€™d post to this sub. Iâ€™m tall, muscular, and attractive,  I have friends who are good to me, I make an average amount of money. Even typing that makes me feel like a big piece of shit. I empathize with so many people here who donâ€™t like how they look or how they act in social situations, who are told all will be better if they improve certain aspects of their lives (WHICH CERTAINLY MAY BE TRUE).

Iâ€™ve done everything to try to fix who I am.

Iâ€™ve had every medical test you can imagine. Thereâ€™s nothing wrong with me. Iâ€™m in excellent physical health. Yet, I am tired every day. I canâ€™t function. I have no energy to do anything. I canâ€™t keep focused on routine tasks. Iâ€™ve gone years with no alcohol or drugs. I get adequate sleep. Itâ€™s all such a failure. 

I constantly have money problems, despite trying to be meticulous about where my money goes. I can get a good job, but I can never seem to be good at any job. And Iâ€™m so tired. Always. Iâ€™m so fascinated with people who do a good job, and are smart and energetic. I envy them so much. Many of my best friends are attorneys. I want their lives so badly. They complain about the stress, but have no idea how hard it is to struggle to get through the simplest tasks. 

I love my doggo, but thatâ€™s about it. If she werenâ€™t always there for me, then I donâ€™t know what. I just donâ€™t get it. Iâ€™ve seen countless mental health professionals. Nothing makes me feel normal. Everything is a struggle.

I just donâ€™t get it. Maybe this is a last-ditch attempt at help. I donâ€™t know. I guess Iâ€™m desperate.
