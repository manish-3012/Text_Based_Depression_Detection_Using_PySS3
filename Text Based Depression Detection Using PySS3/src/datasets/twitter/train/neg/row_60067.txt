Just tried for the first time to kill myself.Less than an hour ago, I tried to hang myself from the tree at the back of my house with my dog's leash and a belt. I didn't fall from a high enough height and I choked for some seconds, but I got off releasing the snap hook.

I've been kinda suicidal since I was no more than 10, but since mid of 2018 I started thinking of suicide as a deeper and complex concept. The main reason I always thought of was "I'm good at nothing and I'm extremely weak in Willpower Terms".

I wanted to join the Army as an Officer, but I don't saw it viable since my country is very shitty. 

I joined a Dubbing School but I don't want to go since it's very far and it would prevent me from going to school certain days (i'm in senior year) 

I'd like to study Mechanical Engineering, but I've already seen how is it like and I'm not mentally able enough for it.

I don't know what do I want to do with my fucking life, I don't want to keep studying, I don't want to work after school, I just don't wanna do nothing, but neither I want to be a useless POS.

I've been lurking subreddits and pages like this, and I found out that maybe this is my real destiny in life; ending it itself. So, thanks everyone for reading and for helping me with some suiciding advices.
