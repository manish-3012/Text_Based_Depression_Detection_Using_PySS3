I don't know what to do, homicidal rageI often have homicidal thoughts, but it's never been as bad as today. I've been a full on homicidal rage half of the day and still am. I've never been so close to actually taking a knife and going out to attack someone. And I still am close to doing it. I don't know what to do. How can I end all of this and satisfy myself? I have more than just homicidal thoughts, but that doesn't matter now. How can I stop it? How can I become happy and at peace? I don't want to go to a therapist, they will lock me up, test drugs on me, abuse me and if I ever say anything about it, they'll just declare me insane so they can keep me locked up for ever against my will. I just want to kill as many as possible until I'm killed.
