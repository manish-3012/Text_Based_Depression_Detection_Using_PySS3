Thank you, Reddit and /r/SuicideWatchAs of 28 of September, I attempted to commit suicide once again. This wasn't my first time - and I am not sure it will be the last. No, I am not hurt in any ways, unfortunately or not.

You must wondering if I think life is worth living. Not 100%. Not really, no. I still don't have someone who likes me, my past stills haunts me like a ghost, and etc etc. But at the end of the, what can I do about it? I fear death. Almost more than anything else in this world. I couldn't do it yesterday, I was trembling of fear after...

I honestly don't know what to think anymore. It is hard. I am still hurt, and I am still having some suicidal thoughts even after that. But I think I want to live. Can I hope that someone will like me? That I will have intimacy with someone? That everything will stop haunting me? At the moment, I am not so sure. Life might still suck ass.

At the same time, however, I want to say thanks to everyone who supported me here. Both on Reddit and this sub. You people are fantastic human beings. You deserve true recognition and every respect in this world. You give hope to a lot of people who have but no hope, like me. And while I don't know if things will get better (will they? Will life stop treating me like trash?), I am truly for the sincere support that this sub showed. You people are what's good in humanity.

As I said, I don't know if things will get better. But as of now... Thank you. :) *hugs for everyone* (I'll post some threads on the comments explaining my feelings, if anyone is curious about it.)
