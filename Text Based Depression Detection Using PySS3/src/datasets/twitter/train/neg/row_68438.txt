What the fck is wrong with me?!I have some important things I need to take care of (mostly school but also one or two personal things) but I never feel motivated to do ANYTHING.

So I do nothing until I have to face the consequences that make me feel so fcking dumb, useless, worthless, empty and suicidal.

And what should I do?

I already reached out and going to therapy.

Should I say to my teachers: "Oh I'm sorry that I didn't care for that even though we had this task for like almost a year now but I feel suicidal"?! Would that change anything? Probably not.

I don't achieve anything and the tiniest task produces an unbelievable amount of stress that makes me feel like I'm having a breakdown.

I just wanna kill myself sometimes but I just can't because one good friend of mine couldn't stand the pain. And also maybe I'm falling in love again with another person.

It's just so damn difficult and the weight on my shoulders is just too big. I just can't handle all the responsibilities, especially the stress, the feeling of being worthless, dumb, useless etc. and all the people ignoring me.

I just want to scream, cry, have someone close I can tell who actually loves me from the bottom of her heart and lay my head on her shoulder and run away from all this madness called my life. 

Why can't anything work out? I only once did something that you could call productive or impressive in my life. And that's it. And when I actually come out of my comfort zone and create anything NOBODY GIVES A SH1T. 

My mind is just in chaos and I'm breaking down...
