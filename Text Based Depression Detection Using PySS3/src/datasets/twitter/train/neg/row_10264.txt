I'm a disgraceI can't do anything right. I'm terribly incompetent and dumb. I'm a waste of space. I look in the mirror and feel pain over what I see. It physically fucking hurts to stare into the mirror. It reminds me of every reason why I hate myself. Ever single part of me is shit. Physically, I'm weak, ugly, and fat. Personality wise I'm a solid fucking brick out of 10. I can't see a single thing that's redeemable about me. If I die, the world isn't missing much. I'll be doing a favor by killing myself. I can't stop thinking about it. I can't shake the thought of dying. How could I? I feel like there's no point in me being alive anymore so why not end it soon.
