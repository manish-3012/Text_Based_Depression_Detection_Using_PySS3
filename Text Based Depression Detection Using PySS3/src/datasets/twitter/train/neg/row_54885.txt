My life has reached its end. These are my final thoughtsIâ€™ve suffered through a lifetime of physical, emotional, and sexual abuse from my family and my relationships, fighting and pushing at every turn, only to be rewarded with a debilitating disease that has ruined my life.

My illness has completely taken over. Iâ€™m bed bound most days, entirely house bound. I will not ever be able to have a career, see the places Iâ€™ve always wanted to see, do the things Iâ€™ve wanted to do. I will never fall in love.

Iâ€™ve had no way of making money for months. The US government still wonâ€™t approve me for disability. For a short while I stayed afloat selling my possessions, but that time has amounted to nothing. I am unable to work. The only thing worth anything that I have left to sell is my phone. I am completely out of money.

Even if I got approved for disability, why keep living? Checks from the government each month arenâ€™t going to magically cure my illness, which has no cure. Iâ€™m unable to *live*, so why stay alive?

I donâ€™t know what I did to deserve this. I donâ€™t understand. It isnâ€™t fair. Iâ€™m only 21. Why couldnâ€™t I ever catch a break? Why did I exist only to suffer?

My life has reached its end. There is no way out of this. Tomorrow Iâ€™m following through with my plan, and that will be the end of my suffering. Good riddance.
