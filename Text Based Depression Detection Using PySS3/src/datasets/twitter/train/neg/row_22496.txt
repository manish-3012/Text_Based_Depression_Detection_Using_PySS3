Everything is pain. So much pain.I thought I was having a good day, but all of a sudden the pain hit me so hard. I canâ€™t fathom trying to keep living through the pain but I have to. If I killed myself it would hurt other people and thatâ€™s the last thing I want. I donâ€™t want anyone to have to feel a fraction of the pain I feel, and me dying would cause some people pain. Help please I donâ€™t know what to do it hurts so much but I have to keep living. I canâ€™t die I canâ€™t it would hurt my family, it would hurt my few friends. I donâ€™t want to hurt people help. But Iâ€™m in so much pain it hurts to breathe. Iâ€™m gonna go drown my sadness in music now. Please donâ€™t bother wasting brain power thinking about this just forget you read it Iâ€™m not worth it.
