PTSD/Bipolar make me unlovable and thatâ€™s the only thing I wantSo even though I care about everyone around me more than me. And I literally go out of my way to try to make people happy I guess Iâ€™ve been doing the opposite. I donâ€™t understand. My bf says I make him miserable but when I go to try to end it he wonâ€™t let me. I donâ€™t understand it confused me cuz he obviously doesnâ€™t love me. Why does he keep me around. Why does he build me up to break me down again. I have always been in abusive relationships my whole life until I met him but then I somehow turned him against me too. 

I was going to hang myself with a belt in my bathroom but someone must have taken my belt cuz I canâ€™t find it in my room and Iâ€™m too much of a pussy to use a razor...trying to find anything to use as a rope. I really canâ€™t fucking do this anymore.
