I don't know why I bother anymorePoor. Can't pay the bills.  Lonely. Haven't had human contact in months.  Im a failed musician.  My talents are useless.  I'm old now, nobody wants anything to do with me.  I've lost my hair.  I took lots of drugs, can't see the beauty in the works anymore.  Cannot escape this nihilistic void.  I'm so fucked.  I'm tired of fighting this battle.  It's just not worth it at all.
