I wish I was abortedI feel so pathetic I have debilitating mental illnesses therefore I have a caregiver that is supposed to bring me food and household stuff. I am being neglected by my caregiver and adoptive family. Ever since my adoptive mom died I have been living on my own constantly being neglected. I met my boyfriend last year and ever since we have been together he has been there for me emotionally and he gets me food whenever he can. He's now in debt because of me. He doesn't blame me but I can feel the strain it's putting on our relationship. It's all my fault. My bio parents dying my adoptive mom dying me being mentally ill and disabled  I wish I was just aborted
