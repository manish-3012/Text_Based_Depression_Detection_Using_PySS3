Best way to kill yourself in the EU (Germany)Im pretty sure I'm going to kill myself. But I don't want to hang myself because I don't want my parents to find me like that. And jump in front of a train isn't an option either because I don't want the driver to get involved. So my best thought would be taking sleeping pills but how safe is that and can I just buy them?
