I just want another chanceI just want another chance to be 18 again and work hard and get jobs in an industry I care about. To not do to the bare minimum. To not be starting at square 1.

How could I have been so dumb?

There's no way out. I want to die. I want to either magically wake up as an 18 year old again (but wiser than I was), or fucking die.
