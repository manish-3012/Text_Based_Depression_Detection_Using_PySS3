misery overdoseI can't live like this. It is unreasonable for me to have to stay alive. I am in so much fucking pain, every waking hour. My mind has been destroying itself for decades now. I think this is it. I pretty much know it. This weekend will be my last. I feel guilt and shame, my friends and family don't deserve it, but I can't do this. I can't talk to people about this shit anymore. Sick of being a broken record of negativity and pain. I feel like I'm just dragging them down with me. Shrinks do nothing. Antidepressants make it worse. So there's no help for me. I am done with life and life is done with me.
