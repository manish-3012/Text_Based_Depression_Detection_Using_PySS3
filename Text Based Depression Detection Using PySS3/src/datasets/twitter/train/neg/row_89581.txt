It is taking all my will to keep myself from killing myselfI have been going through depression for over 3 years now and is started when I went to university to become a doctor. I spent months alone in my apartment, started skipping class, and eventually dropped out. The only thing that stopped me from ending my life at that time was watching YouTube videos of my favorite YouTuber. I decided that I will do everything in my will in order to be able to someday possibly work with him. My channel has gotten nowhere and I am starting to feel the desperation coming back. It makes my happy when I entertain people but I hardly have an audience to entertain. A few nights ago all I could picture was hanging myself over the staircase and just ending it there. I spent the entire night crying and shaking because I was so close to doing it. The one source of happiness that I know will bring me joy is impossible to get to and I don't know if I can do it anymore. I can't stand this pain.
