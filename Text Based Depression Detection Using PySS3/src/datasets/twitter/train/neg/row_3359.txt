Sooner than everI feel completely useless.
I'm taking Engineering courses, which I pass and I excel in certain fields and all that, but I can't find happiness, or even a job, with what I have.
I was dumped by the love of my life because she fell in love with some asshat from another state she only knew online.
The girl I've been talking to recently just found a new boyfriend and probably didn't consider me an option.
I've said I want to die at least 5 days straight to friends and family, but they attribute it to my classes being stressful (which they aren't) and I can't bring myself to tell them how I feel in clarification.

I don't want to die. I don't believe in an afterlife so I know that this is the only shot at living- in any form- that I can, but at the same time I don't want to continue this inner torment.
I have pills, but I'm afraid I'll throw them up. Knife, but that leaves blood everywhere for the person that finds me. Rope, but no beam strong enough to hang by. The only option I have is get hit by a car/bus but that will bring my life's trouble on the poor person who happens to be behind the wheel.

Every moment I walk in the streets I hope hope hope hope hope hooope that a car rides the sidewalk and slams my head into a wall. I'm miserable. I'm desperate. Worse still, I'm lonely.

Edit: You win for today. I got a bit drunk to pass thee night. 
Edit: 4/29: I live, and I'll keep posting as frequently as I can. I make no promise that I'm feeling better, but I am moving away from contemplating active methods of killing myself.
Edit: 5/2 I'm sorry for all this mess. I know a lot of you care just enough to tell someone "dont do it" and leave, and I don't blame you for it, but I still think I should at some point. l I'm pretty banged up on the inside and the fact that classes are over for me tomorrow doesn't help.
