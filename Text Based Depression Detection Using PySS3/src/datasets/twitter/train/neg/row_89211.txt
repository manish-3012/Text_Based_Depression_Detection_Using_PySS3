A nice letter for you all  

I donâ€™t know where to begin. Itâ€™s pretty funny to me I canâ€™ seem to find my one and single copy of my will. Oh well, one of them is out there. Hopefully itâ€™s seen. Whatever, hi, hello, itâ€™s me, A. Iâ€™m probably not doing so well right now, I donâ€™t know where I am. Letâ€™s say sleeping? Forever? I donâ€™t know what quite to say. Doesnâ€™t matter now, does it. Today is February 8th, 2020; 219 days since I knew without a doubt in my mind, I found my forever. It is 201 days since I have made her mine. For you, if youâ€™re reading this, thank you for everything. I am proud of you for listening to me and growing up; youâ€™re slowly learning that life is okay and not that scary. Considering my current state, that really seems like an oxymoron, I have failed yet youâ€™re (hopefully) still there. Mental health plagues me. The stress of a relationship, like for you is immense. I understand that you have the same issue but not really the same way; I AM NOT GOOD ENOUGH. Not just you but for anyone. My self esteem was fixed because of you, L; thank you. Ever since December 27th, 2019 though, I never recovered. Looking at myself, I am disgusted. I tried my best to be with you and I succeeded to what; I donâ€™t know. I wish I was able to talk to you about issues. I was afraid of driving you away; jealousy also makes me incredibly hurt. All this for something I didnâ€™t even need to put all that extra time and work for. Oh well, I canâ€™t hurt you or myself anymore. I AM NOT DUMB, I see everything. I wish you had respect, for me. All of you, what the fuck is wrong with you people, B grow a pair and do something, S grow a pair and accept life and stop being so spoiled. And to my father, leave the woman; it isnâ€™t worth your time, life or anything. I donâ€™t care about love, destroy it, she doesnâ€™t feel the same as you to her. L, I wish I knew if you felt the same as I feel for you. I just donâ€™t know unless weâ€™re alone; relationships wonâ€™t always be alone and I get scared. When I told you something, all of you, listen please holy shit. Why so toxic? When you are mad, the first person in your wrath is me; why? I try so hard and I canâ€™t. This is so bad, why canâ€™t I be happy consistently. What did I ever do? I donâ€™t know, I will never know, the darkness seems more comforting. Thanks for everything. I am so so sorry. I wish I was better, boyfriend, brother, son, student and, person in general. I canâ€™t be it all. I am sorry I canâ€™t fulfill. I have failed and this is the path that should pursue. I am sorry. So so so so sorry.
