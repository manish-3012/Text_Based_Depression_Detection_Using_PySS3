It comes backI would get the thought stuck in my head, telling myself I should do it over and over. I was so sad I was so lonely. I fought. I brought myself back. I remembered those times and thought â€œthat wonâ€™t happen againâ€ â€œIâ€™ll stop it before it gets to that point next timeâ€ â€œI can never go back to being so fucking sad like I wasâ€. 

It came back, it came back before I could even notice.
