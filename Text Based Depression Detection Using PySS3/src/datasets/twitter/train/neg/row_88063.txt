I am calling a friend tomorrow morning who has expressed suicidal thoughts and could use some advice.Hi friends. Posting this here before I go to bed so I can wake up and read before my call tomorrow morning. He's safe now I'm confident, but could use some advice.

My friend reached out to me today, asked casually how I have been, and I did the same. He expressed to me that he's depressed, and had been having suicidal thoughts again (first time he did was 3 years ago, I was also there with him). I've read a lot of tips on being non-judgemental and affirming their feelings, not offering absolute advice or solutions but actively listening. Is there any other tips you all have about this? 

Side note: I offered to call him tonight but he said to wait til tomorrow morning. I'm glad he's reached out to me now, shows he knows he wants to improve his situation.
