I decided a long time ago life isn't worth living.When I was in high school I realized I didn't think life was worth living. Logically speaking, we can enjoy the good times but we all suffer and go through pain too. I don't see the point. Why is that worth it?

Killing myself now might mean missing out on some things but I also will never have to suffer again. How could that not be the right choice?

The only reason I haven't done it yet is because I know the people I care about won't understand and I don't want to hurt them.
