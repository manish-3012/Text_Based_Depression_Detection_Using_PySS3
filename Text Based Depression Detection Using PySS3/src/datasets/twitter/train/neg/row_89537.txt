I don't know if I'm going to make it home...So I'm wrapping up a "deployment" from a not so hostile country. It's more of a rotation really. But anyway, I'm set to go home in about two weeks. But the thing is I don't know if I want to anymore. Around veterans days, a girl I've been absolutely crazy about messaged me and said "hey you, I love you." Now I haven't been the most blessed person when it comes to relationships. But this made me feel the happiest I've felt it forever. Long story short. She has been going thru alot of stuff. And it turns out she has been leading me on for attention. The worst part? I still love and care about her. But now I don't want to even go home on block leave in march. Honestly I wouldn't be mad if I just stopped existing...I'm a loser all things considered. I just can't out up with it anymore no matter what I do I'll never be happy...
