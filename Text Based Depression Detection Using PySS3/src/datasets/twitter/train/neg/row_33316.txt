I want to die I want to die I want to dieI need help and I have nobody. What the hell are people on the internet going to do? I have no willpower to power through the severe anxiety, depression, my ADHD, my childhood trauma, and my pure laziness. I can't start small. I just keep making mistakes and end up at square one. Its funny how every fucking time I just keep deluding myself into thinking I can do better. How naive can anyone be? Are people really going to tell me that it gets better when I have tried OVER AND OVER AGAIN FOR YEARS AND ABSOLUTELY NOTHING GOOD HAS COME OUT OF IT. 




Can someone please just tell me I'm better off killing myself?
