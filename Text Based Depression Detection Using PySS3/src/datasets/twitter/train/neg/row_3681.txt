Not strong enough.I always thought of committing suicide but I don't think it ever hit me as hard as today. I can't even feel sadness at this point, I am just really angry at everything. Nothing makes me happy anymore, it hasn't for years. I can't blame others for something I chose though so I am angry at myself as well. I can't even be honest because I see how they look at me afterwards. I try so hard to keep it to myself and hold it all in but I wonder much longer I can take...

In the end, I can only blame myself for my constant silly choices in life ever since I was a child so I have to live with their consequences. My problem is, that's all my life has ever been, living in the consequences of my bad/uninformed choices. Eh, I must be real crap for screwing up constantly my personal and professional life.

Or maybe it's karma for mistreating and scaring away those around me. But then again if I can't love myself how can I love others? I would just be lying to everyone, which is still what I do to avoid unecessary drama. People tell me I am cold and cruel but how can a person be so cold and yet feel so bad about themselves?

I have no problem admitting I messed up, it's just that even if I admit, there is no point to it, nothing will change. What's done is done. I can hardly even look at people in the eyes for as long as I remember. I have reached the point where it makes me sick, enraged and bitter to even wake up when I see some people don't even have that choice. Why not take me instead of them? Why am I the one who is very healthy? I'm doing nothing here.

I used let gaming fulfill me but even that has stopped working or is quickly fading away. I have no real aspirations or things I love. It all became daily sacrifices and struggles that I am able coup with for who knows how long.

Anyway, I don't want to ask for anyone's forgiveness, or go back and fix my decisions, I hardly ask for anything in life, I just want to gain the courage to finally kill myself to find some peace because I have no reason to go on in this psychological warfare.
