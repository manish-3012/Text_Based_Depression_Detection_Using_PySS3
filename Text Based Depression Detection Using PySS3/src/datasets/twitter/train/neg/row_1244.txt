I am not okI'm sitting at work and all I can think about is how im going to kill myself when I get home. For years I have been thinking of this, it was always a back up plan, but now it feels so real, I'm so tired all I want to do is sleep and never wake up. After years of people telling me it's not that bad, even though they've seen the cuts and the scars, doctors dismissing me because I haven't made an attempt on my life, bosses thinking the answer is more work because they royally don't understand, I'm done, I'm finally ready to just give up, I have tried to find reasons to live, but it all means nothing, I'm exhausted and no one cares, so goodbye
