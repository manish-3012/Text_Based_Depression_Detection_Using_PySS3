Point of no return?As months pass I become more acclimated to how I live.  I accept that it won't change more and more.  When I try to improve my life, I fall on my face.  The narrative that my depression tells me becomes more easy to believe, and harder to rebut.  I have started liking the way I feel when I'm depressed and hating the way I feel when I'm stable.  Stability feels dull, like I'm not living.  It feels like an unstable fantasy.  It never lasts, and it never will.  I'm liking the feeling of being depressed; I've become addicted to it.  I know it's unhealthy, but it's so addictive that I don't want to change.  I'm at the point that I actively cause things that worsen it.  All the advice that I get from my psychiatrist/psychologist is funneled into maintaining this intoxicatingly miserable state.  
  
Is this the point of no return?
