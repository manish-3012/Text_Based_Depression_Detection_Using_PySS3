UghhhUgh I feel so fucking awful. She was such a great person but now I feel like she fucking hates me. I don't know if she does but I feel like she really dislikes, I honestly didn't talk to her for a week. Ugh it hurts so much to think that I did something wrong to her. She was my only friend since my other 2 friends left for university. I'd honestly kill myself if I had something to do it with but for now I'm just going to suffer until I can actually do it.
