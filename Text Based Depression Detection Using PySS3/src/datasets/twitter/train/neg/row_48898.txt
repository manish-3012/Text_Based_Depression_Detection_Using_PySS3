I can't do it anymoreI live in a very dysfunctional household with alcoholic parents who verbally abuse me on a constant basis, sometimes getting physical with my father.

I don't know of any options I have left...
Because of my depression and overall shitty habits I've gotten 2 years behind in Highschool. I'm nearly 17 and still considered a freshman. So I'm convinced I have absolutely no future.

My friends have all abandoned me, despite me trying to desperately stay in contact, they just forget about me.

I've decided that I can't do it anymore. I have no one to go to, and I feel so alone...

The only thing holding me back is my huge fear of death. But at this point I can feel my fear of death fading by the day...
