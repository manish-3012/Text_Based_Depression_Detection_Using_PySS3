UnfairJust found out a friend died in a tragic car accident(drunk driver smashed into him). Great guy, always a smile on his face, nice to everybody, a wife and young kids. I feel horrible. Why him? Heres a guy that appreciated his life and should still be here, and I ungratefully wish for death every night, wake up feeling disappointed that im not dead, no kids that depend on me and Im still here. I dont get it. Its all wrong and makes no sense
