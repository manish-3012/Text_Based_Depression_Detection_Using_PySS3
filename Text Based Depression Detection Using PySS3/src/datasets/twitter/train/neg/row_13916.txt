I think about it everydayI feel so worthless like no-one actually cares about me. I have almost no friends and the friends I do have are always busy. I love my boyfriend but he's been making me feel like shit. I feel like he's the only person who will ever love me... other guys just wanna use me. I love him. Honestly I don't know why I'm still here, I am so unhappy and I'm excited to just have it all end. I want it to end. I don't have any will to live. I'm not excited about anything, I'm a teenager with schizophrenia and I can't talk to my psychiatrist because my mom just HAS to go in and she always bugs me about stuff. I hate her and my sister. I love my dad so much though. He isn't bothersome he's great. My mom always brings up stuff I don't wanna talk about even when I tell her I don't wanna talk. I wish I could just disappear!!! I don't make people happy!!!!
