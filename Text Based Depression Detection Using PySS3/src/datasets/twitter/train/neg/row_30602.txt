The countdown continues..I often wonder if I am the only one who spends years planning their perfect exit. It's been my reality in the same way a couple discusses their five-year-plan. Except that mine isn't five years, and it's not a dream that I share with another person; it's a plan that began in roughly 2010 with an implementation date of TBD 2024. While that may be oddly-specific to some, it makes perfect sense to me, as that is the year that my son will graduate high school. In my mind, I see myself watching his graduation and settling him in his dorms. While he won't know it then, that's when I will say my final goodbye and hug him one last time.

I am aware that I shouldn't be thinking these things, that I should be seeking help, whether in the form of a counselor, medication, or friendly ear. That third option humors me, as who really shares their heart's darkest torments with their friends? I have a background in research and am well versed in the stages of suicide, such as ideation, ideation with plan, ideation with plan/method. This is a blessing and a curse, as I can put a name to each term while I rationalize the continuing escalation of these thoughts. I feel both anticipation and anxiety when I think about how fast the time goes by, and how little I have left. It makes me both happy and sad. Does anyone else feel this way?

I have been going over the many methods available to me. While I would prefer something that would be relatively clean and induce minimal trauma, my research has given me other factors to consider, such as the very real possibility of failure and permanent (non-death) outcomes. I have concluded that the best way to be found, is to not be found at all. I love to paddleboard, and also love my 9mm. I think one day I will find an extremely remote place to take my board, and just not return.
