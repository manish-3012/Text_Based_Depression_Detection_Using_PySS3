I find it amusingThat people in my real life never know when Iâ€™m being self destructive, or Iâ€™m going through something, or any of that. 

But the people Iâ€™ve met online, my close friends.
Theyâ€™re always worried, and they just somehow know, even when I donâ€™t want them to worry, and I want to be left alone to implode on myself.

Itâ€™s just weird to me.
