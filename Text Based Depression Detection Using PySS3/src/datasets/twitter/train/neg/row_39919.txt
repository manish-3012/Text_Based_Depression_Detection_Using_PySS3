Games are the only thing that keep my goingSo, as title says, Im pretty depressed, just spent the last 3 hours on a suicide hotline and made her cry... I don't know what to do really, I've been supporting suicidals for 5 year approx not to take their life but now Im in their seat, all that keeps me going are games and the fact that it would probably end my mom and dads life aswell wich I cannot accept as a burden.
