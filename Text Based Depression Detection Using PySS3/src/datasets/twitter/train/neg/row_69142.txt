Court date upcoming 09/17/2019First offense, I started taking clonazepam and had no friends. I ubered out to a fucking bowling alley. I started arguing with the guys next to me, no cursing no violence. Next thing I know Iâ€™m asked to leave. I drank early in the night and I was bought drinks later. Iâ€™m facing a year probation and 25 hours CS. Date is Monday. I just started my new job last Tuesday. If I lose it...idk. There are a few extenuating circumstances, but I donâ€™t know the legal process.
