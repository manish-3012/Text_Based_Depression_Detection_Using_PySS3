Second postI wish I had the balls to just go jump in front of a car. I can't do it anymore. Nobody cares how I feel they'd rather see me have good grades then good mental health. I don't see a point anymore. I'm so tempted to go jump off a bridge and end it. My grades are going to shit and so is my mental state, she wants me to care about my grades more I'd rather die. I might go try to jump later or I'll sneak out tonight and do it. Maybe I'll leave a note about how much of a narcissist my mother is and how abusive it is to be in the family while being locked up with them for 9 months on top of worrying about school and myself. Maybe. Possibly. I hope I do
