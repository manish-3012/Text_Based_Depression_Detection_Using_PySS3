a former workmate i haven't spoken to in 3 years has messaged me at 3 in the morning saying she tried to kill herselffair warning: i'm not the best emotional support person most of the time; i'm not really sure how to handle this in general, especially when i was just being an insomniac on facebook

what am i meant to do? i barely know this girl. literally, we talked a couple at times at work before she quit four months in.
