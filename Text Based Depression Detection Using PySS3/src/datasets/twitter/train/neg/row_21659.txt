What's your purpose for living?I was always a depressed person but after my mom's death i began to think commiting suicide every single day and i feel in vain. The problem is i live with my father. I feel like in prison, i dont have desires, hobbies or motivation for anything but i cannot disappoint him. What is your purpose for living? Your answers may help me. I feel hopeless and i am exhausted of feeling unhappy.
