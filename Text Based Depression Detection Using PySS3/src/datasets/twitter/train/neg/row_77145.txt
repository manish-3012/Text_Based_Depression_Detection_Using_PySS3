Feeling empty and aloneHello,

A friend told me to post here about how I feel. I've been in a bad place for a while now, but lately I thought I could feel happy again.

This week, a friend of mine, who I really like, told me she was going on a date. That made me feel really bad, and then I started feeling bad about feeling bad because she's my best friend and I should be happy for her (and she already told me she doesn't like me that way ages ago which makes it extra stupid).

Right now I just feel like I have nothing to live for or to look forward too. It's not just the woman above - I feel like noone will ever like me because I know how horrible I am, and that I'll never be successful at anything because I'm too lazy and bad at things, and I feel bad for feeling bad. When I'm not keeping myself busy I'm either crying or sitting there doing nothing, and even when I do I need to constantly fight to keep the bad feelings out. It's come to a point where I feel like the only reason to keep on going is because I'd hurt other people too much if I didn't.
