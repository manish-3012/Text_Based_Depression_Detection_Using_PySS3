I donâ€™t have the balls to kill myself.I wish I could but I canâ€™t. Iâ€™m a bitch. I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m here. I wish I hadnâ€™t been born. I wake up screaming at night because I realize Iâ€™m going to die one day. Itâ€™s so cruel. We live in such a cruel world. Eh am I here. I donâ€™t want to be here. I wanna kill myself so bad but I donâ€™t have the guts. Iâ€™m weak and canâ€™t do it. Iâ€™m beyond stuck between a rock and a hard place. I just wish I didnâ€™t exist. This fucking life is killing me.
