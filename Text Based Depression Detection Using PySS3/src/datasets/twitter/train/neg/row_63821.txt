How do you guys do itA month ago I had a really well paying job for a student, a friend group who I actually liked, a girlfriend, a nice place to live and I was still severely depressed. Now I have none of that, I'm trying my best; following all the cliches like going to the gym and working on myself but every day gets harder.
