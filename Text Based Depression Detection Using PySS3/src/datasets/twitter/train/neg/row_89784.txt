Escape. Worried about myself (X Post from r/Depression, they just don't answer it seems)I'm worried, because the only things that make me get out of bed in the morning are my love, my friends, and altered (read: more pleasant) states of consciousness.

I just keep running and running away from my boredom, my omnipresent existential anxiety. I never get away, and it's never far enough, for a long enough time. Things will be better when I'm living with my girlfriend, but the feeling won't last. I just wish I could hang out with my friends and my love forever, but I know I'll never have that. The fundamental reality is that I'll NEVER be satisfied. Happiness will forever be a carrot on a stick I'll willingly chase till meaningless death.

Some days, even otherwise good days, I end up feeling like this. Bored. Depressed. Borderline suicidal. A perfectly normal day, and I'll end up wanting to shoot heroin. I don't do H, and I've decided long ago that above all, I'm a responsible drug user. I haven't faltered, I've never let cannabis, alcohol, or tobacco interrupt my life. But I can't help shake the feeling that it would be the most perfect way to end everything. No more boredom. No more worrying. At long last, a peaceful nothing.

DISCLAIMER: I will never, ever do heroin. Not once, not ever.
