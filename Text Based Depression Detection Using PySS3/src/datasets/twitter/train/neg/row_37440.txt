I'm not afraid to die anymore.I dont think I'm afraid to die anymore. The reasons I had to stay alive just dont seem worth it anymore.

What will my family do? Doesn't matter. I wont be alive to see their reaction.
What about all the opportunities I've been given by going to Uni? Doesn't matter. It's not worth fighting for anymore.
What about all the good things in the world? Doesn't matter. The worlds going to shit and no one cares. Might as well cut the crap now and end it.
What about my girlfriend? Doesn't matter. She doesn't deserve a piece of crap like me anyway, it'll be a weight off her shoulders.

Call me selfish, but I'm tired. I'm just so tired. I thought this gap year would help me get my shit together before I go to Uni but here I am, being as pointless as ever. 

I thought I was gonna die at 16, I was ready to die at 16 but I was too scared to. Now here I am at 19 and a whole adulthood ahead of me and I dont know what to do with myself. Accomodation for uni will be too expensive, I'll be on my own and even after I finish the degree I'll be 23 and in debt. A shit tonne of debt. And for what? 

There's so much more to it than that. But I cba to type anymore. So yeah. Not afraid to die anymore. I'd rather walk away from the pile of shit that is my life than confront it. Sorry.
