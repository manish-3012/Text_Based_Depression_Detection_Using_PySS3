Help. Anything. Please.I'm out of cards. I am almost 30. I've taken the meds. I've done the whole thing. And the best I could do is flat line.  It's impossible for me to describe how I feel. I've given up on trying. It's got deep roots. That's all I know. I have a partner and a daughter. I have reasons. To stay. So why is it that this feeling persists. On top of it now, guilt. Tremendous amounts of guilt. In any direction, I see nothing. I had a panic attack last night and I can only maybe describe it as rolling sadness. I don't know what I'm doing even writing here. I can't go on. It's too heavy. Do I write a letter? Who gets to look my daughter in the face and say that mommy is dead. That's not a job I wish upon someone. And it used to be enough to keep me grounded. I'm losing my footing. I'm so tired.
