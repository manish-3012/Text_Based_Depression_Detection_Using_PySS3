Iâ€™m giving upIâ€™ve tried in life. Iâ€™ve tried to talk to people about how Iâ€™m feeling but they donâ€™t believe me or simply donâ€™t want to listen. 

I donâ€™t have a reason to live. Iâ€™m not listened to. Iâ€™m unimportant and insignificant. Whatâ€™s the point to my existence? I wouldnâ€™t be missed.
