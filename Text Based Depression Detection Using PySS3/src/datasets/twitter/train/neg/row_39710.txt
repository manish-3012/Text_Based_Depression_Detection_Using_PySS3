suicidal ideation, fear, and a near death experience.I don't tell anyone about my suicidal ideation, I just want a gun. But I'm so scared. Scared of failing and scarring and brain damaging myself. Scared of what happens after death, if anything. Scared of the void. But I hope I can get over the fear I know with time I will, but I'm afraid. I don't really fear death itself, I don't have anything in my life I fear to lose. I was turning a corner and my car started to lose traction and I almost slid in front of a semi going 100km/h at that moment I was perfectly okay with it, I was happy, it was finally over. But I made the turn. I fear waking up in the ER with half a frontal lobe after trying to kill myself. But I don't know if I can take 50 more years of this shit, every day it gets harder to get out of bed. All I have are regrets and resentment, and with the proper method, my chances of waking up are pretty slim, probably slim enough to risk it. Thinking about doing it makes me feel this profound sense of justice, like I'm getting what I deserve; a bloody, and violent albeit quick death. That will probably be what pushes me over the edge in the end but man is looking your own death in the face a scary prospect, but I suppose I'll just have to face that fear and overcome it if I ever want to know peace.
