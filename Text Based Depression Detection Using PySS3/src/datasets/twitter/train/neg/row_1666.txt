Tonight I burned my letters and Im putting everything behind me.Let me start off by saying, this is a long ass story how I got here and I donâ€™t care that much to say, especially since Im leaving that shit behind me. I told my girlfriend I was having bad thoughts about a month ago. We had just broken up but we really depend and need each other. It looks bad but the thoughts werenâ€™t because of our break up, the break up didnâ€™t help but it wasnâ€™t about that. Well she kinda told me she would never forgive me if I did and I broke down crying(I never cry). She said it taking all of the pain you feel and giving it to everyone else thats ever cared about you. That last part wouldnâ€™t bother me except that sheâ€™s the only exception I could never do that to her. Anyways, down the line I went on vacation for two weeks and we got into a couple phone call arguments eventually cutting all contact. I had told her that one night that Im going on vacation for two weeks and if something doesnâ€™t change then Im making a decision.(Again not her its not the breakup). Well on vacation I decided I was going to do it. Nothing was changing and I was incapable of changing my situation. I was angry at God wondering why, begging for just a little peace or mind. Yesterday I came home from vacation. Last night I came to a huge realization that I know was planted in my brain by God. I woke up today a new person. Im strong enough to do this shit on my own. Iâ€™m ready to be a man now. I burned my letters. Called my girl because were on speaking terms again and I told her I burned them and that I feel like a brand new person and I feel like Im gonna be okay. She fucking lost it, she was so angry.  Iâ€™ve never seen her so angry. She didnâ€™t know about the notes. See I write her letters and eventually Ill hand them to her one day I have an entire stack. Well I forget some of the things I tell her in person and some of the things I write to her. She was not happy about it. I guess I was very insensitive though. Just expecting her to be like â€œThats great Im proud of you!â€ I hope sheâ€™s okay. I really do. Im tired of worrying her. I made it clear she doesnâ€™t have to worry anymore. I hope we fix things I love that girl more than anything. Im so thankful I woke up better today. Thereâ€™s a lot still going on and a lot still thats going to happen thats gonna make it hard, but I finally feel like Im strong enough to handle it. A couple weeks ago I had almost lost faith entirely. In God, in myself, in humanity. Now I know that there is just know way I can feel the way I do right now without God allowing me to feel this way. I donâ€™t understand it, I thought God wanted me unhappy, I thought I was being punished. I didnâ€™t know what to think and still donâ€™t but Im done trying to understand it and Im putting this all behind me and moving on. Everything happens for a reason and I think this is all to make me into the man Im supposed to be. Im glad I can finally look back and say that.
