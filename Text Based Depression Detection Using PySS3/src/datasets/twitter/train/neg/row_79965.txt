So fun to write cover letters when you hate yourselfIt just feels supremely dishonest to highlight even the talents that I do have.  Like, am I sure I didn't just *dream* having marketable skills and a good work ethic?  There's a special cognitive dissonance when you're trying to wring out self-praise on the same day you decided it would be too much effort to brush your teeth.
 
It's exhausting to pretend I think I deserve a specific job when I'm not *totally* convinced I deserve to live.  And from this side of the veil I don't know that I can trust my judgement on what kind of work I would love or hate if/when my mental health improves.

And forget about salary negotiations.

Sure would be nice to have a robust free healthcare system in the US right about now.
