i'm losing all hope. it's not getting better. quarantine has ruined my life.i didn't have friends to begin with but this period of quarantine is making it worse. at the beginning, i was dating someone who didn't give a fuck about me. and only talked to me when he was horny or no one else was around. i had "friends" but i only mattered to them when they needed something. i cut everyone off. making online friends has been a dead end. people want to pity and infantilize me and it makes me feel worse. i can manage myself just fine. i'm just fucking lonely and i'm tired of doing the same things over and over. i don't have the energy to care about politics rn because i'm too privileged for people in power to even pretend to care about my issues. i feel guilty for even complaining because others have it much worse than i do, so what right do i have to feel as hopeless as i do? i even feel bad for saying i'm tired of hearing about politics constantly. i feel bad for admitting i don't have the energy for it. i'm fucking drained. 

i'm so tired of it. i keep forcing myself to be productive just so that i don't feel entirely worthless. i sit in my room reading, drawing, studying, writing for hours on end; but when that's all over, what meaning does it hold in the end? i'm losing my grip on things that i shouldn't be. nothing is giving me hope anymore. this situation will only get worse. i keep fighting with myself to stay productive but it means nothing. i'm sick of the same thing day in and day out. this is giving me too much time alone with my mind and now, i'm in the worst mental space i've been in for a long time. i never thought i'd be this close to rock bottom again.
