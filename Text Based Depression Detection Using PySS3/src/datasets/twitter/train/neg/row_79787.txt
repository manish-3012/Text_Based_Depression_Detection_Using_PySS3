I think I'm doneI really tried but a rather small incident today made me realise I'm nothing but a low key con artist convincing people and myself at times that I'm better than I am, smarter, nicer and worthy of anything at all. I'm not though. And this isn't some angsty teen stuff, I think I've known for at least 10 years now but was always to cowardly to face it. I don't even deserve to get better. I don't deserve my family's time and money. I don't deserve anything that's given to me because I am fundamentally wrong and bad. I'm arrogant, I talk down to people, I'm selfish, I'm a brat. Even if they don't realise it now but I know they're better off without a burden like me. I'm scared as hell though. But I don't see any way back from here. Thanks Reddit, it's been a blast. You made me smile when I shouldn't have and made me feel less alone.
