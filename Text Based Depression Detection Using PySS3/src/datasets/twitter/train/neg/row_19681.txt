Just feeling dull often. Life is pretty darn good, but I can't seem to feel or appreciate it.Took leave from medical school earlier this year. My best friend in med school had taken her own life recently, which funnily enough didn't seem to affect me as much as I think it should have. Life just feels dull. I don't get excited by much at all. I feel lonely, I like girls but I can't seem to have the motivation to really pursue relationships -- or even friends. Apathy seems a recurring theme these days in my life. I mean life is awesome, objectively. My family is very supportive, my brother just started practicing as a surgeon, we are not super rich but live comfortably.

I am beginning to think its just my temperament. It's naturally despondent. I remember as a kid I use to be like this as well. I feel like i'm in a ditch and i'm having trouble getting out of it. Some days it feels like I have the energy to climb out of it. But it's like a ditch with a slope that never ends. You can fight and climb but on the days you don't have energy anymore you'll inevitably slide back down.

I know suicide is a common thought and it doesn't necessarily transpire to action. For me this holds particularly true. I think about it often and I convince myself that it's just a bad coping strategy. Is there anyone who have felt like this before and have successfully changed your thinking/baseline feeling. I don't want to feel like this. I want to feel -- you know, excitement, passion, emotions. I'm too analytical and pessimistic. Sigh.
