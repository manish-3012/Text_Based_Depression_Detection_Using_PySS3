Do normal people think about suicide daily?For as long as I remember I have had the daily thought "just kill yourself" but I ALWAYS have 100's of reasons not to. The simplest part of my daily life is dismissing these thoughts.  I really don't consider my self at risk or suicidal. I was just wondering if this was a "normal" thing. I'm getting really annoyed and aggravated that I keep having these thoughts. Has anyone been in a similar situation?
