I don't want to die, but because of a chronic illness I suffer a lot and worry suicide is going to be my only option.I have a non fatal lifelong neuromuscular illness.  As such I am somewhat disabled.  My symptoms fluctuate but every day I at least have some degree of muscle weakness.  I'm 30 and have been symptomatic since I was 12 or so.  When I have a particularly bad stretch like I have in the last few months, I feel a fluctuating but ever present level of crappy all day every day.  On bad days I feel really awful and even simple tasks are difficult.  Even sleeping is hard so even that doesn't give me an escape.  I do have a therapist who is wonderful.

I don't have clinical depression.  The sad thing is that when I am physically well I am a joyful person.  I am married to a beautiful and supportive man I want to spend decades with.  I work from home a little bit as an artist when I'm well enough, and absolutely love my work.  I find simple beauty in so many places, in so many people.  I truly do my best to access as much of life as I can despite my illness.  But I feel shitty so often.  I can't imagine suffering like this for 40-50 more years.  Sometimes I feel like even though I don't want to kill myself, suicide is going to be my only option because there's a limit to how much of this I can take.  I have been thinking about suicide more often lately because it almost relieves a little bit of psychic tension to remember that there is a possible escape from this.  Sometimes I take an Ativan just for some relief from the mental angst that comes with all of it, or to sleep peacefully for a little while.

I'm scared and mentally fatigued and I wish I could just get a break from my body.  Is it even irrational to kill yourself if you are suffering physically and it's out of your control?  It's tragic because death isn't what you wanted, but is there another choice?
