I have nothing leftThis is my third time posting to this sub, Iâ€™m still here. Iâ€™ve gotten through days I didnâ€™t think I would and Iâ€™m still alive but I have nothing left, no motivation, no job, no money, no life to look forward to. My dreams are out of reach, my hope is gone, I just want to overdose and be done. I want to write a note but Iâ€™m too scared. Too scared to die painfully, I donâ€™t want it to be painful. I donâ€™t want the 9-5 then die, I donâ€™t want another job I hate, I donâ€™t want to keep fighting with my family. I want out, I want out so badly. My self harm is spiraling out of control, I want out.
