I've given upI've battled suicidal thoughts for 4 years now, but nothing I do gets rid of them. No matter what I do my life gets worse. Today I overhears the only person who I thought cared about me talking shit about me. Since then I've been a complete mess and I don't think I'm ever getting better. I have to make it through 5 more months of my job and I can't do it. I'm so fucking tired of waking up every day. I'm so fucking tired of nobody caring about me. I'm tired of being alive. I just want to stop existing.
