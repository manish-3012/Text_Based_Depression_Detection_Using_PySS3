It's my birthday todayIn all the days of the year, April 13th will always be the one I most dread.

17 years from today, I was born. 2 years after that, my Mom died of stage 3B breast cancer.

And now, 15 years later. I've grown to be a person distraught and stricken by grief. Got neglected by the family I had left behind, grew up knowing that I'll never have anyone that cares about me. And in most cases, that conclusion turned out to be true.

But still, I pushed myself to keep going. Washed down all the pain with self-medication, but hell even booze, pills and nicotine can't fix me. They just created this fabricated euphoria of not hurting, only for everything to come crashing down on me once again.

And now I'm here, judging whether or not I should continue pushing for my dream of being an Oncologist, weighing if that purpose of saving kids like me the burden of living without a mother would be worth it after I'd be reminded every single day of the agonizing fact that I'll never get my Mom back. No matter what I accomplish, no matter how good of a doctor I become. Nothing will ever bring her back.

That dream has been my purpose for the longest time, and now it's nothing but a false sense of heroism rooted in the selflessness I inherited from her.

Mom. You're everything I ever wanted, everything I ever needed in this life. I miss you so much.

This life just ain't worth living without you in it.

I love you, see you soonest.
