Suicide is my destinyI come from suicide. On one side of the family, nearly everyone killed themselves. My brother has tried. My mom tries every few years. I always thought I was the strong one, though deep down inside I knew I wanted to die too since I was a kid. I need to not exist. 

I only interact with people I pay. I donâ€™t have much money, it will all be gone soon. Then what? Is that when I finally do it? Why do I have to wait until then? 

I used to have friends when I pretended to be ok. Now that Iâ€™m me, everyone is running as fast as they can. Including my family. Including my psychiatrist. I think even my therapists want to get away from this black hole. All I can do to make up for my existence is to try to pay the people who listen to me exist. I pay them a lot.  I donâ€™t think itâ€™s enough bc Iâ€™m so awful.  

I want to keep existing, but somewhere Iâ€™m allowed to be and where I donâ€™t have to pay or hide or whatever.  Maybe away from humans? They always make me feel bad for existing.  Animals donâ€™t as much.  Anyway yeah, Iâ€™m sick of paying for my existence.  Iâ€™d rather save money for my family and die.
