Fuck thisBest friend is ignoring me, no friends anymore. Have fought depression for 7 years now. Can't get a job because everything is too exhausting. I don't see the point of living like that. Even tho my parents tell me its selfish to end my life I don't agree, its selfish to let me live like that when I should already have ended it long time ago.
