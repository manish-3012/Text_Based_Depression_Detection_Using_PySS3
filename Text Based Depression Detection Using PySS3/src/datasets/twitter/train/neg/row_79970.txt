I hate myself and I literally want to dieNo, I don't have a plan. But you know what? Maybe Covid will kill me. Because no one wants to be around me. No one wants to see me. I have no real friends to turn to and I'm completely alone. I'm tired of living this way. I'm tired of talking and going to therapy. I'm tired of reaching out to the suicide hotline or the crisis text hotline, only to be fed some generic responses that don't help me at all. I don't want to cry everyday and suffer anymore. If only a miracle can kill me now.
