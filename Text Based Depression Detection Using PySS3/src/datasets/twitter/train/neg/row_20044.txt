Im just done.This is panic attack 3 of the day. I cant get over it anymore. Between losing the love of my life to this disease, being too afraid to go outside, and driving myself into financial ruin, ive just run out of reasons to try. My business failed, im 20 grand in debt, unemployed, uneducated, mentally ill, and there just isn't a light at the end of this tunnel. Theres nothing i can do to fix this anymore. Ive tried so many things, and they each leave me feeling worse for failing. Tomorrow morning i make the last trip out to the woods. Ellie, if you ever find this, Im so sorry. It was never you fault. Thank you for trying for so long to help. Im sorry I was so broken. Have fun in scotland. I'll miss you most.
