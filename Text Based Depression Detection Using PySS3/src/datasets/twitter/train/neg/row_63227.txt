Things feel pointless and I just want to dieI'm constantly numb and can't stop thinking about killing myself. I'm unemployed and can't access meds or therapy. Neither can I just get a job (due to some paperwork issues, I'm waiting on a green card renewal) or ask friends and family (we're dirt poor).

I can't stop thinking about suicide. I've talked to hotlines and they haven't help at all. People keep saying it gets better, but it really feels like it won't. It just hurts to be alive and I'm doomed to a life of underemployment and discrimination. Maybe dying is for the best.
