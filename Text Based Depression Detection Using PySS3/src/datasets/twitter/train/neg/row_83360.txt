Please HelpIt hurts so much. It's hurt since my parents split 10 years ago. Since I found my dad on the floor in his own vomit and I had to clean him up before mom got home so they wouldn't fight again about the alcohol. It hurts when I feel everybody and what they're thinking and their pain. I feel everyone's pain and I want to help but it's too much and no one seems to want it anyway. I'm sick of the apathy our culture breeds. I'm sick of the people coming in to the gas station I work in and pissing in the trash can without a second thought. 

They say they understand but they dont. So many different doctors and medications. They just ship me off to the mental institution without a thought, where I'm treated like an animal.  They treat us all like animals.

170 IQ they say. What the hell does that mean? I'm deemed mentally unsound anyway. I'm a defective cog. It's only a curse. I dumb myself down by drinking and neglecting my diabetes but it's not enough. It still doesn't numb the empathy. 

Please help. I don't have any transportation, all I have is this computer. I don't know why I should go on living anymore other than the fact that I don't want to hurt my family. The thought of my family's greif after my death is the only thing I'm hanging on to and I'm not sure if that's enough anymore. I'm scared.
