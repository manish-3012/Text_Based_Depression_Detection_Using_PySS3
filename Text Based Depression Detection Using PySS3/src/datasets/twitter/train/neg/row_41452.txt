Failed out of universityThe other day--and it's not the first time something like this happens--my parents said they met some neighbour whose daughter (same age) had finished her studies, why not me?

Indeed, I should have graduated last year.  Instead, I have failed and destroyed all my chances.  Because this would be a very hard blow, I can't tell my parents.

Also, I started getting crushing anxiety when I leave the house, what if I run into an acquaintance or old classmate?  I was a fine student and person then, now I'm a failure of a human.

So last month I bought a method, have been practising and preparing to do it this Friday.

But this will completely devastate my family! So I've been trying to tactfully convince my parents that my death might be a good thing, but was entirely unsuccessful.

To think that last summer they suggested changing university... well, you only get one chance in life and I ruined mine.
