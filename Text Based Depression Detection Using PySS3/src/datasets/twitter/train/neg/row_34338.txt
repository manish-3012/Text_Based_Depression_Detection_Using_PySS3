i cant handle itim so sick of living this boring life. i contemplate suicide almost all day long and i cant shake it. i sit at home and do nothing. im done with school and chose not to go to college as i only saw it as a way of being more depressed than i already am. i stay with my parents and cant find a real job as im too socially inept and anxious to go outside, even to go to a store or something. i cant be fucked to learn how to talk to people anymore as all my attempts made me feel worse than i already did. im completely trapped. its so tiring to sit at home and play video games all day. i use digital art as an escape but even then its getting to the point where i cant look at my art like its worthy and therefore dont sell it. i have nothing to do with my day. everyone i knew thought it was the dream to do nothing all day. its the opposite. its an everlasting nightmare that i cant get out of. thereâ€™s literally only one option in my book and its suicide or a mental hospital. either way im fucked. 
if i fail my attempt my only resort is to go to a hospital. i just dont know what to do. itâ€™s like thereâ€™s no hope for me, ive buried myself so deep in this hole that i cant get out anymore. no friends, no family and no therapist out there has ever helped me. crisis lines dont work even in the moment. im open for help but everywhere i go is a dead end. nothing helps even when i accept it. feels like some people arent just meant to be happy
