Worried about my girlfriendMy girlfriend and I are long distance. Weâ€™re a young couple, her family doesnâ€™t know about me, her friends donâ€™t know she has depression. I feel so helpless. I donâ€™t know where to turn. Sheâ€™s so adamant she wants to die and doesnâ€™t want help. She gets angry when I talk about therapy and seeking help. 
I truly do not know where to turn.
If you can help or advise me in any way, please.
