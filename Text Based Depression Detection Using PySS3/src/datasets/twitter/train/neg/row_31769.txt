The issue is that I hate myself. There is no "help" for that.You don't like onions? I won't put any in your meal. That's the least I can do to help.

You cut your self? I can get a bandaid/plaster to help.

You need to talk, a lift, to walk, a friend.. I can help.

I hate myself. I fucking loathe me. There is no help for that. I don't message a friend saying "I fucking hate myself, how are you doing?" That would be cruel. At the psych she asked "you don't like you?" No, I fucking *hate* me. 

There is no med for that. No book to read. It's such a helpless, hopeless position.

I'm not 18 and upset about school. I'm over 40 and hate who I am. I'm my own enemy.
