HelpI feel so guilty when people try to help me, because the only people that do are already going through things and I can't help them. I'm tired of being here. I'm tired of being such a disappointment. I don't think things can get better for me without it hurting somebody else anymore. It's better for me to just struggle with this until it finally gets to me and I commit suicide.
