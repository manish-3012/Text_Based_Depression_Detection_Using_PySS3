im fuckedim about to fail the 9th grade because im a glue eater

im a fucking idiot who doesnt put effort into their work and cant push myself to do it

by the end of this school year i will take my dads car and drive away if i fail

no point in going onwards if you get held back

my dad died last year and the only thing i have going for me is my mom who is great and the only reason im still here

i have great friends but i dont want to pester them and "talk about it" to them im the nicest person

i have no drive or intent or passion for anything

maybe ill drive my moped into a car at high speeds

ive been diagnosed with depression 4 times by my middle and high school but i get no support

only thing holding me back (again) is my mother

seeing all your friends with romantic lives kills me

sorry to vent and if you read this im sorry to pester you

end of vent
