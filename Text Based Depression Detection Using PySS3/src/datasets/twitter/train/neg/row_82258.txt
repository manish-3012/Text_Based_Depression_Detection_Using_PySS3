Why do I always end up having suicidal thoughts even though they're not rational?I've been having suicidal thoughts since I can remember, and any time the things go wrong I end up going down and thinking about giving up. I'm trans but my transition is going wrong, I'm young but I have bad health, I am studying a career, but I do not like it and I am not sure that it will help me to find a job in the future. I've been going to therapy since I was four years old, but I never talk about it openly. My family and friends have always told me that my suicidal thoughts are laziness and I have them because I don't want to work to solve my problems, and the best thing that I can do is that I repress them so as not to harm the people who loves me.

I've spent the night crying, my parents also cry when I cry and then I cry more. Now I'm too tired to think about ugly stuff,   I just want to think about kissing my boyfriend and my new cute socks. But I know that when I have strength again I will see again the problems and realize that my life is shaped like a dead end. And then plan how to get a weapon to do a shooting and then shot myself, thing I will never do because I am unable to get a weapon. I fucking hate the world so munch.
