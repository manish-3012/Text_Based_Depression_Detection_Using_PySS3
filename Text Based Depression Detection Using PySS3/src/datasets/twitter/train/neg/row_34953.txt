It sucks how often we get back up again and think we're moving on, only to come back here againI'm so tired, I'm exhausted, I'm tired of being sick and of feeling sick. I'm tired of being the only one who advocates for and looks out for me. I don't even hate myself anymore I'm just so fucking tired. I actually probably love myself more than anyone else right now and that shit has not been easy when you're chronically ill and everyone but you wants to give up on you.  
  
No amount of rest is ever enough, I'm so tired of being constantly tired. I finally believe I'm worth fighting for and I would but I don't have the energy, I don't have the will or the strength. I just want to sleep, I just want to sleep. I don't need to wake up again.
