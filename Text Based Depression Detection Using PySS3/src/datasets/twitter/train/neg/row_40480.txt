I'm just so tired of this.I cant even kill myself right. I've failed my first attempt and I'm ready to make another but I dont want to screw it up. Why isnt euthanization legal for us? I so badly just dont want to be here anymore. I was never meant for this world, I am meant to be in the cosmos. I hope I get my freedom soon.
