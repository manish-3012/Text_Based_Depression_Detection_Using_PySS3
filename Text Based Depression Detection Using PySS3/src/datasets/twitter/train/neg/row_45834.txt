Iâ€™m scared for when Iâ€™m no longer afraid to die.Not sure where else to post this, figured Iâ€™d try here. Just looking for some support and listening from folks that have lived a similar experience. 

All my life Iâ€™ve lived this conjunction of both being suicidal while also living with often crippling death anxiety (like lay awake at night having a panic attack at the thought that one day Iâ€™m going to die). The funny thing is, though, that as much as it sucks- Iâ€™ve always looked at it as a built-in shield. Like my mind is trying to protect itself from what it would do if I wasnâ€™t afraid. 

Lately though, Iâ€™ve began to worry about the day that this barrier goes away.  I work in mental health. And I see everything in myself that I see in those that I evaluate as a medium-high risk. The only difference I see is again this shield. I want to get help for this crippling anxiety, but at the same time Iâ€™m worried that if I overcome my fear of death- I know Iâ€™ll die. 

Thanks all for reading. I just needed to discuss in an area that wonâ€™t make me sit through a comprehensive SRA.
