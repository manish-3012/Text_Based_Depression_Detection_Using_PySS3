The last strawI've been suicidal for years.  Going out or going to work and seeing all of these young couples (some with kids) hurts so badly because I know no one will ever love me.  Whenever I see an attractive girl, I just want to cry because I know I have no chance at a happy life.

Apart from that, I hate this world.  It is so corrupt.  It rewards the bad and punished the good.  I believe that humans in general are a disease and should be exterminated.  Today, I've been exposed to so many rude people, and this had just proven my point.  I need to escape this terrible world in which I can never find love.  It the only way to do the is to die, so be it.
