I am feeling at peace.Many times in the past, ending my life on my own terms has been an idea born out of a spur of the moment, emotion-laden breakdown. However, I have felt a slow and steady build up of rationalized reality behind committing suicide. 

I remember a day when I would burst into tears after realizing I actually contemplated doing something so permanent and shameful. Now, thoughts about suicide (planning it, tying up loose ends, etc.) offer a respite from the deep emptiness and pain I do not want to battle with anymore. I am exhausted, I want my eternal sleep more and more each day. 

The last person I derived any pleasure in arguing with about my opinion on suicide is exhausted in their efforts. They are absent now, as I am once again looking temptedly into the void . I know I am impacting a part of their life negatively each time I need to talk about this and that is not a note to go out on. I love them deeply, and I do not want their memory of me to be painful and cause regret. 

I have written a good number of letters. I spent a very good day with members of my family I do not see often. I have plans for my things after I am gone and a detailed account of almost everything that plagues a family after a death. I have a few things left I want to do, and some people I want to tell goodbye in my own way. I have enough energy to be as normal as I can to the people in my life that love me for the remainder of my time. I hope my efforts will be enough that they will forgive me after I am gone. With their memories of me and time, I hope healing will come. This is the only unpleasant thing, knowing I'll hurt some people with my choice. 

I guess that is why I write in this thread. My explanation is long and may go unread, but if I could find someone who may understand, I could have hope that those who love me will one day understand that this is what I wanted and it is no one else's fault. Thank you.
