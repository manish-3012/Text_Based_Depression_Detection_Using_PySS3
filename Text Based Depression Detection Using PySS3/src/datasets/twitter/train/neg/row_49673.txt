Just needing help talking me back from ledge.Had strokes. Have left side paralysis. I'm 27. It rly fucked my brain over. Been with husband almost 9 years and I at first forgot my feelings for him.

They're back but slowly fading. I'm tired of flip flopping. I'm afraid of contuing. What if my feelings change for him? Like. How? It's not fair for either of us but I feel so depressed and unhappy.

I still have around a year of recovery.
