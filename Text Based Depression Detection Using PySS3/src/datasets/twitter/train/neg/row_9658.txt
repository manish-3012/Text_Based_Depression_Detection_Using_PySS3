Why?I came here to get help with some problems so I said a lot of things... And person on here was helpful in their replies when I talked of things in really general terms. It gave me some hope and it helped.  But today once I said some details they went and deleted every post they put.. Including information on a site I wanted to refer to again for help.  Why was I abandoned?  Was what I said so very awfull.. Worse than other peoples issues here?  It kinda made me feel worthless ya know... And more alone.
