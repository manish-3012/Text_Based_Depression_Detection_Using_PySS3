I feel guilty for having suicidal thoughtsThe thing is, my life's pretty good. 

I am 22, currently in a process of getting a higher education and doing well at it. My parents have decent income and care for me. I am healthy. There wasn't any tragic event happening to me.

On the other hand I have some reasons to be unhappy, like feeling lonely for years.

Overall, probably net negative. I dislike my life, I don't think it's a good experience.

But that's just that. In many groups an average would be worse than that. If I'd were to vent out, I'd hear an "And? That's it?". If I work on it, I'll solve most of my issues and some just need time.

So when I feel like I'd rather just give up and if I was given a magical button to guarantee that I'd successfully would kill myself, without pain just one press to stop, it would already be pressed... I feel guilty, for thinking of it, when I am mostly fine.

I feel guilty of this thinking, that I don't really enjoy life (or see much value in it) and don't really see death as much of a bad thing, so the preferable option is obvious.

Whenever I feel like crying, I am thinking if I am just faking it. Sure I don't feel great, but how do I know if I don't exaggerate and overreact simple issues. I mean, how much of it is me feeling sad and how much is me feeling sad over feeling sad.
