Need help with friendHello, I'm posting this as a result of something that happened tonight at my friends house. So, tonight was supposed to be a normal night of drinking and hanging out with friends into a struggle to keep my friend from killing himself. We were all drinking and having fun but one of my friends ended up drinking a bit too much and had to go to the bathroom where one of my friends went into to help him out and eventually they came out and he seemed okay. He began to drink more and eventually we all ended up outside and he kept saying his parents didn't love him and that his life wasn't worth living. He said that he wanted to kill himself and that when he got home he'd kill himself in two hours. One of my other friends mentioned that he said his parents told him that, "he's a fuck up and that he should kill himself." 


He ended being taken to my friends house to sleep it off but what I need help with is how to handle this situation tomorrow when he's sober because the things he was saying were very serious. 

Also, sorry if this seems poorly written at all since I'm still a bit drunk from earlier.
