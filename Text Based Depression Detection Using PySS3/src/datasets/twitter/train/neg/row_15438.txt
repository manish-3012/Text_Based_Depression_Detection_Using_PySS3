UntitledTo that timeless blankness I go,


Against wishes and wisdoms of those


To whom life has not presented a blow as I've known


But only the sweetness of the rose,


Their pains but small stings


Of the bees that float near the flowers


And sap the nectar as events my wings,


The sun shining beauty on the hours


They see but I cannot; downcast are my days


Which run forever back- and forward,


Precious memories turned to haze


By the remorse to which I am moored


And which won't let me fall to the slumbers


That grant me my only solace, fleeting,


But necessary; its absence encumbers


As I'm left to bad thoughts, greeting


Them as friends I've learned to hate


And try to avoid but still encounter,


Their presence something that sates


My need to feel, illusory downers


Whose addict they have defeated;


Once I fought, but my blade rendered dull,


The sentence I have meted


Is to shoot my own skull.
