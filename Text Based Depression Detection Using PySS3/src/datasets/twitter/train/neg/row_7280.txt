I don't even want to die anymore.Clickbait-ish title but oh well.

I don't want to die anymore I just want to go to sleep and never wake up, I have no desire to drown myself or hang myself anymore, I've just gave up on killing myself now I just hope that I can die from something sorta natural, cardiac arrest, heart attack fuck even murder, I don't even think I have the guts to even make sure that I'll be gone if I attempt and it's not like I could use a gun, they're illegal where I live and no one's going to give a young kid a gun for fuck sakes. I just want to be gone, I don't want to see tomorrow.
