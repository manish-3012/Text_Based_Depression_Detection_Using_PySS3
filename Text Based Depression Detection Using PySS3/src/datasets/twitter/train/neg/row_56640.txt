i spent my birthday alone and suicidal and self harminganother awful year has passed and i'm all alone in the world. i reach out, i ask for help, i do whatever i can do. i even changed my life last year by moving to another place. but i'm still broke and very mentally ill and i've been abused my entire life. i have nothing to live for. nobody truly cares about me. nobody would care if i was gone. and i want to die so desperately. it's pathetic that i spent my birthday crying and having violent flashbacks and harming myself. i want to be gone. i know nobody will care about this post so it's pointless to even type this out but whatever. i'm just so tired. i thought life is supposed to become worth living at some point. guess i was wrong.
