Can't handle my situationMy life is in shambles. But at the core is my looks, if I looked normal and felt normal I would be incredibly happy even with the million of problems that have built up. Because I know I can solve em. Instead I know that I'll just keep being incredibly miserable with no end, things can only get worse. Is there any method to overcome something like this? I keep thinking about suicide but I don't think I'll ever do it, yet I can't take it anymore either.
