Iâ€™m not really alive for myselfSo Iâ€™m a junior in high school, and within the past 12 months iâ€™ve overdosed twice on tylenol. I have moderate social anxiety, but i manage it well enough to make friends. My depression is really the kicker, itâ€™s all genetic as far as iâ€™m concerned and the dissociation keeps me pretty isolated. My life is fine otherwise, decent relationship with parents (we donâ€™t fight but i also donâ€™t tell them anything), good grades, and a promising future if i reached for it. I even want to be a doctor but it almost feels like a backup plan if i really have to keep going. I feel like iâ€™m kinda just living in preparation for a future i donâ€™t want. My life is overall fine but i just donâ€™t want it. Iâ€™m just always bored and unmotivated and i feel like things will never really work out for me. Especially relationships, i canâ€™t keep a friendship to save my life, and iâ€™m just now getting out of the cycle of jumping from one relationship to the next so now i donâ€™t have a partner to lean on. i donâ€™t really have anyone to lean on right now, or iâ€™m having a hard time accepting that i do, which puts me on this forum. anybody else feel anything like this? how do i keep going? i just want to find a reason the live other than the fact that i hated seeing my parents cry in the hospital.
