Want to do itIâ€™m a 16 y/o in high school, and my life is complete trash. My grades suck and I have absolutely no control over my behavior. Whether it comes to doing work or talking to people, I just canâ€™t seem to do it. Sometimes Iâ€™ll be able to motivate myself in the short-term to do something, but then Iâ€™ll find myself regularly going to bed at four in the morning because of pure laziness. I feel like I have tried everything to change myself, but the idea that itâ€™s all up to the oneself is just stupid. If it were that easy, then I would have done it. No matter what, as I have been for my entire life, Iâ€™ll always be an extremely lazy, shy failure. Thatâ€™s how itâ€™s been for years, and at this point I realize that it isnâ€™t going to change. In the long term, I just canâ€™t get myself to do anything to fix it. I donâ€™t know if this captures the severity of the situation, but I canâ€™t take it anymore.
