Fuck itThis isnâ€™t my first post here in the past I posted on an alt but I donâ€™t fuckin care anymore. Life is shit I hate it I spend most of my days alone. Do you know the most fucked it part I thought I was done my hole fucking life I struggled with this bull shit. but at the start of this year things where looking up for me I was starting to make friends I got a girlfriend. But life said fuck you a few months ago my girlfriend got admitted to a fucking mental ward because she tried to off herself I watched on a video call as she OD that was rough then 6 months later I got another girlfriend we had been together a month and things where great then she fucking ghosted me then corona hit so Iâ€™m starting to loose my friends. Mostly this is just a fucking rant but Iâ€™m really thinking about doing it. Although deep down I know I donâ€™t have the fucking balls to do it. Fuck you life.
