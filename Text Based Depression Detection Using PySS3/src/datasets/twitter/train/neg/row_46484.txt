What even is my lifeMy younger brother just got a scholarship to Maine University and meanwhile, I'm here wondering what went wrong with my life. I'm 23 and only squeaked by with just Bs and and low As. All As for him. My mom treats him better than me. She says she loves me but she gave up on me. My life now is just an endless cycle of just sadness. I'm proud of my brother, but then I look at myself and I see nothing. I go on the scale and see that I lost twenty pounds, but then look and notice my ribcage is showing so much that I might as well be a skeleton. I sleep and hope I never wake up. I'm so numb to my own pain that I smile sometimes and realize that one day it'll be over and then I'll never have to wake up, but then I look at my brother and my family...I can't hurt them. Then I think about death and how I fear it. I don't want to die, but what is my life? My life is just  endless disappointment and endless sadness. I want a new life...I want to be happy. I want to be successful. Please...just end all of this pain.
