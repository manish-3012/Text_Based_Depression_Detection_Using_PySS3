Why I can't just talk about suicide?I mean... It's obvious. But I just with I could tell people as a "warning" so they can prepare themselves. I don't want attention at all, for real! I know that losing someone hurts and have the knowledge that the person's not gonna be there soon may allow you to not suffer so much or not be surprised.
Like, when people have some deadly disease the doctor warn the family. Why can't I tell them?

Maybe you're thinking that I want to say that bc I want them to treat me better or just get more attention, but honestly, the thing is that I don't wanna die in vain (though I'm going to) and perhaps the ones that'll stick around learn something or try to be better ppl. 

I've been planning my death for 3/4 years now, and I feel like I lived enough. Went to therapy for a month or so and didn't really helped (my parents don't like the thought that I may not be healthy, so they just avoid it). I'll die in December 2021 if I make it through this year.

Don't feel pity, don't feel pain, don't feel anything. It's not like I'm the only one who's gonna leave, I'm not important and don't wanna be. Didn't have a good life but wasn't that bad too. The only thing that I don't like about it is that there are so many ppl in way worst situations than me and they're still trying.

I'm just tired, haven't done my best and ain't ready to live like a real adult, so f*ck it.

(Sorry if I made any grammatical mistakes, English is not my main language).

Thank you for reading too.
