Iâ€™m a worthless piece of trashIâ€™m 20 but Iâ€™ve already wasted my life. I fell in love with a girl starting in middle school and she faked being my friend all the way up to high school graduation. After that she just ghosted me and Iâ€™ve been depressed ever since because I miss her so much. Most people say time will heal or find someone else but time makes things worse and Iâ€™m not attractive enough to find another girl. Because Iâ€™m so desperate to get over this girl Iâ€™ve lost all my friends and Iâ€™ve disappointed my family. I try my best to get over that girl but I dream about her every night and itâ€™s tearing me apart. Everyone would be better off without me and this life isnâ€™t worth living
