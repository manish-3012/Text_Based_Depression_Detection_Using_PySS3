I feel like I am kept from jumping over by a few strings, that once they are gone I will have no point in living.The strings I am talking about are my parents and my girlfriend. They are the ones I will hurt if I do it. My parents are old my father will be dead in the next 4 year (At most, cancer) my mother isn't exactly healthy she may not last longer than my dad I don't know. would it be better to do it while I have my girlfriend? I don't want her to think it is her fault if I do it after a possible break up. Anyway without them there is no one who I would "hurt significantly with my death. Sometimes I wish they were just all gone so I could do it.
