Why do I want to die right now?Everything is going fine for me. Iâ€™m just so fucking anxious. Over what? I have no idea. Iâ€™m fantasizing about what it would be like to not wake up tomorrow. Why am I like this? I feel like this is more of just an acknowledgment that I feel this way. Iâ€™m not doing anything. But I hate that I want to.
