Too big a pussy to end it allIâ€™ve been thinking about offing myself for some time now , Iâ€™ve just gotten out of a relationship that lasted 3 years and she has already found someone and moved on although we spend time together occasionally nothing is the same of course. Iâ€™ve realized my mistakes and regret them dearly every single day, I also am in a financial struggle at the moment as well as have almost next to no social life and a horrible academic career . Things used to be very different in my life , i used to be able to do anything I want and had a good circle of friends now most nights I just lay awake thinking of ways to kill myself unfortunately I just pussy out even at the thought of it , I know that if I just had the balls to do it I wouldnâ€™t be writing this right now. Long story short the only thing keeping me from killing myself is my cowardice.
