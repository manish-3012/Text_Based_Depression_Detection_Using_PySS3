I just bought some razor bladesI've not self harmed in a few years. Going through a really tough time right now though and there's nothing I can do but try and endure it.

Been very suicidal and it's fucking things up more. I'm too depressed to think or do anything. 

When I used to self harm, I'd pry open pencil sharpeners to get the blades. They often weren't very good. Now I've gone out and bought double edged razor blades, the kind you use for shaving. I'm looking forward to it in a perverse way, I've never done it with a proper blade. The benefits of being an adult, I guess. I just hope I don't cut too deep by accident. That would be ironic, cutting so I can survive easier, but end up killing myself.
