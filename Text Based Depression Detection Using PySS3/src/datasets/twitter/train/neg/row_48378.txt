17 and ready to goLife is quite the roller coaster with people with mental illness were all in this big fight for a better "future" but when you find out you have a mental illness that gets in the way of the better future were does that leave you at? lost ): 

Im in the hospital writing this im still hopeful  of something better but I wont ever get what I want out of life because of were im at with my brain and my undiagnosed mental illness. This is my last resort for help I don't wanna suffer in my mind it just doesn't make sense to keep going if im just gonna keep suffering like what's the good in that? Nothing.  

I want a better life but im not gonna let myself suffer day after day and when they find a bed for me im gonna go and accept every single form of treatment trust me I am because I hope I can change I really hope I can. 

But what happens when the help doesn't work? What happens when I keep suffering everyday and I keep hurting my family and abusing them. Like I dont wanna do that bruh. So im gonna get help see what I can do and if shit doesnt work well looks like im gonna save some money buy some percs and a bunch of xanx and a bottle of strong alcohol walk down to the waterfall behind my house and put some music on and watch the world fadeaway.

 The fucked up thing is I actually become happy with this thought knowing im suffering this bad that could be the end of my problems. Keep in mind in the hosptial with this mindset on my chromebook trying to get help second time im being hospitalized. 

I wont let myself suffer.
