I've made my plans.. but I don't want to go through with them?I don't know how to feel anymore. Each day, I realize how much of a failure I am. Failure piles upon failure which piles upon more failure. I've learned that there is a light outside the tunnel.. but right across that light is another longer tunnel. I can feel happy and laugh, yet it all feels fake and very short lived. I've been suicidal for over a year now. I'm an asshole who doesn't deserve to live. I'll never be anything. I'll never be loved. Why should I exist? After I made my plans to kill myself after Ramadan ends, I felt happy. Yet, I still felt horrible. I even relapsed self harm today after a whole year. What the fuck is wrong with me?
