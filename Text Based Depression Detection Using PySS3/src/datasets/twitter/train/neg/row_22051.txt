Anyone else on the fence?When I feel frustrated I write my feelings. It wouldnâ€™t let me post an image of my page but Iâ€™ll summarize. Basically I feel like I want to die. I made this account to have an anon place to see if anyone else feels the same. I moved across the country on my own, I love my family more than anything but I wasnâ€™t raised by blood and it feels like thereâ€™s an obvious separation between myself and the family. Being on my own took my away from the suffocation I felt from my family (when they would leave me out I was so depressed, but when I moved away I feel less bad about being left out because I can pretend itâ€™s not them excluding me, itâ€™s me choosing not to go) but now Iâ€™ve become painfully aware of how hard it is to make friends. People seem to love me but I canâ€™t seem to get close to anyone. Iâ€™ve lost tons of friends this year too when I found out they just wanted to get into my pants. Anyways- the on the fence feeling. Iâ€™ve tried to kill myself before. I took a whole bottle of pills. I remember when I woke up I was so drugged up I wondered if I was dead. I didnâ€™t leave my bedroom for two almost three days (I was thirty pounds underweight and not eating or drinking anything) and I became increasingly depressed when I realized my family wasnâ€™t even worried (that was during a one week trip home after moving away). I donâ€™t want to attempt suicide again, but I feel so empty inside and like my future is pointless so sometimes when I lay in bed I wish my body would just turn off.  

Tldr; I wish I was dead but I donâ€™t want to attempt suicide again. Just feel empty/in limbo
