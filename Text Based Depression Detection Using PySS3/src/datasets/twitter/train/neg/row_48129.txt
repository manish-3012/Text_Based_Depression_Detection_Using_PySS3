Going to work in 30 minsI feel so pathetic i'm hated by my family and loved by no one i'm so alone and cold I am a fake person I put on a persona that i'm happy. My brother drops me off at work but when i get to work i'm going to clock off and go kill myself probably......I'm a useless person in my opinion I'm a waste of life. I don't want to go on seeing everyone around being successful while i'm left behind. It hurts..... and when you're not even on anyone mind or no one talks to me at all. I just want people to care for me. Someone to ask how my day is....I do so much to try and be kind and giving and get nothing in return. I want them to feel guilty for what theyre doing to me. goodbye
