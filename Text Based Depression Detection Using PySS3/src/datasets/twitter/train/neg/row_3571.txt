I'm trying not to do itLifeboat, the song from Heathers. That's how I feel.
I considered cutting but my skin is to beautiful.
Scratching is not good emough.
Drinking and smoking don't work for me.
I just fell asleep on the bathtub but a voice eoke me up. I can't believe I started hearing voices after all these years of just seeing stuff.
I want to dissappear, but I don't know how to do it. All the methods I know are so long and tiring and stressful. I just wanna lay there and blink and be dead.
