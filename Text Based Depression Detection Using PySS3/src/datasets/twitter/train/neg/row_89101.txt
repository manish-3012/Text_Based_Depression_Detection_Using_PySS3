Thinking Of Taking A Huge Investment Gamble, If I Fail Then I Kill Myself. If I Succeed, Then That's All Good.So I've been trading/gambling in crypto currency since April 2017. My biggest success came in August 2017, after investing $30k in a project called Binance Coin. My investment grew to a September 2017 high of $160k. That's a lot of money for me. The price crashed in mid September 2017. If I didn't sell my Binance Coins when the price crashed, I would have had $500k now. Enough money to resign from the job that I hate, and be financially free in some way.

When the Binance Coin price temporarily crashed in mid September 2017, I lost the plot completely. Long story short, I have now lost a total of $70k because I chased other coins so I can get back the $160k. I lost all my life savings in the process. My pension fund is gone, I've lost everything. I have zero savings, and I owe a lot of money. I owe a $55k mortgage, and a $5k credit card debt. Luckily for me, I don't have children. But I'm old, i.e. 34 years old. 

My 8 year old car is starting to give in, and I am literally one salary away from poverty.

I'm desperate, and I'm at a point where I'm considering taking out a $25k loan, and invest it in a project that I believe will succeed. If it fails, then I will kill myself. If it succeeds, then my life will be back on track.

What I do know for certain is that there is no way I'm starting a family while I'm not financially free, absolutely no way. I'd rather be alone forever with no children and a wife.
