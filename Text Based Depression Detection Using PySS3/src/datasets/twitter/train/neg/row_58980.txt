im breaking apart.i once had a friend. he was nice, very caring. however, one day he left me and told me that me telling him my problems was a burden and he felt like he became my parent overnight. i was disappointed and heartbroken. ever since we never talked, though i tried to. i dont want him to be burdened by my problems so i tried telling more people about it hoping it would reduce the burden. it backfired. it spreaded like wildfire and now im really broken. i have one wish, to see the brightest smile on that friend. i tried to make him happy, but at the expense of my own happiness. but as he became happier with other people, i started feeling sad. and now i cannot really see a way out. i dont know whats happening to me. my parents were never there for me. he was my only friend in my 17 years of living. and now i just want to leave.
