Why am I always abandoned?What makes it is about me that makes it so easy for people to stop caring about me? I know no one can answer this.
 
Maybe they never cared in the first place. Maybe I'm just too stupid to notice. 

I wish I didn't feel things so deeply. I wish I didn't believe people when they pretend to give a fuck. 

This will never stop. It will be the same cycle until I die. I want to be brave enough to end my life. I wish I wasn't so naive. 

I know I'm just repeating the same thing over and over in every post.

I'm just trying to make sense of it. I'm so fucking tired of hurting. 

Whatever it is that makes it easy to abandon me has always been there. I wasn't good enough for my mom. She had to have other kids because I wasn't enough. 

I guess I'm just defective. 

I guess I'm not worthy of life.
