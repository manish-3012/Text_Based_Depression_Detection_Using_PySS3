I admit defeat.I can't do this anymore. Today was wrapped up in either being screamed at by my mother or sleeping to recover from the trauma of the day. I keep trying far too hard to fight back and protect myself in a battle that's impossible to win. I can't stay and I can't leave, because I'll probably bring the 'rona back and kill my high risk parents. If I had the money to leave I mean.

A separate but relevant issue: I used to think my ideas made me special, but I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that they don't. No one wants to hear what I have to say anymore. Why can't I stop speaking like they want me to? Life would be so much more livable if I could drift through silently and never feel compelled to react.

It's all I can do to keep from taking every single pill I have downstairs and bidding my brain children good night. The characters in my head are the only things keeping me alive right now. I suppose I'll have to apologize to them as I take them to my grave.

I'm so broken. I can't do this anymore. I want to be free of this horrible place I'm in. If I could stop feeling and expressing emotions, that would help too.

Maybe I'll have one last night in my bed. Good night.
