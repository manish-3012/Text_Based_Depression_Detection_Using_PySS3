When I was in 3rd grade I thought I should kill myselfBecause life wouldn't get better. I had no friends. Now I am all grown up, and life is much worse.  I want to say I give up but I already have. I've been through so much and I'm tired.  I hate who I am, I've tried so hard to fit in, and be average. I fail miserably at even that. Being bipolar with a learning disability that basically makes me autistic. Rationally there should be a day where I give up.
