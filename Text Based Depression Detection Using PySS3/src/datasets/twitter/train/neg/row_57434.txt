I Want to DieI don't even know where to start. My dead parents? The rape that took five years of my life? The friendships that have bottomed out. How disconnected I feel with the world? The latest attempt at a relationship, where he lied to me intricately for weeks? Realizing he was a scary person wasn't the heartbreak. It was knowing that that aside, he did it because he didn't want me: he told me.

I have always been someone who fights, tries again. It's not even that I'm insanely exhausted inside. It's that I don't even think I'm a good person anymore. I don't think there is a solution anymore. I think I'm just running out the clock.

I've had therapy. I've read a ton of self help books. I've talked. I've called hotlines. I've dug deep in me. I've tried taking risks. Doing things. Creating a positive lifestyle. None. Of. It. Works.

I keep thinking recently how I would do it. The thing stopping me is just that I don't want to mess it up and live. Even my brother, who has always been a rock for me, just mocks me recently. I can barely stand being awake.
