HelpSo, I started cutting about 2 years ago but I quit on my own (using the butterfly project) but then something happened and I relapsed (a couple months ago) and I canâ€™t stop anymore. I tried the butterfly project again but I donâ€™t have the will power anymore. Iâ€™m weak. I just canâ€™t stop because I need the pain, I deserve to be punished. Any advice? :(
