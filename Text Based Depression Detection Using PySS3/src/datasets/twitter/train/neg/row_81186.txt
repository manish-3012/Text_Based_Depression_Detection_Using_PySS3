copypasta: how true was this for you?'Yeah... Fuck calling these hotlines.  Police showing up at your door can literally ruin your life.  You thought you were struggling when you called? Well prepare for a shit load more stress when you lose your job after being involuntarily held in a psych unit for a week where they treat you like shit.  This happens all of the time.

Mandated reporting is one of biggest barriers to people calling suicide hotlines as that digusting practise can make your life a whole lot worse and land you in massive debt in the US.'
