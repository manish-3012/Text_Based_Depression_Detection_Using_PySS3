I did something so gross and slimy and shameful, i don't know how i can possibly go the rest of my life knowing what i did.I'm not gay, but lately i'd been into transexual porn for some unknown reason and yesterday my crazy lust made me do something i'll regret forever. I went on Craigslist, at first just kinda out of curiosity, and i ended up talking to this trans girl for a while and was eventually convinced to go meet him/her at a hotel. Against my better judgement i went and when i got there he/she didn't look how i was expecting but i let him/her perform oral sex on me anyway. He/she also took some naked photos of me which i really regret allowing. I have been contemplating taking my own life since it happened. I am a pretty religious guy and i know what i did is a sin and suicide would be too. That's the main reason i haven't done it yet. That and my family. I really don't know what to do.
