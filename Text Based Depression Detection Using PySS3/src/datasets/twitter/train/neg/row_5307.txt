Being an ugly male virgin in today's world is a strong justification.I've never had any intimate contact with a girl before, let alone ever had a girl flirt with me. Everyone I know have been in relationships several times and have experienced sex many different times as well. Me? I'm nothing more but an ugly and sexually inexperienced loser. Being ugly and a virgin as a male in today's world is already similar to committing suicide. So, why shouldn't men like me just finish the job? I'm not committing suicide soon but I will make sure it happens sometime in my future. I'm just waiting for the right moment.
