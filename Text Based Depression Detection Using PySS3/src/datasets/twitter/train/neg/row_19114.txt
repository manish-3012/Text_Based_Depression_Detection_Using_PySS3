This is Only Getting WorseI'm trying everything I can to snap out of this, but nothing works. Almost nothing. If something does, it's only for a few minutes. The love of my life and everyone that used to call me their best friend won't talk to me anymore. It's insane. I just don't see why I should be alive if I hate it this much. I try to get out, but it feels like everywhere I go I'm not wanted. I'm thinking about going to look at guns in a few minutes. I don't know what else to do.
