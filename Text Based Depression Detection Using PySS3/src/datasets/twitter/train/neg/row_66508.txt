Need adviceMy little sister attempted to commit suicide last night by taking a bottle of aspirin. We are located in nevada and I am trying to find a way to help her moving forward. Sheâ€™s in ICU and will then be released to the hospital upstairs. My question is will they release her into the streets after or will she be admitted into a psych hospital ? Iâ€™m not sure what to do. If I didnâ€™t listen to my gut she would be dead. I had a horrible feeling last night and called the police to do a wellness check and she was overdosing they got there just in time. I really appreciate the help.
