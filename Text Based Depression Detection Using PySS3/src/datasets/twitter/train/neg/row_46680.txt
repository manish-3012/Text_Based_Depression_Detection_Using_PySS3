I need advice, I don't know how to deal with my suicidal sisterI'm sorry, I just feel like if I mess up or do something wrong when I talk to her when she feels suicidal, she could do something she regrets. She self-harms and whenever I see her scars, I feel devastated. She tells me that she's never liked living for as long as she can remember. I just can't relate to her because I've always been content with my life. I feel like I need to do something to help her, but I don't know what. I just can't understand. I thought maybe someone going through something similar can help me relate a little better, I just want to help her as best I can. I've always looked up to her and I love her so much it hurts. I don't think I could stand it if she killed herself. I want to know what I can do do help her.
