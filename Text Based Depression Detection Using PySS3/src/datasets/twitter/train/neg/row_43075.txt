I hatr feeling depressed and suicidalI have no reason to be depressed yet i am having suicidal thoughts and cant snap out of it. When i get depressed i get mad, start crying, want to kill myself.  Right now iam thinking about OD on sleeping pills, i know they wont do anything i have done it before.  I just sleep through it.
