Gotta push through this to experience videos gamesWarning: friendly depressing rambling. 

I promised myself I wouldn't hurt myself because cyberpunk 2077 and other games I love are releasing maybe this year or the next.
 It's so hard though. Yet hard isn't even the word.  The pure despair and hopelessness I feel is abysmal. If someone broke through my window wanting to murder me right now the only request I would have is to do it so my siblings wouldnt see or hear. Like I'm so ready to go as if I'm an immortal who has been living too long. Have yall ever been around elderly folks and there just like "yeah whatever I've lived my life no big deal."? That's me except I'm 24 and haven't don't shit lol. But I'm exhausted and over it. 

If you have Bpd, you might also know how I feel. The intensity of emotions is too much.  I hate crying all the time even if I don't want to be. (can't be a bad bitch with tears in your eyes ok) If it wasn't for video games, my siblings and 1 more person, I promise  you I would not be here lol.
 
What video games are keeping yall here?
