I just donâ€™t understand why everyone has hated me my entire lifeI didnâ€™t do anything wrong. My entire childhood was just me being bullied and made fun of in school and high school. My parents just yelled at me, cares about my siblings more, didnâ€™t prevent me from being bullied, and never let me go out anywhere. Once in college, everyone just wants nothing to do with me. They all have friends and dates but I got no one. My parents ask me why I have no friends every now and then and they act like itâ€™s my fault I have no friends even though they are part of the cause. No one cares about me at all. The depression, loneliness, and suicidal thoughts get worse everyday. Therapy and medications are no help at all, just a waste of time and money. There is just no point in me living as long as everyone continues to hate me. The longer my problems exist, the worse my depression, loneliness, and suicidal thoughts get. I just wish people cared but they donâ€™t at all. No one ever does.
