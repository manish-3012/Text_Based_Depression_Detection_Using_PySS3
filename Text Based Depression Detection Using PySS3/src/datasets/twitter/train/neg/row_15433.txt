My therapist said something funny...... after I told him that maybe it would be better if I killed myself. He said "do it, but why would you be doing it?", and when I mentioned the reason, he said I shouldn't do it for something that stupid. Maybe he was trying to get me to snap out of feeling that way, but truth is since my last appointment, I'm actually feeling even *more* suicidal, lol; I realized what a pathetic, useless, ugly piece of shit I am and that just makes me wanna end it even more.
