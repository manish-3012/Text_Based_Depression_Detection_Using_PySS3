the twilight of life looks like...this, with a howling cat.As I sit here thinking my suicidal thoughts, I wonder if the cat is reading my mind. If so, she's not very empathetic.

I'm not young anymore. I don't think I have any good reasons to keep going. I *have* kept going, that's why I'm still alive now. But a window of opportunity is presenting itself.

I could have said something, I suppose, had some things in place to prevent the dark night of the soul, but instead I chose to walk into it alone. Because that is how I experience life, alone. If I told someone it might create a momentary flurry, but nothing sustainable, and nothing would really change.

Aging has given me experience, and perspective, and I still want to die. Death first called my name when I was thirteen, and I waited this long. Perhaps it really is the right thing.

But obviously I'm not sure...just not sure.
