I can't do it anymoreI've officially hit the lowest point in my entire life. I didn't think I could get any worse but I have. I don't expect people to read my mind. I have been begging for someone in my life to listen to me so I can on just a little longer but no one gives a shit. I can't do anything anymore which renders me useless and I've already tried it all in past and now I'm done.
