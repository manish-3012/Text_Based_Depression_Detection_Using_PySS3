Tired, sick, suicidal, just can't deal with it...Well, I've put in almost 27 years, and I feel like I've made a good faith effort to get better to no avail.  I'm just tired of dealing with all this: 

* Brain damage from a previous attempt 

Probably shaved a good 5-10 points off my IQ and left me with impaired executive functioning and (seemingly permanent -- it's been three years now) brain fog. 

* Hate my job

Dead end job, stressful, low paying, boring...best of all, it requires constant travel, really, a nightmare.  I dread waking up in the morning.  

* Broke up with my girl, alienated my friends

The usual.  Just couldn't deal with all the pressures that she was putting on me (*Where is this relationship going?*, *Do we have a future together?* etc); no desire to interact with anyone after putting in my time at work, so I mostly just sleep, listlessly watch tv on the weekends. 

But the real kicker is 

* Endogenous depression (most likely incurable)  

I've always been depressed, or I can't really recall a time when I wasn't depressed, and I am seriously doubting it will get better.  I've been in therapy since 18 (so, coming up on nine years now, enormous waste of time and energy), countless medications...

The only medication which helps, I've found, is test enanthate.  I don't cruise on this, but have run 4 cycles of 8 weeks in duration every year since 22.  It helps, but only marginally.  Not currently running anything right now, though.  

Since hitting 26, I feel like I'm on borrowed time, anyway, since my mom checked out at age 26.  I just want to end it because I swear I've done *everything* right, and nothing helps.  If my life was going to get any more bearable, it would have done so by now.
