Itâ€™s hitting really hard againI canâ€™t imagine ever killing myself or even creating a viable plan. Itâ€™s just too out of character. Iâ€™ve been so apathetic recently. I got to the point of being so confused I turned off my emotions. This is wild in of itself. Iâ€™ve always been a feeler and empathetic but I just feel empty and worthless and so so nothing. Thatâ€™s just the feeling is nothing and I hate it cause normally I burn when things get this bad. I donâ€™t wanna talk to people cause I feel like Iâ€™m being a burden but if I donâ€™t talk to them I wonâ€™t be able to help myself. This feeling is awful and I donâ€™t have an appetite anymore which is scary and I donâ€™t want to relapse and self harm or redevelop bulimia. Iâ€™m so lost and so scared and so cold. Iâ€™m sorry this post is all over the place. This is the first time Iâ€™ve gotten words out for my feelings in a few days. Have a lovely night
