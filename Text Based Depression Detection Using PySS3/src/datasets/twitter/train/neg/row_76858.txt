Iâ€™m a lying hypocrite and everything is my fault.For years Iâ€™ve avoided telling people the truth. When I do open up to someone, I donâ€™t tell them much. I tell them Iâ€™m depressed and anxious, but I tell them that nothing caused it. I always say that Iâ€™ve just always been anxious. And I tell them I donâ€™t know why my depression is slowly getting untreatable. Even my few friends who know about my suicidal thoughts/suicide attempts donâ€™t know why. I never talked to them about it. Iâ€™ve avoided telling the truth so much I started lying. I pretend to have problems that I donâ€™t, and I pretend that little problems are bigger than they are. Just being depressed or anxious doesnâ€™t explain my crazy mood swings, amnesia, and all the other crazy shit. I donâ€™t even fully understand what is going on with me. At this point I feel like I canâ€™t tell the truth. And I donâ€™t even know what to say. Itâ€™s been so long since Iâ€™ve had a serious talk about my emotions. A while ago I had an â€œinterventionâ€ and really didnâ€™t really tell my friend whatâ€™s going on. Truthfully, Iâ€™ve been suffering from crippling ptsd for years, the longer Iâ€™m alive the worse it gets. I was abused physically and sexually by my grandpa. It was years ago so there is no proof. I doubt I can do anything legally. And my family will 100% not believe me because heâ€™s such a â€œgood manâ€. My family just thinks I have mild depression.. I want to tell someone. I want to cry and just be open about everything. But this problem is getting worse. Honestly Iâ€™m turning into a literal compulsive liar. I canâ€™t be honest. I donâ€™t know how to talk to anyone. Itâ€™s hard to even tell if what Iâ€™m saying is true because I donâ€™t know how I feel. I really donâ€™t think I can be helped. Like the only option at this point is suicide. I canâ€™t start over. I want to change so much. All the bad things that have happened in my life are all my fault. All of it. Everything is always my fault. I hate myself so much but Iâ€™m also pretty sure Iâ€™m a narcissist. I hate admitting Iâ€™m wrong and think so highly of myself while i talk to others. Itâ€™s so weird and hard to explain. Everything about me is a lie and a contradiction. Iâ€™m a hypocrite and I donâ€™t know what to do at this point. I want to start over so badly. Iâ€™m fine. Itâ€™s all a lie Iâ€™m just fine. Iâ€™m just being dramatic. Iâ€™m a liar. Iâ€™ll always be a lier. I just want attention. I need help but Iâ€™ll never be able to get it. I donâ€™t deserve it. Iâ€™m fucking done.
