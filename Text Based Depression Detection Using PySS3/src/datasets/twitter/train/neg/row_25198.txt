I sometimes wish I'd never been born at allHi everybody,

I'm posting from a throwaway account. 

I'm a 23 years old Frenchman (turning 24 in June) living in the east of France. I am really depressed since I was in the middle school. I have a passion for music (especially for French and American classics) and poetry. I also produce some music. I'm currently doing a PhD (hoping I will become a researcher).

Since January, my depression has worsened. I want to die everytime and I feel so empty. I have to hide it from my family and I have  no friends or girlfriend to talk about my pain (I guess that's the reason I chose reddit). To forget it I focus on work but I feel like it's even worse. I have already thought about how I'm going to end my life. I don't even know of it feels to be loved, all I know is hate and despair. I really don't know if i will still live by my 25th birthday. 

I usually go for a walk in my city to visit the cathedral, the Roman ruins, the museum or simply in a park. That's the only way I found to forget about the pain. I also read a lot just to imagine being a the shoes of someone else and living their lives.

Anyway, I'm sorry for the mistakes in my text but I just wanted to share my state of mind with y'all. Thank you.
