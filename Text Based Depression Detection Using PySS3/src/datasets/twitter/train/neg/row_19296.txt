I messed up and see no point in trying to go furtherI have (or maybe had, idk what's the state rn) a VERY close friend, that goes through some tough times at home. I promised myself and her to protect her and do anything to make her happy. Yesterday I broke that promise and I am starting to feel like she might hurtherself, or that I might lose her completely. I feel like a complete failiure and don't wan't to live anymore
