Planning itSo last week I started having intrusive thoughts about being a pedophile. Which I'm NOT. And NEVER have been. This shit is scaring me and disgusting to me. I have two children and would NEVER hurt them. But these thoughts won't stop. I tried to kill myself with fentanyl a couple years ago and I only failed because someone found me. If I can get my hands on more, which I can, its not hard, then I will find a place and time to do it. Just so these thoughts go away. I've told my therapist and I'm not sure if she is equipped to help me. What should I do? I can't live with these thoughts anymore and its only been a week.
