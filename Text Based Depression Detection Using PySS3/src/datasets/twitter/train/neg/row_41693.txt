Someone sent me a suicidenote to proofreadHi, 
Not sure how to go about all this, or how to respond, but considering she's thinking right now I'm reading it, I figured I'd rather be quick. 

I got sent what seems like a suicide note, from a girl I met a long time ago online. We didn't really talk thÃ¡t often, but now she sent me this. I'm not sure what to do - I tried calling the hotline, but I guess everyone in my timezone's sleeping.

She's asking me not to respond on the content, but only on whether or not she misspelled stuff or should explain more about stuf. "please don't ask any questions" she said

Hope you guys have suggestions, cheers

Would calling her on Skype be a good idea?
