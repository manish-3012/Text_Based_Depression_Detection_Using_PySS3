Anyone else feel like they just simply can't be bothered to exist any more?I'm at a low point at the moment, which is really confusing for me. I've always been the one that loves life, loves myself and always seem happy-go-lucky and confident, but I always have this urgent feeling that I just shouldn't be here. Whenever people ask my about my future I always know what my future is going to be, I just don't know when. 

It's not like I want to die, it's just that the idea of not being around is more appealing to me than growing old. 

I don't want to be around any more, I've had my fun and now I'm ready to not exist.
