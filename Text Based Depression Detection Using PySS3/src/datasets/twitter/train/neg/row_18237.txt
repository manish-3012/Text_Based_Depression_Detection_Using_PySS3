you only can get help online if you are european or american (including canada)if you are asian, latino, or african you never gonna find any help, the only that i find after an extensive seatch is "look for profesional help in your country"  

&amp;#x200B;

moral of the story: only english, amercans (from trumpland) and europeans can get help, because this the r/SuicideWatch subreddit is only a way of reddit owners to  take the blame off  about a suicide but  it's no use (except if you are from these countries) 

&amp;#x200B;

is hard to swallow but is a redpill.
