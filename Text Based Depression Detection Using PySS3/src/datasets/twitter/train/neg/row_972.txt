I donâ€™t have anything that makes life worth fighting for.Iâ€™m sitting here at a Korean BBQ restaurant on a Saturday night eating dinner by myself.
My plans fell through today - both Plan A and Plan B. As Iâ€™m sitting here trying to figure out what to do with the rest of my day, I canâ€™t really come up with anything worthwhile. 
Thatâ€™s when I started thinking about ending my life. The more I thought about it, the more it made sense to me. I hate being stuck in the same old loop. I fight tooth and nail for change, and I always end up with the same result - nothing.
Ending it all seemed like the easiest way out. Even though my few friends and family would be crushed, I feel like I would finally have relief. When the hell am I going to get paid my due? When will the world throw me a bone for once? Will anything ever go my way?
