Feeling completely worthless (pointless ranting)The anxiety has been getting worse and worse as the year goes on. I can barely talk to anyone anymore. And the phone calls have always been impossible. I canâ€™t go to a doctor or therapist for help because I canâ€™t call them. I was supposed to call someone about an apartment so I can finally have a better place for myself but that obviously was never really going to happen.

The suicide text helpline was useless. All I get from them is empty platitudes. â€œGo for a walk.â€ Yeah thatâ€™s gonna solve my shitty personality.

Both the men I loved were abusive assholes. The second one told me that I should jump in front of the train since everyone would be better off. He didnâ€™t have to say it, I already knew. And I actually fucking miss him despite him ripping my heart out. We just both need help that we donâ€™t know how to get.

Iâ€™m useless. Thereâ€™s nothing inside of me. Iâ€™m incapable of taking care of myself. 

The worst is that I have a kid. So I feel like itâ€™s too late to actually kill myself now, Iâ€™m forced to stay here suffering forever because of him. I canâ€™t break his heart like that. Thank god he has a good dad because lord knows I canâ€™t take good care of him. Iâ€™m a failure in every aspect of my life.
