I need to make some irreversible financial steps to put my things in order before I end my life. If you could read the links above and give me any advice... I do not really want to die, I love life and my children, I would like to see the future of technology, but life became an endless pain and each day is worse and this is the only rational solution. Sometimes suicide is the rational solution. Please read the links carefully and give me any feedback.
