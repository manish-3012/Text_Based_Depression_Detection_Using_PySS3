It's when I'm not depressed that I worry myself the most.The last few weeks, on and off, I've felt psychologically numb. It's not a particularly good feeling. Well, actually it isn't much of a feeling at all. It usually interrupts the depression and leaves me feeling completely empty. I haven't spoken to my family in almost six months and I honestly do not miss them. My wife pretty much cannot stand me nor I her. I think she's sick of my neurotic depression and anxiety or whatever the fuck it is that's wrong with me. There isn't really much reason to keep drawing breath, well other than cowardice. I've always found it strange that suicide is often referred to as the "cowards way out." If it's really so cowardly, then why is it so hard to do it? One of these days I'm gonna work up the courage. I think it'll be during one of these emotionally dry times when I do. I'm only writing this because you guys seem to care when people go on long, melodramatic rants like I so often do. Eh, I guess I can always delete this post if I later feel like an idiot.
