I'm scared, I need helpToday's been a shit day for me. I've been cutting, I've had multiple breakdowns, I'm just not in a good state. About an hour ago my friend messaged me about how he's going to kill himself and how he's a waste of space and useless. I'm in an awful state as it is and just had another complete panic attack, I'm scared he's going to do something and I'm struggling to even reply because I'm a mess. I need help
