maybe in heaven I can finally be a boy16 year old trans guy. I hate everything about my body. I want to cut my chest off, I hate the way my hips sway I hate how my hair feels against my neck and back because it's so long I hate how old men leer i hate I can't feel stubble on my neck all my guy friends are bragging about their beards and sharing tips and I feel left out and i hate when I look down _there_ how there's nothing there I hate having to double check my surroundings when I go to the men's room I hate not being able to go to the men's room I hate that girls at school know I'm trans (I'm out at school but I sure as hell don't pass) and they leer when I'm in the bathroom bc they know I'm a boy and I'm a freak that's all I am that's all I'll ever be maybe if I can just slip away I can be a boy in heaven maybe then god will let me have this one thing
