i'm too worthless to liveI'm so worthless... I have no future. I'm not good at anything. I have no talents. I love drawing and singing and they're the only two things I like and I'm so bad at ether of them and I don't mean a little bit or humble brag I mean I'm absolute shit at them and that's not me being too hard on myself I'm just terrible at it and I've tried my whole life and I can't improve no matter what I do

I've never had a boyfriend and it's so hard to make friends they seem to always grow distance because they find someone else and I feel like I don't have anything to offer. My one group of friends ditched me for being annoying and I've been lonely ever since and I try so hard to make friends. I sign up for things I take classes I go places I try so hard to be social and no one ever stays and no one will ever love me

I'll never be successful I'm not good at anything

I'm ugly and my body is shit and I my immune system is so bad I'm always sick and miserable and I'm always breaking bones and ever since I was little I was always ridiculed for it at school and my mom always hated me for it because it cost money 

And I have a heart condition so I can't exercise much or at all and I'm overweight (not much but I'm a little more than curt) and my hair is hideous and people make fun of me even though I try so hard to dress cute and work on my body shape and do my hair and makeup and no matter where I go people make rude comments

I'm a senior in high school and I don't think any college will accept me because even though I try to do things and I try to get involved in leadership roles in not popular and have no friends so I never got elected for anything I ran for or tried to do so I have hardly anything to put on my resume and even my chorus group kicked me out because I'm sick a lot and have to miss school and my voice wasn't good enough to keep me anyways

I went to an art school summer camp and it was the worst time of my life all of the other students and professors shunned me because I had the least skill even though I've tried my whole life so hard to learn I've taken lessons twice a week my whole life and I have no talent

Even my therapist gave up on me and said she won't see me anymore because it's been months and she says that the two of us just can't make any progress

My sister is everything I'm not she's skinny and blonde and beautiful and she has an amazing body and she's social and so smart and she charms everyone and she's just good at everything and athletic and she's healthy and normal and she's so good at everything without trying. The one sport I was good at was tennis and there was one spot and I was going to get it but then my sister got a last minute try out and took my spot even though she doesn't like the sport and I can't have anything I'm just no good

I don't see the point in living anymore shes better than me and no one will miss me. I've tried so hard for 17 years and nothing has happened and nothing will ever get better. I have such a bad personality and I used to be so happy and it's just sad to see how much I've given up because I try and try and nothing ever works and I'm just sick of living in a world where I can't do anything. The world is better off without me
