lost money of family in stock market, im too afraid, suicide on my mindI can't believe this is happening. I lost more than half the money invested in the stock market. I can't repay them. They are asking about if their investment is doing well and I just say yes.

I was just trying to do the right thing and make money for my family. I having so much anxiety that I can't sleep.

I can't face them now. I'm just thinking about killing myself right now. I'm totally fucked
