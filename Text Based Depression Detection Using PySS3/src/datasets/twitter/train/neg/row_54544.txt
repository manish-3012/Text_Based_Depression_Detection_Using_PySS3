Seriously disturbed after watching serial killer documentary and seeing the parallels with my life.TLDR: I'm a highly functional final year grad-med student at a top Ivy league university, watched a documentary on the craigslist killer (philip markoff) last night and been seriously disturbed since, can't get it out of my head that I am a monster of a similar breed and am feeling very tense and isolated...

Background:
During the breakup of my relationship with my first relationship (ended 1 year ago, lasted 3 years), especially towards the end, I exhibited these traits:
- very selfish, lacking empathy 85% of the time - really loving the rest of the time
- manipulative, threatening suicide on breaking up
- completely emotionally unavailable 95% of the time
- very violent mood swings (not physical violence)
- borderline emotionally abusive
- impulsive sex (with guys, girls, tvs, cds, escorts), lived a complete double life.
- gambling for endless hours playing internet poker 

(I'm pansexual btw and actually coming to terms with it despite being somewhat in denial about it for a couple of years)

I went to see a psychiatrist during this turbulent period as it was very distressing for me (as well as for her but thats a given). They said it was unlikely to be BPD as it didn't seem pervasive enough and lots of these things they said were somewhat normal-ish in periods of high life stress. 

Anyway as I lay watching this documentary I noticed the CL killer:
- was a highly functioning medical student, who no one would have suspected to lead this double life
- was a loving boyfriend who 
- had issues with impulse control (gambling with online poker and sex)
- wrote his lovers name in his blood before killing himself in a shrine of photos, this is what really shook me in that I feel so sad and can relate so much to the helplessness he must have felt at his lover leaving him and being with someone else. But its also something that my emotionally unstable, manipulative self would have done to make sure my ex would feel the "hurt" I was feeling... completely psycho i know... (I'm not like this normally but I can relate to it is what I'm trying to say)

I should at this point add I don't have any impulses to hurt anyone, what is really distressing me most and making me feel like I should just end my own life is that I can relate to so much of what this guy went through and it is really making me think I am a similar breed, possibly capable of similar things if my circumstances were different (I am somewhat financially stable, and I really do keep sex and gambling under check for the most part despite inevitable relapses - it seems this maybe what triggered it, though this is largely conjecture).

I'm not sure what I'm looking for here, or if this is even the right place to post but I just feel very isolated right now and don't really know where to turn...
