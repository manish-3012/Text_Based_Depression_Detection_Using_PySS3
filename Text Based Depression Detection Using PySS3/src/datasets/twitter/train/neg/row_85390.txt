Anyone else feel like they mean nothing?Ive been "depressed" for a while, for sometime it was more just anger and sadness combined but recently it's taken its toll and while i'm angry and furious at myself and my life i'm so terribly sad. i just feel nothing. I started to think and honestly i just feel like well my parents have suffered death before they'll be fine if i die, my siblings have each other and their friends it's ok. But most of all i don't wanna spend 30 years working some shit job i don't like just so i can survive. I'll probably be working a fine job and be middle class and have a wife and kids but it's not what i want. there's 7 billion people on earth and i'm not unique at all. So why continue?
