CommuneI am considering starting a commune in California on a 20 acre ranch. It would either be free or very inexpensive like 25-100 a month and we could do fundraising and take donations in nearby cities. Cheap food  like rice and beans would be cooked and we could have chicken coops and garden. water and camping gear will be provided. Transportation to town provided. We can have campfires and Coffee or tea. My goal is to provide nonprofit service to homeless, hopeless, lonely, and hungry people who may be penniless  and or suicidal and in deep debt and unable to get and hold a job. Police will be welcome on site so illegal drug addicts criminals will not be Welcome and will be banned. I need a substantial list of names of interested people to proceed and all ideas considered. Please email phillipanthonybiondo@gmail.com with your name and contact info and any ideas like how to recruit members, please try to get names of interested people, I really want to do this, I think 10 people minimum would be enough to start but ideally would like to have a large group and maybe someday a huge community.
