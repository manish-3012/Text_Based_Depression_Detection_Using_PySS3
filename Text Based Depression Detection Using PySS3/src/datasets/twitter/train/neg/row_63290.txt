A really good internet friend of mine who has been dealing with depression for 4 years (ive known her for 2 years) just said she cut herself open and that she can't take it anymore and that I need to tell everyone shes sorry but that it's too much and went offline 2 min ago. I don't know her adres.Is there any way I can do something? I don't wanne lose her.
