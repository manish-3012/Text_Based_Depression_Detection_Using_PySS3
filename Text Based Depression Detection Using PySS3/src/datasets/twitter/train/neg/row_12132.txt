Give me a reason to live.I'm 18. My whole life I've been raised by narcissistic parents and have been socially isolated my whole entire life and have been bullied and emotionally abused. I've never had a friend, I've never been in a relationship and have been suffering through depression and anxiety my whole life in silence.

No matter how I hard I try to connect with people to make friend they always flake on me and/or cancel.  I feel like there is something wrong with me that nobody is telling me. I really want to kill myself but I don't know how to. I want this pain to go. I fucking hate living like this. 

Feels like nobody in my area or the world wants to be my friend. Shit even people I've talked to on reddit flaked on me. 

I can't even enjoy anything anymore. Porn makes me depressed thinking I'll never had a sex with a person I love. Video games don't serve as an escape or entertainment anymore. I'm getting addicted to cigarettes to help cope with my depression and loneliness. 

I don't know what I'm going to do with my life but just to let this community know, I have no one to reach out to and am suffering every single day.
