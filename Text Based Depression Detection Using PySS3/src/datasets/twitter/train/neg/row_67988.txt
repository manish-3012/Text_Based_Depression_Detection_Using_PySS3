Back againI can't get these horrifying suicidal thoughts out of my head! I'm living with debilitating, excruciating pain everyday and I can't take it anymore! The government has all the doctors locked down from appropriately treating people like me that actually need pain control and who is not just a drug seeker trying to get another high! I can't live like this anymore and the healthcare system is useless!
