Need to dieI am at a stage in my life where anything that made me happy no longer exists because I've killed it internally or dropped it. I think it happens once you reach a point in life long depression when you begin to realize you are going to kill yourself eventually. I have already moved away and cut contact from all my friends and family. I dont enjoy much or have attachments because I know they are temporary, they're painful. I cannot form them anymore if I wanted to. I don't have a capacity for anything beyond going to work to support myself so I can sleep in a bed and go to work the next day. There's really nothing. The last few years are one long memory. I don't remember or care to because it doesn't matter. I spend most of my time getting high or drunk and walking. Every day when I get out of work I get fucked up, walking miles and miles and miles aimlessly every day walking anywhere. That's what my life has culminated to. I can't go home, I live with trust fund college children w a slumlord situation and i can't afford to move out. I just sleep here. I will probably kill myself in here just to fuck with my landlord. I want to walk into traffic all the time. Or off of a building or bridge. I want to walk into the ocean and disappear. I don't have anywhere I belong or want to be. I want to give up. There's no feeling left in me except constant sadness boredom and hurt. It's been there all my life. I didn't think I'd live to 25, when I was 11 or 12 I decided I would kill myself at 24 and for some reason I'm still here. I don't know what to do.  People recognize that I am broken and I will never be human to them. If people are concerned it's always coming from a place of making themselves look better. Nobody gives a shit about you.
