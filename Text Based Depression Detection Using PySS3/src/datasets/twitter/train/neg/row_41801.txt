About ready to end my suffering.I posted about five days ago. Clearly, I didn't go through with killing myself. Right now, though, it seems like it's the only option. My grandpa is dying and my mom is forcing me to go to his funeral. I don't really want to because it would just be way to hard on me. My dad was totally okay with me not going to the funeral but my mom, of course, wants me to suffer even more than I already am. It's bad enough that I didn't apply for very many scholarships for college because I was stuffed in special ed rooms my whole life (most of them had shitty teachers). And I owe a bunch of money for missed appointments with my counselor. I'm dealing with maladaptive daydreaming as well, which I'm using as a coping mechanism right now. I'm worried about the FCC repealing net neutrality even though my dad assures me that we won't end up losing our internet because of high costs. I'm tired of the bigotry in the world right now. I'm bisexual and I want to date but I'm scared to because in my state, a bisexual/lesbian girl was missing for two weeks until they found her dead. 

Why do I bother trying anymore? Also, I can't tell my parents because they'll call the police if I tell them I'm suicidal. I can't go to the hospital because my family can't afford it. I'm stuck.
