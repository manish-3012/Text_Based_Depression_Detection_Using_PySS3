New to this group and feel lost and hopelessI feel like Iâ€™m trapped in a box and no matter what I do action or inaction nothing is right.  Iâ€™m just so exhausted by it all and nothing seems to give me any sort of pleasure or joy anymore.  I just want to give in to the thoughts and go.  I donâ€™t know what to do though every episode of the thoughts seems to get stronger and stronger.
