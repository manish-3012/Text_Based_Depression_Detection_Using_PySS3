Suicide &amp; Natural DeathWhy is suicide is frowned upon on but natural deaths by accidents or dying in your sleep is okay? After all, the end results are the same right? As in being dead? In my opinion, I've never thought people who killed themselves as selfish because they did what they wanted the most. Brave too. How is it different in the eyes of society?
