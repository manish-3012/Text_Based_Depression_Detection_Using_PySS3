I donâ€™t know how long I can keep doing this.Every day lately Iâ€™ve just felt so hopeless. I just sleep and go to work. And when Iâ€™m at work I feel like I canâ€™t breathe. I just think about ways I could hurt myself or take my life. And I want to scream and tell everyone how Iâ€™m feeling. But I donâ€™t want to put my emotional pain onto them. It feels unfair to do that. Iâ€™ve just been getting high all the time wishing I had something even stronger. I had a whole life and was going well and then the relationship went south. Moved states back home, lost my previous job, I just lost all my progress. And I feel so fucking alone all the time now. I donâ€™t feel like Iâ€™m a priority for anyone. I feel like an afterthought. Deep down I donâ€™t want to die, I just want relief. I want these thoughts and this pain to stop. I canâ€™t handle it anymore. Im just waiting for the day that the thoughts get too big to push down. I just hate myself and who Iâ€™ve become. I canâ€™t afford therapy or a hospital stay really. And that puts all the burden on my family. I just need help so badly. I just donâ€™t want to keep existing. Iâ€™m a broken mess. I started cutting for the first time since middle school/high school again (Iâ€™m in my mid twenties). I just dont know what to do anymore.
