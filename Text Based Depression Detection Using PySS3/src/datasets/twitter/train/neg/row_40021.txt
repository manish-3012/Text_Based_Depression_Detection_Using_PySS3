I ran out of time, but something is telling me not to die alone.My grandmother (Dad) passed away 2 years ago, I resent so much about it. My other grandmother has 2 months to live, but I can't bear to see my family.

I wish I could be worth something, but I can't find the time. My legs hurt from working so much, my mind is always tired. I tried to end it once, but I couldn't muster up the willpower. Something is telling me to not die yet, and it hurts so much.
