I am incredibly privileged and still want to die, I do not understand my mind, very stupid reasons RANTI am a senior chemical engineering major and all I have ever wanted was to work in research. I have worked in the same lab for 4 years and have a 3.64 GPA, I am also doing a one year Master's program next year. My brother is a electrical engineer and got into Georgia Tech for his PhD last year and he had a 4.0 GPA as a undergrad. I kept telling myself this was my semester to get straight As so I will look good for PhD programs (which I am applying to Fall 2021), but it ends up I am getting mostly Bs. I don't know why getting straights As is so important to me but all my college career I keep getting Bs and I just feel like I will never amount to what my brother is. I am in the process of purchasing a gun and will shoot myself soon. I was in a ward only a couple weeks ago after I jumped out of my window and all they kept telling me was that I was so smart and had so much to live for, but these thoughts are still there that I keep ruining my life by getting these Bs semester after semester after semester after semester. I am so tired, all I want to do is sleep all day and this will allow this to happen, I will not have to worry about the future anymore.
