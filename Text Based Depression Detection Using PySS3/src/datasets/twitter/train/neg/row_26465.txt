Leaving the theatre."Life is like a movie, if you've sat through more than half of it and itâ€™s sucked every second so far, it probably isn't going to get great right at the end and make it all worthwhile. No one should blame you for walking out early."

    

 Thirty-one. No family left or friends to speak of. I don't get enjoyment from anything. I've never had a passion for anything. I'm either a financial or emotional burden on everyone I know. I have a nitrogen tank at the ready to usher me into the void. I'm a 30yr old man-child that raised myself. I have no skills. No purpose.   
 Anyone see a reason to stick around?
