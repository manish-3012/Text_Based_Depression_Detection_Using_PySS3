Tried to end it all yesterday and I'm too afraid to tell anyone.I realize now that I need to get actual help. I know it was stupid and I know there were other options but I'm too afraid to talk this with anyone else. My family is emotionally abusive and put up a facade with my friends so it doesn't feel right to tell them. I have a therapist, and it seems pretty pathetic to tell them that. Ever since, I just felt disoriented and lost.
