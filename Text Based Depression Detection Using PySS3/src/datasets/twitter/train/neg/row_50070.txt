Iâ€™m so depressed I just want my pain to endIâ€™ve been suicidal for so long I donâ€™t know what it feels like to experience any sort of happiness. I feel like Iâ€™m being suffocated over and over except I just wonâ€™t die. Iâ€™m 21 now and Iâ€™ve wanted to die consistently since I was 17, I know people keep saying it passes but it doesnâ€™t. I donâ€™t want to hear one more person tell me it gets better. Iâ€™ve attempted twice, once by trying to cut a artery and the other an overdose. Obviously they werenâ€™t successful. I want this pain to be over, my parents are going away for the weekend and I just want to end my pain peacefully.
