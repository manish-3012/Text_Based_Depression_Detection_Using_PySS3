I'm going to kill myself before I turn 20I'm going to kill myself before I turn 20 on June 5th. I just can't be alive anymore, just can't. Tired of being lonely due to being introverted and socially anxious. Tired of waking up everyday at 5 a.m. to go to my shitty dead end office job that I get treated like shit. Tired of going to a garbage university with garbage people that I pay a lot of money for it. Tired of getting home at midnight, and going straight to bed, and repeating that everyday for the rest of my life. Tired of living in a garbage third world country where everything just gets worse. Tired of living in this world with terrible and awful humans. I'm just so tired of everything.

People always say it gets better, they've been saying that for years, and it never does. And I'm tired of waiting. I'm either going to throw myself in front of a train or buy a gun from a local drug dealer (since guns are pretty much illegal in ny country).

I just had to get this shit out of my chest since I have no one to talk to that cares about me enough to go through all the trouble. Thanks for not reading and I'm not sorry about my bad english. Bye.
