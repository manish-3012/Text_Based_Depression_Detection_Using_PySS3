I cant get get over itWhen i was 12 some teenagers bet me up and stole my nikes that i had got for christmas. I got  bullied at school and at home decause of this. Apparently it was all my fault. After that i reached the conclusion that i was not as deserving of being alive as other people. This is just one of the things in my life that im supposed to "get over" like a normal person. I cant. At this stage in my life i think the best option is to kill myself.
