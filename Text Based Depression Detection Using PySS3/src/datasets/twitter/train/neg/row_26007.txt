Just lost the last of my friends, and my gran's dyingI just lost the last few of my friends to my own stupid fucking decisions. 

I snuck up behind one of my ex-friends while she was having an intimate conversation (I didn't fucking know) and scared her with a "boo". She chased me half way across campus and threatened to slit my throat in front of my other ex-friends. I called her a psychopath and the others had to hold her back to keep her from attacking me. I wasn't eavesdropping or anything, but I was accused of doing so. I had just gotten in another fight with a really immature kid in the group who keeps overusing and ruining jokes, and he's really fucking annoying, so I thought that's what the conversation between them was about. The argument hadn't resolved yet so I thought they were talking about the argument between me and the other kid, especially since they didn't go to a private place to talk, they just stood in front of the attendance office like it was nothing. When they tried to make me apologize for eavesdropping, I didn't - because I told them that I didn't eavesdrop. They of course didn't believe me. They called me insensitive and kicked me out of the friend group. I'm glad to not be going to school (and seeing them) until Thursday, but at the same time my absence will be because me and my family are visiting my dying grandma "for one last time". 

I don't know what to do, and I just turned my left arm into prosciutto with a kitchen knife.
