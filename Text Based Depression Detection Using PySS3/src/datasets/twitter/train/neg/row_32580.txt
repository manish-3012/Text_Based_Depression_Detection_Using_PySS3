Afraid to leave my houseI am a teenager and I have no social interaction with anyone other than my parents. I haven't left my neighborhood in nearly a year I have been doing online schooling for 4 years and everyday I honestly question everything. I often don't know whats real and whats not I sometimes question whether or not Anything is real and right now I genuinely don't know whether this is being received by real people. I am sick of the torturous mind games and I really want to die and go on to the peace that awaits me.
