I have 28 dogs right nowI have 28 dogs at my house right now. Sounds like the start of a severe depression/hoarding situation right? 
The reality is 99% are fosters, and 21 of them are tiny puppies, and they are preventing me from killing myself. My reasoning is simple: if I died today, no one would be able to feed them or clean up after them today, and the rescue would be scrambling to find other fosters to take them. So I have to live until the youngest ones make it to 8 weeks and are adopted. Rinse and repeat. While I will not be taking on this many at once again because it's a lot of work and is giving me excuses to avoid self care, I can literally say they're saving my life. Fostering is a lot cheaper than therapy...
