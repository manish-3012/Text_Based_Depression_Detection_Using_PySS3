A Universal CrueltyWhy does the universe put someone in your life for you to fall in love with unexpectedly only to eventually come to the unfortunate conclusion that she will never be yours? She will never be with you even though both of you have admitted that you like each other. You get along so well together, and she is the most beautiful person you have ever met. You both have your flaws but you still tend to gravitate together. And youâ€™ve never felt this way about anybody ever. Seriously. Everâ€¦

Whatâ€™s the point? How can the universe be so cruel? I feel a pain in my throat... in my heart... throughout my entire body... an empty pain. Itâ€™s like seeing your future enclosed in a box in front of you made of unbreakable glass. You can see it and talk to it but you can never reach it.

I just want to go away. The rest of my life is so unstable and slowly falling apart. 

I love you â€œsixty-six.â€ Your green eyes and beautiful smile. My biggest regret is meeting you and allowing the universe to play its cruel joke.

Yours,
