I feel terribly lonelyEntire bus ride home tonight, I felt terribly lonely. With friends just 5 feet away from me (and my ex).

I cranked up some white noise on my headphones but couldn't drown out their laughter without hurting my ears.

I'm a worthless piece of shit still being affected by a breakup from a year ago.

It's pathetic the entire ride home I'm telling myself how much a piece of shit I am when that's exactly what you're not supposed to do

I'm driving myself insane and I hate it
