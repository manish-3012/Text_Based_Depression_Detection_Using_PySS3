Someone ik just committed suicide.I didn't know them too well but it's still upsetting. And that's the thing- why is it upsetting. Io what it's like to want to kms. I even question why anybody would want to stop suicide- it's nothing but relief.

I think it might be because he died due to suicide though, and not something else. Because I'm suicidal. Because ik it's gonna happen to me... *and hopefully soon*...

On top of that it kinda makes me not want to commit suicide due to the pain. But on the other hand it's extremely triggering at the same time- more triggering than out would be for most because almost nothing can trigger me.
