uhhmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm IDKSo I thought about how I was/am suicidal and all the things I've been told. and found this subreddit and everyone here gets told the same or similar things like get over it, you'll change, and something along the lines of time heals all wounds basically all non-supportive but not against you like being apathetic to your feelings. and I just want whoever who reads this I know that being told someone else having the same problem doesn't help that much and that there are plenty of edgy people out there that make it sound like nothing but it hurts so much hell I might be one those edgy people but no matter what you do somebody cares and that killing yourself just means you'll never be able to see that the most beautiful thing in the world somebody that cares or somebody might not be able to see it for themselves and you get to show them you care. and that is beautiful even if don't see it. Look I am going to be honest I myself don't know how to "get over it" or stop "being silly" which are terms my parents use to try to get me over it but I feel like that if I help somebody I help myself like Buddhist karma but without the religion the idea that helping somebody else is enough to help myself get through until I can find somebody who cares or find some one for me to care about. I know that your parents don't look like they're helping but they're doing their best and even if it doesn't help the thought that they made an attempt should help even the faintest way. and if there isn't some one out there to show you love you have time to show somebody else love and I don't know if that is going to help you but the thought of having meaning even if I don't believe it helps a little. Man I am seriously self doubting if this is helping anybody and I am seriously doubting it is helping me but I want somebody out there to get help from this or look for help because of me even if I don't know it I can at least dream. fuck I might be selfish I am so scared that somebody hurts themselves because of me which isn't too far off from why I am here but I desperately want to believe in my own personal redemption even if people still think of me as annoying, an asshole, some dick, and the kid from UP.

Man I am not even sure I should post this I am going to do it anyways because IDK
