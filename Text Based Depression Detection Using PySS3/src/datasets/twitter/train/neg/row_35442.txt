Almost 150,000 members and SO little interaction.I just briefly went down the recent posts and ALL of them have so few upvotes or comments. 

I have a plan. Just ordered a shotgun. Itâ€™s on its way. Thank you 2nd Amendment. I donâ€™t have to gamble. Goddamn sure thing.  No family. No friends. Had a good job, lost it, in my opinion, unfairly.  Since my mom, my life, died almost 9 years ago, this has been an inevitability.  Iâ€™ve just been waiting for all the tangential relationships to die off. That has happened. 

My ONLY regret is that Iâ€™ll miss that new Tool album on August 30th. Been waiting a long time. I almost made it.  But destiny calls. We should try to help each other more.  Or maybe not. I have NO ONE who knows me who will notice my death. Isolated. Lonely. Full of regret. Depression. GAD. SAD. BPD. Fear, sadness and anger. No. Way. To. Live. This is for the best. But if you still have people that care, keep going.  You never know.  I, unfortunately, unquestionably, do not. There are worse things than death.
