I don't know what to do anymore.I just need help. I have no one to talk to. I feel like I drove all my friends away throughout the years and am now stuck with noone. I have my boyfriend but I think even he is tired of hearing about how much I want to kill myself and dealing with my constant mood swings. It's just exhausting living and feeling sad and angry so intensely over the stupidest shit and it's like a hole I can't dig myself out of. I cut tonight for the first time since middle school. i feel like a failure because I can't even gather the energy to get out of bed and go to class and do my homework or anything. Everything just seems pointless, and giving it all up sounds so easy. I want it. I don't think I'll ever be desperate enough to do it, but I think about it all the time. I need help.
