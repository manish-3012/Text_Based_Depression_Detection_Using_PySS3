My noteTo everyone that I am leaving behind, I'm sorry. Mama and papa, I love you please don't blame yourselves. [redacted], I know I promised I wouldn't die, that I wouldn't kill myself, but please, try to understand the pain I feel. I apologize to all those I have hurt, but I know you are all stronger than me, and I know you can make it through this. 

Every day for the past year has been painful. I can't remember a single day that I haven't failed somehow. My entire life is a series of failures and mistakes, everyday the same mistakes, the same failures. Over and over I've tried to make friends. I've tried to open up, only to end up hurting myself more. This isn't a life I can live. I've tried so hard to put up with it. But as I look forward, I see nothing. The only end to the pain I see is death. Don't get me wrong, this isn't easy. I love you mama, papa, [redacted], [redacted], [redacted]. 

Be stronger than I was.
