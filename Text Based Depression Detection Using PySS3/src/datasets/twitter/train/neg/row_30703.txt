This was my last chanceI have tried as hard as I can, but I just can't do anything right. Another chance at a career down the drain, and with it, my life. I'm tired of trying so hard and failing at everything I put my heart and soul into. I'm done trying after this. I'm not going backwards again. I'm sick of struggling at everything. I'm sick of being a failure in life. I'm done.
