Nobody did anything to me.Iâ€™ve spent years trying to track down what exactly my â€œtraumaâ€ is. I wanted to know what caused me to be like this, so I could validate myself. Recently, Iâ€™ve come to a conclusion:

Nothing happened. I have no reason to be the sad fuck I am. Iâ€™ve lived a picket fence life so far with more than enough, two parents who care as much as they know how to, and a good education. 

My mom called me emotionally abusive. Worse than her bastard father. My sister was shocked and in tears when she heard it, she couldnâ€™t believe my mom would say that considering just how bad her father was. That validated everything I thought about myself for the years leading up to it. In that moment all I could say was â€œI know.â€ 

I constantly feel guilty for existing. I feel bad that people have to look at me, talk to me, breathe the same air. I feel guilty for wasting peopleâ€™s time, and energy. I feel guilty for wasting the ink in my pen that couldâ€™ve been used by someone else to write something better. I donâ€™t deserve to fucking breathe. 

How pathetic do I sound? What a fucking spineless idiot. 

It just gets to be too much, watching every action, and replaying every conversation until my head hurts. I have to watch the way I sit, laugh, talk, and monitor how much I tell people. I have to closely watch my tone, and my body language. I have to keep track of what lie I told who. 

Itâ€™s exhausting. Iâ€™m so fucking tired of it. I canâ€™t do it anymore. I donâ€™t want to do it anymore. 

The frustration of wanting to die, but not wanting to hurt my dad has driven me to the point of taking it out on others with a cutting attitude, and quickness to anger. Itâ€™s disgusting and evil, and I hate myself for it. I try to keep myself away from them so that theyâ€™re out of the line of fire. 

I try so fucking hard, but I keep failing. 

They donâ€™t deserve my mess. I wish they could just forget me.
