CAN SOMEONE PLEASE ANSWER Iâ€™m doing it tomorrow clonazepam, Zoloft, seroquel, lamictal, Vyvanse please I want to go I need to know if this will work please Iâ€™m beggingmy plan got messed up because my dr wouldnâ€™t give me the 90 day prescription (told her I was going home and needed more because of my insurance) think she caught on only gave me a two week supply (Iâ€™m outpatient nurse admin meds) pharmacist wouldnâ€™t include the refill

Iâ€™m doing this tomorrow will pick up the prescription tomorrow and will not bring it to the nurses 

I calculated what I have 

560mg -Zoloft (never been on she prescribed it because Iâ€™m obviously done) 
1275mg-lamictal 
1400mg- seroquel
14mg - clonazepam 

Optional 560mg Vyvanse didnâ€™t wanna include it unless I have to cause donâ€™t feel like having a panic attack I want to sleep or pass out in my fucking bathtub and not come back 

Iâ€™m female 5â€™4 115 lbs I tried overdosing on lamictal before crazy stuff happened the dose I tried was way higher didnâ€™t work doubt this will work I want it to work 

ANYONE PLEASE TELL ME if this shit will work mixed please itâ€™s gonna happen I donâ€™t wanna be walking around then randomly stop feeling my legs like last time I want to fall the fuck asleep and die do I go buy vodka or something anything to go with it I have like ten dollars please Iâ€™m taking it regardless I just want it to work I think there is an interaction between Zoloft and a few of the drugs listed. Will the seroquel help me sleep? Anything

I am sure this isnâ€™t allowed to be asked but Iâ€™m planning on taking my life tomorrow as soon as I get my meds so I am not very concerned
