GF says she want to die, what can I do?We're 19. She says she's always scared and preoccupied of something and that she's tired of life and just wants to end it. I've told her that she can change her life anytime she wants if she's not feeling good with her current life. But she keeps saying 'that's the way I am and I can't change'.

Background, their fathers are authoritative fuckers, they have beaten her many times, and yells for stupid things (like leaving an empty box of something on the kitchen) are not uncommon. They have never taken her to a psychologist, she has requested it in the past.

What can I do?!

EDIT: She's currently researching in Google ways to suicide......
