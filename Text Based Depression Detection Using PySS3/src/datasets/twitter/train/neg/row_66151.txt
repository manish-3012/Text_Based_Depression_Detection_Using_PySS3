I don't know what I'm doing anymoreSo my friend texted me this today. It hit home so hard. I don't really know why I'm posting this. I feel a bit like showing off or something.
All I do is mostly work, to have my mind occupied. Whenever I don't, I try to think of things to do to make my siblings happy, to be sure that they will never have the need to ask themselves if anybody loves them, because they'll be sure I do. All my goals evolve around that. I don't think Ill ever be happy, as whenever I stop working or doing an activity all I can think about is death. I don't really know what to do, at times I am disgusted with myself and I think if my siblings knew what I did when they were not around they would be disgusted with me too. I really don't know anymore. I feel like I'm such an egocentric person from time to time.

Ps: I am a university student, I'm trying to complete my studies half a year earlier so I can return home, be with them and support them while the are young (my siblings) (we have a great relationship because I have spent a lot of time playing with them and teaching them things and generally being there) . (I'm studying at another part of the country, its far away, its my first year and the subject that I chose to study takes 4 years to complete). I feel like I am spending my parents money and doing nothing in return, and as much as I work it doesn't get better. They are both very proud of me but I don't know if I am going to achieve all I said I will.
