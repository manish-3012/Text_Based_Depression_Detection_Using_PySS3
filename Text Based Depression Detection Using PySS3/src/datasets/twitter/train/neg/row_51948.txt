Just hopelessI feel so empty and just angry. I donâ€™t see a point to living anymore. I donâ€™t see a point to anything. Thereâ€™s nothing in sight, no joy, nothing.

I hate being a person. I hate that we work jobs until weâ€™re infirm and old. I have been offered a job making next to peanuts. What is the point of that? Whatâ€™s the point of doing anything? Itâ€™s all fucking stupid and pointless.

I would rather get in my bed and just die than go through another day working toward nothing and hardship. Life is absolute shit and itâ€™s only good for those who play the game and delude themselves.
