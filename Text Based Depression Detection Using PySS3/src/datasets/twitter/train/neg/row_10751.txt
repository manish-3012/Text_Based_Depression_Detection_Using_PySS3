9 Year-old sonSo, about a year ago my son said he wanted to kill him himself. We got him to see a counselor and we do family counseling as well. There is depression and suicide in my wifeâ€™s family and there is depression in my family. He has signs of anxiety and depression but he seems to be thinking about it more seriously. He gets caught in this negative thought cycle and he canâ€™t seem to get out of it. 

He expects himself to be amazing at everything, the first time. He plays football and he loves it and he is good at it. (The coaching staff doesnâ€™t yell, there isnâ€™t any Friday night yikes going on here.) 

I just donâ€™t know how to help him. 

Anyone had suicidal thoughts as that young of age? 

How did you get through it?

What can I do as a parent to help?

I just donâ€™t know what to do. My heart sinks and I just want to keep him happy and safe. Please, if you have any ideas let me know.
