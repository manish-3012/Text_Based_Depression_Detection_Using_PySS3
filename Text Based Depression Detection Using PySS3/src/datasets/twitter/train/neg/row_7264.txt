I don't have doubts anymore. I give up.I found out today that I can't move out as I planned. Soon as I knew I had this sinking feeling. It was like the part me that still thought I could have a future died. Now, I am just so empty and calm. I just really wanted to be free and I will be. Not in the way I thought or hoped, but I will be. I have been wanting to do this all year but I still hoped. I think that is why I couldn't do it. I no longer have such delusions.
