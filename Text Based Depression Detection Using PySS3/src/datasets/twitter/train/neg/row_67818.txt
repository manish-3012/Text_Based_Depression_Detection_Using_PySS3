Cant do it anymoreNo one cares about me and if they do they do it out of obligation because of how pathetic i am or they just pity me I never matter even though im suffering too they just dont care or bother to pretend to I dont understand what i have to do

I cant keep being in this house with a abusive neglectful drunkard everytime i hear him screaming or his voice i want to hurt myself

Im a rightfully unlikable freak of a human

I dont belong anywhere. Theres no lasting happiness for me when i think that i found it. I never learn

I cant do this anymore. Im sorry
