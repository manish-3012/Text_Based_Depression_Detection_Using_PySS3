Tomorrow I have plans to end my life. I canâ€™t do this anymore, Iâ€™m falling to pieces.Iâ€™ve always been depressed well ever since I became a teenager. I really thought it would go away, that it was the phase us teens go through. But I guess mine wanted to be persistent, and over these draining 3 years Iâ€™ve lost who I am. Iâ€™m weak, and I cry every single day. 

Iâ€™ve been on and off with my relationship for 11 months and, well it just doesnâ€™t feel right to him and I understand that, I canâ€™t force him to stay. I have to let him go, and Iâ€™ve decided that after Iâ€™ve let him go, Iâ€™m going too. 

Everything always seems to be stacked against me, itâ€™s no ones fault but my own. I just, I get filled with hope too easily for the future and such. I really thought he wanted me, and I always thought about being in his arms and being okay, sadly Iâ€™m not the girl for him and I think that is breaking me, it feels like I cannot breathe. He was the last thing holding me together, but Im about to lose him forever... 

I managed to persuade him to stay with me tonight, before he leaves again forever.  Itâ€™s honestly destroying me I feel like I cannot breathe, 

When I wake up Iâ€™ll be without him Iâ€™ll be without my love, forever. I WANT TO FUCKING SCREAM SO LOUD, IM SO TIRED AND I CANT FUCKING DO THIS ANYMORE I FUCKING CANT OKAY? SO DONT BULLSHIT ME AND SAY IT WILL BE ALRIGHT BECAUSE IT FUCKING WONT IT NEVER EVER WILL BE. 

And no, itâ€™s not just him. Itâ€™s my whole life, tomorrow after I wake up with him gone... out of my life forever, without his love forever. Iâ€™m going to end it. 

Goodbye everyone, Iâ€™m so fucking sorry but at the same time Iâ€™m not it just is always too painful to carry on whether he is here or not. I donâ€™t want to be sad anymore...
