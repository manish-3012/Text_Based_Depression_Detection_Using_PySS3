Half brothers dad tried to commit suicideMy half brothers (B) dad(D)  tried commuting suicide. B lives with me but D lives 4 hours away. B got a text today from Ds gf saying he has tried killing himself multiple times. What should B do?

D has been on drugs for years now. And has pretty much abandoned B. They haven't talked in a year or so. But my brother wants to do something but idk how to help him. 

Any advice would be amazing.
