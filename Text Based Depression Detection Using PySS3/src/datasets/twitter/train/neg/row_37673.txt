Lowest point of my life.I've always romanticized the idea of suicide, but never considered it fully.  The past couple of days has made it seem a viable option.

Last night, after a series of nightmares, I took the strap from my Eno hammock and put it around my throat to see what it felt like.  Yeah, it hurts, but that's the nature of the beast right?

Logically, I know that I'm a slave to the negative chemicals in my brain...but just knowing that reality doesn't help my rationalization process.
