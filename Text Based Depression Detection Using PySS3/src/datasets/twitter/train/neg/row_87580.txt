Here are two good reasons not to kill yourself:Because if you survive attempts (and even the powerful feelings/fantasies/plans), you are better equipped to help others. By far, most people who kill themselves are good souls, sensitive people, empathic. Their depression might bring out responses that make them not value this inner goodness (e.g. apathy that decays into nihilism, defensiveness, anger, even aggression), but the good decent core is still there. If there's less of you/us out there in the world, then the world misses out on that; that's a huge loss to the universe. Don't let the bad/cold/indifferent guys win.
I'm sure I would care about you and even love you and see the good and wonderful within you even if you don't love yourself. Unfortunately here in the metaverse there is no way I can reach out and hug you there in that dark existential corner you've dwelt in too often / too long.
Postscript: I successfully talked three friends out of suicide in the last 14 mos. In each case, they trusted me because I've survived four major attempts (overdoses and one carbon monoxide). Learning how to forgive yourself and not sabotaging yourself with self-hatred/loathing is vital to fighting off those suicidal feelings/thoughts.
Love, meg
