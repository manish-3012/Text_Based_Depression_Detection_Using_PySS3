I want to die, but i still love cooking and baking for others, my only joy left in life.My mind is racing with thoughts of how to off myself. Didnt ask to be born, never cared much about life for a long time, the only joy I get these days is baking and cooking nice meals for my boyfriend's family.

Would love to just hang myself somewhere in the woods, i would just say goodbye and pretend to go on a trip somewhere since my visitor visa here ends soon, my fears are that My body is discovered too soon, or conplications like sending my worthless corpse back to my homecountry will just cost too much money and I would continue to be a financial burden to others even after death.

Best case senario to make it easy for everyone here is to break up with my boyfriend in the next few days, fly back to my home country and die there.
