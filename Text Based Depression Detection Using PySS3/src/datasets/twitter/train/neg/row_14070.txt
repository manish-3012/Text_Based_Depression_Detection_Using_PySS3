this is itI have posted in this subreddit many times before, however I thought I got better. Now all of a sudden I've been hit with a series of bad events and I cannot do it anymore. My parents have been fighting off and on for the past year and a half and today was the final straw. My mom packed her stuff up and left. She withdrew money from everyone's bank account and spent it on alcohol and a hotel. So now as I'm typing this, my father is -$84 in debt. Everyone is calling him calling him a wife beater and saying they are going to beat his ass. If there is one thing I can tell you. It's that my father IS NOT abusive. My whole life this man has given me and my family everything we wanted. My mom got a brand new Lincoln 7 months ago and I got a brand new Samsung S9 . He did it because he loved us. I'm just rambling now. Right now I have no where to go. My boyfriend broke up with me and my siblings live in California. This is it for me. I cant do this anymore.
