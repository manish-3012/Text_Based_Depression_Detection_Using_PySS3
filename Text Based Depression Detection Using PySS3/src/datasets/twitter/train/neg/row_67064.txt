Does anyone else get so close to just ending it all but suddenly remember they're afraid of pain?At least once a day I somehow reach a point where I'm so close to grabbing the nearest sharp object and stabbing myself or slitting my wrists with it, hell evem breaking the glass off my picture frames but I'm a fucking pussy and just can't bring myself to bear the pain. I just want to die a peaceful death in my sleep and leave this shitty fucking world but I can't, I'm trapped and become a part of this soulless system....
