I'm so doneWell, this is where I've come to. After years of shitting on Reddit, here I am again. Full disclosure, I'm only 16 and a senioir in highschool, but whatever. I have nobody to turn to rn. So, here we go.

I've attempted suicide 47 times? I think? It's gotten to the point where even I can't remember. I've used weed, and almost every time it's been a fake dab cart, leading me to trip balls on DMT for hours. I can't remember the last time I was happy.

But that's not true. I can. It was with my ex. And sure, everyone tells me to ignore them, but that's hard when I fall in love incredibly quickly, with this one at literal first meeting. I've been at such a loss since we dated multiple times, each time to no avail. I keep finding myself in worse and worse positions. I just want to sleep and never wake up, bc I'm simply too much of a pussy to actually kill myself.

But that doesn't mean that I won't do something dumb. I keep confessing my feelings to this ex of mine, and they just ignore me. They see me and looks the other way, even turning around at times to avoid me. And that hurts; I'm literally in love with this person, and cannot get them out of my head. I don't expect anything to change, but in my disoriented state of sadness and overwhelming fear of dying alone, I find myself wanting them to just come back. I don't know what I expect to get from this, but any sort of comment will likely be welcome. I just don't have anyone to turn to, nobody to love, and nobody to love me. So I guess what I'm saying is this - I might not come back to this post. I just want this all to go away without feeling any pain. I simply want to feel less of this bullshit. Anyone here got any advice, cool. I might need this shit.
