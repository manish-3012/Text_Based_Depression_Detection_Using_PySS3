I want to dieNow some may think this is a joke but itâ€™s not. Iâ€™m serious. I think this may be my way of reaching out but I donâ€™t think anyone will care or even respond. I want to kill myself. I want to die. I donâ€™t want to hurt anymore. I donâ€™t want to be a disappointment anymore. I donâ€™t want to feel alone. Shit I have this friend who is a girl. My best friend if any. The only person that understands me. I think I might be in love with her. But sheâ€™s in a happy relationship and Iâ€™ve finally realized that sheâ€™ll never see me how I see her. She is my only reason for living at this point. But I donâ€™t want to burden her with the trash I am. Iâ€™ve almost decided how Iâ€™m gonna do it to. I just wanted to get this out there and vent. Iâ€™ve thought about this many times. There are more factors to this then my love life btw. Idk hell im only 16 years old. But I hate this world that we live in so much already. I wonâ€™t be missed I believe. I need ideas on what I should put in my letters. I love my family and almost everyone in my life, but I canâ€™t take this anymore
