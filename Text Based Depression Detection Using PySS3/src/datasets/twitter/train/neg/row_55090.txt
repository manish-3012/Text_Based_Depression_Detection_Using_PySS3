Tonight is the nightI am going to hang out with a friend today play some pickup basketball games one of my favorite things to do but when it turns to 2 am I will take some pills and take a knife to my heart. I relate some lyrics from a song by XXXTentacion called Jocelyn Flores and the lyrics right here "I'm in pain wanna put ten shots in my brain" If I had a gun I would have done it a long time ago but a knife and some pills will do. Things were looking up for me starting college soon but I withdrew cause I know what my plan is 19 years of nothing. I hope everyone forgets me I do not want a funeral just bury me six feet deep and I will be fine.
