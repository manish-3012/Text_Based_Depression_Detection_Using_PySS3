Sick of my Pakistani ParentsI (F18) come from a very conservative Pakistani family and Im sick of the way that the culture is. I literally am tired of it all the controlling part of it, the narcissism, sexism, the rules, traditions, customs. My mom is never supportive, the only reason I get to go to school is because it would look good on my "marriage resume." I did want to go to law school, but now I dont want to follow any of dreams. Im only allowed to go far I have to stay at home and commute if I want to go to school but most of the good law schools require me to stay over there so ive given up on it.  I have a boyfriend and I love him but I want to break up with him to save him from the all the negativity I bring. I feel like im weighing him down. Im sick of my parents but I also dont want to hurt them and i dont see a solution or a light at the end of the tunnel. I genuinely want to swallow a whole bottle of pills but I dont think I have the courage to.
