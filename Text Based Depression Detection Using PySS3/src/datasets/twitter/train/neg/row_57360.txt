I put a loaded gun to my headHello 
I don't really know how to do this but I don't have anyone else to talk to about this. I'm sorry if this isn't the place to put this I've never done this before. I'm 22 and last night I put a gun to my head. It feels like recently my life has just been headed downhill and no matter how hard I try I can't stop the landslide. Everything seems to pile on at once and I really try my best to deal with it but some days it's just too much. Last night was bad. A bunch of things had happened and when I got home and made it to bed I finally took the fake smile off and everything hit me all at once. I lost it. I broke down. I was so overwhelmed and sad all I wanted was for it to stop. I reached over to my nightstand, grabbed my handgun, cocked the hammer, and shoved the muzzle against my temple... I started crying. I sat there in tears for a while. Telling myself to do it. There's no point for me to be here any longer. I've never been good enough for anyone so what's the point of being here. I just sat there for what felt like forever. It took me a while to collect myself and calm down. I really think I need help but I'm lost and I don't know where to go. I'm scared that if things continue to get worse eventually I will take my own life. I don't want that...
