Why live, Why loveIf this is truly it, if our imminent demise is just over the horizon, why live life.

Some of us aren't able to feed themselves because of a fucked up society.

Some of us are torn down by society's entangled chains.

Some of us are broken and hurt so badly, that the everlasting void of death seems more comforting than fixing ourselves, because we see ourselves as beyond repair.

Some of us see ourselves as so putrid and vile that even the thought of even sharing moments with a significant others sounds outlandish and impossible.

The mistakes and greed of the older generation will be all of our deaths, so why bother in living..

To try and capture a false sense of hope?

Of love?

Of happiness?

Of comfort?

Its useless, completely pointless.

But why do we do it?

Why are we bound by what our minds tell us...

-ironic...



I just wish someone would tell me it's ok..

Its going to be alright....

I wish someone could comfort me with a warm embrace....

And calm me down...

And stop me from using that knife.... please..
