Tonight, I'm finally going through with killing myself. AMA.Hi.

I'm sick and tired of it all.

The usual suspects: 

* I'm a 22 year old straight male from western Europe. No money problems. No girlfriend, a few FWBs.
* There are medical reasons for my suicide, but I won't clarify them because I know some people I know read reddit, and the last thing I need is for one of you fuckers to "save" me. 
* I've had concrete suicidal thoughts for at least three years. Pretty much permanently depressed for as long as I can remember.
* Yes, I sought help. First my regular doctor, then a psychiatrist. Attended for half a year. Kept describing someone else's problems to me.
* Yes, I've tried contacting a hotline. They were busy. Great. Doesn't really matter, since I wasn't planning on letting them change my mind. I've had three years of this shit already, I don't need any more.
* I realize I will leave people behind that will be hurt my by actions. Tough shit. There's a few people of which I *hope* what I'm going to do will fuck them up.
* My preferred method changed from drug cocktail to shooting to hanging. Shooting isn't an option because acquiring a gun here is ridiculously hard. Hanging is preferred to a drug cocktail, because it's more disturbing to the people most likely to find me. Hanging is done from an attic window. I have an old bed as a counterweight. Rope, with noose, is prepared. Suitable length for my height and weight computed. It's at least as good as I can get it given the information I could find.

I'm sick and tired of people telling me crap like "chemical imbalance" and "irrational decision". Fuck you. Life consists of good things and bad things, and the good doesn't even come close to outweighing the bad for me. I don't care that there's some girl I'm going to meet, or some incredibly rewarding activity I'm going to miss out on. It's all pointless hedonism. None of it is permanent. We're specks of dust. We get born, go through a load of crap, and die. I want to skip the load of crap part.

I'm sick and tired of random people telling me they "love" me, when they ostensibly haven't met me and have no clue what I'm like.

Other than that, AMA. ~~Limited time offer.~~

EDIT: Goodbye.
