Anything I'm missing?I've been getting ready for a few months now to make everything as least painful as possible for everybody and everything on my list seems to be taken care of, anything I'm missing?  
I've got my finances all in order (no debt)  
No person or animal is dependent on me

* I've said what I need to say to people and worked out any problems that we may have had
* I've trained my replacement at work
* I've set up how I want to be remembered, etc
* I left my SO and let the dust settle on that  


anything that i missed? I don't think I wanna leave any sort of note, I'm afraid people will blame each other if i do.
