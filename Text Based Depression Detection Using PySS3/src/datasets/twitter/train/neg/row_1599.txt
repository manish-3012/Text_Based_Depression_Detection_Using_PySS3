[SERIOUS]Please talk to me... I'm barely competent but I'm struggling with my friend who is the one who just attempted suicide...So a few days ago I had to rush to my friends house that called me to help my friend who was so incoherent that even once I arrived a 1/2 hour later (should have taken me 45 minutes but I was doing 90mph in a 45mph zone) I still had to pull him out of bed, slap the shit out of him to make him barely coherent and spent the next 2-3 days with him to make sure when I turned my back he wouldn't be gone... I've contacted all of the friends that he's purposely ostracized himself from, He has a doctor's appointment to go see a medical professional... but I'm pretty sure that's not going to be enough... what if anything can I do to help.... I held him in my arms for an hour, and slapped the shit out of one of my best friends... and before you say call a hospital... we're in the USA and this would be a $5-10k price tag... which would not encourage him to no longer be there... he believes it would be simpler to just remove himself from the situation... I think the worst part is I'm not in much a better position myself... but I can do for others where I feel crippled to do for myself... suggestions and please, if I don't respond individually just assume I've tried that or I'm going to... I'm now running on almost 4 days awake with micro-sleeps and I think I might actually be able to manage 5-6 hours tonight because someone else is watching him...
