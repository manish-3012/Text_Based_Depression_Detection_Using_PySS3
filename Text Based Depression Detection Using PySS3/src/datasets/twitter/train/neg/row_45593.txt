Iâ€™m such a loserIâ€™ve been trying to find a girlfriend for so long and I canâ€™t do anything to stay out of the friend zone. Iâ€™m just so freaking lonely that it physically pains me and makes me want to take every pill in my cabinet. The only person who I think cares about me is my mother, and if thatâ€™s not sad I donâ€™t know what is. Iâ€™m paranoid everyone just tolerates me and doesnâ€™t actually appreciate me being around. Itâ€™s more of a gut feeling. 

I work in a Walmart pharmacy as a cashier and let me tell you, working a ten hour shift and customers blaming me for every single minuscule issue they may have brings me to my absolute limit. Everyday I come home and try to relax but I just canâ€™t shove all of the hateful faces out of my head. Iâ€™m so anxious all of the time that I canâ€™t hardly function as a normal person. I have OCD where I feel like I canâ€™t be happy if I have work the next day. (OCD like I think about the issue, stress about the issue, â€œrewardedâ€ by constantly thinking about work, like an endless loop) 

Ive graduated high school last year and I thought I would reach out to my old friends to see if they could maybe help me, but they treated me like they had never met me before.. it just hurts.. I donâ€™t have a reason to stay here on earth, but Iâ€™m so very afraid of whatâ€™s on the other side. Constantly think about steering my truck into a ditch on the interstate.
