accepting my fatei have been thinking of suicide for weeks on end uncontrollably. the thoughts wonâ€™t shake. i think iâ€™m starting to accept my fate, that suicide is my destiny. everyone has a purpose for their life ending that is written into destiny.... mine may just be suicide. iâ€™ve been struggling with depression since before highschool and i think that the universe just wants me to end my life and the depression is the universe giving me signs to die. iâ€™ve been manifesting a sign from the universe that i should stay but nothing has come up, life is only getting worse. iâ€™ve been looking for signs i should stay for weeks. i think it means life wonâ€™t get any better and i should go. i just got out of inpatient (not for an attempt) so iâ€™m going to wait a little before i go i think. i feel like death is literally calling me. itâ€™s scary cuz i donâ€™t know what to expect when iâ€™m dead. is it gonna be just dark loneliness? peace? hell? heaven? what the fuck is it. these thoughts have been scaring me. i just want to have the desire for life again. iâ€™m just so upset i really want to live but the pain is so much. everyday. even if i do go to inpatient again i donâ€™t think the thoughts will disappear. they might for a bit but iâ€™ll come back to the same cycle again.
