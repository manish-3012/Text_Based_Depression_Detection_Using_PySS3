I hate myselfI posted on /R/relationships a few days ago about how my wife cheated. 

I get why she did it. I am weak willed and a fucking emotional disaster.  I can't get anyone to give a damn about me. No one cares about my thoughts or feelings. I am worth less.  I hope one day I will get the courage to end this bullshit.  I am tired of letting everyone down with my worthlessness.
