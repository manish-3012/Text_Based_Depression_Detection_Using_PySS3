Double suicide attemptMe and my fiance did a double suicide attempt by overdosing on fentanyl, a drug thats 50x more deadly than heroin. Before we did the suicide, I had written a goodbye note on my Tumblr, thinking that it would be fine because ppl on Tumblr are supposed to have no way of finding a users fb account. We only survived thanks (or no thanks) to this girl on Tumblr who managed to find my Facebook!! I contacted her to tell her that she saved me, but I have yet to thank her... No idea how she found my fb!! I've asked and she said she forgot. So she contacted my sister, who called the cops who traced my fone, and found us 45 minutes away in a hotel.

My fiance had puked up most of the drug so he was in MUCH better shape than me. I was put on life support and doctors urged my mom to pull my plug, telling her that even if I got out of my coma, I'd never be able to walk again and I'd be in a permanent vegetative state. My fiance didn't have to go on life support, and he was only in rehab for 1 month. I was in rehab for 11 months (where I tried killing myself on multiple occasions because I missed my fiance so much) and, despite supposedly going to be in a permanent vegetative state, ironically I was let out (even though I still couldn't walk well) because they felt that cognitively, I was outstanding!

As of now, I've been out of rehab for less than 2 months and already I've seriously considered suicide again, even more so than when I was in rehab bc now I have more tools to get the job done. I think because the suicide was my idea, (no I did NOT tell him to do it with me!!! I actually told him not to but he kept saying he couldn't live without me) my fiances family doesn't want us together in person (&amp; a lot don't want us together at all) so since the fentanyl, we've only seen each other once when he snuck over. He's changed a lot. He's always been a mommas boy, but now he's tripled it. Its been making me feel like he doesn't care about me as much as he used to.

Before all this we were living together. From the time we dated to the suicide attempt, we'd lived together longer than living apart, so it's been a huge pain in my heart to be away from him. The thing that's frustrated me the most is that he could be living with me right now, and the only reason he's not is because "my mom won't let me." Like, ok GROW THE FUCK UP !!!!! he's 21! He should be able to move out whenever he goddamn well pleases!!!!! So all that with him is why I wanted to try killing myself (for good this time) again.

But there is a silver lining! So he's been wanting to get paid to watch me but his mom's been saying no, that she needs to have a meeting with my mom first, to build a bond with her future family member. Well after I yelled at him recently over text n called him a coward and said I shuldnt have to live like this and that I was "so done", he said he thought long n hard about it and if his mom has the meeting with my mom and he's still not allowed to watch me, he sed "I'll just come over anyway. I'll tell my mom that I'm not going home. I won't tell her where I am." Ofc he sed, "not tht I'm not going home for good obviously." Which means he's planning to spend only a few hours at my house.. that makes me kinda want to wring his neck. Lol. Like, dude, you can literally stay at home with me and my family like before!!!! My mom and sister like him, my dad's dead and my brother is in the marines, so literally he'd be cool here! I'm really hoping that he can just move in the way he did before... Lots of sleepovers until one day he just decides not to go back home lol.. His mom was saying she wants to look for a multi-family house for us though. We'd live upstairs and his mom and little brother (who practically hates me now), wuld live downstairs. Idk when that would happen though, because his mom is super low on cash atm.

If I could just be with him again like before, I'd be so happy. I'm going back to school asap so I'd get to see him every day and do work studies to make money again!! Then I could try to get my own place and invite him to come live with me. Hopefully by then he's already living with me???? But once we live together, I'll be the happiest I've ever been in my entire life!!

I've realized that before, I needed anti-depressants but I was too ashamed to tell anyone how depressed I was, and then it got to the point where I stopped thinking a drug could help me. But now that everyone knows, I'm not afraid to tell my mom, "Get me a psychiatrist." We were at the doctors when I said that, and I could tell she was hesitant/ashamed to even ask. But she did and so I'm going in for my first official psych visit in October!

My future looks bright with my fiance by my side. Would I still prefer to have died? Of course!! And I hope to help change laws that would make it illegal to put suicide attempt victims on life support. Hopefully one day in the future I could actually genuinely thank that Tumblr girl for saving our lives. Today is not that day though.
