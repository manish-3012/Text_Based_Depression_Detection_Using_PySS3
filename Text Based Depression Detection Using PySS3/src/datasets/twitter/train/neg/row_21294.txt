Talking to others casually is a great way to remind yourself how worthless you are"What do you do for a living?" - Sit on my ass all day drinking and smoking weed to forget and dissociate

"Youre a really nice person" - No I'm a worthless piece of shit that does nothing all day and keeps running away from their problems and trying to kill themselves or distract themselves from not doing that.
