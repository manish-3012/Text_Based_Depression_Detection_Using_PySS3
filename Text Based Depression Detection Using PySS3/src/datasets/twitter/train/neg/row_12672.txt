I wrote I poetry hope you guys read it and like itYou are stuck in my head
Day and night
I canâ€™t get you out of my mind
I cry my self asleep every night 
You are the only reason Iâ€™m thinking of suicide
I will never heal
I will never never change the way I feel 
Until I leave this fucking face
Sometimes I wonder if I killed my self would you ever miss me
Cause the only reason thatâ€™s making me wanna die is my love for you
I still have feelings for you
I will always do
I will never forget about you 
How can I even forget you 
You are special
You are my first love 
You are the one who taught me 
How to love 
And showed me what love feels like
I can never let you go
Cause I still have hope
It hurts feeling unwanted 
By the person you want the most
By the person you cry for everynight
I canâ€™t give you up itâ€™s hard  
Because youâ€™re everything I want
Everything I need
I need you to the point I wish I never met you
I try hard to forget you
But losing you is like losing a blessing
Life sucks hasnâ€™t been the same since you left me
I never thought that the boy I love would become my ex
I would give up anything for you
I cried over you too many times 
I have no idea why but I do
Itâ€™s not like you actually care 
But itâ€™s because I love you
And you donâ€™t know how much I do
I know Iâ€™m waiting for the impossible 
To happen but I just canâ€™t stop
Sometimes I try to avoid talking to you 
Because every time I do 
I get too attached and then 
I realize I can never have you
I feel like my life is crashing  down
And my mind is attacking me
The bad voices in my head are growing stronger 
Iâ€™m screaming for help
But no one can hear me
I say Iâ€™m fine but fine is just a word
Itâ€™s not the way I truly feel
I canâ€™t take it anymore 
Itâ€™s so hard knowing that itâ€™s all my fault 
Iâ€™m feeling so cold the pain is slow
And I canâ€™t deal with this pain
Iâ€™m not a fighter 
The days are dark when you are not around 
Iâ€™m finding it hard to breath
Loving you is suicide 
Iâ€™m trying hard to stay alive
When I heard you say you love me
Is the part I will never forget
And I wish you could come and save me
How can this be possible 
Iâ€™m loving you  even tho you are not here and youâ€™re not mine
I feel like Iâ€™m drowning when I talk to you
You never notice that youâ€™re killing me
You never realize that Iâ€™m dying 
I love you more than anyone could ever imagine 
I need you more than I need my own breath
I miss you so much it hurts 
Iâ€™m broken
and no one can fix me
BUT YOUðŸ’›ðŸ‘‘
