I'm sixteen, my bf dumped me in front of everyone, and my parents are on my caseI cut myself earlier with pair of scissors. Nothing too deep this time. I'm just losing it and I can't call my friends because they all hate me.

My grades have been getting worse and worse and quit after school activities because I've been getting huge and just want to stay home. I eat all the time now and i can't even control myself. It's like three twinkies before class and then whatever is served when I get home, which is usually deep fried crap.

I stopped seeing my councilor about a month ago cause she wasn't helping much. We'd just talk about the same things over and over. I just feel lost now and I have no idea who to turn to or what to do.

I think about cutting myself all the time, or maybe even using a belt and hanging myself. Fuck my life.
