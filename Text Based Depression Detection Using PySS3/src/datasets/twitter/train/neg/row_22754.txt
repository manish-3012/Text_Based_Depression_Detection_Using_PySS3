Day 8 from my bedI feel crushed by existing.

I feel existentially confused and I can't get out of bed. Then I go to my chair in my living room, then back again.

Each night is filled with different dreams of my ex from 10 years ago and it's so convincingly real. I also have dreams of child-care, one of several jobs I've had where I care for others.

I wonder constantly if I should just die. I have thoughts about my future life for better or worse and I just don't really feel like it matters.

I'm a very positive person but I just don't feel like anything matters.

I'm by no means rich. I'm one misstep from homeless and I don't honestly care.
