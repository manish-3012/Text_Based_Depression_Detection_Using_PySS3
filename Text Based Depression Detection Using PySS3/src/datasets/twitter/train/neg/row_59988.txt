On my way to jump off a bridgeFor 2 months since I was hospitalized at the psych ward for suicidal thoughts, people told me things would get better but it did not. I feel so tired, empty. I feel sad for my mom, dad and brother, they loved me so much but I can see I'm a burden for them. I also feel sad for the little stray cat I was feeding, he loved me so much too. But I know it's the end of the line for me, nothing worked, hospital, meds, therapy.... 

I don't know why I'm writing this here, don't think anybody will read this, there's so much suffering here. I wish we all didn't have to suffer. I wish people would understand that depression is a real disease.
