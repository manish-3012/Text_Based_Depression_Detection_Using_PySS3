Have been crying for hours ptsdThis evening I tried to distract myself  from my horrible thoughts by going in a chat room. 
I was told to kill myself. I was told that I will be raped. I have ptsd and Iâ€™m freaking out. Iâ€™m so scared and more than one man was poking fun of me. Iâ€™m so scared and Iâ€™m trying so hard to hold myself together. Iâ€™ve been wailing for hours and Iâ€™ve been having flashbacks. I feel worse than dead already.
