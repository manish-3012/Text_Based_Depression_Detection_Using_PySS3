UnwantedI was reading that /r/askreddit thread about sex therapy and the thing that stood out to me was how willing people were to change for their partners. Over and over I kept reading about how people just want their partner to be happy and enjoy themselves and their enjoyment comes from seeing their partnerâ€™s pleasure. I wish I had someone like that in my life, but I donâ€™t. 

Most people around me either dislike me or simply tolerate me. Thereâ€™s no one who genuinely cares for me. No one ever asks if Iâ€™m okay. No one remembers me when theyâ€™re sending out invitations to things. I donâ€™t matter to any other person. If I died right now the only thing that might affect other people is my coworkers covering my shifts. Iâ€™ve tried to reach out and make friends or connect with my family so many times but it never works. I just end up getting hurt again. The only way I can see this pain ending is if I kill myself. I plan on sticking around to see Avengers 4 (Iâ€™m so pathetic the only thing keeping me alive is a fucking movie) but after that Iâ€™m going to blow my brains out.
