i literally dont care about anythingevery since i became 15 i have literally stopped caring about anything,

i dont cae about my marks or my future, because at the end i will die, and even if my future is bleak i can just kill myself

i sometimes feel like nothing really matters since i can kill myself whenever i want to, of course the process in itself is hard, but there are many painless ways to pass.
