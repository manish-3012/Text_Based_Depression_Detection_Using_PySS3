Feeling sad and lonely, don't want to burden my friends with awkward emotional conversations anymore.Basically what the title says. I have a few close, supportive friends. Three of them know about my depression, but I just feel like whenever I try to talk to any of them about it, they are judging me and they are annoyed that I can't just pretend to be normal anymore like I used to. 

I started taking fluoxetine in early November, and at first it seemed to be working really well. When one of my friends noticed the improvement in my mood, I told her that I had started taking medication... and I don't know, her reaction just felt like she was disappointed. 

I find it hard to do much of anything social because there is this huge pressure to be happy and to enjoy the things my friends enjoy, but I just don't enjoy anything anymore. And they don't seem interested in hearing about how sad I am, so here I am on reddit instead of chatting with them.

The thing is, I used to worry that me killing myself would be too much for the people I love... But sometimes I've just been wondering if it wouldn't be easier to hurt them all at once instead of drawing it out like this and pretending that things are getting better, giving them false hope.
