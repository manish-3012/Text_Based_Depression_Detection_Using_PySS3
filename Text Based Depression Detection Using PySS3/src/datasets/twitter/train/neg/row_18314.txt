Why donâ€™t the people we love get it.Why donâ€™t the people we love get it. 

Why donâ€™t the people we love understand that this is what we want. 

My family, my Mom, my Dad, my Brother, they all know Iâ€™m suicidal. Iâ€™ve told them before, Iâ€™ve begged before, for them to let me do it and they refuse. Now I get semi-regular texts reminding me out of the blue life is worth living, or articles about how crushed peoples families feel after a loved one commits suicide. But why canâ€™t I make this choice. I can make any other choice I want, so why not this one. If I donâ€™t want to be alive anymore why is that not up to me. 

If they love me why wouldnâ€™t they want me to find this peace. If they love me why wouldnâ€™t they want me to feel free from the pain. If they love me why canâ€™t they see it from where Iâ€™m standing.
