Is it weird that I often dream and daydream about hanging myself?Iâ€™ve been suicidal for a couple of years now, when ever I think of suicide itâ€™s not â€œifâ€ itâ€™s â€œhowâ€. Iâ€™ve got it all mapped out, how I want it to happen. These past couple months Iâ€™ve perfected my suicide on how I want it down to every detail. It scares me.
