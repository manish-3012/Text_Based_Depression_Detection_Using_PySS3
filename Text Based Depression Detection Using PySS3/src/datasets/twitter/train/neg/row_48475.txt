Screw throwaways, I don't care anymore. I saw my school schedule, and I got into some bad classes. Probably from the absolute shit luck I had last year.For starters I'm Asian, so there's already a "standard" which we are expected to follow, and pressure from other students to maintain that "standard". I don't even know why I'm writing this now. I just want to end it all. My shit teachers combined with my shit luck won't do me any good for the future, where I might not even get into college. There's an even larger pressure on me from my parents who were extremely successful from the start and are still successful today. Heres an example of a shitty teacher, where I actually got a D in her web development class. She would toss us a PowerPoint, describe it vaguely, and expect us to finish the assignment in 40 minutes. Problem was, no one knew how the fuck to do the damn assignment. Of the 30 of us in class, there were probably 2 kids that kinda knew what they were doing, and spreading the documents around the class so people could copy. This continues for a few months, as a copy or fail situation. Here's the kicker. I NEVER copied. And I stood by my word. Yet every single time she suspected me of doing so, eventually leading up to the point where she has me going to the administrators office to have a talk. I came back clean, but the teacher never looked at me the same again. And cut to the present,my teacher actually recommended me for another class instead of ADV. WEB because I made such a "bad" impression. This is one class of many. I don't even want to talk about it anymore. I'm quitting. I suck too hard at life.
