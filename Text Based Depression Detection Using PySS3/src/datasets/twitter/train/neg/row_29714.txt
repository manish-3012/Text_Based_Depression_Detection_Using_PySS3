Will you be given anti depressants if you go to a psyche ward and are suicidal?I am not remotely depressed,I never get depressed.I am just unable to cope with misfortune happening in my life chronic illness,brain damage,lack of real sleep I feel I can't cope with anymore.

If I go to a psyche ward (I have been in them before for visions etc I have when I don't sleep) will they put me on anti depressants if I am suicidal?

I feel like I need the support truly, but I'm not suicidal because I'm sad.
