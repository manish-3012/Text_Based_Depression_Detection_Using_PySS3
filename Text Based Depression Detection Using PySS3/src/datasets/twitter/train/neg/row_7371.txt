I don't want to do anything except dieI've never made a post in reddit before, all I do is lurk and you guys have made me laugh like crazy and always cheer me up, so I figured reddit seems like the place to post this shit if I'm going to post it. So I'm a noob so sorry if I fucked up something and wasn't suppose to post here or something.

I just graduated highschool. I don't want to go to college, I don't want to do anything in life.

All I've done all my life is act. That's it. Just pretend to be someone else and somewhere else because I hate being me. Every second. Every day. I'm living an illusion. So that's basically the only thing I like to do. And I know being an actor is like impossible and I read more about it and I don't even think I want to do that. But the point is that there's nothing I want to do. I'm as unmotivated as I could be. What's the point? Right now I'm taking a year off and crying my eyes out each night wondering what the fuck I'm going to do. It's a nightmare. I am absolutely terrified. At one point I even had a knife to my neck. I know I wouldn't do it though because I'm a pussy. That's the only reason I'm alive. That and I have a family who I would never dream of doing that to. I just often find myself hoping that a fucking car will come out of nowhere and kill or something like that. It gives me about as much pleasure as someone daydreaming about winning the lottery or something.

So yeah. I don't want to do anything except die. And really, I haven't done anything. I haven't ever got drunk, high, gone to parties, or had a boyfriend. Probably because I have no friends because I'm trapped inside my own fucking head pretending to be someone/somewhere else. So I've lost the will to live when I haven't even lived yet. Thanks for reading this. Please reply even if it's to say "man the fuck up" or something (even though I think "tough love" is against the rules) so I don't feel so fucking alone right now.
