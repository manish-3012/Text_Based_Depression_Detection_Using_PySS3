I'm a horrible personHonestly I don't understand myself sometimes. I'm posting this in the hope that someone else will understand/empathise.

I'm in the depths of a depressive episode and was inches away from committing suicide last night. I had my pills ready, I'd written my will, I'd come to peace with it. I was almost miraculously saved by a friend who was concerned by a conversation we'd had that evening and saw me, spoke to me, listened to me, in the middle of the night despite her having to go work the next morning. She's given so much of her time and help and I am incredibly thankful and lucky to have her. She's offered to speak to my parents about this (I don't currently feel like I can), she's looked up safe place I could stay in my city, charity counselling services, offered to call them up for me.

But because my brain is a piece of s*** I don't want help from any of the services she's mentioned. I don't want my parents to know, I don't want to speak to mental health volunteers, I don't want to stay in a safe place for suicidal people. I don't fucking know why. Maybe I don't believe they'll help, maybe I don't want to accept that they'd help. But I do want help. I'd give anything to feel differently. To feel hope. It's a complete contradiction and I feel horrible about it. And mostly I don't know what to do. I just want a doctor to fix me. It's like I don't have the energy to put any effort in my own recovery.

Does anyone else feel this way?
