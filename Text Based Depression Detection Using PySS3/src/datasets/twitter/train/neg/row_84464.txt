Leaving this weekendIâ€™m leaving tomorrow after work. Iâ€™m going to the mountains alone. Iâ€™m filing my remote camping permit day of so itâ€™ll take longer to audit the lack of my return. Youâ€™ve tried to stop me before but this time. Itâ€™s different. Iâ€™m at peace with this decision. Iâ€™ll keep everything as tidy as possible and bring as few belongings as possible. My life insurance is set. And my sister knows how to divvy up the money. She doesnâ€™t know how soon that may be.
