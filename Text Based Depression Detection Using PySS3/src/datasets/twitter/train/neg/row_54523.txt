No where to go. Please come lie to me.Ever since I went back to work I feel crushed. I think about dying all day. I have to physically stop myself from driving my car into buildings and other cars. I want to die.

Suicide hotline over 3 hour wait. Call drops or they hung up when I finally got connected. Hotline online chat, 2 hour wait, it got all the way down to â€œthere are 13 people in front of you in lineâ€ and then it never moved again. 

Found a discord server called Lively tagged with suicide help. Because of account being new they have some sort of verification that I canâ€™t pass to get into the server. No way to reach out to server members. Finally find some side server with a channel that I can type in and get told to leave and go call a hotline, even as Iâ€™m trying to explain my technical difficulties with the server. 

Try to call into work. Boss says â€œuncontrollable cryingâ€ isnâ€™t a good reason not to come in. I ask him if he thinks customers will be ok with me making them food as I actively sob and drip on their food. He goes on to rant about how he wishes he â€œcould cry all the timeâ€. 

Iâ€™m just, Iâ€™m trying so hard to stay calm. Iâ€™m trying so hard to do everything Iâ€™m supposed to do, call the hotline, reach out, take a mental health day. And at every angle Iâ€™m shut out or have a bunch of hoops to jump through. 

Can someone just lie to me and tell me itâ€™s going to be okay? Can someone tell me Iâ€™m more valuable than minimum wage? Can someone tell me that no matter how late the food is that I donâ€™t deserve to be yelled and cussed at? 

Can someone tell me that any of this will ever end, that there will be a vaccine for the coronavirus and everyone will go back to being normal, and getting yelled and cussed at will become the outlier instead of happening multiple times a day? 

Can someone tell me Iâ€™m in some sort of fever dream, and that all the people who want to send all of us essential workers out to die arenâ€™t real, and in the real world weâ€™re all working together and being careful, and way less people have died. Please.
