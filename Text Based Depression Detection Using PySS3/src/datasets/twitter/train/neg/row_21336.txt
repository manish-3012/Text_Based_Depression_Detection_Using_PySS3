I could never win, and at this point, I just want to laugh.No matter how much I want to try and do things for myself for the better, life just keeps fucking with me. It's like one cruel joke after the other, with no respite, just one hit after the other. I'm not talking about one or two things the past few months. I'm talking a plethora of options to fuck me where it hurts the most. At this point I'm almost ready to give up. I'll just fall back into bad habits and let it destroy me. I'm killing myself at work just to be okay, to be better, and it seems I'll have to keep doing so coz life is a cruel joke. Fuck, man. I just want a breather for once. Is that too much to ask? Fucking hell.
