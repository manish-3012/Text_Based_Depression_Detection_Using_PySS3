I just feel like Iâ€™m waiting to take my own lifeEach night is the same:   

I ponder my issues, how insurmountable some are, how easily tackled others are.   

I wonder how much Iâ€™ve screwed up my life. Iâ€™ll be 24 in a month. Iâ€™ve never worked much, save for a few month stretch where i worked eighteen, twenty hours day. Iâ€™ve ruined my academics through drug use, Iâ€™m still trying to finish a degree. Iâ€™m literally six credits shy, and I canâ€™t muster the motivation to go to my classes. I ask myself, *whatâ€™s the point? I wonâ€™t find a job anyways.*  

I wonder if itâ€™s too late for me, both academically and personally. Iâ€™ve got skme issues that necessitated an early intervention, and Iâ€™ve waited too late on them. I wonder if my drug addictions, the things I once used to escape my reality, wonâ€™t allow me to solve my reality, if I wonâ€™t be able to escape them now. Iâ€™ve been binging on cocaine for upwards for four months now, but I guess everyday use ceases to be a binge.  

I wonder why i have no one. I know most people say that and donâ€™t mean it, theyâ€™re just histrionic or discounting the numerous people that show love for them in their day to day life, but for me itâ€™s true. I am entirely alone. There can be two, three day stretches where I donâ€™t say a single word to another human being. Iâ€™ve lost all my friends either because of the drugs, or because they find me â€œtoo depressing to be around.â€ I am where fun, whimsy, and life go to die. In that way, should I not die too?  

I wonder why in any relationship Iâ€™ve ever had, the girl has cheated on me. Most recently, multiple times. Itâ€™s a combination of factors: Iâ€™m a pushover, I have little self respect so they donâ€™t either, and Iâ€™m not always fun and flirty to be around the way these hook ups can be. Thatâ€™s worn down my defenses and my self worth a lot.  

I wonder about the life i have left to live. In all, when i look at my future prospects, i see nothing. I see a college graduate who took a bit too long, I see an addict who will never escape his demons, I see no job prospects, I see struggle, homelessness, hunger, and despair. I honestly feel that, in an effort to avoid pain and struggle, itâ€™s the most rational choice.  

Many of these problems are fixable, but many arenâ€™t. I also wonder, even if I fix these, do I think Iâ€™ll be happy? I doubt it. Iâ€™ve had an existential crisis since i was 12 about the way this world works: you are born, you go tk school, you go to more school, you work until youâ€™re too tired to do anything for thirty years, you retire, live on a meager income, and die. That sounds... terrible.  

I just donâ€™t think Iâ€™m cut out for life. I want to be.

And then I begin to think of okay, if you did it, how would you? Hanging is my preferred method, because of its high success rate. But, if you canâ€™t tell, I like to be certain of things. Itâ€™s uncertainty of success and likelihood of pain is too high for me. I hate the romanticized ideal that those interested in suicide donâ€™t mind pain. The opposite is true for me, I want painless. Iâ€™ve had enough pain from bullying, disappointment, hating my very existence. Why would I want my last moments to be spent in anguish?  

Next, i begin to wish I had a gun, or the ability to get one. I see myself gripping the handgun, occasionally a pistol, turning the barrel on myself and just starting at it. Would I put my mouth over the barrel? Sucking deaths dick begging to be extinguished? Would I put it under my chin, angling up toward the back of the brain? Would I do the side of the head?  

This mental high doesnâ€™t last long, Iâ€™m reminded that i canâ€™t buy a gun, Iâ€™ve been hospitalized. It didnâ€™t help, i still thought about suicide with the frequency I always did after the hospital. It just made me wait a little bit.

Then i grow tired, the hours running long as the clock tells me that itâ€™s way too late to try anything, I would probably wake everyone up. Plus, Iâ€™m too tired to write a new note or proof read an old one. Itâ€™s fitting really, a lazy pathetic sack of Shit is too tired to kill himself. Thatâ€™s just poetic in a way.  


So, i close my eyes and begin to sleep, envisioning my life if x, y, or z immutable qualities of my existence were different, how much happier and healthy I would be.

I wake up with sun beaming in my window, and blurt out loud, â€œkill my self, suicide suicide suicide or die,â€ a form of OCD or Touretteâ€™s Iâ€™ve acquired over the years. And so begins a new day, waiting for night to come and hoping I have the energy and imagination to finally pull the trigger, without a trigger.
