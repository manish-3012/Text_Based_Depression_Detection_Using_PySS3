I don't understand myselfYesterday I walked 9.1 miles in 20 degree weather with no coat. In the middle of oncomming holiday traffic. I had two police cars and a fire truck swerve to miss me. No one stopped, no one honked._x000D_

Every time someone would come close I would hope the person behind them didn't see me. Any time a car was moving fast enough I stepped out. No matter what I did I couldn't get a car to hit me._x000D_

A friend found me in a snow bank after searching for a few hours. I don't remember much other than the world turning beneath my feet. It felt good to be so totally carefree, playing chicken with cars, no longer caring if they hit me._x000D_

My legs are in terrible pain from the attempt, but I fear I may be back out on the road to try again today or tomorrow. I'm an intelligent person, but there is simply no way out of the life I've been given. I've met people who say I'm living their dream. Why can't they live their dream and let me get out of it?_x000D_

I haven't eaten any solid food in four days. I don't feel hungry. Unfortunatly there are NO social services such as food stamps for a single guy that doesn't take medication and has no problems. Help doesn't exsist._x000D_

I've got a feeling I'm about to go back to the road, but wanted to talk to someone before I did. Meh.
