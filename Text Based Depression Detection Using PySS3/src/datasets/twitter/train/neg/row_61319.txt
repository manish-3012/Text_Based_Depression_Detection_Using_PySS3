My problems donâ€™t matterThrowaway account because my mom checks my regular account

No one cares about my problems. Iâ€™ve tried talking to my parents but thereâ€™s always something more important. My friends just not taking it seriously when I try and talk to them and school just calls my parents.  Iâ€™m just a kid, itâ€™s nothing serious. Theyâ€™ll just yell at me for losing weight or cutting again. But again Iâ€™m a kid I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m doing. 
I always thought I was gonna grow old and be successful but I might as well end it now because I donâ€™t see anything getting better. My grades dropped and Iâ€™m probably not gonna make this year in school. Itâ€™s not worth the constant stress. But thereâ€™s people who have it a lot worse so I shouldnâ€™t feel like this. I should feel lucky for being able to do this stuff. The only time my family wants anything to do with me is when Iâ€™m happy but that never really happens anymore. I donâ€™t know of any of this made sense. It probably didnâ€™t.
