I want to end it so badly but I canâ€™tI have an eight year old daughter who looks up to me, two dogs who adore me, and an amazing boyfriend who loves me so much, itâ€™s the only thing in my life that Iâ€™ve never questioned.  I love them more than anything in this entire world.  My dogs would miss me so much. My daughter would still have her dad, but weâ€™re so close and it would ruin her.  

My boyfriend lost his mother five years ago and his grandmother three years ago and heâ€™s still grieving.  He would have to grieve me too.  Weâ€™ve been together four years and we live together.  Iâ€™m all he has.  I couldnâ€™t do that to him. And if I left he wouldnâ€™t even have my daughter anymore because I doubt my ex would encourage my boyfriend and daughter to continue having a relationship if I were gone.  I want to die so badly but I canâ€™t.  Iâ€™m lying in bed next to him while he snores, bawling my eyes out because part of me wants to quietly crawl out of bed, never to return, but another part of me just wants to hold him and never let go. 

Another sleepless night figuring out if Iâ€™m going to destroy my familyâ€™s life, but finally end my pain, or not. 

I love them so much. But itâ€™s so exhausting only living for other people.
