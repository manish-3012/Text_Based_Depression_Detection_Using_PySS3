I just want to talk to a physical person about these thingsThe minutes are counting down. This isn't my first attempt on seeking someone to talk to face to face, but this is probably my last attempt. If anyone is the Tempe/Scottsdale area, I'd like to hear from you. 

I want to say after an hour from this post I won't be able to respond, but reddit keeps post blocking me. Oh well. Just give it an hour from this posting time.
