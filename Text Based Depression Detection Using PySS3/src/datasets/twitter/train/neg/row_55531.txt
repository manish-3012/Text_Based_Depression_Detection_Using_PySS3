I finally have the courage/reason to do it! Iâ€™m so relieved!So I was recently scammed out of a large sum of money that is going to make I so I canâ€™t afford rent bc it was for medicine that i use for work but now itâ€™s becoming more and more unavailable so I was forced to purchase from an individual I met on reddit actually who completely took advantage of my desperationðŸ˜†
Itâ€™s funny really he is probably still laughing
Heâ€™s a really cool guy too and props to him for being so good at what he does 

ANYWAY

I got the portable charcoal grill Iâ€™m gonna use and the klonopin I am gonna need to make me not care that Iâ€™m taking my last breaths
Iâ€™m 29 years old who has a marketing management degree thatâ€™s as useful as toilet paper and a girlfriend that Fucks other men for money
Or maybe itâ€™s just bc they have a bigger dick honestly idc anymore
My best years are behind me and itâ€™s all downhill from here and I know it the person that scam to me I should be thanking and honestly I hope that he reads this and knows that Iâ€™m not mad at him and I hope that he realizes the great service that heâ€™s done for the world you see I am a recovering drug attic and I have bird in my family for a decade with my use financially emotionally spiritually mentally drained both my mother and my father they deserve a better son and in this case a better son is no son

Sorry for the lack of punctuation You see Iâ€™m driving out to the lake now where I plan to do it I donâ€™t want to be found at all but I know that it is an inevitability so I want it to be as long as possible before they realize that I killed myself Iâ€™m not going to have a note on my body so I guess in some cases as melodramatic as it is this is my suicide note Iâ€™m sorry for burdening you all with this but to the person who scammed me youâ€™re the one that finally made this happen
Itâ€™s been a looooong time coming and it isnâ€™t your fault you were just the catalyst, the spark that ignited the flame thatâ€™s going to suffocate me and finally my suffering will be over. I would say his user name but honesty heâ€™s such a nice and cool dude Iâ€™m not gonna do that mi wish I could have done something with my life before taking my own 
But Iâ€™m not gonna be one of those assholes that buys a gun and kills people to take with him to...wherever the hell we go

If youâ€™ve read thus far then know Iâ€™ve ignited the grill and I just sparked  up a fatty and took 22 kpins ab 20 min sho so theyâ€™re kicking in 
Within the next half hour I will fall into a sleep that I wonâ€™t wake up from
Iâ€™ve read this is the most painless, humane way to go
Thank you all and treat your parents well
And dont be a dick and take advantage of sick people on the internet and use their own addiction against them making them spend all their money 

At least I have a life insurance policy on that isnâ€™t voided by suicide after 3 years and I got it in 2014 so my parents will get a small 100,000 when I go 

Iâ€™m sleepy guys
Bye
