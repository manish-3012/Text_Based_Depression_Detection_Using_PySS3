I just don't want to inconvenience anyone...Don't want to kill myself at home b/c it will drive my parents home value down.

Don't want to do it outside where someone can stumble on my corpse and be traumatized.

I just wish I could dig my own grave in some remote place and die in peace without inconveniencing anyone.
