I'll be gone within the next 24hrsI feel like reddit is a good place to put a suicide note of some sort so here goes nothing.

I've been battling bipolar disorder for what seems like forever, the constant pain hasn't stopped, my meds aren't working and are ruining my life.

Everyday is completely the same, I wake up, take my meds, and fall back to sleep, bed bound due to immense fatigue caused by my meds.

I'm failing uni and I'm completely lonely and miserable and that's not going to change with my condition. Every day I'm treated like shit by people I want to be with, causing my mind to go fucking insane in the process.

Family bereavements and poor relationships have happened all my life, I'm fucking sick of this cruel world and everything in it. 

I plan in the next 24hrs to overdose on everything that I have, get drunk and numb and jump off the nearest bridge. I'm ready, it's over. I can finally end this miserable and painful experience. 

I love my family and the few friends I have, but I can't take this any longer
