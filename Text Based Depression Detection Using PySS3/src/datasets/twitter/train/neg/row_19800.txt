Lol she said it. She said it. I don't deserve anything. That's it, That's the confirmation I needed. I'm killing myself.Honestly, I'm glad I've lived long enough to hear those words. For the past five years I've had this voice in the back of my head saying I'm worthless. A disappointment. I don't deserve anything. But to hear it, to actually hear it with my own ears. I've lost it. That fucking broke me. I'm a horrible person. I deserve to die.
