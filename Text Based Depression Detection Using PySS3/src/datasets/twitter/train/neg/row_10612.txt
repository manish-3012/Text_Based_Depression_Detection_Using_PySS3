Why canâ€™t I talk to anyone?I donâ€™t feel safe to be myself with anyone in my life. Not a single one of my friends can relate or really even sympathize with my problems. I canâ€™t even go to my mom, I know sheâ€™s trying but she just ends up making me feel like I need to figure it out and move on. It would be nice to feel like there was someone I could go to for comfort and to feel okay but there isnâ€™t. All I have is myself and my thoughts and I guess this subreddit :/
