Just told my girlfriend that I was thinking about killing myself.Her response: "Do you need to go to the hospital?"

Me: "No, I'm not going to do it, I just want to."

Her: "Is that really a good use of your time? You should choose to do something else instead of thinking about suicide."

I don't really know how to feel about this. I mean she has a point, but it also really reminds me of /r/wowthanksimcured.
