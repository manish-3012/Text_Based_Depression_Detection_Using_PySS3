I think today is the day(Iâ€™m sorry this is so long, and Iâ€™m sorry about any mistakes)
Iâ€™ve been a fuck up my whole life, Iâ€™ve ruined everything that is good in my life. A little back story I lost my dad when I was 8, my mom is an alcoholic and left. I rely on others because Iâ€™m still under 18.  I ruined my relationship and the love of my life broke up with me today. 

My niece was born almost 8 months ago and i still havenâ€™t been able to meet her because my sister in law hates me. Iâ€™ve missed her first words, her learning how to crawl. My brother tries his hardest. 

The only good thing left in my life is my dog, sheâ€™s amazing. I feel horrible that Iâ€™m going to end it and sheâ€™s going to be alone. She has bad separation anxiety. I think Iâ€™ll take her on a walk and spoil her a little extra today. 

I just got my driving permit this month and a motorcycle license. Iâ€™ve yet to feel the freedom of riding. All Iâ€™ve wanted to do my entire life is to ride. I believe I couldâ€™ve made it far in life. I had bigger plans for myself. But it looks like god threw a wrench in my plans. 

Iâ€™m going to go to my dads grave and then take my dog on a walk and spoil her for a while. Then grab one of my girlfriends or exâ€™s (whatever she is now) shirts and end it while holding the shirt. Reminiscing about all the good times.
