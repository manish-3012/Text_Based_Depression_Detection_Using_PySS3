Don't feel like my life should continueFeel like I'm at a point where I shouldn't pass the age of 20, that this is as far as I can go and that my story ends here. I also don't know what reason there is to live, why does anyone bother, I've stopped caring about everything, I can't find anything that makes me want to live. I just wish I didn't exist.
