Six years gone for nothingI just need to vent before I say my last good bye 

Me and my girlfriend have been fighting a fair bit but I though it was normal until COVID-19 hit and I lost my job while she took care of everything. She developed a drinking problem to the point it affects her job. I have always had anxiety but nothing like what I felt in the last few weeks Iâ€™ve been with her Iâ€™d been sleeping on the couch and telling her itâ€™s because I like to stay up late and hangout with our cat. In reality I would spend my nights crying worried for her well-being and the well being of the two of us during a pandemic. 

Well unfortunately one thing led to another she had spent the day drinking at work and slept at her desk without telling me anything I spend my night pacing angry and scared for her til she came home at 7 am wreaking of wine and vomit, thatâ€™s when I snapped and I blamed her for allot of things that werenâ€™t her fault we fought she showered and left only to come home late that night after what I could only assume was after work drinks leading to us fight and breaking up. The day after that I left moved out only the things I needed I had to call on my father to help me get my things in order and drop everything to help me. My things are currently at my familyâ€™s house I am homeless, jobless, and very soon lifeless. 

Iâ€™m sorry for the shitty grammar, Iâ€™ve never been a smart person and Iâ€™ve never been good at anything but I did love her she was my everything and now I have nothing. If you even bothered to read this thank you this is the last thing Iâ€™ll ever say 

Mom and dad I love you and itâ€™s not your fault. thank you for having me, Iâ€™m sorry I could never be as good at things as you wanted for me. 
Thank you all.
