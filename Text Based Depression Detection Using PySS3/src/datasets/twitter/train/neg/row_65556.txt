Crying doesn't help anymoreI don't understand me anymore. I feel so pent up and confused. Crying used to be the only way I knew how to release this terrible energy and feel like I am a human being after all. But now even crying when I am alone feels like I'm putting up a fake front. It feels so off and empty. I truly, truly want to die and would jump at the chance if I knew it would be painless and my family would know I was dead but would never have to see/find my broken body.
