A guy just told my girlfriend she's the only reason he hasn't killed himself.Backstory: There's this sweet little guy named "tom" (not his real name, obviously) at my school, the never hugged/kissed a girl type. He didn't really have any friends, and he started talking to my girlfriend. She felt really bad for him, and decided to befriend him, but things have gone too far. He just told her he loved her. He told her the only reason he hasn't killed himself is because of her. Now my girlfriend is crying, and she feels so helpless and doesn't know what to do. I'm just desperate for advice and figured this would be a good place to ask, please, if anyone has anything to tell me, don't hesitate.
