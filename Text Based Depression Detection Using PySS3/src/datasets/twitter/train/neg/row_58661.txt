Iâ€™m barely hanging on.Unemployed for 7 months, and rejected from a job that I was ðŸ’¯ qualified for with an inside connection. My partner lost his job. People say itâ€™s not my fault, weâ€™re in a pandemic. 

My ex best friend used me and tossed me aside, acting like I donâ€™t exist. Life keeps getting worse. Im barely staying afloat with bills. I left a toxic job so unemployment money is non existent.

Iâ€™m a fuck up and a loser. I canâ€™t even get a minimum wage job. Iâ€™d rather be dead. The only thing keeping me here is my dog. I donâ€™t want him to be sad, but maybe he would be better off.
