Everyone loves me, but I donâ€™t.Forgive me if this is the wrong place for any of this.. 
Let me start with saying Iâ€™m absolutely and optimistic person. Glass half full. I try to bring light to any room Iâ€™m in. I have a lot of friends. I would say 15 close friends I see week to week at work and around and at my house and every where really. I have a super loving mom and dad and huge family that are absolutely amazing Iâ€™m never sad or disappointed because of them. Only ever in a sense of my longing to see them. My last two girlfriends have been absolutely the coolest two girls Iâ€™ve ever met. The first one we broke up mutually as I wanted to move for my work and and she wanted to move oppositely for school. (Sheâ€™s doing amazing and Iâ€™m super proud of her.) And my most current ex girlfriend was so awesome and is going to college and sheâ€™s a league or three above me but she loved me so much and I helped her get her amazing job she has now that translates well to when she graduates and sheâ€™s fantastic but I broke up with her because in my head I just didnâ€™t want a girlfriend anymore.... One of the absolute greatest humans ever and I just broke up with her. Almost literally just because.  And it has helped me to realize I thought I did it so I could grow and develop on things Iâ€™m working on. I have a very steady and lucrative job for someone in their low 20s and Iâ€™m doing very okay financially. I stream. I have a small podcast. I do comedy for a verrryyy small group. (10-15) Iâ€™m literally doing great. But for the first time in my life I want to kill myself. I havenâ€™t even thought about how but thatâ€™s what I want. I canâ€™t stand what my mind thinks anymore. Im not pleased with how I look but thatâ€™s natural. But Iâ€™m scared and confused?! I know depression comes in so many forms but I donâ€™t understand??? My biggest fear is that I will be forgotten. And it sickens me. I can literally think about how I feel Iâ€™m not making enough of an impact on this earth and worry and bother myself until Iâ€™m throwing up and bawling. I donâ€™t know what I need but Iâ€™d love some insight. Thank you so much if youâ€™ve read this and Iâ€™m scared to see what youâ€™ll have to say..
