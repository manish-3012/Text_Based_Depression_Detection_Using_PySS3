I'm getting pretty close recentlyOver the past couple of months it seems I've had more time to think which has only lead to suicidal thoughts. Most of it being "I can just turn left and run into that bridge support". The only reason I haven't is mostly not wanting to waste all of the money my parents have spent on me. I know I'm a terrible child but I like to think I'm not that bad.

I've been thinking about just saving up my paychecks and writing a will that splits my liquid assets evenly between my parents and gives my physical assets to my little brother. At this point that seems like the logical step for me to take.
