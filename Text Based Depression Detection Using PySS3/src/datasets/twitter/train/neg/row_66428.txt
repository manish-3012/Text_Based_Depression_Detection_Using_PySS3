I talked to a therapist.And it didn't help. I had a flicker of hope that the therapy might actually force me to confront my crippling emotions  but it seems like honestly even the therapist tried to down play it. I'm being crushed under the weight of loneliness and confusing personality problems, and I can't even get help when I'm practically on my knees begging. I'm pretty convinced that my days are numbered and I'm going to put a bullet in my head as a mercy to myself. Not asking for advice, just spilling my guts.
