Trying to find the courage to end my lifehi my name is raquel. I am 18 years old and to be honest im ashamed to have let my life go on this far. when I was a freshman in high school i decided that if by the time I graduated I did not feel better I would finally kill myself. But here I am. During high school I had a relationship that gave me hope. We were going to leave everything behind move to the US and start our lives together (we both live in Mexico). He was the love of my life, we were both on the verge but together we found a reason to live a reason to try. He didnâ€™t stay that way. He changed started turning into his father who he despised I wound up in a mental hospital we tried to save our dream but it was too late. Everything was too fucked up. In a way for me the love of my life died he no longer exists. Ive tried to replace him in the sense of finding a reason to live be it another partner be it anything and I keep fucking failing. I am unlovable, I am disgusting. And I donâ€™t mean physically, Ive been told Im attractive, Im signed to a modeling agency. And im not ungrateful Im happy with my looks but no one believes you have it bad when they think youâ€™re pretty. Girls are threatened by you so they treat you like shit and boys want you as their fuck toy. I had found someone that really loved all of me but he isnâ€™t here anymore. I like this boy right now and I wish we could be less alone together but when he looks at me he only sees a pretty face, someone he hooked up with. Heâ€™s too scared of someone like me hurting him. I am such a coward why the fuck havenâ€™t I killed myself I decided this three years ago why canâ€™t I do it.
