It really really hurtsMy thoughts are racing all over the place, my hearts feels like it's a dead weight on my chest, I'm shivering dring yet I'm sweating, I have severe butterflies in my stomach and I can't eat or even drink water because I will end up throwing up , why won't God just make it all stop?
