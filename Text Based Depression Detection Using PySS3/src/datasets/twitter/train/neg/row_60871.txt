I think itâ€™s timeEverything I touch, dies. Everything I try to do is wrong in the eyes of my parents. Friends, are just friends that wonâ€™t ask how Iâ€™m doing. I make jokes just to help people laugh, but in the inside Iâ€™m dead. I think itâ€™s time.. things havenâ€™t been the same and it doesnâ€™t get any better. My parents donâ€™t believe I am depressed and think itâ€™s a stigma a bullshit excuse that just because nobody in my family has had depression means I shouldnâ€™t have it. Come home from break (school) just to get yelled at in the first hour. I think itâ€™s time, for a peaceful forever rest...
