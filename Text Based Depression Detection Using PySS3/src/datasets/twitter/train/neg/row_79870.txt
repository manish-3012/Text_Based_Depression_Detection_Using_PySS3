I can't express my feelings. I haven't been able to over the course of many years but I need help.I've been here too many times already. I've gone through nearly 2 years of pharmacy school with repressed suicidal feelings. I've hidden it from counselors and doctors not out of a general desire to, but because I cannot open up to people in the slightest. In general, I'm an overly generous person. I give everything that I can to charitable efforts and despite all my negative feelings I present myself as a happy, shy person.

I dropped an entire year of school just to recover and still I find myself in the same position (even worse so now that I've been missing classes and exams due to my own incapability to give even the slightest about anything). I actually searched my apartment for drugs that would assuredly end it tonight but I broke down. I'm tired of going through these feelings year after year. I can't connect with a single soul no matter how I reach out (I act very sociably and I cannot make one damn connection). The only thing that is holding me back is the knowledge that, if I die, my parents will owe about 80k in loans. 

Even if I somehow manage to graduate successfully (I am convinced that my professors/dean are more than tired of this), I have no aspirations or anything that I generally care about. I'm stuck in a void. For the love of anything, for the love of the alcohol (maybe it is very sad but alcohol is the only things that gets me to feeling even a little bit normal) that is enabling this post, help.
