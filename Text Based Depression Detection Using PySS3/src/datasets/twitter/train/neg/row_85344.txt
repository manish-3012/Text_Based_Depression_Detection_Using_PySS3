Itâ€™s not getting betterI donâ€™t know what to do anymore. The past few weeks have been bad. Iâ€™ve never felt more like offing myself than I do now. And two years ago I stuck a bullet in my .44, spun in and pulled trigger twice. But Iâ€™m still here. The only person I told was my sister and she took my gun. She shot herself almost a year ago now. Iâ€™ve shut down. I almost donâ€™t feel anything anymore. This life is a sick joke. I wish I could get better, but itâ€™s looking impossible. Iâ€™m running out of options. Iâ€™m running out of people that care.
