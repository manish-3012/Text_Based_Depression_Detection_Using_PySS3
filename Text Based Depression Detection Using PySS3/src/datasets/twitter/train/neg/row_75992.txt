I don't know what to sayI'm a programmer and I feel depressed all the time. Currently 24, I get exhausted and feel bad about myself. I've tried counseling but it didn't help. People say find good things in yourself, yeah well I don't think so.  I don't know how to erase this pain of hatred. I might be happy on the outside but dead on the inside. When I see a cliff, I get this feeling of jumping down right away. I don't know, what have I become?
