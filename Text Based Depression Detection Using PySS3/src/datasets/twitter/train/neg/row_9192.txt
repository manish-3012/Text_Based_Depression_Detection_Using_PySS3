I guess i sorta wrote something about my last episodeI let out a sigh, it radiates throughout my room, bouncing off the walls and dissipating into the depths of the darkness that had crept in from the corners. My bones are dripping with a thick layer of melancholy and it's hard to move. My lifeless shell is a cage, seemingly oblivious to the anxiety charging against my skull. Feeling panicked, that familiar but nonetheless uncomfortable weak rush in my limbs, the pounding of my heart in every vein in my body, the indescribable desire to escape; but simultaneously I can feel the air around me that has suddenly become heavy, clinging to me and dragging me down, with a completely numb emotional state.
Where did this fog come from? How can I feel human again?
The episode lasts for days; a blur of both sleepless nights that dragged on in painful hours of tossing and turning, and days where I am barely awake, merely sleeping to escape the feelings. A blur of forcing myself to eat enough,  wondering vaguely where my appetite went and if I could go with it. A blur of dishevelled hair and wearing the same clothes to both sleep and go through the day, and a blur of missed calls and messages from people who weren't going through this storm.
When will it end?

I know it's not great writing, but I'm tired and I needed to get it off my chest. I hope you guys are managing okay.
