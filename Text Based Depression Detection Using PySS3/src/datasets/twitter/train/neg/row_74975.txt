My friend is going through a lot and it's triggered me so much I've become apatheticShe's a genuinely good person, but she has a history of suicide attempts and unhealthy emotionally manipulative relationship and a bad childhood. 
I've helped her the best i could these past 3 years, every break and suicide attempt no matter how it triggered me which honestly it almost cost me my own life just trying to save hers. She's a nurse and she hates her job,she just starting working at a A mental Ward and she exprienced burnout and had to go to the hosptial, i feel so horrible that  i turned off my Wi-Fi today specifically so i have an excuse not to talk to her and this happening made me feel like the worst friend in the world . I know it was a childish mood but she doesn't want to talk about how she feels and if i try to spark up a "normal " conversation once I've expressed my support and all that, she barely says anything! Just a few emojis and one word answeres. I don't know what to do, i care about her so much that i get anxious to the point where i shut down emotionally . I don't want to attempt again, im already very depressed and anxious and i just can't handle her anymore, it's  been a year and mostly her being depressed and bouts of happiness before she tries to off herself, im tired, she's 19 and im 16, that matters because i don't have any kind of understanding of jobs and shit. I need to focus on school, i need to focus on me. I could have asked for space months ago but now is  a wrong time. I don't know what to do. I want to kill myself rather than deal with this shit.
