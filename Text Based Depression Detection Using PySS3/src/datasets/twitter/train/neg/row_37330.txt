I want to die. It hurts too much.Family obligations, school, arguments in the family, being fat, ugly, worthless, constantly putting hope into people and getting that immediately crushed, tired of sacrificing myself for others. I'm sick of everything. I just want to die. If there was a bridge near me, I'd walk off it right now. I'm tired of life. I'm tired of me. My parents are the only thing keeping me from killing myself, but even now I'm losing the strength to keep going on. I want to end it. I want to stop living. I'm sick of myself.
