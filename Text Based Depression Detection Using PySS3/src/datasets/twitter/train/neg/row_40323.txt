Cognitive function declining. Not much time left before I'm catatonic or vegetative.I've been making the rounds telling some of my friends that I'm going to kill myself. There's been a trend of understanding with my decision. Just a couple days ago I started having trouble with balance, and my speech is starting to slur. Today I needed help to navigate the menu when I called medicaid. I'll probably need a caretaker soon. My window of being functional enough to end my life is closing, I feel. Doctors still monotonously shrugging their shoulders at my issue and treating me like a number.   


You'd think that dealing with heart issues for 5 years would have been the real struggle. A prisoner in my own body. Unable to do a lot of things. Then the panic attacks and schizophrenia came. Just a normal day for me. I adapted. Then the peyronie's hit. Dick's still in the process of painfully shriveling up with scar tissue. It's been especially rough, worrying about the future of my love life and any relationships I was hoping to have, but I still managed. At least I still had a future.   


But now? I'm not sure. This thing going on with my brain is too much. It's like being more dead than alive. I can't experience the world anymore, process its beauty, understand... I'm just an empty shell with a useless soul in it. I'd almost believe in a god because it seems like the universe is out to get me, making my life progressively worse over time, torturing me. I always thought that things couldn't get worse, but then I started laughing when it would actually happen. Because I expect it. It's so predictable. It's so bizarre, absurd.. but maybe that's what gives it comedic value.   


I really want a friend to be there when I go, but knowing the way of things, I'll probably die alone, in my room. All I ever wanted was to be held. Everything would have been, would be okay if someone would just hold me.
