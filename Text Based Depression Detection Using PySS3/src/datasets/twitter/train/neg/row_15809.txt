Constant thoughts of suicide but I don't really want to die.Does anybody body else think about suicide all the time but not not really want to die? Like I feel like nothing will get better and is be better off dead alot but ive always been the what if type and don't want to miss anything. Mostly it's just like thinking " I could do it. I could easily do it. I won't do it but I could." I know someone asked something similar a few months ago but it's bothering me right now and I don't know where else to post.  Sorry.
