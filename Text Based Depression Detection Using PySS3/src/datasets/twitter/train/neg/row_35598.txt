Exhausted...just fucking doneBeen good for months. But, today it just hit me like a truck... the same old feelings of emptiness. I canâ€™t stop my thoughts from going in a continuous negative loop. Just around and around all day. And the pills and talking and mindfulness is all bullshit.

I just want to take the gun from my closet and finally get some peace.

I just want rest
