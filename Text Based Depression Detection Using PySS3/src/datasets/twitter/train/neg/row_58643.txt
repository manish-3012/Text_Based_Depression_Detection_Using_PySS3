I tried to hang myself last night.Idk, I just feel like I'm a waste. I know it's quite the cliche thing to say, but I genuinely feel as if everyone around me hates me or finds me extremely difficult and annoying. I don't have any hobbies other than Martial Arts because I'm either not allowed to take up a new one or it costs too much/I don't have a way of getting there. So, because of my lack of personality I can't make any connections with people. I feel pathetic for writing this and will most likely delete after some time but I just wanted to get it off of my chest.
