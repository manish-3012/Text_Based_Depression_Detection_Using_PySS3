a financial burden and source of stress for my family and (all former) friendsI have bipolar disorder I. This past month has just been back-to-back manic episodes all the time and this time I really feel like I messed it all up. At first I had to drop out of this semester of college because I couldnâ€™t get any work done due to my episodes. That was already a huge decision I had to make, and one my parents have already advised against. This last episode was about a week and a half long and during that time I felt it necessary to take out personal loans, payday loans, max out credit cards for drugs, booze, and other definitely not necessary items. Now my account is overdrawn, I wonâ€™t be able to pay rent or utilities and I have to pay all these loans back with money I wonâ€™t have because Iâ€™ve had to quit my job for the same reason I left school. Because of my diagnosed mental disorder and my history of drug abuse I already feel like a financial burden because theyâ€™ve had to pretty much help me pay for everything but now Iâ€™m in debt for shit they shouldnâ€™t have to deal with and itâ€™s not like this is first time Iâ€™be spent thousands on drugs. I just feel like what the fuck is the point of trying to fix myself if Iâ€™m just prolonging the inevitable. I will just continue to cause even more stress to my mom and waste even more of their money. Wouldnâ€™t ending not only bring me peace, but finally give my parents the chance to move on to the point in their life where they can relax knowing their kids are off doing their own thing? Why is this prolonged episode of stress and worry better than a period of loss and grief?
