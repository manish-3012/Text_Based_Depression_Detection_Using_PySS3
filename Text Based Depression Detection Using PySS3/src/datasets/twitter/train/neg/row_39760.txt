I stopped caringFor the past 2 years or so, my past has been creeping up on me again (I was abused by my moms ex boyfriend from around 2-12 or 13) Ive seen a few therapists but I always end up losing insurance and just not going when i get it back. I just switched from high school to online high school and now i can see my life going downhill more than it already was. I stopped doing my school work, im just letting it build up and instead ill smoke weed or play a game on my laptop. Im in my room all day, go to work, then back in my room. I used to be a great student, all A's, AP classes. Now I just dont care what happens to me whatsoever. I dont feel anything most of the time but every now and again ill just randomly cry for a good 30 minutes then go back to feeling nothing. I cant stop this no matter how hard I try. I feel like my brain is a fuzzy tv screen and my real self is trying to break out, to do good again but it just cant. I need help.
