Lost hopeI donâ€™t think I can keep going anymore, I used to be really suicidal, but I thought this past year I was getting better, but it always just comes back, Iâ€™d feel fine for a couple weeks then everythingâ€™s awful again. Iâ€™ve been depressed and suicidal for years now and I donâ€™t know why I havenâ€™t killed myself yet. The thought of living another year or even another few months terrifies me, Iâ€™m now 19 and I didnâ€™t think Iâ€™d ever make it to 16, I donâ€™t know what to do. Iâ€™m so so lost. Iâ€™m meant to start uni in September, but Iâ€™m the back of my head all I think is that I wonâ€™t be alive for that. And I feel so awful because I have an amazing boyfriend and fantastic friends, but I cant bring myself to tell them all this, they know a bit, but I could never just go to them and say Iâ€™m planning to kill myself. I donâ€™t feel like Iâ€™m alive, I canâ€™t comprehend that I actually exist, and that other people can see me and speak to me. I feel like Iâ€™m living in a bubble, or through a video game. Iâ€™m so cut off from everyone and everything, Iâ€™m so uncomfortable. Things would be so much better for everyone if I wasnâ€™t alive anymore, itâ€™s all Iâ€™ve wanted for 6 years, and itâ€™s never going to change.
