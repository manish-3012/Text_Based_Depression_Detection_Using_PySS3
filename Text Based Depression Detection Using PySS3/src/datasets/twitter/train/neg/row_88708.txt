Is it fair to be depressed because of loneliness?It's probably the only reason I consider suicide and have depression. 

My inability to reach out to people and grow relationships, and find people I want to be with. 

Is it fair? 

My life is, by most standards, great. I have everything I need with no major setbacks or blocks in my way. 

Besides mental issues, like depression and anxiety. 

Is it fair to be depressed and consider suicide over feeling so alone? 

Sometimes it seems like the only way I'll be able to fix the situation.
