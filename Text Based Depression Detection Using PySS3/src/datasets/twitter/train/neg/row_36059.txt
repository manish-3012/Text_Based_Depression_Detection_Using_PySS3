The only reasons I don't kill myself are people in my lifeWhenever I feel myself edging closer to attempting suicide, I try and think of reasons that suicide isn't the best decision. I can only ever come up with the names of people who would be hurt or disappointed if I died. But are people even reasons to not kill myself? I can't think of a single part of life, or activity, or special moment I'd like to live to see. The only thing that keeps me from jumping off of my local bridge is the fear of disappointing my parents, family, or boyfriend. Literally the only thing stopping me is knowing I'd affect others, but that just doesn't feel fair. The more I think of that, the more I wonder why it'd even matter if those people were disappointed in me if I were already dead? I just don't know why it's worth fighting my mental illness when it's already ruined everything I love. It doesn't feel like there's anything left of me to offer to this world. I feel pointless
