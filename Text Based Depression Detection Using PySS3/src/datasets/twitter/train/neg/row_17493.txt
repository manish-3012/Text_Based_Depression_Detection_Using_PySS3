Approaching the end of the line (longish text)Hello.

Let me preface this by saying that English is not my first language and due to the length of the text I didn't proofread it. Sorry for the fragmented text. Also I'm not really planing to commit suicide in the immediate future, although there is a designated end of the line for me.

I'm not entirely sure why I now feel the need to write this down after years of beeing miserable. I suppose there's a number of reasons but stopping myself from procrastinating by sharing this with other people might be the driving force behind this desire.
On the one hand I want to present all the relevant aspects of my story but on the other hand I don't want my identity to be known so I'll have to be vague in some regards.

  
  
  
**1 Summary of my current circumstances.**
  
I'm Western European, male, in my late 20s. In late 2013 I graduated from University with a Master's degree in a computer science. I since hold an average paying in software engineering.
I live by myself in a small appartment. No siblings, no pets, no car.
  
  
  
**2 My situation**
  

I have a face that only a mother could love. I won't go into all the details since that would probably be enough to identify me but it would take about 10-15k to fix my worst problems (nose and ears) which would probably make me roughly "plain" face-wise. To actually look attractive I would need at least 15k more. Since I'm also pretty short for a man (4 inches below average in my country) being plain probably won't cut it. Since I have no social or sexual experience even that might not be enough at this point.

I have known that I'm ugly since I was 16 or 17. I had become ugly earlier than that but it took me some years to realize why I lost friends and got zero interest from girls. My childhood was actually quite ok, I had a lot of friends. I even had girlfriends.
Since then I have struggled to accept my reality. In a way I have been a procrastinator. Not in the sense that most people procrastinate by postponing some task or piece of work but by postponing a final conclusion.
For over a decade years I have been running in the red numbers. I can't recall a day that was worth living. True, some where better than others, but it was never close to good enough. I measure my days not by how happy I was but by how good I managed to suppress the fact how unhappy I am on that given day.
I justified living each of these days by borrowing from my future happiness. I would tell myself that I could endure suffering as long as there was a payout somewhere down the line. I never really specified when that payout would have to happen but as long as I had a somewhat reasonable excuse to keep waiting, I was willing to keep hanging in there.
Initially I was waiting to turn 18, then to finish school, then to start university, then to finish my bachelor's degree, then to finish my master's degree, then to get a job. 
So here I am an I can't make up any more milestones. Yeah I could get a Ph.D. Sure I could save countless years to start financing a house, but I just can't bring myself to believe it anymore. I'm not getting younger. I have already spent more than half my life alone and lonely. I can't go on chasing the next elusive milestone anymore when so many people just what I desire for nothing more than the fact that they were born with better genetics.
I have invested so much effort and it didn't help me at all. I don't know how attractive people study but my studying consisted of 1/3 actual studying and 2/3 being in a depressed stupor. As such it took so much effort to still achieve the results I got and I'm just empty, I can't keep doing it.
Recently I noticed that I get less and less work done ad work. My boss didn't notice it as far as I can tell but it drags me down even more. My work ethic was one of the things I was really proud about when I was working summerjobs 10 years ago. 

I also become increasingly frustrated with the fact that I pay a huge percentage of my income in taxes, mandatory health care etc. I can hardly save more than a couple hundreds a month even when living extremly frugal. I hardly benefit from either and I bet the people who do get government hand outs and health care have and/or had on average way happier lives than me. 

I was in therapy and on anti-depressants for 2 years. Neither really helped. Besides I gained weight and became lethargic from the SSRI. I see no point in trying either again.
  
  
  
  
**3 Dating**
  

I tried asking female acquittances and fellow students out. 100% rejection rate.

I tried online dating. It was a joke. I made an account on some dating websites like plentyoffish and okcupid. Hardly ever got a message in return, never got a date. Not that it matters, I doubt any woman would want to stay after getting a look of my face in real life. I made a tinder account, swiped right on everyone till matches run out. Hundreds of women. After several days I got one single match which was a bot. 
  
  
  
  
**4 Outlook**
  

By next summer I'll have saved enough money for the first big surgery (the complicated rhinoplasty) and hopefully the ear surgery. The latter will depend on whether or not I can get a loan to raise additional money. I'll likely pay a high interest but it's a win/win situation for me. If it works out I won't mind in the slightest paying of that loan and if it doesn't I won't have to worry about it anyway.
The plan from here on is very clear: I will somehow make it till next summer. It will be hard but I am confident that I can wait one more year. After I get the surgery I will give dating one more try. If it turns out that the physical change is not severe enough and/or that my personality is already damaged beyond repair, I will end my life. I have to promise myself that I will follow through with that. That's my colateral for one more year of borrowed time. 

I have not given detailed thought to how I will do it. I recently had an atheroma of maybe a quarter of an inch in diameter on my leg and cut it away with a sharp knife without anesthesia. It was very unpleasant (and bled a lot till I taped it) but I'm confident that I can withstand the pain of a "hands-on-approach" if more comfortable methods won't be available to me.

I'll go to sleep soon, I might reread this tomorrow and add important information that slipped my mind today.
