I'm scared ill never be happyI've never had a stable job, everything i had was either part time or casual.. I've had one full time job but it was a contract, I've been looking for something similar since, i look everyday, during the time since I've been unemployed I've volunteered, done internships, finished school, tried to make connections with people, went to employment agencies, re work on my resume, apply online everyday writing up emails, cover letters.. I've had so many people look over my resume and tell me ya its great..this was all before covid and quartile started..  

I'm so scared ill never be able to reach my goals i have for myself. i keep hearing how people should just go for their goals.. how do you do it when you can't afford them or no one will help you get there.. i keep hearing how this pandemic is making this harder for everyone.. when i see or hear from friends and family it sounds like things are going great no problems once so ever.. some of them have found employment when looking for less then a month, some of them bought houses, or new cars.. or starting a family.. 

 I'm just here getting rejected from every place i apply to, with no leads once so ever..  i can't seem to reach any goals i have for myself, i feel like I'm trying everything i can and no one seems to want to give me a chance..
