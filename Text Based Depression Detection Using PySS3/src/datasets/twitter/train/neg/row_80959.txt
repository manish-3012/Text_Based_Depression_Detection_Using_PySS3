I think Iâ€™m readyI donâ€™t know what it was about today, but I think Iâ€™m finally ready to take the leap and end it. I have work till 9pm tomorrow, then after I think Iâ€™ll buy myself a one way ticket to Hawaii. Why not go out with a nice trip eh? 

Having to deal with this issue for so long really drains you man. Even with the new position I achieved at work, Iâ€™m finding ways to screw it up. Iâ€™m really doing nothing with my life besides screwing up. My work can find someone 100% more work efficient then my sorry excuse of a human being. ðŸ˜‚

I just want to apologize to my parents for what Iâ€™m going to do. Mom, dad.. You did your best raising me. Iâ€™ve always tried helping others before helping myself. You guys never gave up on me when I dropped out of college and decided to work full time. You were always there for me even when I thought you werenâ€™t. You guys were the best parents. Iâ€™ll always love you guys wherever I end up once this is over. 

To my brother and sisters. I might have not been the best brother. Always in my room and never at family gatherings. Donâ€™t think I never went because I donâ€™t love you guys. You guys were the best siblings a little bro could ask for! You always took the time to help me with school and any other problem I had. Iâ€™ll always love you guys. 

To my coworkers. Hey, sorry Iâ€™m ditching work to take care of this. I hope you guys wonâ€™t be to mad. Thanks for the good memories guys. 

To my nephew. Hey bud, sorry I wonâ€™t have a chance to see you grow up. I just hope your at that age where you wonâ€™t remember who I am. I love you buddy! Grow up a better man then me.

And lastly to my best friend. Dude youâ€™ve been my partner in crime since middle school. All those late night video game parties. You hit me in the nuts multiple times, and I screwed up your back so many times, but that never stopped us from being Friends. You werenâ€™t just my friend, but my brother. When you told me you were accepted into law school I was so happy for you. Out of me and you, I always knew youâ€™d do something with your life, even if you started out in a rough patch. Iâ€™m proud of you man. Youâ€™ll make something with your life. Iâ€™m just sad I wonâ€™t be around to see it. 
I love you man. 

god bless.
