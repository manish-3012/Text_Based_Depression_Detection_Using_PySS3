I don't know what I'm doing with my life.Like seriously? What am I doing with my life? 

I know that my parents aren't proud of me. I feel like my dad cheated on mom and left her because of me. He always came home really late, and I would never know that he came home. I didn't have much to say to him, I still don't know what I can say to him. And when I do see him, he is always in such a rush to get out of there that I just don't say anything to him. My mom has turned into the biggest bitch around after the divorce. Everything is my fault all the time, even things that I'm not even involved in, she finds one way to say that they are my fault. If we have to go someplace important, she decides to completely trash me. She calls me fat and ugly. My handwriting is even horrible to her. She says she can't read it. I know for a fact that other people can read my writing, she just wants to project herself on me, and I've just about had it.  I had to quit college with just two years away from getting my BA, because my money for it ran thin. 

The only thing that really makes me happy now is my online role playing. I've had people tell me it is rather stupid and I need to just start facing reality instead of running away from it. 

I'm feeling really low right now. I could use a friend or just anything for that matter. 

I just don't think I can do this anymore..
