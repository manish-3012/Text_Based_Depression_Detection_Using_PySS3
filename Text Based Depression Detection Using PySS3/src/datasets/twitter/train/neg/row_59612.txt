I can't live like thisI can't be with the man I love. I'll probably never see him again. I don't blame him. He needs to get his life together.

I see no other reason to live. I can't work because of my mental illnesses. I live in my childhood house I have traumatic memories of. I have no hobbies or talents. I've spent hundreds of dollars on psychics that just took my money.

I don't want anyone else. I'll never love again and I don't want to. All I ever wanted to be is a wife and mother.I stopped taking my meds 3 days ago. I haven't left my room in days so my mom won't even know the difference. My best friend thinks I'm pathetic and that I'm making myself depressed. Fuck this. There's no reason for me to live. I'm done. I feel like I'm not supposed to be happy ever so why endure more suffering?
