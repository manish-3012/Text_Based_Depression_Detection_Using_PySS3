Not to sound like another attention-seeking teenager, but...I'm probably going to re-read this in a couple days and realise I'm being an idiot, but lately I've been feeling kinda (very) shit. I'm fucking up my education with an average of about 3/7 (MYP system; 5s are required to study IB). I've been neglecting people and cutting myself, among other things. Because my grades are awful, everyone is telling me how bad I am (going to be) at life. My parents are giving me too much attention which makes me feel like they have high expectations of me. I don't really want to bother living through all this pain for a glimpse of happiness just to die anyway. I know it's not all as hard as this, but my point is: this isn't even hard. I can try, but ultimately everything I do just makes me feel so useless. I know there's no point trying to make an impact on the world, not that I'm saying I do, I just don't want to feel like shit compared to everyone else. I'm not going to kill myself, but I don't want this life I have. I know life isn't a competition, but I don't know what the fuck to do; now or later. Thanks for reading~
