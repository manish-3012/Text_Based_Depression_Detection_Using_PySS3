Sad pathethic loserMy family literally enjoys watching me in pain. They do not want to see me be happy and succeed. They love having to drive me to work and do things for me because it gives them power over me. They want me to depend on them so that I could never have the confidence to leave. 
I cant keep living with that. I hate everyone around me. Everyone reminds me of my past and the disgusting fat person I use to be.  I made everyone else look better and feel better standing next to me.
