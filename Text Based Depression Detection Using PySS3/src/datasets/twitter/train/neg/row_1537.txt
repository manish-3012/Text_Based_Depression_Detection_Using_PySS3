TiredI'm just so tired. Everything is getting worse and I don't feel like I can handle it. My boyfriend is getting more and more suicidal and I'm getting really scared that he's actually going to try soon. But I can't help him anymore. Everything I say to try to convince not to kill himself he just refutes with either dispassionate whatevers or with some kind of twisted logic that I can't argue with. 

I've been sick for the past week and haven't been able to get any homework done, so now my mountains of college homework is swamping me. I have a test tomorrow and one on Wednesday, both that I haven't studied for. I can't do this. I'm so tired. I really just want it to stop. I haven't cut in a long time, but I'm really considering it tonight. I just want the pain and the fear and everything to end.
