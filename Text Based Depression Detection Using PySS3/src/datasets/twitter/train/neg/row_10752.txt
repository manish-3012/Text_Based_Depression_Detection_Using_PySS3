What to doSo me and my bf had a fallout (not the first time) and I was suicidal. He broke up with me then called the cops on me, so now Iâ€™m stuck in the mental hospital. I canâ€™t live without him right now as he is everything to me. He says he is done fighting for us. Iâ€™m just so lost. What should I do??
