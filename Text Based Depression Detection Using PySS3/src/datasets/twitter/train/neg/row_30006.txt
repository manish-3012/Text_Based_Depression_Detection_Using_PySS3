Suicide would be a permanent solution to my permanent problemChronically ill with no cure and no more hope left. I've tried just about everything to try and make my situation easier, but nothing works. Doctors seem to give zero fucks about people like me. The life I envisioned for myself seems so far away, and reality is too painful for me to bear. The things that people take for granted - good health, a happy childhood, relationships and friends - are all inaccessible to someone like me. Aside from a couple suicidal gestures I've never truly attempted to kill myself, but I am more tempted now than ever.
