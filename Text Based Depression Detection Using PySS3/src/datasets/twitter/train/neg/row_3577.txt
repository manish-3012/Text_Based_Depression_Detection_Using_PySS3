Hopefully encouraging message for those suffering,There may be no such thing as fairness in this life experience, it's true some are more fortunate from the start. You can tell yourself what did I do to deserve this, I know at least once or twice in my life I have. But lately I look at it this way, someone is always going to be looking at my situation saying why are you not thankful? because the situation I'm in is so much worse, they're right &amp; I can look at someone better off than me &amp; be right saying why are you not thankful? but I have to look back &amp; remind myself why am I not thankful.

I do have things to be thankful for, it's just too easy to lose focus when I'm wrapped up in myself, that's why I need to stop &amp; really be mindful of what's going on around me. It's good to look for the positives, I may have to live alone &amp; have a cat as company because not even family can tolerate me, and I may have ibs which causes most food to be a nightmare to avoid &amp; be living with a heart condition mental health issues and a learning disability. But you know what, I can't change those things, and the things I can change I should focus on instead.

I've been trying to better myself lately, you may or may not know this here but I do have antisocial traits, and there are predispositions I deal with every day &amp; you may as well but it's good to prove to myself/ourselves I'm not what I was born as I'm who I make myself into.

Growing up all sorts of things can ruin us in so many ways, but it's good to get back up &amp; look for a way to get out or to fix what's going on, I'm not saying there are no hopeless situations but I am saying if you do have hope try to hold on &amp; keep going forward as mom always told me.

I hope this helps someone.
