I don't think people around me have any idea.I'm always surrounded by people at work (I work for a fairly big retailer) and none of them have any idea what's going on in my head, but its getting harder to hide it.

I only have 2 friends at the momment and it isn't getting better. If anything its getting worse, the only way I feel good now is through drugs, thats the only time i feel anything close to happyness. I remember being quite happy before, I only seem to be truly happy when I'm surround by people I like, friends, either hanging out at someones house or out with them. I can no longer do that and its getting to the point (Yet again) where I just want to end it. After a failed attempt 3 weeks ago I decided to just try and.. carry on. Just trying to survive isn't working. I don't have any social skills so getting new friends is almost impossible, I don't know where to go to meet them either. I'm constantly alone in my room. I feel so lonely.. I just want to have the guts to do it properly this time. No one should live like this, every day is torture.
