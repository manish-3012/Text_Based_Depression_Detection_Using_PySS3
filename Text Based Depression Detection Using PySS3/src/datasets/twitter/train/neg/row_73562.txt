Talk me off this ledge.My depression kicked back into full swing in November, worse than ever. I started going into rage-mode, sometimes for no reason. That has started to wreck my relationship, which is certainly falling apart. She doesnt want to leave, and is staying by me, but I push people away and I KNOW I'm doing it and can't stop. I'm embarrassed of this, of me. I can't have her close to me when I'm like this. 

On the worst day in November, I thought to myself "I give up". Things have become too much to handle. 

That scares me, so I give therapy one last try. It's never helped before, but I'm scared. Email 9 people. Only 2 respond. First one backs out last minute and bails on me saying "she doesnt think she can help me after all". Second one spends the time talking about her ex boyfriend and concludes the session with "Yea, I dont know how to help you. If you have any ideas, let me know." and hands me a pamphlet on depression. 

So even 'the help' doesnt want to help. Rejection across the board, when I didn't think things could get worse. That put me in an especially dark place. 

Then I find out my work contract wont be renewed, I'll be out of a job in April. 

Then I get injured and cant run, which was my ONLY vice and what was keeping me sane. 

Then I crashed my car, hit another car. Insurance isnt enough, I'm likely going to owe $14,000. 

This all started in November (well, really started 20 years ago when I first experienced depression/anxiety) with me feeling like things couldnt possibly fucking get worse and they just. keep. getting. worse. I have depression and no help, a SO I am pushing away, soon no job which means no insurance, no car, and in debt $14,000. 

I fucking give up. How could I not?
