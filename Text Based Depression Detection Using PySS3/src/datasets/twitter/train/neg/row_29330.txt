Out of the Game. Well, I'm going to go along with the option of suicide. I utterly despise my life and this world. I'm a young person (17 year old male and high school senior), but enough is enough. I've barely started this game but I'm going to permanently log myself out of it for eternity. I've decided to leave a vast note behind for anyone that wants to understand why I did what I did. It might be extremely confusing and out of the ordinary for most people, but that is how my thought process goes. 

I'm getting strong medication from someone that attends the same local public high school as I do. I have my parent's alcohol to consume that will counteract the drug to make death more probable. Overdose is not the safest and easiest way to go, it's actually pretty idiotic, but it will have to do. Nothing can fix my situation. All other avenues are not approachable or helpful.
