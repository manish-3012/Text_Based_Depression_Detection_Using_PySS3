I don't understandI posted here a month or so ago, and I did feel better for a bit. But I've plunged right back into the depression.

The thing is, I can't even figure out why I'm miserable. It seems that one day my problems don't feel like problems at all, but now they feel like problems that are so big I can't handle them.

I've tried to kill myself 6 times over the past 2 months, and each time I've failed. The only reason I haven't tried it for a few days is that I can't figure out an easy way to kill myself in my home village, I'm waiting for an opportunity to present itself.

I want to see the doctor, and I've got a scheduled appointment with the Children and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) people, but it isn't till April, and I'm not convinced I can last that long. They said that my case wasn't "urgent" enough for a sooner appointment, which makes me feel like a drama queen about the whole issue, like I'm making a big deal out of something that isn't a big deal.

I don't understand why I feel like this and I don't understand how I can get better if I don't know why I'm upset in the first place. Which just leaves me feeling frustrated and scared.
