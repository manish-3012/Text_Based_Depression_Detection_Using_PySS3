Autoimmune Getting The Better Of MeThrow away for reasons, I think some of my friends know my account and I don't want to overly alarm them...

I don't know, I think I need a place to vent, maybe. I'm in constant pain, I've had to modify my diet so strictly, I'm always tired, the medication I'm on isn't covered by my health plan and is considered chemo therapy. There are days I just want it all to end, and I have no idea how to do that other than letting go of the steering wheel, swan diving off of something, or just killing myself.

I've gone from medication to medication, to self medication, and I'm just sick of it all. I've tried what seems like every medical diet to no avail. I'm tired of the constant pain. I'm tired of being just fucking constantly tired. I'm tired of crying, of being different, of having something I never asked for. I just want to be pain free for a day without using a pain pill, or smoking cannabis, or drinking (and drinking can just make things worse). 

My family is somewhat supportive, but then they swing complete opposite to I'm selfish, it's not that bad, I need to get over it, my cousin has an autoimmune and it's not *that* bad how can yours be so much worse? I must be faking it, or I look fine so how can I truly be sick?

I'm just so tired of it all, I just want to stop being in pain.
