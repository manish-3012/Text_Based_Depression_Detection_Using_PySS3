Things are coming to a close.Well, all the last days of comfort I could spend are over today. Now it's back to the psychiatry or getting kicked out - and I know that the psychiatry won't fix the problems I have and have always had. The last stays didn't. 

I've succeeded at alternating most of my friends over the last months by just not answering or meeting up anymore. Since my psychosis I don't even know what's happening, I feel like I'm watching myself fuck everything up without being actively able to do anything about it. 

This is no life. The pain has to end before it gets worse - I know for sure that the good days of my life have passed and from now on I can only disappoint and hurt the ones around me more and more. 

I'm sorry.
