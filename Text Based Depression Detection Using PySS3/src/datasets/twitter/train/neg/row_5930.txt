I set an event instead of a date and the suspense is killing me (no pun intended?)Im waiting on a legal process to go through. But they take so long. And if the prosecution takes my side I cant kill myself. But if they take his side I will die. This is my promise to myself.i just want to die. Almost hope theyll take his side so i can finally die.
