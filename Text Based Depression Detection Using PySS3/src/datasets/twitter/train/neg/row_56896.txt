Suicide is the easy way outInstead you should stay alive, struggling every day of your life, fighting for even the modicum of self respect, watching everyone you know around have what you have and will always be denied, just so you can appease someone else's idea of what life is to them.

There is no reward for suffering and death doesn't care you fight or not. I'm giving in to it.
