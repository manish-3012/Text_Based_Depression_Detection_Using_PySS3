Losing passion for the only thing i love and dont seem to careI have made music over the past 4 years on and off. it all started pretty well got some noteriety and then i fell in love for the first time and got my heart shattered. That killed everything for me including my emotions/ability to feel after a couple weeks, i stopped going to the gym and making music for months on end. When i finally decided to try and make music again it was all forced since i couldnt really dig into myself and pour feelings out. Since i strted up again i have slowly been letting go and losing patience by the day. Today i just broke my mic and felt nothing for it at all

And its that simple fact that is making me want to leave. My only anchor to this earth, my only purpose now means nothing to me. I honestly dont know what to do with graduation coming up in a few months. I am not walking so will probably lose the few people i speak to currently on that last day of school so i am very comfortable with the thought of suicide. 

Just felt like leaving this here incase anything happens, its the tip of the iceberg of issues that ive had but its something.
