About to be one year since I attempted suicideOn October 6th itâ€™ll be one year since I attempted suicide. Iâ€™m still deciding if I wanna celebrate that day or go on as if itâ€™s just another normal day but I come here today to tell people life gets better. After almost a whole year of intensive counseling (2 appointments a week every week) Iâ€™ve become such a happier person  Iâ€™m not nearly the person I was a year ago ( the broken , depressed teen that wanted to end it all) i just want people to know it gets better no matter what youâ€™re going through and I figured Iâ€™d share my success story to those who need a little motivation. Donâ€™t be afraid to seek help itâ€™s the best option life gives you. My counselor recently sent me a letter saying congratulations for being counseling free and that she was so proud of the person Iâ€™ve become and it really made me cry tears of joy seeing someone be so proud of my progress. Iâ€™ll leave you with this lifeâ€™s precious enjoy every second of it â¤ï¸
