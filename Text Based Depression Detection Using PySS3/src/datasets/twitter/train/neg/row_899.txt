Too Scared to Die, Too Tired to Live. (A rant, I guess?)Hey, I donâ€™t know if the title makes sense.. but here you go. You know depression, lows and highs and lows and highs, a never ending vicious cycle. Iâ€™m in one of the lows lately. Havenâ€™t showered in a week (usually one every two days is my schedule), house is a mess for the last 2 months (havenâ€™t cleaned once) and I feel truly bad. I donâ€™t want to live anymore NOT because I see no hope for my future (I do, truly) but because I feel like even on my happiest days, I will struggle with depression and even the idea is making me exhausted. Almost like I am completely taken over by darkness but here is the thing.. I will never kill myself even though I want to stop existing everyday. Everyday I wish I wasnâ€™t present in this world; feeling, thinking... but I will never kill myself because I have an extreme fear of death (Thanatophobia). I was brought up atheist so I never had an afterlife concept, no hell or heaven, just darkness. I think it was this that caused me to have a fear of death from a young age. I used to have panic attacks thinking about death at the ages of 9-10. This never went away and I carried it to my adulthood as well. Thanatophobia is not only causing me to stay alive, but it is also feeding my depression. I simply cannot make peace with the knowledge of all will come to an end someday. And I will not be the one to determine which day that will be. So, this is not hopeful, this is not positive. This is not me saying â€œI will stay alive because I want to.â€ This is me saying fear has a big role in me being alive and it is a type of torture everyday of the week, constantly.
