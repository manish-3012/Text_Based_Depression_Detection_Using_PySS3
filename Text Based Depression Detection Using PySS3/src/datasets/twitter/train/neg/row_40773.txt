can someone tell me some scary shit about overdosingMy parents are handing out my ritalin and antidepressants as theyâ€™re needed because I canâ€™t stop thinking about using them to overdose, but Iâ€™m afraid to die in pain and distress (and for my family to watch me die that way) or to fail and have to live with the health problems it could cause

if anyone can tell me about any horrendous experiences theyâ€™ve either experienced or heard about Iâ€™m hoping it could scare me off the idea and lower the chances of me going hunting for my meds when my parents arenâ€™t home if I have a bad episode

Iâ€™m in the process of getting further help but Iâ€™m between appointments and on a waitlist for a mental health unit
