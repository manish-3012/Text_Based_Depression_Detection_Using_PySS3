I'm trying so hard to die.I'm autistic, I already now I don't deserve to live.

Another news story about parents killing their autistic child showed up on tv. A member of my family laughed and said 'oh yeah I know the temptation'.

A couple acquaintances talk about how 'if they had an autistic kid like that they'd euthanise it.' I hear people in my social work class talking about how much of a financial burden we are to society.

I've heard family talk to my parents about not encouraging me to get a boyfriend, because they don't want me to have kids. The offspring might be autistic, and no one wants more autists around to drain resources.

I know it'd be selfish of me to go down the path I want to go down. If I get a job, It's possible that it could be done better by a healthy person. If I find a man and marry it'd be selfish, too: either we produce more defective children or I'm taking up a slot that could be taken up by a healthy, complete woman.

I know I know I know. I've been trying to off myself for years to make everyone happy. I know it'd make the world a better place if I died. But I'm too much of an rslur idiot to do it right.

I'm so scared of death, but I'm so ashamed to still be alive. I know that there are better, more valuable people out in the world that deserve what I've got way more than I do. I know I should get off my ass and either try and be more useful, or hurry up and do my duty to society by removing myself.

I hate myself so much.
