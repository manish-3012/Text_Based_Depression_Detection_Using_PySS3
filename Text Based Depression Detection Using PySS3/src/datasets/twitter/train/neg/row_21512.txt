Please help, I don't know what to do anymoreI've been struggling with depression for a few years now. It actually got to the point to where I attempted to commit suicide 5 years ago. I still remember every single detail of that night. After I downed the bottle of pills and chased it with vodka, I layed in bed staring at my ceiling and I cried. I cried until I didn't have any tears left. I obviously didn't do it right because 5 years later I'm still here. You see the thing about my depression is that people think that after you get a little help that you're all back to normal. That's far from being true. I'll be honest though, I did feel better, happier even. It took me months to feel like that again though, I didn't just change overnight. Over the past few years after that incident I found myself still thinking about dying once in a while, but I wouldn't necessarily think about committing suicide. I wondered what it would be like to cease to exist. Over the past month I thought about dying almost almost every other day, then the past two weeks that was all I could think about, last night I was tempted to do something about it. I couldn't stop crying. I cried so much I gave myself a headache. I imagined myself taking the bottle of sleeping pills, and I imagined what would happen right after I was found dead. I wanted to do it, I really did in the moment. I just wanted to find the strength to get out of bed to take the pills. But I couldn't. I couldn't get out of bed. I didn't have the energy. I haven't had the energy to do anything in the past few weeks. I haven't gone to work in the past two weeks, I think I'm already fired. I literally haven't even walked outside of my bedroom the past two weeks. My roommate told me I need to get my act together, but that is easier said than done. I want to talk to my mom about it but I don't even know how to put these feelings into words for her to understand. I just don't know anymore.
