I want to die but I know it's gonna end like the last several attemptsEach time I've tried to kill myself, I've ended up in a psych ward. I've slit my wrist, overdosed several times, and I've nearly shot myself. I know that if I try again, I'll just end up in another psych ward. What scares me is the fact that I'm turning 18 tomorrow, and I've never been to an adult hospital. I'm sorry if I triggered anyone.
