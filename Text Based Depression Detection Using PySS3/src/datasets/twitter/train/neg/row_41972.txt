A hopeful foolI'm such an idiot...I was so worried other people and helping them progress that I jeaprodised my uni...now coz of 1 grade I may not be able to attend my graduation
I feel like a failure, I wanted to end my life before worried about trivial things and now I don't see the point in living as a failure
I can't blame anyone but myself, very disappointed in myself and I don't think I can take it anymore
