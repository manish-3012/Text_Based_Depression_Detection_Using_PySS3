Attempted suicide, haven't learned my lessonI hear about stories of people who attempt suicide (and fail) and it completely gives them a new perspective on life, but it didn't happen for me. I saw my dad cry for the first time ever, my mom wouldn't let go of me while I was fluctuating in and out of consciousness, as much as I absolutely hate to hurt them, I just can't help but want to end it again. I think about attempting suicide again every single day. After my first attempt I was forced to see my doctor, they took me off my antidepressants because they thought it's what caused my suicidal thoughts and actions in the first place. Now that I've been off of it for about a month now, I feel awful, I have terrible mood swings and lash out at people, I cry at random, I'm consistently forlorn and irritable. If I do give it another try, I'll take a much more straightforward approach. Even though I start therapy in October, I know it won't help. I'm just exhausted with all of it, with hating everything about myself, with thoughts of doing terrible things to myself, and being angry at the people who've made me feel this way. I want to live so badly, but I know someone like me can't.
