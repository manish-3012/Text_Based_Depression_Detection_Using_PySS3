Farewell (I think)Some might remember that last night I made a post saying I was going to attempt suicide that night, and that if I posted afterwards I survived. Well, I counted my chickens too early, and I had to postpone it until tonight (which is why I promptly deleted the thread). In the next 6-8 hours, I will be attempting suicide, and I've thought it all through at this point. I'm about to finish my note and I have the means to end everything. I feel more free today than I have in a long time knowing that I can finally rest. That's kind of ironic, isn't it? Feeling more alive than you have in recent memory because you've got the means to stop being alive?

Anyway, I'd like to thank all the wonderful people and mods on this page for being so supportive and for doing such a wonderful thing for the community. I've never once had I bad experience on here, and I'm certain that without SW I probably would have attempted sooner. I've only been here a short time, but I appreciate all the kind words and help more than you guys can know. Unfortunately, kind words aren't enough to keep me around anymore. Again, if I survive, I'll respond with an update. If not - well, you know.

I hope you all make it out of your troubles and live happy lives. I was just too lazy and selfish to fix my problems. You all deserve to be happy.

Later, lads and ladettes. Have a good one.
