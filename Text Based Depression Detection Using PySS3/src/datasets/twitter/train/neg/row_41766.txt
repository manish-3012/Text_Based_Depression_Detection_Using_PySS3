I can't take it anymore...All my parents do is fight.

About money, what each one does, what each one doesn't do. I'm fucking sick of it.

It's all my fault as well, If I'd never been born, my parents would be a lot happier, and a lot more wealthy.

I could talk to my aunt and brother, but I don't know what they would do.

I'm 16, and my parents have been married for around 27 years. My brother is 29 and lives an hour away from us. 

Once I was born, some 13 years later in 1996, I guess things really went down the shitter.
