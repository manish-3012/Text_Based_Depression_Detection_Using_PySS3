I think I'm really out of timeI've had a chronic pain/health issue for the last ten years since I was a kid and it's gone downhill badly since last year. I haven't had a job in over a year and live with my parents, Im in constant pain and have been doing a health procedure to try and fix the problem. It seems it's not working and it costs a LOT of money. I'm several thousand dollars in debt and can't really work especially not because of the lockdowns and Im in horrible pain constantly. My family thinks I should be doing more but refuses to believe that I am at my absolute limit. I don't want to die but I can't live this way, and I think it's time to go. Part of me is excited to not be in constant pain all day every day, I hate that this is what my life has become.
