Happiest When SuicidalSo long story short, I am suicidal. Have been suicidal and depressed all of my life. I've always been a hard working kid, but I have always been screwed over by everyone else. The worst part is that I am now happiest when I am fantasizing about killing myself. Suicidal is some dark stuff. 

I quit my 200mg of zoloft cold turkey because it did nothing, and I don't even have withdrawals. Even when I quit my adderall, I experienced no withdrawals. Meds only made stuff worse. When does life actually become good? Don't mean to be selfish, but if I still feel this way a few years from now, then I will happily leave this earth.
