I don't know I should just do today or notSo it's christmas right, got no gifts, no one other than a person who molested me as a child to celebrate it with who lives with me, no family that really care about me, no friends to see person and friends online who cringe at the mention of me being sad. So I think the only real option is to just do what I need to do, I know people say it gets better but honestly, at this point, seems a bit unlikely. Today I woke up depressed feeling awful, sluggish and today just feels even more depressing than other days. I just think it's probably poetic justice to just end it today, to say hey all you stupid abusers, you won't have anyone to abuse anymore now that i'm a corpse and i'll have a break finally.
