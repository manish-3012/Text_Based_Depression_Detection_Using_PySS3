I'd honestly rather die in dignity than live as a transgender outcastAnd both of these things would hurt my (conservative) family. I feel like I'm being crushed between two walls and the only thing to look forward to is death. At this point, even if all my problems could be fixed, I'm sick, I'm tired, I just want death and nothing else. I don't want to ruin my family. Why do I have to exist? That's just cruel.
