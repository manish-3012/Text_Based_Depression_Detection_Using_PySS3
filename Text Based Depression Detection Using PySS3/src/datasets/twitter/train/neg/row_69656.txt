Today I tried to kill myselfI got in a nasty fight with my mom. I always said if my mom stopped loving me or died that would be it, nobody would care if I died. I still believe that, but It never should have warranted this. I sat down, cut into my thigh, and took 13 pills. Doesnâ€™t matter of what. This gives me a high and I start feeling stupid and dizzy. Iâ€™m texting my friend and joking about all my trauma and iâ€™m just feeling worse. I tell her about what I did and she naturally got worried. She told me to throw up (I couldnâ€™t) and texted my mom and my best friend. It was such a stupid thing to tell her, but over sharing, my biggest fault, saved my life. At this point iâ€™m dizzy, pained, and nauseous. My mom bursts in yelling at me and tells me to sit down. I tell her i took 13. I never told her why. The paramedics come and iâ€™m sitting on the couch. My speech at this point is calm, almost robotic. I get overly polite around authorities because of deep psychological issues. They check me, vital organs are fine. Iâ€™m alive. Everyone leaves the room except for the kind paramedic who was taking my blood pressure. He asked me if I was lying, because I swore up and down it was an accident. I told him the truth. About my sexual violations, and my issues with self worth, and my father and brother. I told him how I didnâ€™t want to die deep down. I wish I did. That would make things easy. They left and my mom cried like never before. She told me iâ€™m her only child, she wonâ€™t get another chance. Thatâ€™s when everything hit me. It was like a new chance. A fresh slate. I looked in my room and imagined it empty. Everything had so much meaning. I couldnâ€™t imagine it going to anyone else, me not using it ever again. I just cried. Iâ€™m crying now. Iâ€™m so fucking happy I only took 13 pills. However iâ€™m not happy itâ€™s an uneven number. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll ever try to change it though.
