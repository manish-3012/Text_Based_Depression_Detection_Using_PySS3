I think i should end it allI dont know anymore, suicide sounds like only escape. Im using video games and internet to escape my problems, i have parent (my dad) providing everything for me, and thats okay thats not my problem even tho sometimes i think what will i do if he dies tommorow, i know this is really negative, but at this point in my life guys, i dont feel soo positive even tho im trying to remain and stay positive. Alot of hard days, im 15 years old and first year of highschool, my parents are divorced, i have no one to talk to, even tho i tried talking to my dad, mom, sister. But they just cannot understand me, yes i have infp personality, but the main issue is school, there was soo much points of my life where i wanted to drop off, i know my parents are expecting soo much from me. Thats what i cannot get with. My first year of highschool is finishing and i have 10% chance that i will pass. Mom told me if i dont pass, she will get me in her house (since shes much stronger finacialy than my dad) and she will make me work everyday, make me go to special school, study, and sleep. I am very open hearted being, i even made youtube channel to make my future out of it, i've always fought even tho im just 15, i've expirienced alot of fucked up shit. Everyone is expecting of me to pass this year of highschool which will be extremly hard for me, and im trying, im trying and its not working.. Alot of days are passing, and sometimes i am even crying, i should be asleep now, but i cant sleep cause every night im thinking about this. I cannot go day without stomachache, i just cannot do this anymore, seems like life got me. I just want someone to talk to, atleast here. Try to understand me guys, please
