Most likely my last post.Never thought I would end my own life.  No I don't want to talk about it.  My spirit just wants to be at peace.  Sure my family will be devastated, my friends as well, I told myself I would keep fighting until I couldn't.  I know my dog will wonder what became of me but I know she'll be taken care of.  My uncle tried to commit suicide but failed and now he's a vegetable for life.  I know my brother will take this the hardest.  But I trained him to be strong and the complete opposite of me.  Now I have a 9mm gun, what would be the most effective way to guarantee certain mortal wound?  From the side of the head or through the mouth?
