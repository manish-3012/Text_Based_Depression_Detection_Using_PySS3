What's the point of living if you're going to be aloneAs in without a significant other for the rest of your life? 

I'm a 22 year old male, I haven't had much experience dating before.  Nothing ever works out.  I've only been laid once in my entire life.  Women don't give a fuck about me.  I don't know how to make a move.  Women never show a shred of interest in me and that makes things extremely difficult.  

I don't ever see myself finding a girlfriend.  I don't ever see myself getting married really.  What's the point of life then?  To live single, alone and sexless? 

You may say "but when you and women are in their 30's things get better".  But that's fucking stupid.  For one, that's fucking 8 years away minimum.  Two, at that point the only way they would settle for someone like me is if their looks had given out on them.  Women ride dick after dick in their 20's until their looks give out and then they look for someone like me who can support them for the rest of their lives.  To use someone like me. 

What the fuck is the point of that?  To be used?  

When I look into the future the only thing I see is loneliness, or being used.  That's not a future I want to live.  Why not just end it all and that will be that?  No more pain, loneliness, depression, sadness.  Nothing.  It'll just be nothingness.  Death is something everyone will experience anyways.
