I wish I was never bornI wish I was never born, all my life I have tried to the best and help everyone the best I can. I genuinely feel for everyone. It's ultimately what led me to this, I am the monster for someone's trauma, and I don't know how to cope. It's all I think about. I just want that person and me to be at peace. Fuck. I'm so sorry. Then if it comes out, I cheated well there's another person who's trauma I caused as well.  I wish I was never born. All I fucking do is cause pain and suffering onto people, and I fucking hate it.
