I canâ€™t take it anymore.I think Iâ€™ve finally snapped. I have constant anxiety from constantly being berated all this quarantine. I donâ€™t think I have had a conversation since this all started that hasnâ€™t ended with me feeling like shit. So relaxing is out the window, and Iâ€™ve had constant depression for over two years that Iâ€™ve told my parents about multiple times, but they havenâ€™t done anything. I think Iâ€™m done with no one caring about me or caring enough about me to tell me that they care, but I guess I wonâ€™t know as Iâ€™m starting to think of the most painless way to end it all. I really some some positive words as I donâ€™t think I will have anything nice said to me for the rest of my life.
