I cant take it anymore...Someone please talk to meI am one major fu** up and i have ruined my life. I am 28, unemployed, have no money, living with my folks who help me out with my bills and expenses, i have chronic depression which ive suffered from all my life and since ive got older it just seems to be getting worse no matter how many different meds i try and how many therapists i see, nothing seems to make a difference.

I am a complete waste of space and just becoming a burden on my family. I am in debt from stupid mistakes and addictions and ive also wasted my parents hard earned cash which i had no right to and now they are threatning to kick me out and ban me from their bank accounts which they have every right too. I just want to die. Honestly ive had enough and dont think i can go on anymore. They will be better off without me ruining them, i could never repay them for everything they have done for me.

I have no friends, never had luck in dating and always been in and out of jobs and currently im long term unemployed on welfare and barely surviving. I cant even get work because i have no skills apart from retail and cant afford to go do courses/classes. I am also heavily tattooed in visible parts of my body which makes it hard to get work. 

So as you can see i have really fucked up my life and theres no way out this time, i cant go on anymore. I am a huge disappointment to myself and my family and they deserve better. Atleast when i die they can sell my stuff and get their money back and not have to worry about supporting their mentally fu**ed daughter anymore.
