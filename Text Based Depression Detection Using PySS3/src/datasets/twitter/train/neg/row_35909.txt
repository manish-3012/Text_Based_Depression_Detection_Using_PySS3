Classmate often semi-jokingly talks about wanting to kill herself. Am worried; how seriously should I take it?My classmate "J" -- not quite a friend, more of a casual acquaintance  -- usually seems pretty happy and non-morbid. However, recently she often talks about wanting to end her life and being fed up with living, or (more rarely) discusses various suicide methods. A typical exchange goes like this:

&gt;J [completely out of the blue]: Oh man, Eruanne, I am so tired of life. I want to kill myself.
&gt;
&gt;Me [seriously]: J, don't joke about stuff like this. Really, don't. It's not funny at all.
&gt;
&gt;J [while smiling all the time]: I'm not joking. Honestly, I want to die. I'm just too scared of the pain to actually Do It.

I am very unsettled by and worried about her behavior. However, I'm not sure if I'm taking her comments too seriously. Is it possible that they're just her idea of joking around? Or, should I do something to prevent her from harming herself? I care about her and do not wish her to come to harm.

I read the [Risk Factors post](http://www.reddit.com/r/SWResources/comments/ch7jn/risk_factors_do_you_worry_that_someone_you_know/), but I am not very close to her and so really don't have answers to many of the questions there.

(Also, if she really is joking, I would appreciate some advice on how to nicely tell her that the jokes are in rather bad taste.)

Thank you for reading.
