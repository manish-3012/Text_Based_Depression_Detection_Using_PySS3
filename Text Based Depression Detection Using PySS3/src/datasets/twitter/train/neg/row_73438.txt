Sometimes I think of the times when I was happy and itâ€™s too much to bear without cryingI miss wanting to live. I miss looking forward to every new day. I miss being a kid and not knowing what it really means to be depressed or suicidal. I miss my grandparents. I miss just being shy, not yet consumed by the anxiety that impairs me everyday. I miss seeing friends everyday at school. I miss my dog. I miss being able to cry and express emotions without feeling like a failure or like Iâ€™m broken. I miss having hope for the future. I miss feeling like a real person.
