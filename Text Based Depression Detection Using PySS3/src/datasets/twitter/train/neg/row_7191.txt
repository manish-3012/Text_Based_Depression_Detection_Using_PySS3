Wrote this poem about how I'm feeling tonightMind always self destructing;
I've started succumbing;
My demise is on the rise I can feel it coming

Why do I say my?
as if I have a sense of self;
I've been used up, and instead of in the trash, put back on the shelf

Why does anybody do anything?
Why are we here?
Just to suffer, I must admit there's nothing I hold dear 

We all die but who really lives;
I know it's not me;
The only time I feel alive is when I'm in my dreams 

I wish someone would understand;
And that would be it;
Selfish, sick, self pitying asshole, I guess I'm just full of shit 

Father said I cant kill myself;
"Nobody has that right";
Suffocating me since my birth is what made me see the light 

Family is just the same;
They nod and agree;
Their closed minds have closed my eyes to what this world could be 

I cling to anyone who sees;
The nature of their lies;
But to live in spite is even worse, I'd still rather die

Oh god;
You know I dont think you're real;
Still there must be someone to blame for the way I've been made to feel 

I guess soon I'll know;
What has been debated for years;
God or not, this life is already a hell crafted by my fears

Eighteen now;
I still can't see past it;
My misery decided for this world I am just unfit

It's cliche to say;
This is it, the final goodbye;
Not like it matters, or anything does, I'm ready to die
