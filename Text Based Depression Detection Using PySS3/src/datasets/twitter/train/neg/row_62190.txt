I felt determination earlierI felt determined to kill myself earlier, I still do I just donâ€™t want to leave my boyfriend whoâ€™s already had enough death in his life. Iâ€™m definitely not doing it tonight, itâ€™s his birthday. Should I break up with him before? I donâ€™t think I want to leave a note for anyone, I have a big competition next Saturday so Iâ€™m gonna do it after that. Iâ€™m starting to not give a shit about the people Iâ€™ll hurt after I kill my self, theyâ€™ll make it through. Theyâ€™ll live. Iâ€™ll just be a vague memory of that one kid that killed themselves, and for my family. I just constantly let them down, and Iâ€™m chronically ill so itâ€™ll just be a relief to them in the long run. I donâ€™t want to keep on sucking from society with my medicine and I have this pressure that I should give back and I just canâ€™t. Everyone will be fine eventually without me and Iâ€™m sick of trying to get help because Iâ€™ve tried and no one has done anything. And if I get admitted itâ€™s costing more money to get myself better, and honestly Iâ€™m not worth that much.
