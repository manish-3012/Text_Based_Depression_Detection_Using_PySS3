Poison is the way to goSo I decided to go ahead and purchase some Nembutal off the DNM, seemed like the best way to go about doing it. Quick, painless, peaceful. Anyways, here's a little bit of back story since I'm making this post my last one. Loneliness has probably been the biggest contributing factor to my sadness. I've been trying to get a girlfriend but haven't gotten past square one. I think I really blew it with a girl at work recently because she seemed really into me but now she's acting disinterested. So there goes my last chance. And I hate when people say "there's someone out there for you." Excuse my pessimism, but no there isn't because I'm nobody. I'm just a guy and an undesirable one at that. Why continue living if I'm going to have to do so alone? I feel like I'm working toward nothing. As for what awaits after death.. I don't know. Probably nothing. I hope I reincarnate into a rich family so I'll be able to get a girl but I'd probably be screwed over in another life just as bad so I'm saying fuck the one I have now. 20 years was enough for me. I'm out.
