Doctors stole my life with a botched iv. Now my body is a horror show and all I want, everyday, is to die a quick painless death.Had an MRI with contrast in 17. Radiologists conveniently forgot to tell me how toxic the iv was and some healthy patients (with normal kidneys) retain the toxin.

Oh and thereâ€™s no way to get it out. And thereâ€™s no research on the damage it can do.

A day later I lost feeling in much of my toes and fingers, blurred vision, insane fatigue, brain fog, joint pain throughout, vibrations all over that kept me up.

â€œOh geez,â€ the radiologists told me. â€œThatâ€™s so weird! I dunno what to tell you; maybe see your primary care doc!â€.

Gee thanks.

Here we are 3 years later and Iâ€™m no better, and all I do each day is search suicide websites for the quickest easiest most painless way to kill myself.

Thanks modern medicine! You sentenced me to a slow painful death for the crime of having a lumbar mri.
