Without music, I have no desire to live...I used to be a professional musician. I ruined it by trying to kill myself. Whatever. I kinda blocked out a lot of these memories but over the last 2 years it's come back. And now I just can't listen to music without breaking down crying. I just want to die. And without music, I'm nothing. It's the only reason I had left to stay alive. I hate my life. I just hate it. I hate it so much. I can barely play either without just wanting to die.

My money problems don't matter. Me being 7-17 days away from being homeless don't matter.

The only thing that matters is that I can't listen to music and I can barely play. That and I miss my daughter so fucking much. But that's my fault (and no, my ex didn't steal her away from me. People always assume this for some reason and it's frustrating because I love my ex wife and she misses me. I'm just an asshole running away from everyone)
