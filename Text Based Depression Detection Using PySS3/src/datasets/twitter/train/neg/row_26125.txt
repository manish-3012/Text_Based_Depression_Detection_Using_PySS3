6I mean to be perfectly honest, I have this preconceived mental anguish inherently tied to walking a couple miles to a mental health clinic.

I really don't want to do that.

But I also hate sitting here contemplating suicide. I can't fucking feel my head. 

Edit: Sleeping is awesome. It's like dying, but I get to dream. I try to sleep a lot.
