April 27Donâ€™t got any friends, just living marvel movie to marvel movie isnâ€™t enough. Canâ€™t recover these grades. Done dealing with this anxiety and depression, I think 10 years is enough, pretty sure this isnâ€™t a slump, itâ€™s just my life. 

Gonna stop trying at school, quit my job, write this screenplay. Gonna see infinity war opening night, then kill my self.
