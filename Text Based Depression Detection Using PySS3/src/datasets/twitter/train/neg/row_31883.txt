I want to die so badlyMy last attempt at a cry for help somewhere on reddit failed and i was called a liar and a drug addict.

I take narcotics for chronic pain, prescribed very legally, but that's not even the surface of why I want to die.

Nothing makes me happy. Ive been sleeping non stop for days. One of my favorite Korean singers killed himself peacefully and I've been researching how to do that but I have animals it could affect.

My bf and roommate would move on. They have more to live for. I took 7mg Xanax and a muscle relaxer in hopes to sleep for a long time. I know that won't kill me. Luckily I only have one Norco left or I'd just down them all. I hate myself, my life. I'm incredibly unhappy. I'll never amount to anything. There's just no point. My childhood abuse and self image is irreparable. I have no charisma. No one ever gives me a second glance. Endometriosis has taken half my reproductive system and my ability to have children, which I've always wanted to be a mother since I was a child myself.

I just don't care. My bf and roommate know how I'm feeling but went back to work anyway. If I live past tonight I guess I'll check myself into a hospital. Idk.
