i'm going to kill myselfi'm sorry but i just cant take it anymore. i'm 13, i used to have a lot of friends and now they all talk about me behind my back. i have severe depression and anxiety. i have and still do cut myself. i have no future and everyday it gets worse. i don't want to live. i just want everything to stop im worthless and no one cares about me. i just want to say good bye to the internet because the internet is where i felt the most strong. so, good bye internet.
