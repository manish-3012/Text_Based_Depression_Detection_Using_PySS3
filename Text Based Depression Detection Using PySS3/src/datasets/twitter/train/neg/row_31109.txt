I'm fairly certain the only reason I am alive at this point is that I am afraid of the pain.I can no longer find anything meaningful in my life and everything I do tends to add to the stress my wife and son go through. I'm not a good person and I'm an even worse parent. I have no skills nor any potential left in me to develop new skills.

At this point I've just degraded into a gelatinous shell that sits at home all day just hoping something will kill me without me ever knowing.

And, as I put in the title, the only reason I don't do it myself is I'm afraid of the pain. There is no way to kill yourself painlessly.
