I think I need help.So I'll be straight forward about this, I hate myself. I'm self-conscious enough to know I have good qualities like honesty and loyalty, I even put other people's needs before my own (usually to my detriment) and yet no matter how many good qualities are pointed out I cant stop thinking I'm worthless. It doesn't matter what I do, I can never stop this constant self-loathing. It's actually getting worse each day, the reason I'm even on here is because I'm sure someone has felt the same; at least one person. Im starting to get scared of my own thoughts, they used to just be passing and not really anything serious but now I'm lingering on them, thoughts like killing my own family, myself, complete strangers; and these aren't the normal "I'm so angry I could" type of thoughts. I'm damn near considering these things, which just makes me hate myself more cause that means I'm an awful human being. I don't even have a purpose, nothing seems fulfilling and it's as if I'm just waiting to die to be honest. I don't know what to do, I don't even know why I'm writing this; it's been 7 years of this constant hell, I hate myself with every fiber of my being. I guess I need help, but how do you get help for something like that? I'd just be wasting their time, I don't see a point in continuing this farce of a life; but I'd like to hear from other people who might be dealing with this, if that's a thing? I don't know, it might be pointless but at least I wrote down my thoughts i guess.
