I almost jumped todayMy father called the police and they showed up before I even made it out of the car. I had to call my husband to have him come pick me up. 
Now Iâ€™m mortified by my foolish attempt. Iâ€™ve never actually come close before and have not had these thoughts for long. 
How do I deal with the embarrassment? That feeling certainly doesnâ€™t help when Iâ€™m in this mental state.
