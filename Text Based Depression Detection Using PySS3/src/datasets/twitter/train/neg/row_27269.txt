I feel like I've given up. I'm simply existing... not living.My situation is the same as so many others. I'm deeply depressed, have a personality disorder and more trauma than I can comprehend.

My family is good, loving and caring. Tho they don't understand what I'm going through. I have almost no friends and no social life whatsoever.

I got kicked out of school, I'm half a million in debt and been on sick leave for years. 

Therapy isn't working, medication isn't working and I'm now more broken and exhausted than ever before.

Lately I've stopped eating, I sleep all day, suicidal from the second I wake up. 

All that is left is figuring out how I do it without my family or friends being the ones to find me and to minimize pain, fear and misery in the moment.

I want to die so badly and I can't tell anyone without being locked up in psych ward
