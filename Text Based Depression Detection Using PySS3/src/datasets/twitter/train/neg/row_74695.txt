Does anyone know what happened to this childhood feeling, and what it's called?Everything was so different a few years ago. I last felt it 2 years ago..n when i went to the fair with my family and to my cousins far away, and played skyrim.

That feeling i saw things differently. I don't see adventure time the way it used to be. I used to see it as a dark weird curious happy feeling. Now i'm just not so curious anymore. That is all. So pretty much i saw things way differently then i do now. When i was in 2nd grade it was soo there. (The feeling) 

i only could feel feel that feeling in my dreams

And a little but by past memories. It gets weaker and fades away. 

Without this feeling i am having a harder life, and things are a lot harder now. I am commiting suicide soon, but i at least wanna know what that feeling was.
It seems like i'm the only person in earth to ever have this feeling. Because nobody else says about it.

Just what happened to it? When i get extremely happy i just day to myself... yay living is fun, but not my lifestyle way. So i destroy it. What i feel now sometimes  is no way near that childhood feeling. Edibles are closest to it. Like 45/100%
