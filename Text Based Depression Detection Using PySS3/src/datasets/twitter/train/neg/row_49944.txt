Strange to think...about all of the friends I used to be very close with, who never had an inkling of the demons I'd battle off every day, and how they'll react when my balls are finally big enough to do it, and I do.

Good afternoon, to anyone that reads this. I am 19 years old, a student in college, and I am planning on ending my life at some point in the somewhat near future, by jumping off of the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, California. I'm looking forward very much to the last four seconds of my life before I hit the water at ~75mph (~120km/h). I cannot wait to see that pristine blue sky, and the bridge as it falls away from my feet. I can't for the life of me think of anything more beautiful than those four seconds.
