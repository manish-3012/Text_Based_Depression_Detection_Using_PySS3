It's over...Hello everyone. I've attempted suicide once before. There came a point when I just thought "Life isn't worth it anymore." Then as soon as something occurred in my life that I just simply didn't want to deal with, I attempted suicide. 

I got out of the psych ward and did everything in my power to give people around me the perception that I was over it. I'm not and far from it. I've come to realize that those people who *helped* me through the "situation" only did so because it was convenient for them. I understand people aren't suppose to care about m issues, but don't pretend like you do just to disappear when I'm actually going through worse things than I was before. 

Anyway, the mindset I mentioned in the first paragraph has returned. I have absolutely no desire to live. I feel alone. I feel worthless. I feel as if I'll never be good enough for me to be ok with life, let alone anyone else.  I don't know what to do. I'm not even afraid.. I just know my days are numbered now. As soon as something happens that I don't care to deal with, I'm going to attempt. Life has no meaning for me and I feel there is nothing/no one here for me in this life. 

I am mentally drained and simply tired of all this. Life has taken its toll on me. I feel cold. I feel alone. I feel lost. I feel useless. I feel worthless. I'm far from happy. Most importantly, I feel I just can't continue on with this life anymore. If you've read all this, I appreciate it, because you didn't have to. Thanks for listening...
