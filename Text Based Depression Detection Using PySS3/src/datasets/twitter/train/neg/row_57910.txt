I mean, I keep telling myself that it'll be good this year! Or I'll be fine this week! But I'm not going to beAnd then I dissapoint myself by having something happen, I just want something good to come into my life. Everything good is leaving and everything bad is coming in fast.




My life is nothing but a downward spiral.
