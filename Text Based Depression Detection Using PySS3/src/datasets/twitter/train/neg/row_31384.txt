Iâ€™m going to end my life. Too much pain, and my dog deserves a better home than this.Three years ago I was poisoned by a doctor; it was a contrast injection before an mri, heavy metals poisoning, and thereâ€™s no cure or way to mitigate the damage. Every day I feel worse - more pain, more stress, more bills. 

I got a puppy two months ago. Heâ€™s sweet and young and I hoped he would help things. But his potty training is stressing me out and making me realize a) that I have no friends and just bought him to get one, and b) I cant handle my own life; how can I raise him well?

So Iâ€™m meeting with the humane society Saturday to give him back. He deserves a home for someone who has a future, not some invalid who has no friends. And Sunday Iâ€™m going to end my life. Two problems solved in two days.
