I think about killing my self everyday.I donâ€™t want to use a gun bc I have no idea how or where to get one. Plus, i know i wouldnâ€™t be able to go through with it... mostly in fear that i wouldnâ€™t shoot it correctly and just end up in a vegetable state...

I canâ€™t take pills bc i have none that are strong enough and i donâ€™t want to end up getting my stomach pumped. 

Iâ€™ve considered slitting my wrists and letting myself bleed out but so many things online say it takes hours, itâ€™t not very effective (bc not many people cut the right area) and that when most people wake up they feel nauseas, lightheaded, and a lot of pain. 

I just wish someone would kill me or i would get diagnosed with something that will. 

I donâ€™t want to live anymore. 

But iâ€™m too afraid to do it. 

iâ€™m such a coward. 

i hate myself. 

i want to die.
