I want to kill myself but iâ€™m too scared I have severe depression and when I was starting to feel happiness it was all taken away yesterday. Iâ€™m back to constantly thinking about how much I donâ€™t want to live anymore. I need someone to talk to iâ€™m so stuck right now. Iâ€™m not good enough. I donâ€™t usually post much on reddit so this is really hard for me.
