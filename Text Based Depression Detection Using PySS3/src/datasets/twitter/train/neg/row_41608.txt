One Final effort...I "live" in one of the most expensive parts of the United States. I have severe depression that seems to be treatment resistant, severe anxiety no one seems to address in therapy, and an Austism diagnosis no one but doctors believe I have.

I don't want to die, I just don't want to be a burden to everyone anymore. They tell me I'm not but they're lying, I see the hurt in their eyes as I talk about my suffering. I've been homeless for years, sheltered by the kindness of people around me. I've been looking for work and that's not working.

I want to stop it all, lay down and just fade away. I have until January to turn it all around and *maybe* until the end of September to be hired so I'm not actually on the streets in January... I won't make the deadline, I know it. I don't WANT to make the deadline anymore. I'm ~70-80 applications down and only 1 interview and no offer.

I'm a failure, like I was told I was going to be for "not being respectful enough" to an abusive parent.

I'm tired of trying. I can't afford to live. I've never been able to afford to live. I have no future.

But... I made promises to people... I want to keep my word, so I struggle. I struggle as hard as I can (most of my fire's gone by now). I'll struggle until I'm homeless again, or I get permission to "go".

This will be my last, most desperate attempt yet. Here's hoping I either beat the odds, or get permission to take one last rest...
