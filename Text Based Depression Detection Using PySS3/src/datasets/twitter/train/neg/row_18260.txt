Incurable :)Hi everyone.

I don't know why I didn't think to do this before, but I literally just googled "can depression be cured." No, no it cannot. It can be TREATED, chronically, but I will never actually be rid of this disease. My therapist said someday I might be, but that was not true.

I should be upset by this. I should feel cheated and deceived, and I do a little bit. I should feel ashamed and angry at myself for not having the sense to just ask google, and I do a little bit.

But mostly, I'm relieved. This year was about asking the question "Will I ever be normal?" The excruciating hope that I one day could be was what kept me going until I had my answer. I had my countdown to January 8th going, since I'd promised you all I wouldn't go until then, but really I was just holding out a couple more months just in case life decided it wanted me around after all. But I don't need to anymore, because my question has been answered. I will never be okay. With an intensive, exhausting, humiliating, lifelong treatment regimen, I "could" have "up to" an average-quality life, the same one everyone else gets for free by reaching over and turning their alarm clock off each morning, but I will never be okay on my own. A simple google search just saved me four months of pain and lies, and I just feel so... Light.

I can let go of hope now.

I'm free.
