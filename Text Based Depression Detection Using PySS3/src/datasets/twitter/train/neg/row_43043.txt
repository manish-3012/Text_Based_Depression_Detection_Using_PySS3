My life.Hi, Iâ€™m new to this forum, but I will hopefully die in the next week and I just wanted someone anonymous and non judgemental to talk to.

2 days ago, I took over 20 500mg tablets of paracetamol and about 100 mg of fluoxetine (my antidepressants.) To be honest, I donâ€™t know if the fluoxetine will have any effect, but hopefully the paracetamol will kill me in the next week.

Iâ€™m a 16 y/o girl (I turn 17 next week) and Iâ€™ve struggled with severe depression and suicidal ideation for the last 2 or 3 years. I was also recently diagnosed with adhd which explains a lot as to why I struggle so much in life. I live with my dad who is a paramedic and has also suffered from ptsd and depression, so maybe poor mental health is hereditary in my family, I donâ€™t know.

I havenâ€™t told anyone about my most recent attempt, and I am aware of the gnarly effects of paracetamol poisoning, so Iâ€™m not ignorant about what I have done. So far I havenâ€™t really suffered any symptoms aside from fatigue and nausea after I first took the tablets, so Iâ€™m worried that my attempt was futile, but apparently it takes several days to take effect, so thereâ€™s still hope, I think Iâ€™m just paranoid.

Iâ€™ve written a note and subtly said my last goodbyes to my loved ones, and Iâ€™m not afraid of whatâ€™s to come, despite how gruesome. I just hope I donâ€™t make too much of a mess in the ER if I end up there.

To be honest, Iâ€™m not sure why Iâ€™m posted this, and hell, it will probably get taken down for â€˜glorifying suicideâ€™ or something, but I think I just want some non judgemental company where I can talk freely about my experiences in what will hopefully be the end of my life.

Much love,
Amie
