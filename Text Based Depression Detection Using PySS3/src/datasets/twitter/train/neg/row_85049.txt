I am a waste of space.I am so fed up. I think I am finally give up. I am at an all time low, and I'm not feeling hopeful this time. I have a husband who cheats and a dog who runs away from me every chance she gets. Those are literally the only things I have in this life that I can claim as my own. I have no true friends, my family only speaks to me to bug me about getting a job (which I still don't have). I don't even drive and I'm 21 years old. These should be the best years of my life and I'm not living. I'm just dead inside. Everything is meaningless. My husband is my only friend and I feel like I bother him by trying to talk to him. He's too busy with his "girlfriends" on all these new apps nowadays. I asked him for a kiss before he left for work this morning (which he used to do every morning) and he flipped out. My own husband hates me. I'm just done. I hate myself and I contribute nothing to society and I am just another mouth to feed. So, I guess this is me asking for help, although I don't want help. Idk. Last time i actually wanted help before i tried to kill myself i called a suicide hotline and I was on hold for 15 minutes. How ironic. Anyway. Just thought it would be nice to let someone know what happened to me. Even if it is just a shit ton of strangers. Idk.
