Ignored when I reach outAbout a week ago, when I was really desperate, I posted about my mental health problems on social media. I didn't get many responses--a couple of "hang in theres", "good vibes" sort of stuff. 

One person who responded was a former classmate. She asked if she could help and I told her I could use someone to talk to. She said I could reach out to her any time. It was late that night, so I sent her a message in the morning. 

The conversation was brief. I felt worse afterward. I really needed to talk to someone and she offered. I thought she would actually listen and be there. 

I tried reaching out to her again last night, giving her an update on the things we talked about last week. It's been a whole day and she never opened the message, but she's been on social media multiple times since. 

I found out yesterday that she was actually in the same city. It hurt a lot to learn she was here and didn't reach out since she's aware of how isolated I am and that I'm going through a hard time. 

It's really painful to have been given hope that this person cares/wants to help me and then have her actively avoid me. I don't know what I did wrong--I don't think I put too much of my problems on her in that initial conversation. 

It would help me a lot to have her to talk to, but she seems over it/not interested. I don't know how to fix or if I should try again with her.
