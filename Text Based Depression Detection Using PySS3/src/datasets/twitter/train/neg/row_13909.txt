I'm not entirely sure anymore.I've been through a lot of shit. Shit that I don't want to bother typing out again. Look through my posting history to see a glimpse if you're morbidly curious. 

To cope, I've turned to tinder. About a week ago, I met up with someone and we had no strings attached sex. I figured that nobody is going to love me and want to share a deep and meaningful connection, so I might as well just have copious amounts of sex. 

I found out this morning that this girl from tinder decided to have sex with me because her friends dared her to. And that if she did, they'd pay her $50.  

Iâ€™ve now been rejected, by women, *in every single way* that could have possibly happened to a man. Iâ€™m just treated so differently by women, compared to other men who just seem to have it all fucking together. I donâ€™t feel human.
