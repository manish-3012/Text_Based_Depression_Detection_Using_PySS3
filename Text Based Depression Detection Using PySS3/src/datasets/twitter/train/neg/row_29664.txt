How can you go all weekend just wanting everything to end, then Monday comes along, you go to work and those feelings go?So Saturday I screwed up. Not in any serious way but as with any screwup it gets to me. Last week though was exceptionally shit so it was pretty much the straw that broke the camel's back. So there I am, chopping up some veg for dinner, and just thinking how I could just stab myself right there and end it. I mean I obviously didn't, but this isn't the first time I've seriously thought that much about it. Probably the first time I've not been thinking "holy shit that was serious" after it, which I guess is concerning. Not like I'll do anything about it though.

But then Monday comes along. Wake up. Go to work. And it's almost like the weekend didn't happen. Why? How? How can I not feel like that all the time?

Then I get home and start to feel like shit again. Almost like all my mental problems exist at home. Almost all of them anyway.

Don't even know what I'm doing here. Will see what happens I guess.
