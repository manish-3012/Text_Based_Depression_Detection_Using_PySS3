A failed attemptAbout 9 days ago, I attempted to commit suicide. It was very rough. But I did go for it. Now still â€œaliveâ€ in a local hospital. I donâ€™t know for sure how the police knew about my attempt, but I believe that someone from OrganDonor(.gov) notified the police. I went there couple of days prior to my suicide to register as a donor; they must have noticed the scars on my wrest. Or I didnâ€™t look well that day. Thatâ€™s the only place I went to prior to my suicide attempt. Anyway, I still cannot find a single reason to be thankful for that Iâ€™m still alive. I donâ€™t think theyâ€™d let me go home, but I still want to do it ... they think therapy can fix me. I believe Iâ€™m damaged beyond repair.
