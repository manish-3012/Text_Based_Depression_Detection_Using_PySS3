How can I break my pattern of feeling suicidal?I have been feeling suicidal during depressive episodes (and in between episodes) for the last 4 1/2 years. The episodes started a few months into my PhD and I just assumed I'd stop feeling suicidal after I completed my degree, because I'd finally have my life back, but the thoughts are still there. 

Does anyone have any recommendations? Thank you!
