Feel trapped in a relationship that will kill me (by my own hand)I have been diagnosed as having traits of Aspergers and I have internet-diagnosed my wife as having Borderline Personality Syndrome. I feel that we are petrol and fire and should never have got together. However, now I feel very stuck in the relationship.

When we are together, we seem to have short patches of not particularly happy detente interspersed with huge periods (going on for multiple weeks) of her being very critical of me. Most of the time I am fine, but during our chats she is very persuasive and I start to think of myself as a monster and want to do harm to myself. I am, luckily, quite inept at doing harm to myself. The worst that I have done is smashed my head multiple times against a door or my laptop computer or a glass. One time we were outside when this was happening and I ran to go do something more immediate but there was no traffic at the time.

Twice I have left the house and gone back to live with my parents. The first time was because she was so mad at something I said that she asked me to leave (and told my parents on the phone that I could never come back). The second time was because our joint marital therapist said it was in my best interests for survival for us to take some time apart. She saw this as my therapist and me as ganging together, and since that she's been unwilling to go back to therapy.

But when we are apart, she is really bad at being on her own. I love her and I don't want her to be so distraught so both times I have come back before I've been ready to have the emotional onslaught again.

I don't know what to do because I know how the extremities of our relationship affect me but I also know that I love her and I can't bear how awful she finds being by herself.
