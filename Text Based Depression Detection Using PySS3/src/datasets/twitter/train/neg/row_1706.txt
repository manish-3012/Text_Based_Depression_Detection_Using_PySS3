Tipping pointSo recently my boyfriend broke up with on the premise that he doesn't know who he is and wants to work on himself.

We had been dating for 8 months and it this seemed to have come out of the blue. 

I really fell for him over the 8 months and thought that based on our communication style , we could get through anything. 

I don't really know what to do anymore. I often feel like "what's the point". I mean I'm 25 and for the most part haven't had much luck with relationships. I really want to build something with someone , but for whatever reason I always seem to push people away . 

Is there a point to to it all?
