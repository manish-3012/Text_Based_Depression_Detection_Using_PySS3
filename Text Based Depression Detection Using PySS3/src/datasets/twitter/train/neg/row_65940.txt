I give up.Its been too long. My life hasnt improved after 3 years. Im stuck in a loop of daily humiliation, discomfort and loneliness along with no qualifications or skills. I hate myself. My family dont care about me unless its trying to get me put in hospital for how i feel. I havent truly spoke to them for months now. I dont see my child. 

I dont feel. I just act. Ive realised i laugh eith my friends because they do. I wont tell them my feelings because who cares. They sure dont. I have no one to turn to but myself and thats only made me feel not real. Im not me. I dont feel like me. I dont feel like shit.

Whenether i leave the house i physically cant do it and go back home to sleep or waste away at a desk to try and ignore my feelings. I feel sad. I feel hurt like im constantly in pain. Whenether i hold a knife or weapon i just want to kill myself. I think of it daily. All day. I have breakdowns and sometimes just collapse. I cant do it. I want to die. I give up. I shouldnt be alive. I dont want life. I want to be gone. To not exist.

Thanks for just letting me put this somewhere. Since im too much of a coward to do it. Despite my numerous attempts i cant fucking do it. If you read this. I guess thanks.. Someone listened to my shit.
