I'm giving myself 1 more month. If things do not get better I am truly done here, I thought I'd never even make it to 21 so I guess it went better than expected even if it was mostly shit.Truly always wished the best and tried to make things better. I've realized that trying to help can make things much much much worse than they ever were before so I try not to do or say much anymore. But will always wish the best for everyone,every race, and every religion.  Just do one thing for me and others please. truly try to be the best person you can be and understand others a bit more before you try and cut them down. Try to find the good in a person instead of the bad even if they dont tickle your fancy if they did no wrong to you and your just pissed and want to bring others down just to lift you up a bit just dont. It doesnt help it creates a shit world and the shit cycle continues. Be a positive change even if you're feeling negative. Take care.
