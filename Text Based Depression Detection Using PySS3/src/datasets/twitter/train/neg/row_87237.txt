I wrote a mock suicide noteToday was a hard day. I kept finding myself thinking about the way I'd take my own life. After awhile I wrote a lengthy letter to a friend explaining everything and just saying goodbye. I felt a tad better for some reason. Not really sure why I'm posting here, I just still am having those thoughts.
