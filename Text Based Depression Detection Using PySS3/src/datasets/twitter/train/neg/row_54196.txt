A question about hospitalizationHave any of you ever voluntary committed yourselves to some kind of facility for depression? If so, does it actually help? There's one in my city with a good reputation, but I'm really ashamed of needing the help. I attempted suicide several years ago and I'm feeling the same trapped, hopeless feeling. I'm trying really hard to take a different course this time but I really can't take much more. I need some kind of relief or I'm gonna have another breakdown.
