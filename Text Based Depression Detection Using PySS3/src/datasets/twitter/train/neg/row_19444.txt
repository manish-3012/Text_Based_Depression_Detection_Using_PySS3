I attempted suicide last nightAs pretty much everyone here I've been struggling with depression for a while. I have isolated myself from the few people that cared about me and even changed countries, I just wanted to be alone and die. But when I finally went to do it I failed (no big surprise there). Now I'm completely empty, I don't jave the stremght to try agaim. I wouldn't even know were to start looking for help and I don't wamt to face anyone. I was thinking of quitting my job and not going outside for a while.
