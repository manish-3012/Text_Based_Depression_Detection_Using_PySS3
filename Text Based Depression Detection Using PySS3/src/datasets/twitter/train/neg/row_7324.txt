is there a right time to breakup with someone suicidal?im not sure if this is ok or not to post here,  but would like to get advice from people who are on the other end of the story

so i (21M) been with my long distance gf (19F) for around a year and 7 months, things started out well and we get along well i guess..she's says she's been suicidal for around 5 years, she never really got professional help because she can't afford a therapist and feels guilty taking money from her sister to go to therapy.

it kinda comes and goes i guess? like a month or two are really bad and then a couple of months are good, it happens randomly without no triggers, she's made a couple of attempts before but nothing too serious(?), she self harms sometimes, its just really tough i feel really bad for her, she doesn't really have many friends because social life exhausts her, she speaks with a friend of her once a week-ish, her family is ok i guess, mom is just not very logical and goes on a tantrum every once and a while and calls her shit, but in general i think shes a good mom and she care about her, she probably just doesn't know how bad her behavior is

this past month has been terrible for her, she keeps researching methods and testing them almost everyday, she doesn't wanna get professional help because she's just tired of it and thinks they wont help, and also because of financial issues. she also has to go to uni soon (because her family wants her to but i believe she can convince them not to) so its kinda like she is in a hurry because she can't deal with all of this, so she wants to do it ASAP.

i think im the only reason she's staying right now, she asks me to breakup with her everyday just so she can do it, not in a manipulative way she just doesn't wanna hurt me and prefers we breakup so she could go ahead..she didn't tell anyone in her family and i convinced her to tell her sister because she is kinda open minded, so she did but her sister didnt take it very seriously, she thinks its a phase, noone else knows but me and her sister know, she doesn't wanna tell anyone else because she doesn't wanna make them feel bad.

i convinced her to book a session with a therapist from my country because they're sorta cheap, she was like ok im only doing one session and if i don't get anywhere then its ok for me to do it? i was like we'll see..so she texts the doc and he says she has a borderline personality disorder and she read up on it and said the symptoms are alike..but she still doesn't wanna deal with all of this and just wants to get it over with, he prescribed her a drug that she could get and she said she might give it a try..she said she will find a therapist in her country because she doesn't want me paying for her sessions, so i guess there's progress?

anyway i just feel really tired, before i used to help, i'd try to make her feel better and all of that, but now i just can't, i feel exhausted and i became so desensitized to all of the things she says, it feels like the norm is her crying and wanting to kill herself everyday, i don't think i care now as much as i used to before, and i dont have alot of energy to deal with that everyday, all of this aside i'm not too happy with the relationship either, like its ok but i feel like what we had was gone.

TL;DR: i've been wanting to breakup for the past 2 months or something but i didn't because i'm sure she's gonna do it if i do, i genuinely care about her but i just dont think i can do this much longer, i don't wanna leave right now because this is probably the worst time to leave, and it feels like if she goes to therapy and gets better then i leave she will just go back to point 0 or maybe even worse, advice?
