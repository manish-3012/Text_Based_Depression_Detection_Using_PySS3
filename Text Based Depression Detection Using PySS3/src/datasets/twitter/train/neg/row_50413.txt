I've been in an endless cycle of misery, recovery, misery, recovery, for years, and it just isn't worth it anymore.I was abused for my entire childhood.  Sexually by my stepdad and emotionally by my guardians.   I have been to the psychiatric ward 4 times before. 
 I have some good days, some good months.  Sometimes, rarely, I feel like I really can do this.  Sometimes, like now, I feel like death is the only option.  I have nothing else for me in this life.  Currently, I'm falling behind severely in my college classes and I really don't have any friends.   

I moved out at 17; I'm now 18 and I live with my girlfriend, who is the literal light of my life, but I feel like a burden even to her.   I don't want her to have to listen to me whine and cry about my problems.   She's mentally ill herself and has bigger fish to fry.

I'm tired.  I'm tired of feeling like it isn't worth it.  I am tired of spending day after day yearning for something more, something good, something inspiring.  It will never come.  It never has, not after eighteen years.  I am so jaded, so pessimistic, and so alone.

I was a hopeful soul, but this world has really taken its toll on me.  If I go, the world will keep spinning. I sound like a broken record.  I don't matter.  I'm not any different.  

I think I'm ready to go.
