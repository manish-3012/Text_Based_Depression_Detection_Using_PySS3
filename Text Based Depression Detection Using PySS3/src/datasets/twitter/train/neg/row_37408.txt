I love life, but I'm just tired.I love life, life Is beautiful, living is beautiful, but I can't do it anymore. I'm really young and I'm ashamed about the fact that I feel like this. The stress is eating me alive, I have a panic attack at least 3 times a week. My family doesn't care or respect me, I don't have close friends, I don't have a hobby or a dream. I don't know what to do, i feel like shit. My parents won't let me go to therapy, not only because "You are ungrateful, when i had your age ...", but also because we don't have that much money. I don't have any time for myself (I don't want to specify the reason). I hate myself.

I just wanted to let It all out (Sorry for my bad english).
