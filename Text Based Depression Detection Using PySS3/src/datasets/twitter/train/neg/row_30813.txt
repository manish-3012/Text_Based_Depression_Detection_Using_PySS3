rantinglast week things sucked and i went to a complete depressive episode and it lasted until about wednesday. it sounds dumb saying it but i was super sad and blah blah blah. iâ€™ve been texting this guy for ages now and my friends said he likes me but we only text. weâ€™ve only talked in person twice and it was super awkward both times. tonight he was ranting about something and me being me i listened and tried to help him. since heâ€™s a grade above me we donâ€™t exactly hang out a lot so i suggest that if he wanted he could hang out with me if he gets bored one day and he said,â€ that would be super weird.â€ i replied with â€œokay haha.â€ then he said,â€ sorry, i meant that both times weâ€™ve talked in person itâ€™s been weird.â€ i just said,â€ well if we hung out more it would be awkward next time lol.â€ all he said was â€œmaybe.â€ so thatâ€™s great. i was really starting to like him too. that kinda brought down my night a lot. maybe he meant it in a different way but kinda sucks. i could be overthinking it but itâ€™s kinda ridiculous how much something so small can change my whole mood. iâ€™m not expecting anyone to cheer me up i just kinda want someone to listen. i could go forever to what heâ€™s said to me that was super kinda but i think iâ€™m just starting to like someone who wonâ€™t like me back- ever.  this sounds so dumb and petty because i know other people have worse things to deal with and iâ€™m sitting here at only 10 nearly 11pm overthinking things.
