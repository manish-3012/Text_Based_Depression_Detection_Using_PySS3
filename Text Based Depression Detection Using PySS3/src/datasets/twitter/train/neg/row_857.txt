Living for the sake of othersDoes anybody feel like they're simply existing for the sake of their loved ones? I'm a male going on 21, a CS major at a decent college, and I've been very fortunate in life, both financially and socially.  However, since about sixth grade this has put up no fight to my depression.  Regardless of what I have, I'm unhappy.  That's not to say I'm not grateful, but this being the sub I'm posting to, I'm sure there are a few of you who get what I'm saying.  Every day I feel like I exert so much of my energy just living that I find insurmountable amounts of block when trying to do things (i.e., socializing or schoolwork).  My parents would just assume I'm lazy, and my depression has pushed me into a repetitive cycle of wanting to self indulge; this is not to ignore my problems but to see if the faintest amount of hope can be found in something I enjoy.  However, I feel there is no enjoyment I find in things I like(d).  I simply do them on repeat with no real emotional response to them.  I can't remember a day where I haven't thought about killing myself at this point, and I feel it's growing ever nearer.
