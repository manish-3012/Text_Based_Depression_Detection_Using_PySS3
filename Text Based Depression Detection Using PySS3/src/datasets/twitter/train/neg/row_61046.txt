I feel like I'm watching my brain dissolve.I'll try not to let it kill me but I wouldn't be surprised if it does. I'm not nearly as intelligent or skilled as I used to be and that isn't going to change. I will probably be taken care of by my parents for the rest of my life. But I'm going to try and get a studio apartment by myself, in an area with public transportation, and see how it goes. Currently living in the SF Bay but not sure how to apply for more disability. Or how to ask my mental health team about increasing my disability rating, without seeming like a mooch and having ALL of my benefits taken away.

Also my girlfriend of two  years just left yesterday. But I'm pretty happy about. The relationship was destroying me and she took advantage of me. I am very helpful to my mom and mental health team for helping me recognize a toxic relationship and GTFO. But now I'm alone.

That's all. I'm not going to kill myself today but the chance is pretty high in the next few months, years, so on. I promised my therapist I would call a suicide hotline if I got the urge, but I'm not sure I'll be able to keep that promise if I am really feeling out ofi t.
