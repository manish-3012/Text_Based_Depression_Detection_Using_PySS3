A natural consequence"As for a spoilt life, no life is spoiled but one whose growth is arrested." -- Oscar Wilde

In the same way that a butterfly can never recover the dust of its damaged wings, I'll never get back what I've lost. I've come to accept this in recent months. Still, I refuse to grow accustomed to such a lowly standard of life. 

Like many of the lost souls here, I've been ill for years. In my case, a series of chronic ailments (insomnia, sleep apnea, OCD, brain damage) have combined to vitiate both my mind and body. My muscles have softened; my personality has grown dull; my spirit has waned. So while I'm only \[23 M\] on paper, I feel as if I'm \[53 M\].

I've wasted thousands on treatment options. Cognitive behavioural therapy didn't work. Post-concussion treatment didn't work. CPAP machine therapy didn't work. In essence, if you've heard of it, I've tried it and had it fail me in some capacity. 

The reason I'm considering ending it is not that I'm angry at Fate or anything like that; rather, it's that I see that I've outlasted my function. No one has any use for a man who can't physically exert himself, a man who can't think straight, a man who can't maintain a household. It has for years now been my dream to start a family, but I fear I'm entirely too unreliable to do that now. I'd much rather have people remember me for the person I once was than have them behold me as I am now. 

I'm too fucked up to detail things any further. I hope you guys manage to find peace, too.
