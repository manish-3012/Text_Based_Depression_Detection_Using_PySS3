I fucked up everythingI'm 24 and I'm a student. I'm in the third year of architecture (but I should be now in 5th year) but I can continue cause I'm mentaly ruined and its imposible to recover even if I would be healthy. I have to leave the university after 5 years of spending money of my parents (who have to work a lot to keep me there). They was always really proud that their son will be architect, now I be the only child in family without degree. 

I lose my contact with all my friends, and I didn't have any longer realitionship. I put all my energy in my future, but everything now is gone. A lot of people said that the ''highschool years are the best'' but for me was horrible. But I hoped that my student years will be nice, but still was lonely and depressing. Now even the hope that after the university I will be happy is gone.

For the last half of the year, Every day I thinking about suicide, the only thing keeping me alive, is that I know my family(mostly my mom) will suffer.

Sorry for my english, hope that is still understable
