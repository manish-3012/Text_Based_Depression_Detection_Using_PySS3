Failed yet againI've tried hanging myself multiple times, but I must be doing something wrong because I end up choking myself and not passing out. I can't bear living much longer, but the only methods left that are available to me would end up dismembering my body. I want to minimize the trauma to my family and friends my death would cause. What can I do?
