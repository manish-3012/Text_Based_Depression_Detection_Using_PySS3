The last strawSo I had been a successful employee for a long time. I had a project that was getting company funding and then something changed.  I became the scum of the Earth over night and now I'm about to lose everything I've worked so hard for.  They have denied my unemployment and my initial appeal. I'm now on my second appeal and fighting....meekly.  I'm about to lose my car for the 2nd time...the first time I lost it I was a single mom escaping an abusive ex.  My relationship is a sham and if it wasn't for my child I would kill myself. I would and it wouldn't be the first time that I've seriously considered it.  After my Dad died almost 3 years ago I considered it.  Like most teens I talked about it...and my Dad talked me out of it.  I wish I was dead. I wish I didn't have my child because it would make leaving this world so easy.  Nobody would really miss me.  I have very little friends. They use me to get what they want and I am always the people pleaser.  People don't give a fuck about me and I know that. So why stay?
