I can feel death on me and I'm feeling scared. I'm trying to reach out for help but nobody is answering.I can't take this feeling. I know they're not ignoring me on purpose, they're are just busy. I'm just scared atm. He told me he still loved me. I feel the tiniest bit of hope? But it's like my body is still killing me. It still hurts so much. If anything now even more. It just feels awful. Love doesn't matter in the long run and he'll probably leave again after he find someone else again. I just know deep down there's no point.
