I paradoxically do things that have no point in the hope they will have a pointLike this. If I say that I think about killing myself every day, I will get people offering to talk to me, but no friends in the real world. I'll be just as lonely. Even then it won't fix the amount of pain I feel every day. I don't see the point of existing. One day I need to get rid of my fear of dying.
