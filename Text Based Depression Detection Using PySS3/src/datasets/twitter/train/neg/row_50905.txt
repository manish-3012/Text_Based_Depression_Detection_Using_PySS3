Imma do it as soon as I finish UniSo yeah thats basically it. Currently Im studying international relations. My grades are good and I dont have debt. 

But imma do it. 

That career doesnt have any prospects unless 1. You are highly intelligent and innovative. Like researching or being an activist. 2. You have many and/or powerful contacts. 3. You are reaaaally lucky.

Im neither of those. 

Recently I was admitted into a research programme. Idk why I just decided that if it didnt have specific goals, i didnt want to do it. Im ashamed but at the same time is like I dont care anymore. 

Im tired of being dumb. Of having zero skills that could serve me in the future. I dont want to end up failing. I cant concentrate and feel like my brain doesnt know anything.

Anxiety is killing me slowly. I dont know if I should go to grad school... Or what masters degree to take. I dont want to flood myself in debt for nothing. 

While my grades are somewhat good, I dont think im able to gain a scholarship anywhere.

Recently ive heard so much stories of people in unemployment that studied that career. Im anxious, depressed, and dumb. 

So imma do it. I planned to be dead by 25 anyways so making it 4 years shorter makes no difference.  

(Sorry if shitty english)
