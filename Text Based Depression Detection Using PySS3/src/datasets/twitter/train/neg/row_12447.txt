my lesser life will finaly endi can finaly be of sume use to something for once, my dead corspe will nursh the earth, i will find somewhere deep in the woods and die there so my body will serve some perpous. 

no point in living like this anyway, and i cant get away from it its all in my head, this feeling inside it will never be true i can pretend its ok for me to feel like a woman but im not truly one and never have or will be, hell im not even medicaly treated, but here it ends now and forever my curse over, my suffering ended. 

and some will probebly ask me to stay, its like asking a person to continue to torture themself its a crule request and if you where im my shoes you would understand, that staying is no choise at all, no going back now, goodbye
