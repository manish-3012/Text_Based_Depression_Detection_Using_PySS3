What do you do when the only reason you choose to wake up the next day is so you don't hurt others? I am not fit for this world and want to leave but I know it will cause my loved ones far too much pain. The only problem is, the longer I stay, the more pain I feel and it doesn't go away. Should I sit and suffer silently so that my loved ones are free from grief, or should I do what I feel is best for me and move on to the next plane?
