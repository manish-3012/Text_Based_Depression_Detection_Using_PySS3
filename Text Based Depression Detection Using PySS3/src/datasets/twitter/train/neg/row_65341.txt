Last time I posted it it got little to no attention, so, excuse me for trying again. Losing all hope (if I had any)Uh, hey, me again. I'm still here.

I posted on here yesterday (well technically two days ago but who cares). Shit just keeps getting worse doesn't it. It seems as though life itself tries to push me off the edge.

Well, basically, I love a girl who I can't possibly be with. Wanted to kill myself yesterday (today?). My mom stopped me. She noticed, and shook me out of it.

Then I pulled up the girl's VK (russian Facebook) account, and... Well, she said something like "suicide is an option" and left for like 15 hours at that point. While I am suicidal (and she kinda knows), I don't want her to be gone, like, at all.

I reached out to her, got her talking. Well, that girl was taken, I knew it long ago. Now I learn that a) she got proposed to, and b) she may have cancer and is waiting for test results.

I... Don't know what I have to think. Shit just keeps getting worse, wounds keep getting deeper. I'm contemplating ending it all now, but I mean, I know I would absolutely obliterate her. I want to finally stop communicating and kill myself later, like I wanted to, but... What will happen to her?

I'm confused. I went through suicidal-worry and hurry-absolutely broken in the span of a day. I don't know what's happening anymore. I'm lost and very confused. I should have killed myself when I had the chance.
