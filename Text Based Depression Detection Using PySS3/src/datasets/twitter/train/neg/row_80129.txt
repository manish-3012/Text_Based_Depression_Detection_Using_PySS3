I am not too sure how to copeFor over half a year I have slowly gotten worse each day. What started as just anxiety that lead me to drugs is now much worse. When I feel alone I can't help but spaz out and lose control. I could be walkign down the street and suddenly spaz out to the point where i make strange noises or cries out loud that I cannot control and I start to grab out, either violently trying to hurt myself by grabbing at my head or pull up a fist. I found I am able to cope when I take sleeping pills and pass out for a few hours but I have been sleeping for over 12 hours each day because of this and I have tried drinking but I can't keep coming to this. I talked to friends and they either tell me I don't have control or that things aren't as bad as they seem but I only am bad when I am alone and I just feel so alone all the time. I don't want to escalate things I just don't know what to do and I keep having suicidal thoughts.
