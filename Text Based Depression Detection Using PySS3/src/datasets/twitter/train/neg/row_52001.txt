Giving upIâ€™m broken.

Iâ€™m giving up in trying to help myself. Nothing Iâ€™ve tried has worked. My life will be full of relapses and fuck ups.

I cut a few days ago. 

I stole yesterday. Iâ€™m a kleptomaniac. No Iâ€™m not proud of it, I just see something and I have the urge to steal it. Itâ€™s almost an unstoppable urge.

I want to stop eating again. I tried to go a full day without it yesterday, but it was too hard. Even when I try to fail I suck at that.

I donâ€™t have a therapist. The last one I had said that I made up stories about my parents not caring about me. 

Is it so much to ask to die?
