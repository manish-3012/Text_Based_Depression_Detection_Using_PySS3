I have felt like a worthless waste of space all my life. Today it feels like the world would be better off without me.I've been trying to write this post for the longest time and always chicken out or feel like it's not "good" enough (story of my life). But today I give no fucks and just need to vent the frustration I have that I'm still breathing. Today feels like the day to fix it.
