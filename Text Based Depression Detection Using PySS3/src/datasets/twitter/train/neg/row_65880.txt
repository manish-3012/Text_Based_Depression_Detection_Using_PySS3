How do I do get myself to do itIâ€™m 30. Iâ€™m done. I donâ€™t know what options I have left. Iâ€™ve had extreme ADD, anxiety, and depression for as long as I can even remember, I constantly try and do what I can to address my issues and it always falls short. Iâ€™ve realized now that Iâ€™m completely disabled and I canâ€™t keep going on, thereâ€™s absolutely no way I can survive in this world without going through immense suffering. I canâ€™t socialize with almost anyone, I just feel totally disconnection and afraid of everyone, I can barely use the phone I can barely even make this post. I constantly think about suicide I constantly put myself down all the time, I canâ€™t stand my existence.

I know people will react to it when they find out, they will probably be mad at me; maybe they will cry; I donâ€™t really care anymore, eventually you get used to it and move on. Iâ€™m tired of waiting for things to change, Iâ€™m tired of trying something new.

Iâ€™ve attempted before sometimes cutting but usually by trying to cut off circulation in my neck, but I always stop myself when I feel like Iâ€™m blacking our. I donâ€™t know how to push myself past that point and do it. I just want this all to be over finally I just want to do the right thing for everyone.
