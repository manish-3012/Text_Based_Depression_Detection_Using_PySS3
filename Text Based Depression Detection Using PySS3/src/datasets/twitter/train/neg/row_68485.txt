Tonight might be itIâ€™ve never felt so alone. I reached out to the few friends I have today to try and tell them whatâ€™s on my mind but I got nothing but disinterested replies that quickly faded. Either they donâ€™t think itâ€™s serious or they really donâ€™t care. I donâ€™t care anymore. I wonâ€™t have to. Iâ€™m writing up a note now and if Iâ€™m still feeling this way at the end of it Iâ€™m gonna do it. Goodbye everyone.
