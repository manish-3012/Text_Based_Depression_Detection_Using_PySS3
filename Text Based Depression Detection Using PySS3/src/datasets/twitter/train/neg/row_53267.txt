I think i want to be institutionalized I have had there urges since I was 10 years old, but this one is particularly strong.  I don't want to die as much as I want to escape.  I smoke weed about once a day after I get home from school, it helps me relax.  Lately I have felt that it is becoming a bit of a habit, and today my mom just found and took away my weed.  I'm grounded, and my mom is not sympathetic.  Between the SAT's, my classwork, moving between my mom and dads, lady problems, I'm exhausted, and I need a break.  I can't just drop everything though, or my life will become even shittier.  Suicide is an option I often dwell on.  Maybe if I get help It will also give me a much needed break.
