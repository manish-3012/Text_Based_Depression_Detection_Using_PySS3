Feeling like pulling it on my life this week just scared of whats next...So it has come to this, I hit rock bottom tonight my mom doesnt want anything to do with me due to a family feud my dad just cant help me at the moment I am simply coasting through life never have been loved never have anything, didnt finish college due to financial problems i am 29 and I am just done. I want to finally go to sleep, I am tired, sad whatever. I want to end it tonight but sadly im bunkering out at my dads house as I lost everything. I dont want to cause a big thing at my dads he already has enough problems. I know I am writing alot but sadly I have no one to talk to have no friends nothing, I am all alone. Ive been thinking of ending it with my six shooter gun or pills I even disconnected the airbag on my car in case I just wanna go for a ride. So many ways to just pull the plug. I dont care what happens here as I am more scared of what happpens next. I dont care what I leave behind people here wont care nobody cares. I just write this just cause I seriously have no one to talk to. Anyways just thought id leave something behind here I am just tired I really am. This week its gonna be hell on earth for me. Probably will go out soon enough
