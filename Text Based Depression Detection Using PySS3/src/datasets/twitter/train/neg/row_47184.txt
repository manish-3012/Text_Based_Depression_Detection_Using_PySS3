I think maybe I just need to let it out...and I can't talk to anyone.I lost count how many times I type something and then delete because I feel stupid.  I hate every word that comes out of my mouth.  Every feeling, every thought:  stupid, dramatic, annoying.

There's absolutely no reason for me to feel this way, but I just want to die.  Every day, same thought, "I'm done."  Over and over.  I'm done, I'm done, I'm done.

I can't get close to people because I fuck it up every. single. time.  I get scared and pull away, abandon before I become abandoned.  I can't talk to people because they don't understand, or they judge, or they have their own problems and I want to protect them from everything.  I think sometimes I feel too much for them and they don't feel it back and that makes me sad.  Even though I'm distant, I still...love people for who they are and I want that back but I can't find it.  Maybe that's what's setting me down a spiral today...I know I shouldn't expect it back.  I don't, really.  Maybe I just wish I didn't push people away so much. 

Life's okay, though.  I'm lucky, just so ungrateful, which makes me feel worse.  "Why can't you just be happy?"  I can't.  I don't know why, I just can't.  I feel like I don't matter.  Nothing does, which makes me feel like everything is too much effort.  What's the point?  I don't know.  I think I'm crazy?  I feel like I can't trust myself because I can't tell if my brain is distorting everything.  It's maddening.  There's moments of clarity when I feel like myself.  Brief glimpses of happiness.  No reason.  I have no control.  Then nothing happens and I'm crushed under what I think is depression and maybe I need help but then I think 'It's not that bad, people have it worse, you're just being dramatic' so I ride it out and wait for the next scraps of "Happiness."

Is it normal to feel this way?  Do people normally think about dying?
