Time to die, fellow Reddit users.It'll be next week. The Japanese household chemical method. Nearly everything is ready. I hope everybody will have a better life than I did, without rape, emotional abuse, abandonment. And I don't wish to become what I've been subjected to as revenge. Nah. I'll end it all. They'll find my corpse full of inhalated chemicals. 
Thank you for your atrention. It's not my first attempt. But now? I have nothing else to live for. And now I won't do it drunk. It'll be just like Mishima. Long live a way of life long gone. Long live Keats. Long live Wilde. The time is nigh. If there's hell, I'll see you all there. But there probably isn't. So. That's it. Needed to tell somebody.
