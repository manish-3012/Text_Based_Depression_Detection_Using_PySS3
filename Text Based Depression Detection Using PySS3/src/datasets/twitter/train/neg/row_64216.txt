My go-to friend doesnâ€™t really seem like she wants to help anymore.I was trying to express how Iâ€™m feeling to her, and sheâ€™s often a really good friend. She listens, is actually supportive, and tries to understand how Iâ€™m feeling most of the time. However, she lives in Thunder Bay, so I donâ€™t get to see her often (Iâ€™m in the GTA). She just sent me this text:

â€œBut I think it would be better if you talked to a professional as well (my name), I want to help you but I also have to look after myself as wellâ€. 

Man. That shit hurts so much to read. As if I donâ€™t try to get professional help as often as I can, but itâ€™s hard to get really close with a professional, because theyâ€™re rarely a constant person in my life. They always have to refer me somewhere else, and I have to start from square one again with that person.
Also, it sucks to think that Iâ€™m such a burden in her life that Iâ€™m getting in the way of her taking care of herself. It just hurts so much to feel like my best friend doesnâ€™t really care anymore.
