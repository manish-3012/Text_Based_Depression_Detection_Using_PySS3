DAE worry about who will find your body?I've been entertaining the idea of suicide more and more these days and I've come to the conclusion that it will all end for me very soon.  I worry about who will find the body.

Do you think it's better to just run off into the woods and kill yourself so you can spare your loved ones the trauma of finding you?  It seems selfish because then a police search might be warranted but maybe investigators finding my body would be easier than being discovered by a loved one.

Thoughts?
