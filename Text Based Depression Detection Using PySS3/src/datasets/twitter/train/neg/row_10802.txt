youngI'm a junior in high school at the moment. I made this account specifically to make this post. Sorry if the formatting is weird. This is my first time posting on reddit and im doing it from my phone. 

I constantly think about killing myself. I float through my classes making notes of what I need to do when I get home, knowing I'm not going to do it anyways. 

I spend 14+ hours sleeping. 

Last spring, I had opened up to a close friend about this. She did absolutely nothing. I had texted her. She didn't reply. I wasn't sure how to feel. We began to drift, me and her. I trusted her enough to know that she wouldn't tell anyone. Three months later, she told all of her friends that I caused her anorexia and that I was a bully. I relapsed self harming for the first time since freshman year and started getting into drugs as well. I feel betrayed. 

I have a 2.5 GPA. I either spend the rest of my life working a deadbeat job or I kill myself.
