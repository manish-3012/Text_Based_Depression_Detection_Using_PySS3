I have no passion to live on, like there's nothing I really care aboutI don't care about having kids or a family or even getting married. I don't care about getting a nice job or owning a house. There seems like there's no goal for me since there isn't anything I care about and I think about ending it a lot. Probably not anytime soon, but one day.
