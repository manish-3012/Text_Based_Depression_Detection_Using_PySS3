A little help from the Internet?So.. Let me set the scene. Its soon to be my birthday and my parents have told me that I can't get anything special this year because of low income. I understand low income into the house but could I get a little help from the Internet to prove that there are good people. If possible could you donate any amount of money to my PayPal, I'd like to get 40p so I can buy a guitar pick as I've been playing with my fingers and i cant bare it anymore.. If you would like to help please follow this link : https://paypal.me/pools/c/8qZ7bZLWbT
