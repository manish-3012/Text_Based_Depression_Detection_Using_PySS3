No Reason LeftI've got no reason to live anymore. I'm 26, living with a toxic parent, no job, no education, only one friend who lives on the other side of the country, I just got out of my first really serious relationship with someone that I really love, and there's no hope of getting back together or even seeing eachother again at this point. I have no money, no transportation, I have no options anymore to even improve my situation. I'm in the midst of the worst depression I've ever had. I wake up wanting to die, and go to sleep wanting to die. I'm tired of being alone. I'm tired of wasting my life. I'm just tired of everything.
