Parents pushing me to the edgeThe last few years have taken a real toll on my mental health. As a result I work minimal hours and play video games. I understand why my parents call me lazy and childish but it's the only way I'm coping right now. I can't take it no more. Every second is agony. I can't go on and I can't live for others just so they dont feel the pain of my death. I've fucked up.
