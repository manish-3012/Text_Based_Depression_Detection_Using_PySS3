I hate my life.Since Saturday(for the first time in years) iâ€™ve fallen in love with a girl(13 y/o me 17y/o) and my best friend makes jokes about it and he doesnt give me any hope to do it, i wrote at a other subreddit and the only response i get is â€žshe is to young for youâ€œ iâ€˜m so fucking mad and depressed right now. 
Next friday is a festival at our village and i wanted to talk to her but iâ€™m so close to giving up and dont do it.
