I don't even know why I am writing hereI want to kill myself. So badly. But I guess if I had the guts I woulda done it a long time ago. I thought about it for years. But now it feels different. Maybe it because I am listening to Frank Sinatra. 

I just wanna do it. I wanna do it so badly. But everytime I think about it, I think about my family. I will be dead, I won't care but my family will get sad. I am a lonely 21 year old guy who doesn't give any fuck about anything. For 3 years I have been staying home playing video games. I failed at my college and now my parents expect me to enter again. Which isn't much a problem. But I am really bored of my life. The biggest problem is my gambling addiction. My parents send me a little bit money every month. I spend it mostly on ciggaretes and gambling. Sometimes I don't even have money to buy food. I feel sad so I gamble to feel better,lose and then feel bad.

I don't even know why I have these thoughts now. I usually think about suicide when I am at bed and have nothing to block my thoughts.The next day when I wake up and sit on my PC it goes away. But now, I'm sitting on my PC having these thoughts. Probably I won't even commit today, I don't even know why I am writing here but I am feeling sad. Really sad. And the only good way-easy way seems suicide. All your troubles gone, all your sadness gone. So what is the reason I am not doing it?
