these are excerpts.  the free-form poetry style is original.

You can always kill yourself - L a t e r

JUST DON'T DO IT now.

Put it off - for another hour, another day.

If you can decide to let it hurt, without 

acting on the impulses for a little longer, 

with the right help, you could feel so much 

better that one day...

You will look back
and forget
what it was like to hurt so badly. 

Let yourself jump ahead in time,

to the day when you are free

from the pain and sorrow,

and you will look back

on the distant memory

of how you almost died,

but somehow you lived through it.
