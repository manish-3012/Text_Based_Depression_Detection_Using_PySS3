dont know why im sharing againrecently ive been having thoughts of ending it again for multiple reasons id rather not state. for a while after posting on this sub before i thought i was finally alright with myself, however in this past month ive been feeling very contempt with myself. i dont know what to say but i just felt the need to say this and let it out as i dont have anyone to talk to concerning my problems. no family and the feeling that ""FRIENDS"" wouldnt even give a shit, let alone comfort me as corny as it sounds. the main thoughts going through my head right now are how peaceful it would be if id just end it and the fact that no one would care or even find out if i ended my life. ive also found myself lacking the motivation to do a lot of things recently. also feeling like im just a nuisance to everybody and that im not wanted nor needed anywhere. i have also lost all sense of direction with my life and what i would do with is as it is a shitstorm right now. its also EXTREMELY tough trying to act like nothing is going on while im going through a lot just trying not to involve people with me. i genuinely dont know what to do anymore
