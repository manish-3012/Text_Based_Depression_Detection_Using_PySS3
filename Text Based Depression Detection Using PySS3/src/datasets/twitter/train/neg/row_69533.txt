I need help not doing itRight now, I have a heavy suicidal urge, my parents and brother are gone, I can keep this under control, but soon I won't be able to control heavy suicide urges, I need help not cutting my throat, according to me thinking more about doing it then school work, that's the best way for me to do it, it's my only option, apart from drug overdose, but I'd rather have a liver that works properly if I fail, but if I fail an artery cut, there won't be any problems apart from me being placed in a hospital or even a psych ward, but that's normal, soon I'll do it, I need help not doing it.
