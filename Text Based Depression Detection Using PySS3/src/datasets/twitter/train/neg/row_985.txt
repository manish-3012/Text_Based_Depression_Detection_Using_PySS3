Unmotivated and going insaneSo I'm an Asian student, schooling while working a part time job, which leaves me with no time for the family. They say the family would be no different without me.

Recently my mother has said that she would have rather gave birth to a pig instead of me as it would be more useful. I feel hurt. I don't know what to do. I'm trying my best to contribute. I've tried talking it out with them but they tell me that I only have work on my mind. I can barely manage my school fees with my pay and I'm on the verge of expulsion due to late payments. My father is too old to work and my mother is a housewife. 

The only reason why i haven't slit my wrists is because i know they can't do without me. But they seem to hate me or something. Help.

Im falling into depression slowly and it's taking a toll on my studies.

Final edit: You guys rock. To think that coming here would do me so much. That makes me feel slightly better, if only a bit. I'm gonna have to move out and find myself lodging and it's gonna be tougher on my wallet but I'm gonna try for a few more months.
