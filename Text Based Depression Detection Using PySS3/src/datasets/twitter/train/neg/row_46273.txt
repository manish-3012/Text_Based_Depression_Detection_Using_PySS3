Can't stop thinking about itI'm wondering if it's like an expiration date I've passed or something. 32m here btw, I've held out past being hopeless there just isn't a spectacular reason for me to continue. Life is just ok for some miserable for others, like drowning in tar with others. Crappy way to go, but at least you won't be alone.
