I hate mselfI've always been depressed. I had a difficult childhood and suffer from autism and have frequent meltdowns. I'm 18 years old and my first girlfriend of two years just slept with someone I hated. The last few months of our relationship have been really tough; we were moving to different areas and knew our relationship had to end at some point. The person she slept with is handsome, wealthier than I and a complete asshole. He was one of her only friends and made repeated sexual advances towards her that she told me about. She assured me that there was nothing between them and she had no interest in a relationship with him; he was just someone intelligent that she could talk to.  About an hour ago she told me she had slept with him and is acting like its no big deal and im freaking out. I just want to drown myself in the bathtub. I hate myself so intensely. I always feel inadequate and i hae no clue how to talk to girls or enter the dating scene becuase my social skills around new people are absolute rubbish. I feel like im going to be alone forever and have been betrayed by her sleeping with someone i had hated so fucking much. i just want the suffering to end. i've stared at my wall in the fetal position for two hours. please god let me die

EDIT: i just went for a run and broke down and sobbed in the middle of a field. Life is torture. I want out. ned someone to talk to.
