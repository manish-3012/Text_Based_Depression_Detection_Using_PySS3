29 and I feel like my life is overI feel stuck at my dead end job. I was a Peace Corps volunteer but left my assignment early which, years later, I still regret. I feel like my career could be a lot better but it's not. I feel like I'm waiting to retire to be happy. I tell myself only 20-30 more years then I can do what I want. I'm afraid to leave my boring yet very secure job and take risks. 

My friends don't call or text and rarely ever answer the phone. I internalize it and feel like I am unlikeable. 

Essentially I feel lonely and locked into an incredibly boring job where I'm not helping anyone. Im also in debt which adds a layer of misery. 

I don't see things getting better. I can't make people be friends with me. I can't make them answer their phone or text.
