I failed my college and my lifeIâ€™ve failed my college classes for the second quarter in a row. I promised everyone I would do better and I failed. Iâ€™m a failure and I just canâ€™t be on this earth anymore because of that. Iâ€™ve never seen a future for myself. I canâ€™t call a hotline because of not living alone nor can I even cry privately. I have no one in my real physical life to go to. I canâ€™t do this anymore.
