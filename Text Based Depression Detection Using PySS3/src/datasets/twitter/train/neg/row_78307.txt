I'm afraid of livingThroughout my life I've been through some dark places. Once, back when I was in high school, I first realized what it means to be alone. It sank in me just how terrifying it is to not have anyone to talk to, to listen to, to connect to. So I became desperate for something. A relationship, a friendship, anything. 
A few relationships and friendships later, I noticed that I wasn't a nice person. But I needed to be good. Otherwise, no one would like me. So I started putting on a new face, a mask. That of a good person. And the more I wore it, the more warped I seem to became on the inside. And the more twisted that mask became. It wasn't that of a good person anymore. It was that of a victim, of idk, a fragile person that needed help.
Eventually it became crystal clear how toxic that was. How toxic I was being to other people. I became a leech.
I am still scared of being alone again. But I cannot be around others anymore. I feel like I'm stuck in a scary place I can't move from. Deep down my guts it feels like suicide is the awnser, but not because I want to die. Because living seems far more scarier.
