I doubt Iâ€™m making it to the end of the month.I really donâ€™t know how else to say that. I have a few reasons to live, I know I do. But the reasons to just give up seems to be an ever growing list.

My few supports I have all want me to go to emerge and get help, but if I have to stay another four weeks in hospital, I know that when I get out Iâ€™ll kill myself the first chance Iâ€™m out of sight. 

I just canâ€™t stand being dead-named, or called he/him by people that I thought where suppose to love me no matter what. I canâ€™t stand the constant torture of my brain telling me I live in the wrong body, that my voice isnâ€™t the one that comes out of my mouth, that Iâ€™ll never be the person I was suppose to be. I canâ€™t handle the constant dreams of how peaceful it will be when Iâ€™m dead, like Iâ€™m just simply laying back floating in warm water.

Iâ€™m so tired. I canâ€™t wait till I can rest forever.
