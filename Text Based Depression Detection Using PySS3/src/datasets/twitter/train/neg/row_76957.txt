Bipolar suicidePeople seem not to care about me. I love my boyfriend and I could never leave him he's the person I'm still alive for. He's so wonderful all of our friends love him more than they love me. People don't love me and it has always been this way. Yesterday was my birthday and some friends did tell me happy birthday but the friends who we are close with didn't bother to tell me. One of them always asks me when is my boyfriend's birthday to give him something special and all, never asked for mine. We celebrated all of their birthdays, except mine. Fuck it hurts so bad. The pain radiates through my neck and my arms. 

I'm weird as fuck, I can't fucking bond with girls only with boys because they find my weirdness exotic or whatever. I know I'm not shit, I have a bunch of good things going on, why can't anyone see it. I'm hurting because I am so alone

I wanna end it and I will end it, I will disappear and I will grant my wish to be no one, to not exist anymore, to not bother trying again and again and again and again.i've been trying so hard but fuck why doesn't it work. Why doesn't it work. I want to bond I want to make something out of myself but I'm always stuck in that stupid loop that makes me either so fucking wild and unbearable or unable to move, eat or clean myself. I feel like I'm no one outside of my illness, it runs me and I don't want to be dragged along anymore. I don't want to be just like... A plant in the corner of the room. My exit will be monumental and my disappearance will be the beautiful gift I give myself, the freedom of not being anymore
