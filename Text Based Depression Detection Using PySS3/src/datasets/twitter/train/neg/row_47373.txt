Feeling suicidal cause of internetSome people on the internet unfairly bashed a piece of entertainment I liked.  They called me trash and that I like trash stuff.  And also that I'm not a true fan for liking the trash 
I feel like just ending my life to stop the pain,  it keeps on coming back no matter how hard I try to ignore it.  It hurts so much
