No one asked if I wanted to be born, like WTFSo I hate how my waking hours are spent working and working and working , doing what they want me to do , and then I get hardly anything, and the cities in the USA are violent crime impoverished shit holes, tell me how this is the best place to be?. You see I got HIV and have other health conditions and I find no enjoyment in life. I calmly explained to my parents that it is immoral for me to have child, much less them, when this world sucks so much. I find it horrible.
