I found out after my therapy session Iâ€™m desperate for attention. It sounds horrible but we all have it. Iâ€™m a prick to everyone thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m alone and thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m not ok. I did get bullied so afterwards I had self hate. I didnâ€™t want to show â€œmeâ€. I pushed away ppl without even realizing it.Thanks everyone
