Losing all function and will to continue.Tired of everything. I just want it so badly to end. My life has been a never ending cycle of disappointment. The thoughts of suicide are with me every minute of the day. I can't eat properly, I can't sleep, I can't talk to anyone, I just can't take much more of this. Everyday I go into work I just sit alone away from everyone until a customer comes in. I don't know what to do with myself anymore. The feelings are so strong that I can't even bear it. I genuinely feel like I've lost control of everything. I feel desperate for help but I don't even know where to look anymore
