I dont really understand why I want to kill myselfSo I'll set the scene. I'm 15 years old and I live in New Zealand. I go to a great school and my family is in no way financially struggling. I have 8 solid friends and am friendly with a whole bunch of other people. I'm not ugly by any means. I dont get shit grades and am in one of the top classes, which I can be in without working my arse off. But I still want to kill myself? Hmmmm? Is there a reason?
