I'm wilting from my inside/outI just wish there was some sense of happiness that was just for me. I feel defeated for recently being blessed with a beautiful baby girl but cursed by her mother and her unrelenting sociopathic behavior. All the while I'm staying someplace where I have no friends or family I can speak to. Ive been so adamant about being a difference for my daughter, i feel i lost my way while being here. Anyone that does know me and I speak with from afar writes me off to tell me about their proud lives they lead. I avoid telling my mom anything because I think she's already worried about my mind state. I always ask myself is it chemical, am I just being a baby or if I'm an organic Bukowski. Either way, it feels terrible this time of night alone thinking, then again in the morning to just go through the motions again. I keep telling myself don't kill myself, it'll turn around. But the sadness has been here as long as I can remember and I don't know how much longer I can endure it. I hope anyone reading this that has it resonate with you find your way/happiness too, because the void, the pain is too deep.
