Feel like After i get my debts sorted out, that will be the peak of my life, so end it there.I recently paid back a friend that i borrowed money from, it wasn't a substantial amount, but, for some reason, this overwhelming feeling of thats going to be the only thing thats good about my life has happened, just end it here.

I dont really know what else to say.. thats the long and short of it.
