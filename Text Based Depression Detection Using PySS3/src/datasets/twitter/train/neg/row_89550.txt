Should I go to the hospital?The urges are really strong now and I got triggered really badly by someone on r/depression (it couldâ€™ve been my fault) and like I really really really just want to stab myself in the face and I canâ€™t call anyone because my therapist is out of the country 

I know I donâ€™t deserve to be treated nicely but it really sucks when people are mean to me for no reason
