Lookin for a thoughtful, understanding allyI have plans in place to achieve my dream of dying peacefully, but I need just one good Samaritan that is open to my perspective and would ONLY be there to facilitate the process and make sure I can complete the procedure safely. It will absolutely not be violent or traumatizing in any way. I am willing to pay (although I donâ€™t have much) and even give into the whims of the second party if they had some sort of alternative interests.

Where might I go to find such like-minded, utilitarian, a person?
Iâ€™d like to avoid the dark web if possible, I simply donâ€™t have the money.
