I made my first cut and it felt so goodNow, just know that I'm gonna probably remove this soon because I don't want some certain people reading this. Today, I grew the courage to go grab a knife, hold it to my throat and make a cut. I had held a knife to my throat before but when I did it before, I didn't have the guts to make a cut.  It shows that I'm only one step closer to finally getting out of this hell hole that we call life. I know that now it won't be long till I'm done on this planet.  Luckily, I'm in online school right now and the camera quality isn't very good so people won't or shouldn't be able to see it.  The pain is still there but it doesn't matter.
