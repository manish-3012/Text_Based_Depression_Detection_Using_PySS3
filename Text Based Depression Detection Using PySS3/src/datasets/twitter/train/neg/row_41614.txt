I'm feel completely broken physically and emotionally.I don't remember the last time I've felt happy. I've been in and out of treatment centers and on and off of every medicine you can imagine and all i have is emptiness. I'll try anything to make myself feel happy, hobbies, school, work, drugs. Nothing works. I'll be distracted for a little bit,but it always comes back. It creeps in slowly so at first I don;t notice it but then suddenly ill be engulfed. I'll lose interest in hobbies. I'll lose interest in work and school. I don;t hardly attend classes anymore. The only reason I attend at all is so I can participate in some clubs. This has all been leading up to a sharo edge. I don't feel safe. I have guns and pills and knives in my home and I just want to get away from them to stop myself from thinking about them. All I think about is death. When I close my eyes I imagine what a bullet would feel like going through my brain and I hat the idea, but it's the only thing I can think about. I want to drive away. Six months ago I attempted suicide. I got in my car and got on a turnpike. I got my car up to 80 and just cruised for a while. I saw a tree in front of me and swerved into it. I woke up to paramedics trying to get me out of my car a short while later. They said it was "a miracle that not only had I not been killed but that I only had bruises." Because of this I can;t even drive anymore without thinking about the option that that entails. Now I'm just sitting at my computer with filth all around me thinking of how easy it would be to stand up to get the gun.
