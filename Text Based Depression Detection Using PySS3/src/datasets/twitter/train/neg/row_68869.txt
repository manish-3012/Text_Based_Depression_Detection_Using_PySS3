Quit feeding me bullshitMy pain won't  fucking end until I fucking kill myself. I don't know why I have taken so fucking long to do it. Everything in my life, I've deserved whether I caused it or not. Why the hell am I still alive? Sex &amp; getting high doesn't make the pain go away. It won't even make me feel numb anymore. I'm always fucking hurting and I need it to stop.
