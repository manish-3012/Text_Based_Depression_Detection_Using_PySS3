Things will never get betterI hate when people say that things will get better. They never do. When something happens, it's always negative. it only ever gets worse. I have no future and life is hell. My friends aren't supportive of me and never help. They just ignore cries for help. Not even Autechre helps.

Starting this summer I have barely any real friends and still, they aren't always there to talk to. That chapter of school is over and my friends from there are unlikely to stay friends with me beyond this summer or even for the summer. I can't be arsed to do all the work staying in contact with them when they show no interest in me back, despite saying they care for me. I'm starting in a school I don't want to be in next season with no friends, and I know it'll be a failure.

So when school ended earlier this summer, my life did as well. I only really have one friend outside of there and he's not good at supporting me when I feel like this, and the rare occasion when we hang out doesn't help me feel much better in general, only for the time being.

There's just no hope of things getting better, it's just not likely.
