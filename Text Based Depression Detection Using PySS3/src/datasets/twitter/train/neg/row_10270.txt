Iâ€™m planning to kill myself after I finish high school in June.Thatâ€™s it, Iâ€™m dying after Iâ€™m graduated from high school in June. I wanted to die before this, but I didnâ€™t want to get up on the schoolâ€™s bulletin board of suicide kids with one paragraphs of â€œhow they such a great person and all.â€ Iâ€™m gonna get school crap all done and over with, so thereâ€™s no mess of it when I die. Iâ€™m gonna finish community volunteering for theft I did back in February, so a criminal record doesnâ€™t get under my name and affect my momâ€™s case to get PR in Canada. I mean stealing was an impulsive thing, it was my first time and the first time i also got caught. I was just mad at how unfair the world felt like to me and how my family was so poor (which I donâ€™t blame on my mom bc she works hard everyday. We immigrated here 11 years ago and the Canadian govâ€™t has kept denying Permanent Residency bc weâ€™re Asian immigrants from SK where my mom is just a cook at a restaurant and my dad was deported a few years ago after trial bc of domestic violence. I donâ€™t miss him one bit.) 


Iâ€™m gonna trash my journals bc theyâ€™re personal and I donâ€™t want anyone to read them, gonna erase my social media with my name, wipe my phone and chrome book so my personal notes donâ€™t get found. I was gonna die on my birthday which is in November, and sort go full circle on life but I figured that wouldnâ€™t work out since I was planning to repeat/upgrade some courses and that means my mother will need to pay for it when Iâ€™m gonna die anyways. So Iâ€™ve set it to August 1st, because itâ€™s a nice date. Iâ€™m not sure where Iâ€™d die, thatâ€™s something I still need to think about. I have my suicide method figured out already, which is overdosing on my prescription pills, Iâ€™ve saved them up over the last few months so I can just go when I want to. They didnâ€™t do much anyway for my sleep. I thought I should prob quit therapy with my psychologist and psychiatrist but I think theyâ€™ll get onto what Iâ€™ll do, bc where I go itâ€™s a teen mental health centre where suicidal kids come in often. I donâ€™t want them to ruin my plan so Iâ€™ll play along as if Iâ€™m getting better. I thought of doing things I wanted to do before I die, but I donâ€™t have anything in mind that I want to do, so I guess Iâ€™ll just enjoy myself before dying. 


Well I think the hardest thing for me is to say goodbye to my cats. I wonâ€™t really miss my family since we arenâ€™t close anyway, and basically itâ€™s every man for himself in my household. I donâ€™t really have anything that Iâ€™ll miss about them, except for my mom. But Iâ€™ll make sure to give my two cats a good warm hug and a little snuggle, and tell them Iâ€™ll miss them a lot. I know nobody here will read this since so many post in here, but Iâ€™m here to say bye. 


Iâ€™m sick of the pointlessness in life and I feel detached from reality. I hate school, just to go to university and go to a job for the rest of my life. Everything is so bland and empty and boring and Iâ€™m just apathetic with all of it. My therapist once said that I didnâ€™t want to get better, and thatâ€™s why we never do much or get much done during therapy. Yeah, partly sheâ€™s right, I wanna die. But you know what I tried hard enough and I tried my best, I tried to control my brain and act like a normal functioning human being that has no trouble going to school everyday. And you know what I tried to react better to my mental illness and make progress. Yâ€™all told me to be positive all the time with a positive mindset and not choose to be a victim but a survivor and every other motivational bs they throw at me, but not once did medical professionals acknowledge the effort Iâ€™ve put in in trying to get better over my 18 yrs of life and try to be positive. Iâ€™m sick of so many people telling me to see my reality and wake up or be grateful or be positive or try harder or any other bs. Iâ€™m done, and Iâ€™m tired. Iâ€™m tired. Iâ€™m done with all this shit.
