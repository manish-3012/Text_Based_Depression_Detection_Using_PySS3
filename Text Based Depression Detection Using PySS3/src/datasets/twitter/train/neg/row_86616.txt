I donâ€™t want to be here any moreMy family hates me. Their so mean to me everyday and always scream at me. I hate myself so much, Iâ€™m so ugly and fat and situating I canâ€™t stand to look at myself in the mirror. I donâ€™t want to be here anymore, I canâ€™t take it, no body would care if I left. I donâ€™t have any friends at school and the friends I do have never want to hang out or ever respond to my texts to hang out. I had plans to hang out with a couple friends to night and they all never responded on what time or where we were gonna hang, even though they said they could hang out earlier. They donâ€™t like me, nobody likes me, Iâ€™m so weird and awkward. My parents are so mean to me and I hate them so much. I just donâ€™t want to be here anymore, it would be better and I wouldnâ€™t have all this weight on my shoulders.
