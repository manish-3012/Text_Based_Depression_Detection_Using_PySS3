Fuck itMy life is in such a state I canâ€™t even be fucked with a spoon to fix it. At this point whatever, worst that can happen is I can be homeless and starve on the streets. I donâ€™t care. I need a job ASAP but Iâ€™m too tired to audition or try to find something more stable than theatre.

Historically, those closest to me have abandoned me. The one constant is myself, so maybe if I remove the common issue, weâ€™re good!
