All the stress and lack of free time is killing meI have been watching this subreddit for the last couple of days, always before I go to sleep. I'm an university student and due to corona virus, our school is closed as any other. The teachers send us so much work, we have to write so many essays and seminar papers that I can't really do anything else. I'm not good at handling these stress situations and deadlines and therefore it's even worse for me. I have a dream, a goal that I want to achieve and I already hate the fact that I can't work towards it like I'm used to. To be honest, the only thing that keeps me studying is the "free time" that we normally have plus holidays. Since I was young I have been anxious regarding my future, as I was growing up, I developed social anxiety and on top of that, from time to time I'm depressed. Many times, I was thinking about suicide and in fact, I think I have been suicidal my whole life. Because I live in a country that still isn't too familiar and open to mental health, I can't do much. To shorten it, I'm feeling horrible, sometimes I even feel physically horrible, due to this mental state of mine.. I feel like I just.. can't keep going like that for much longer, but there is nothing I can do about it, if I told anybody close to me about how I feel, they would look at me like I'm crazy. There is so much stuff I would want to add, but It would be too long and I dont even know if anybody is reading this. I hope it all makes sense..
