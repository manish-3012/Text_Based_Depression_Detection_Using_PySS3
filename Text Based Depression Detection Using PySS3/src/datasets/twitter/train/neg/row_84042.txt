5 days now constant thoughts and plansI am going to call a local hotline soon to talk to someone. I feel like it's getting worse. There's like this burning inside of me....and the fire is just growing and starting to get out of control. 

I basically plan on doing drugs enough to put me in a dissociative state. Then cutting myself until I lose enough blood to hopefully just die. I tried it before but the blood clotted....so going to use aspirin to thin it out.

I have struggled with suicidal thoughts before, I have never had them as strong as they are right now. I am not in IMMEDIATE danger....I plan to work my next couple of shifts and was planning for days off.

The reason for killing myself is that I don't feel I will ever find  a good relationship. I'm physically attractive (I don't have that view but girls my age tell me), but mentally I am so far beyond fucked. OCD/ADHD....I self medicated with alcohol for all of my 20s...isolating alone. Avoiding rejection. Avoiding abandonment. I started to get seriously sober (admit at this point I am an alcoholic/drug addict) this year...and it's all hitting me, just how much of life I pissed away with my drinking. I'm 34...I've never been in a serious relationship. I just hid, and drank.

I could go into detail about more reasons but this is the main one. I have no confidence sexually because of the lack of experience. I have insecurity over size from all the porn I watch...like, from what I can look up I'm average. just completely average there. So it should be fine I know.

This is going to be the thing that kills me...I've dealt with addiction, joblessness, financial ruin. I have honestly been doing so well lately but I feel like this specific part of me is broken. I'm in a small town, dating options are limited. Maybe I need to move back to a bigger city.
