I'll just leave this hereIn the last 6 months, my wife has left me, I've lost my home, I've been informed by my ex that I'll never see my stepdaughter again, my mother passed away... I have nobody left to find a note so I'll just leave it here. 

I've got nothing left. I've got nobody left. And I can't keep doing this everyday. People keep saying it can't get any worse, and then it always does. I just can't keep doing this over and over and over. Losing everyone and everything. I could tell my therapist but she would just call the police. And the last thing I need on top of everything else is to survive and add new medical bills to it. Some of us just weren't designed to live in this world. I've tried so hard for 42 years and I just can't keep doing this

To anybody that reads this, thank you for at least being somebody in the world to hurt my voice before it was gone.I've just tried so hard to live my life as a good person and all it's brought me is pain and suffering. And I just can't do it anymore.
