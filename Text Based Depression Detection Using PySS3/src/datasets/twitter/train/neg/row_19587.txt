Suicide is what I want but I'm too much of a cowardI want to commit suicide but I'm just not brave enough for that. I stand by over the edge, urging myself to jump, knowing after just a few short seconds, I'll be at peace. No more stress, anxiety, depression or self harming. But I'm too much of a coward. I carry on each day, yes my bf knows about the self harming starting again, and that I'm back on medication ðŸ’Š as that's impossible to hide when you live and sleep with someone, i keep walking to the local bridge, slicing my arms and urging myself to jump whilst he's asleep. I know he loves me, I know my family loves me and I know my friends love me. But I simply do not love myself. I hate myself. I'm just not brave enough to do it ðŸ˜ª
