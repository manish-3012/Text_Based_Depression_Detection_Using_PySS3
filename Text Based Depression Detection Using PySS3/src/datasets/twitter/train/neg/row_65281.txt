My life is a dead end rutI'm suicidal. I have been for awhile. It's just something I've pretty much come to accept. And I'm reaching my breaking point. I'm 17, and honestly I feel like a complete failure. My GPA is awful, I try but I do terrible, my friends are slowly leaving my life, and I constantly want to change how I act and how I look because I find myself ugly. I'm constantly feeling like my parents are disappointed in me, and that they are just feeling like they have to help me because I'm their son. But everything I do is just, wrong. I just want to be done. I want to give up.
