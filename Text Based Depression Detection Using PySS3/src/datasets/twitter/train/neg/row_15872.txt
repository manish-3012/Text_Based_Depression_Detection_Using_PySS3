Was very close to jumping off a bridge. I can't get it off my mind.A couple weeks ago, I had a very horrible relationship with this person, let's name her Annie. 

We were both very good toward eachother, and then out of nowhwre, I was blocked and told it wouldnt work. I was upset. Not enough to make me do what the title says, but then more things compiled on. I was proceeded to be harassed by one of my friend groups that I had (kinda like an "I told you so" but with more rough uses of languages). They all unfriended me and blocked me. Now, I was really in the dumps. Then, the word got out to a very very, very large chat where the news spread. I am *extremely* sensitive and cant take these things well.

I unplugged, I had a one set mind to do "it". I walked down the road, to the left and up a ramp that led to the bridge, right above the highway. 

I just remembered staring down at the racing cars below. I was scared. I then began to climb the fence, but then police sirens came and my body froze. I was in shock, becuase I realized what I was doing. I was brought to the local hospital and treated by social services and said I was alright to go back home. I am seeking therapy but at the same time it's taking them forever to get back to me. 

The thoughts are still on my mind and I really don't know how to cope with these thoughts and how I should approach them. I just want to forget about it. I dont know how.
