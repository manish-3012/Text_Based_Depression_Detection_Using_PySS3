My life is a constant embarrassmentEverywhere people laugh at me. I'm some fucking joke for everyone to enjoy. Everything I try or do, I just end up embarrassing myself. Literally, EVERYTHING I try. I just fail, fail, fail and make a joke out of myself. It's like a fucking curse or something. I literally took a walk outside 30 minutes ago and somehow managed to make my brother and father laugh at me because I was scared of a bug. And then when I come home, my father yells at me for being scared. This is just every day things.

Everyone laughs while I suffer in the darkness, unknown to everyone.

I'm ugly, dumb, stupid, and a loser. Good at nothing and good for nothing. There's no use in anyone telling me, "oh don't say that you're good at this, good at that" because I know it's all bullshit.

I would've killed myself when I was 16 but I didn't, all because of my shitty dream of being a comic book artist.

Now that I've matured, I know how pointless everything is. Even if I become a comic book artist, so what? I doubt anyone will care, and knowing my life I'll find a way to embarrass myself again. I'm so used to it that at this point I expect it. 

My body is so pathetic and worthless. It hasn't done shit for me except let me down. I'm so limited by this pathetic, useless, body.

I have no idea what to do anymore. Tbh I don't even know if I should kill myself. So many things have happened. So many damn things. 

Idk if I should bear with my pain and live a boring, lonely, embarrassing life or if I should just end it here, and have no clue what's next.

I'm just going to wait until I get out of college, by then I will have made a good decision.

But suicide is looking hot rn.
