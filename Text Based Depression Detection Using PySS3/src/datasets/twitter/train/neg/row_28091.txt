I made it to 20...goddamnit...Listen to this relationship well you read but finish the song https://youtu.be/lP077RitNAc

if you seen my post history you know I wanted to go before I got the 20 but here we are

Still stuck on this godforsaken planet

I ran out of meds a few days ago and felt kind of clear-headed but then I started taking meds again in the depression came back so I don't know if it's some kind of switch a Ro shit it or not

I don't know I don't really care anymore

Grandma sent money I got socks for my birthday and payment off my debt that was cool I guess

Neither of my semi close friends texted me though so

Just another reminder nobody gives a shit

I'mma start building that suicide player so y'all can listen to it before I go

Y'all should tell me if I'm missing anything or not

I'm going to class

Late

Again

And without breakfast

I think I'm going to go ahead and just not go into class

Let's be really honest with ourselves if I walk in the class, I'm gonna distract someone from learning

So I'm just not gonna go

So everyone can learn in peace

I'm just gonna go get breakfast

I'm sorry I post so much here

I should stop so I don't push someone else's more important and urgent post down

Maybe I'll just go back to r/depression

I don't know

What do you guys think

I don't care anymore
