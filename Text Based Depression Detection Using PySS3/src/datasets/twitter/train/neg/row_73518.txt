Preparing to Commit Suicide.This may not be the right subreddit, I do not know.

I have spent the day writing out all the letters I plan to leave behind.  The general thought being that in the week or following week, all the necessary arrangements will have been made.

It's been very difficult to write all these letters - alot of tears have been shed; and of course trying to come up with right words to leave behind to old friends, previous loves, and especially family.

To me, it's the first step to moving forward with the plan of action; to attempt my best to tell everyone that it wasn't their fault; they should feel no burden; and that there wasn't anything anyone could have done otherwise.  

The letters would be sent immediately before; at least that's the thought I have right now. 

I know this is all very morbid stuff - but I've been conflicted about this for a very long time. 

For those I know it will impact negatively - I've been away for a very long time; so my presence just isn't there.  There really isn't anyone who could physically stop me - so really it comes down to me pulling the trigger or not.
