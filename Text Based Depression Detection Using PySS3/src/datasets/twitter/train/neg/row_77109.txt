cant stop suicidal thoughts... 2 nights ago i got into a argument with my girlfriends sister at my house and i called the cops because she was drunk and hitting me. when the cops got there my girlfriend told the cop i choked her last month. i have never laid my hands on her or hit her sister back. i didnt want her sister there because they were all drunk and waking kids up. i was in jail for a night and am getting charged with second degree assault. when i got out and came home she was gone and took all the kids. im so depressed... i dont know what to do... ive been diagnosed with depression, bipolar, autism, o.d.d, and a.d.h.d. i guess i might want someone too talk too? i really dont know... i havent slept or ate since wednesday... i havent been able to really stop crying... i feel like the only way to make this stop is to end it but i cant do that because my kids so i feel like im trapped here suffering... but the thoughts wont stop... i feel like im gonna snap and do it...
