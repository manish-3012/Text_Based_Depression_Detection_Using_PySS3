HeartbrokenI've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, depression, and anxiety (but im not sure it has anything to do with this) and it always seems to ruin any type of relationship I've had. I have serious issues with jealousy, possession, and im quick to anger. I wouldn't ever intentionally harm someone, especially someone I love, but I always end up driving people away. Psychiatrist and therapists are no help, they don't listen they just wanna shove meds down my throat, and for the last year I've just been isolating myself. I get attached way too quickly and from there I get obsessed. I don't think ill ever be able to maintain a healthy relationship with anyone and that scares me but id rather get the best help I can get rather than hurt someone. I need advice, im going out of my mind. Is there some sort of disorder I have that i don't know about?? Or is this actually apart of who I am?? How do I get rid of these feelings?
