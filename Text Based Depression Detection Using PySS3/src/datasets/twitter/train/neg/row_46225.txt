Why is suicide even a thing we try to prevent?It just seems really dumb. I never asked to be apart of a society or be apart of a family if anything it's selfish of them for forcing me into something I never agreed to. I can kind of understand trying to prevent the death of someone important, but even then I could raise the argument that it's selfish for to oppose this onto even them. It's even more selfish to oppose it onto someone like me who doesn't matter in the gram scheme and will most likely be replace by someone else who can take my place. I doubt anyone would particulars care especially since I'm the annoying one in the group; besides I never talk to my "friends" anyway. I never liked my mom so I really don't care how she feels about me offing myself although I doubt she would even care for too long. I've always been too afraid of doing it not because of fear of what's after death but more of the pain I would have to go through to get their. If the option of a painless death ever arise for me I'll make sure to take it honestly. The feeling of fear has kind of left my body. I should give out gifts just to let the backlash of the whole situation sit with them as punishment for making me live in something I've never consented to.
