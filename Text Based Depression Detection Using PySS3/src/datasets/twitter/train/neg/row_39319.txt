My surgery was cancelled because of covidFirst my best friend who's basically a brother to me dies and I can't go to see him one last time because of COVID. 

I get laid off and now I have a new job but my body decides to just break down. I'm a transgender man and my period started again. HEAVY. 

I start this new job and only a few months in I'm rushed to the ER early in the morning due to how terrible the bleeding is. 
I'm told it's a period. 

I'm in agony both physically and mentally. I'm cramped up, very dizzy and just feeling awful. My surgeon doesn't think that it's a period. 

I get an ultra sound, they find a mass. I'm put under and they take it out to test. No cancer thank God. 

But I'm still bleeding and no stopping in sight. 

I'm put on birth control that gives me pregnancy symptoms and it stops the bleeding. 

I'm scheduled for a hysterectomy on the 16th. My period returned today. I got a call today. 

Surgery is cancelled, I'm going to have to get use to having a monthly period till further notice. 

I've been on hormones for 8 years, I shouldn't be having a period. 

I just hate my body so much, I miss my brother so fucking much, I can't see my parents this year and my mom's sick I'm terrified I'll lose her too. 

I hate everything so fucking much, I'm so afraid right now for myself. I've not been this close to the edge since I was a teenager
