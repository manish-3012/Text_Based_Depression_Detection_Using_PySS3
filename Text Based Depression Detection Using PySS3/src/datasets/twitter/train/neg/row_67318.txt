I want it all to endI've been fighting anxiety all my life and depression. I'm so tired of fighting. I can't get help because of the stigma that surrounds parents with mental illnesses. I don't want to be labelled a threat to my toddler even though I do my best to take great care of my kid. I'd rather die than be an abuser. I grew up being abused physically and my mom still emotionally abuse me. She says I'm selfish and a bad person for being depressed and needing to take medication. My husband is controlling and is sick of dealing with my mental health problems. He doesn't want me getting help because he doesn't want social services involved again. 
My child deserves a happy mom and unfortunately that's not who I am. I don't know if I'll ever be that person.  I hope God can forgive me for feeling like this because I sure can't forgive myself.
