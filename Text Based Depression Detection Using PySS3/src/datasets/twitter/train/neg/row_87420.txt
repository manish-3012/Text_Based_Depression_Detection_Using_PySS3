Being An Empath Is Keeping Me AliveTonight I realized something really key for me in my battle with mental health.

As much as I think about ending my life (daily), I have not once actually attempted it, and tonight I realized itâ€™s because I am probably one of the biggest, softest empaths to ever exist. 

Being an empath is a double edged sword. A lot of the reason for my suicidal thoughts is because I have prioritized everyone elseâ€™s emotions/well being over my own for my entire life. I have never once put my own needs first and am now dealing with the repercussions of that. My life is not the one I envisioned for myself when I was younger.

However, the same quality that has arguably ruined my life is the one thing keeping me from ending it. 

Knowing that my mom would be absolutely devastated. Just the thought of putting her through that kind of pain literally makes me sick to my stomach. Any time I imagine what it would be like if I actually went through with it, I am overcome with guilt and sadness. 

This is probably a good thing, because if I didnâ€™t care about how it would affect other people I wouldâ€™ve forsure done it a long time ago. 

Iâ€™m not sure what the point of this post is, other than I guess hoping someone else can relate. Itâ€™s 4am where I live and I canâ€™t sleep but writing this out has helped me sort through my thoughts a little bit. 

I hope we all find peace and hold onto a sliver of hope that someday shit will be different.
