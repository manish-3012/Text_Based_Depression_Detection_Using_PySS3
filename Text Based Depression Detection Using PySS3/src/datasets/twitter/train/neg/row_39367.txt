How do i break it to friend(s)/?Long story short - In college, Age 17, Gay (nobodyknows), no talent, bad grades, dead end part time job, starting to self harm, considering suicide.

I don't plan on telling my family at all, but i really need to tell someone IRL, i'm too scared to ask my college tutor if there's is a Councillor let alone talk to one. I'm not incredibly close to any of my friends to just drop in the conversation that i'm suicidal, and if i did i can't imagine one friend that wouldn't just pass it off attention seeking or just wouldn't take it seriously.

It seems easier to write it in a note and just do the deed when my parents go out for the weekend or something.
