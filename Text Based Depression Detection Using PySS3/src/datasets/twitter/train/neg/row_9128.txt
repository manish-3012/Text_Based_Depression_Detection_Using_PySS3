Nobody tries to consider my opinion.I dont know where to start. Well here's a start: My parents divorced recently, but they think I'm stupid and dont know what a divorce is, when they constantly praise me for my smarts (I just do all advanced classes, I dont even get all A's, just A+B's.). My mom, being the only person I can truly love, told me that my dad had already divorced once. He doesn't give me privacy, constant dirty jokes he laughs at and thinks I dont understand, when I'm just trying to steer the conversation, and the 'I'm gonna do/get/learn/build/buy etc'. Everything I've tried to find fun in reaps nothing. Life, none. Video games, none. Friends, none. Love, hell none. Pets, none. YouTube, none. Reddit, none. I'm just tired, that's all. I just need to sleep some more. But I'm already sleeping to much. My brother, 4 mins older, is annoying as shit and constantly hates me. I'm manipulative, spoiled, and needy. I just want to kill myself. Like a jump or shotgun. I dont want anyone to feel like I want to blame someone. Just be a out of the blue death. Make people think about in serious light for once. I dont think I'll do it for a while, unless theres another uphill battle. I've got less than 10 friends who are keeping me afloat. Maybe one knows about my suicidal thoughts. I've got to go. My dad wants me to go to church. I'm atheist, but to scared of his reaction, if he would listen. Night everyone.
