Alright Iâ€™m Killing Myself NowWe have no water, no power, no service. Things just keep getting worse and nobody cares. Somehow the mini school WiFi still works. Which is why I can even type this

My parents are going to run us to the ground because their incompetence with money is astonishing

Meanwhile I canâ€™t do anything about it. Iâ€™m broke. I have no car, I have no money, I have nothing to exchange for money. What now? I canâ€™t ask anyone for money. 2020 was supposed to be mine but now itâ€™s ruined because of them. I was going to beat them. But I guess they win again

Iâ€™m done, Iâ€™m killing myself. I know exactly how to do it too. Itâ€™s perfect. Soon Iâ€™ll finally be at peace. Fuck you, fuck me, fuck everybody
