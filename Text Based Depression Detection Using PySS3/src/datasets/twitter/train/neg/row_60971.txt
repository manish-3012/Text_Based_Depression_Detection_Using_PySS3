Everything is a burden, including myselfMy life is going nowhere why shouldnt I just kill myself. I thought once I did something with ym OCD then it would be obvious. I dont know what to do now. I have NO goals and I dont know what to do now, I cant handle living on my own, I cant drive, I cant do anything. I seriously dont know what I am supposed to do other than end my life.


I feel like everyone is trying to make fun of me and make me as uncomfortable and miserable as possible
I just dont see a point in trying to be with others if all they do is hate me
And someone will say I love you if anyone reads this but you dont actually, you barely know me. Im just an insignificant speck on the world, there is no way you know me, I could be faking it. In fact I am faking my personality
I have none of my own so I do this shit
