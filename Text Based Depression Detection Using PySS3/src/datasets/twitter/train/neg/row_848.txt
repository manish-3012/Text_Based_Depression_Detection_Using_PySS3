hanging in there for too longI made some mistakes, and managed to run from the consequences. I ran because I was afraid, afraid of what would happen, afraid of what I would lose. Now I am afraid of what it would do to people I care about. Every time in the past few years I've gotten down enough to contemplate suicide, I've taken steps to deal with the consequences. And every time a new milestone I set to fix everything is passed, I realize how little effect it had, I'm no better off than I was before.

I'm living a triple life. I never tell anyone everything, so at best the people closest to me only have a partial view of what is going on. But I can't do it to them to tell them, that is unacceptable. I will not tolerate the loss, nor would I manipulate the loss away. I refuse to.

But yeah, now my last ditch effort is holding thumbs for the next two hours or so. If things work out, then maybe I will make it through this month, but only to have to face problems next month. Next month's already going to be harder.

If things don't work out. Well, I don't know yet. It's not like I'm going to kill myself, that takes planning and resources I just can't afford right now.
