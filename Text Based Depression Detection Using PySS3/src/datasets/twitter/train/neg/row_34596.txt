I'm stupid, stupid, stupidI'm incompetent, stupid, and lazy. I have 2 brothers, my biggie (22/23) and i used to be close, he fucked his higher ed, and is on his third chance, he play sports and very sociable. my lil bro (16) is epileptic, currently at private school, he's our best hope. Me (21/22) an idiot, somewhen in my childhood, i stopped being sociable, i was and still is a shy, but this is different, i'd mumble to myself, and as soon as school's out i'd lock myself indoor, doing nothing, have stopped studying too, if there's a guest i'd run to my room and hide. These habits didn't die until highschool, when i decided that i want to live in some other town, i still haven't started studying though, i think i've completely stopped studying outside of classroom. Have i stayed and enroll in the school where my dad teaches, we woulda saved a lot of money, and waste a lot less time, now i regret everything, i enroll in a night class program of some second grade college, for a useless degree but that won't matter because i've learnt nothing anyway.
I've been a burden my whole life, there's no way i could survive this, i will stop being a burden and end this as soon as i can.
