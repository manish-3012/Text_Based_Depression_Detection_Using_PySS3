CalmMy body and mind have calmed down now. Would be a nice time to sleep and not wake up. Googling ways to kill myself. How many of my anxiety meds would I need to take?

I don't want to die. I don't quite know how to live either. Live how I want. 

My soul is tired. Unable to please my parents.

I want off the dreadmill.
