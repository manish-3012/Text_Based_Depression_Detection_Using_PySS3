I donâ€™t know what to doIâ€™ve fucked up many times in my life and just recently was probably my worst. I feel like my life is going nowhere. Iâ€™m in college and Iâ€™m on my way to failing out. I canâ€™t focus on anything and I accidentally fuck over people I hold dear. The only way I feel like I can dig myself out is by finding something Iâ€™m passionate about like music but donâ€™t know the first thing about it. Iâ€™ve wanted to kill myself many times and I feel like Iâ€™m dangerously close this time. I really donâ€™t know what to do I want to die so badly but Iâ€™m too much of a pussy to follow through with anything or try anything too painful. I feel like I fail everyone around me. Iâ€™m sorry for venting to Reddit I just feel like Iâ€™m out of options. I hope this doesnâ€™t end up being the first and last post I ever make but if it is, it was nice reading everyone elseâ€™s similar situations. Goodbye everyone I hope this isnâ€™t the last you ever hear from me
