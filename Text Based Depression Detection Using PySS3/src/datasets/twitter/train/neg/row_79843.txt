Maybe I am wired differently up here...The last 48 hours, I have been in an overwhelming agony that I have never experienced before, I have never felt more lonelier, and I have never wanted to kill myself more... In the last 48 hours, I have tied my belt around my pull up bar and put my neck around for 2 times now... but each time, as I stepped off the chair... and my weight pressed against my neck... I just couldn't do it... 

The only times I would feel better is when I have cried enough and gone to bed but the time I am spending awake, I would just be crying... and I just really wish that I would feel better...What can I do to make myself feel better? I have tried taking walks... I have tried prayers... I am at my wit's end... please help me

I have called the suicide hotline 3 times now, and every time a different person would pick up and listen to me, and I'm really grateful that they would spend that hour or 2 listening to me but they have offered me no valuable advice except for encouragement and I don't think encouragement could change me... They have asked that I go down and talk to their counsellors but I really cannot repeat this in front of a real person, I am really afraid he or she would mock at me instead...

There are so many things that I really want to do in my life but I don't think I am capable of accomplishing them... There are so many things that I wish I hadn't done or said but I did it or said it anyway... If I kill myself today... all these would be gone
