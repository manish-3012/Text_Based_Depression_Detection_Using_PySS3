I don't want to kill myself but I can't stop thinking about it.My life isn't perfect, but it's not that bad. Everyday is a constant struggle, though. I can't stop thinking about taking my life. I've had some close friends watch over my gun and blade collections. Got rid of all my pills. But everyday I think about it. The craziest part is I don't actually want tp die. I'm only depressed because of the suicidal thoughts, not the other way around. Is there a way to get rid of the thoughts without medication? I don't have money of insurance right now so that's why I ask that.
