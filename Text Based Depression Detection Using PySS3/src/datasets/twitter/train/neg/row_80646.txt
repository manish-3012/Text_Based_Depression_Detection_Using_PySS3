I hate myselfI'm just so sad. So lonely. I feel like there's this great dark emptiness inside me. I don't know what to do. 

I'm all alone. All my relatives are either drug addicts or mentally insane. My grandparents treat me like dirt. They all hate me. They exist to violate my boundaries, to make fun of me, to laugh at me when I'm in pain, to invalidate my feelings. I fucking hate my life. The other day they threatened to kick me out. I know they're bluffing. They've been telling me that since i was twelve. But i still feel like shit.

I do my best but nothing works. I keep trying to find a job but none are available. Even wanting a ten dollar an hour job makes sense. Even if I succeed in getting a job, I'd need to wait 6 months before moving out. I have to pay off my medical bills and pay for my car. None of my other relatives want to help me. I hate living like this. I just want to die. 

Edit: the title is improper. It should be "I hate my life", for that is what is true. I tried writing that originally. There is nothing wrong with me.
