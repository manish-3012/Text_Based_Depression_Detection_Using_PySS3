Friend took a pic of me, feel bad :/We were joking with a friend, and he saw that I have a gun, and he knows that I'm depressed, so he tried to make fun of me and said that I should shoot myself If I dared... I grabbed the gun and smiling pointed it to my chin, he [took a pic of me](http://uploadpie.com/BZGcI) , I didn't knew he did so, until today I was checking my phone :/

it's a small handgun in case it doesn't appear on the photo, as it is very dark and blurry... anyway...

Now that I look it, I feel bad, I mean, I don't  know if I'll have the courage to pull the trigger... it sucks to feel like that :/ ....  I think we were just having fun, but when I ask him to do the same, he refused :(

Sometimes when I'm feeling suicidal, I think to leave a note, but then I ask myself, Why I should?, if my friend took a photo of me while I was holding the gun, I don't think he would care if I shooted myself, neither someone would.

But well, thanks for reading, and yeah, now I'm better (thanks to the meds), but, I guess all of us thought about doing it more than once :/

 TL;DR: Friend took a pic of me while I was pointing a gun to my head, now feel bad when I see it. Thanks for reading! :)
