Thinking about suicide is like a drugYou ever just like â€œdamn, I could be dead 10 minutes from nowâ€? Just stab myself in the fucking heart or something if I really wanted to die. Everybody has a knife and 10 minutes; itâ€™s easy to die like fr there are no excuses so I must still wanna live for something. But what? Why does it have to be so relaxing/freeing to think about how I could be dead in 10 minutes if I really wanted to. Thatâ€™s all you need, 10 minutes max. And itâ€™s such a calm feeling knowing that I can die whenever. Itâ€™s like a drug that makes everything feel ok.
