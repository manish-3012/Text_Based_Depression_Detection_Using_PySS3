My Envy makes me suicidalI compare myself continuously to my younger sister because she seems ideal as a thinker. I am naturally a feeler. My nature is to react first or I feel things before I can think clearly. I'm aware it is a weakness. I feel like my parents reprimanded me the most. I wonder if my family needs me if all I bring is trouble.

My younger sister possesses all these qualities. Well-planned, reason-driven, calm, objective, analytical, grounded, no nonsense attitude, realistic, tolerant, simple, clear-minded, brutally honest, moderate/temperate, self-controlled, confident, responsible, open-minded, diligent, rational, logical, independent, emotionally independent, thick-skinned, self-sufficient, assertive, etc.  Not easily swayed by emotions and rarely lives in a fantasy. She doesn't care what others think of her or need their approval. She is her own person/self-contained.

I know you are probably tempted to tell me to learn from my sister. I wish she could learn from me. I'm five years older. Am I always going to be a late bloomer or immature?
