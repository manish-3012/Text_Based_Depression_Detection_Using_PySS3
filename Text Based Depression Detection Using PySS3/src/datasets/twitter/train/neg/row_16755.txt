I canâ€™t find any hope or reason to stay hereOn an individual level, Iâ€™m living with the weight of horrible childhood trauma that I know Iâ€™ll never recover from in any meaningful way. On top of that, throughout my adult life I just seem to get re-victimized again and again to the point where my life just feels like a cycle of waiting for the next horrible thing to happen. 

On a societal level, I have to live with the knowledge that the exact shit thatâ€™s happening to me (it manifests differently, but all leads to the same effect) is happening to countless people every day. I know how many of my friends have been assaulted to some degree and it makes me insane. I know we have no chance of saving the world from the climate apocalypse and that makes me insane.  I canâ€™t stop thinking about systemic issues, how they manifest in the very structure of society, and I see this play out in real time and the news every day.

I can try to unpack all of these experiences and try to find meaning or accept that there is no meaning or whatever, but that doesnâ€™t change the fact that all these things are happening, and they will continue to happen to countless people. I know thereâ€™s nothing I can do and that makes me insane. I know I should drop my whole detached, depressed thing and start participating in real life and stay in university so I can get a job but I know anything I do will never make me happy and it wonâ€™t make anything better so I have trouble finding any energy to care. 

I donâ€™t want to get help anymore. Getting help just entails talking to someone who is a literal professional at teaching you how to ignore the problems that are really getting to you, or taking medication that alleviates some of the symptoms of being completely lucid. 

I donâ€™t believe Iâ€™m crazy anymore. I know these things are all real and true and itâ€™s not just a chemical imbalance in my brain. I donâ€™t have hope because the world is hopeless. My depression is just my knowledge that the world is shit and so is my life and thereâ€™s absolutely nothing meaningful I can do to solve anything.
