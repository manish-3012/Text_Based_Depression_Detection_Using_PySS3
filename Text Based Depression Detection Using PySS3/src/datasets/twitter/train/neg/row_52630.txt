not sure if I should go to a hospitalI am suicidal  and am in pain every day of my life. All I do is work part-time at a shitty fast food place and lay in bed. I never get out of bed. When I leave the house I detach from myself and my surroundings. I will feel spaced out and completely out of it. My only "safe place" is my bed.  My short-term memory is completely shot. I am always tired no matter how much sleep I get.. I could get 12+ hours and still feel completely exhausted.  I am always feeling severely slow/sluggish. I am unable to get my license because of all of this. I am unable to go to school. My thoughts have been all over the place and I am having a very difficult time processing them. I have been on 5 different medications in the past 2 years, and have been to multiple therapists, but everything is getting worse. I am getting worse. I don't see a point in me being here. I am always alone and no one wants to get to know me or understand me or anything. There is no point. I am just a fool and a joke to others.
