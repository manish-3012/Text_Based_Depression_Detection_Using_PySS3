I keep sinking lower. No will or want to live.It all seems so trivial. I was used by a person I fell in love with who broke up with me and deserted me for another girl. I, personally, can't handle the immense pain that this is wreaking me. It's unbearable. Nearly every person I've dated has met this exact pattern. I've always been expendable -- they always leave for another person. I told this person this, and he said it wouldn't happen, then betrayed me. I feel unlovable. For once my life felt filled with excitement. I'd never been truly happy before. Now I feel stuck back in this miserable place without any future to look forward to, but she gets the fun times and he's spending time with her. Everyone can tell me that I'll move on -- I don't give a fuck. How do you move on from the 5th situation like this, moreso when you've actually loved this person? I have no desire or want to live. I don't want to think about it but it keeps forcing its way into my mind. I've made calls to the suicide hotline twice, but it hasn't helped. The only reason that I haven't done it yet is because I can't imagine how my family would feel, but I'm selfish. I can't take it. I've tried everything, I've tried to get out there and I've even tried church. Life, for me, seems hopeless. I want to end it. I don't know where it all goes, if there's darkness or if there's someone there at the end. I do know that I want the pain to stop. It feels like suffering, and is the worst I've ever been through. I feel like I'm going to go for it today. I want to so badly. I don't want to chicken out this time. I'm fucked up inside and out. I need this torture to end now. I've lost faith in all of humanity. There is no one left. No one can be trusted, and everyone is a sham. If not to others, than only to me. Always to me.
