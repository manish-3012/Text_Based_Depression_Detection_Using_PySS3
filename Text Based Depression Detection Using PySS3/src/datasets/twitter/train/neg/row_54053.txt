I keep having nightmares of hanging myselfAlmost every single time I fall asleep or nap, I end up having the same horrible dream. I've been having these extremely lucid dreams of me hanging myself. I can feel the rope around my neck, I tighten the noose so there's no slack, and I kick the chair from under me.

Then I fall for a second and wake up in a cold sweat right as my neck takes the weight of my fall.
