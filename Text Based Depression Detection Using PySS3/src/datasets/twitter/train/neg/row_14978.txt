Haven't had a friend since the third gradeWhen I was in freshman year of high school I wouldnt want to go home because of my toxic parents and I would just walk around aimlessly for hours while on the verge of crying. I did this everyday for months because I wouldnt want to go home and that in my sick head I thought I would eventually make a friend, thinking back on this now makes me feel terrible. And then in sophmore year I had a lot of "friends" but they treated me like shit. I dont have that much money and they would make me use the last of my money to buy them drugs and stuff, and always told me to go away and reall did a lot of things that mentally broke me. but I had nobody else at the time i didnt know what to do. Now im in junior year of highschool and I stopped talking to them, and I have nobody. I have no friends, nobody likes me I am the most un likeable person. Im able to talk to people "well?" but nobody wants to talk to me nobody likes me its not fair. Even If I just had 1 friend I would feel so much better but I dont even think thats going to happen. The last time I had friends who truly cared about me was litterally when I was in 3rd grade. I dont know why people treat me like this I dont know why people treat me differently than others its not fair what did I do to deserve this. Nobody cares about me. the only way people will even give a fuck about me is when I kill myself, and even then, people would be sad for a couple days and then eventually get over it and then forget all about me.
