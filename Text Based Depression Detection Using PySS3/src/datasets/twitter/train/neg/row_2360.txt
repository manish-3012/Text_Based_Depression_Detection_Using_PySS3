I have left depression lead my life and now I feel like I can't start a new lifeI have been depressed since high school, not a severe depression so I could keep "living"(let's say just survive). Without getting into details, now I am 28 unemployed, without work experience, bad health...

I do not know how to live, I would like to find a job but right now I am considered old and have no experience in my field(IT), and they don't give chances to people like me(At least in my zone, but I dont have money to move other places).

I have considered to try and work for the goverment( I have been supposedly studying  2 years for tit...but I did nothing) and I find it impossible to focus while studying.

My family situation is getting worse each day, my dad(financial support of the family) health is not the best and him dyiing one day is a posiblity, my mom has not job and I am going to have to earn money for her. My sister mental health(She had a long phsycotic crisis and since then she has become... let just say weird) is becoming worse again and I honestly cant stand her anymore(As much as I love her but she is just too much for my mind)

I got a gf this year, a wonderful girl who motivates me to become a better version of myself. But I know she will leave me as soon as she sees the real me.

My health is bad right now also, I am having sever stomach problems and I am going to have a surgery in both my feet which will leave me at least 3 months of recovery.

I just want to die, I don't see the path to a normal life so why the hell keep suffering? I wish I had a gun because I don't have the balls to hang myself.
