Have no motivation behind lifeI have no motivation to do anything. When I wake up I do nothing and then feel more shit for wasting time doing nothing. I don't want to live anymore, my only escape is through self harm and even that isn't good enough anymore. I just want to kill myself, every day is worse than the last. I have nobody to talk to and I feel like I'm just slipping away from life.
