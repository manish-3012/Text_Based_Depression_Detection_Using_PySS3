I posted this on suicidal thoughts and the point still stands. I want to fucking die but i cant.Ive talked to different people about this but i thought i was getting better but now as i want to follow through i promised to another redditor that i wont kill myself. He said if he has to stay on this shitty earth i do to. But rn i just want to crack open a pack of sleeping pils and sleep forever.
