Scared if I use antidepressants that I won't be able to have sex again!Hello

I have really bad anxiety and depression which is getting worse - my therapist told me to try an antidepressant to help lift my mood and get me back on track - but after reading online I saw that most antidepressants can lead to ED and other sexual disfunction's (some even permanently, even after you stop the medication) - now as much as I want to get help for my depression, one of the things making me depro is ED and PE so I dont want to make that worse!

How common are these side effects and what are my options - if I dont take them I might kill myself and if I take them I can never have sex again!
