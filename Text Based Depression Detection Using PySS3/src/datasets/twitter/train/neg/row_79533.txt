This is sub is a joke.Majority of people want to hear "life doesn't get better, you are right to kill yourselves".

Do yourself a favor and unsubscribe, because clearly any attempt to *actually* get better (with real, gradual work) gets downvoted into oblivion. How many helpers left because of this toxic mentality?

I, for one will not be around to watch this happen. I've struggled with suicidal thoughts since I was a kid and know there's no use feeling bad all the time. Poverty sucks. Childhood trauma sucks. Never having anyone to rely on sucks. Never feeling the warmth of love sucks.

But I know sitting around saying "nothing will work for me" won't change my life for the better. None of you will find this helpful, even though it's something you have to hear.
