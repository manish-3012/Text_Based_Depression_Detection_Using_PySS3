I don't want to live anymore.I'm 20, male, social anxiety, no friends. Fuck, I can't even convince myself to go to a psychologist to work on my social anxiety. I have no social skills. I do not have any friends, merely 1 ex work colleague with whom I meet for dinner once every 3 months. 

I don't know how to meet new people. I have enough money to live well, but money doesn't make me happy. I have all I need, anything I want, but not any friends or social contacts. I never had relationship with a girl. 

I can't even converse with somebody normally without my entire body freezing, my brain going entirely numb, starting to stutter and feeling completely awkward.

All I want to be is to be a normal human being with friends to hang around with and have fun with.

I could easily get access to something that ends my life. The only thing that keeps me alive is my mother. She would be the only one caring about me. But would I give a fuck if I was dead? No. At least my misery would be over and I could finally stop caring.

I'm tired of this world, I just don't belong here.
