iâ€™m a guy,, and iâ€™m embarrassed to admit feeling suicidal to my family or friendsa few of my mates know as well as my boyfriend but itâ€™s too much to just talk about 

i feel numb while typing this. 
i feel empty and like everything i do i just drag my feet in. idk what that means or what to do about it- i just have no motivation whatsoever and iâ€™d say that scares me but it doesnâ€™t. 
i just feel nothing.
