Therapy is dumb.Yesterday I was on the edge. I even did something risky that I new was risky because I was just overwhelmed with stress, anxiety, and anger. I contacted my therapist to book a session and went in today. I told her what I did and how I donâ€™t see a solution to my problems. This whole week Iâ€™ve been feeling worse and worse and nothing Ive tried helped and Iâ€™m scared but convinced Iâ€™ll just try to end it at some point. Firstly my therapist tried to half suggest and half threaten to put me in hospicare which I begged her not to and after that we just went over why Iâ€™ve been so overwhelmed recently. And I walked out feeling a million times better. Although Iâ€™m not completely better Iâ€™m on the right path finally! I know a lot of people on here really have had bad experience with therapy but if you have please try someone else. I was luck enough to pick right my first try because I feel like my therapist is the only person who really understands me and so far they are the only person who has really helped me. Therapist are still people, Iâ€™ve heard friends tell me they had tried 5 therapist before finding the right one but when you do they really help!
