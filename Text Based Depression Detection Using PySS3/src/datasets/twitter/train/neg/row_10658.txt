I'm "in love" with somebody who doesn't know I exist, and even if she did, I'm pretty sure she wouldn't love me the way I need her to.I don't really know how to explain what I mean, but the feelings I have for her aren't romantic in any way. She's married, and that doesn't bother me in the slightest, as I have no desire whatsoever to have that sort of relationship with her. But I love her deeply on a platonic, spiritual level. Though I've never spoken to her, I feel such a connection to her through her writing. Other than that, I can't say what it is about me that makes me love her so much. But all I can think about is her loving me back. I so badly would love to have a mentor-mentee or mother-daughter kind of relationship with her, and I don't know why. I don't know why I crave a motherly figure (or why specifically this woman) as I have a wonderful relationship with my own mother and love her more than anybody in the world. But some part of me, on some level desires this woman's affection. I don't think I will ever be at peace until she knows me by name, considers me a friend, and has held me in her arms at least once.

I can't tell anyone about my feelings lest they consider me a freak. I know I am. I'm a fucked up, weird person who doesn't even deserve to be alive, and I know my dreams will never become a reality. Even if I do get to know this lady, I don't expect things will work out the way I'm hoping they will. I'm quickly losing hope, weight, and the desire to live. I'm like a walking vegetable, completely devoid of any substance. All I do is cry and make myself sick over not being able to have the love that I want more than anything. I don't know how I can go on like this. I'm tired of feeling sad and worthless.
