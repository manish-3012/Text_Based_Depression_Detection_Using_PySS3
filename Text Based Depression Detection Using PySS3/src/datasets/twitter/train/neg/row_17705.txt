I bought a gun todayRevolver. Hollow point bullets. Aim for the spot where the brain stem meets the back of the skull.

Drive into the wilderness, where it might take a while for someone to find me. Eat a bunch of tranqs and vodka as a backup.

Grieving passes. What I have lasts a lifetime.

I have everything planned out. But I don't want to die. I'm just tired of suffering so much, and being so alone. I have nobody to talk to
