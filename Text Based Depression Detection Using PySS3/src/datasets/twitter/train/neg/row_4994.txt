Never trust anyoneMy wife has told me she isn't in love with me anymore.  She isn't attracted to me anymore.  Im alone, with just my mother and my cats to stop me from offing myself. I don't see any point in living when it's just one fucking pain after another.  Can't be with my wife,  can't even be around her since she just wants to be alone and is in another country.  I don't care who I'd hurt anymore,  it just doesn't matter.  There's always just so much pressure to do everything and be strong and take everything life gives but there's no real point in it anymore.  There's no end goal.  There's nothing happy waiting.  There's no rewards.  Life is pain. You have to fuck everyone over to stop the pain and im all for it.  I just wish I hadn't promised because for some stupid reason that still means something to me.  I want out and I don't know how to do it. I want to be numb or be nothing.  I didn't ask for life or love or any of it,  I just want it to all go away. I just want to stop hurting.
