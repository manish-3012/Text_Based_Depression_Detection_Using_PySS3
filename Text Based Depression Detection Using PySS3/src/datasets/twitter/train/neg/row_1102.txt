Tired of feeling ugly, unwanted and unlovedI've always been overweight and felt ugly and somewhat socially awkward so I never had the confidence to approach the girls I was attracted to, in fear of rejection...so I always just settled for the unattractive girls with low self esteem to satisfy my sexual desires. But sex with someone you're not physically attracted to gets boring really quick. And everyday the voice in my head telling me to end it all gets louder because I fear no matter what I do I'll never truly be happy.
