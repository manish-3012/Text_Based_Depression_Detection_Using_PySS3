The feeling is getting stronger...The pain is getting more intense. I'm trying to hold back the urge of just ending my life, but the more I hold it in the more I'm willing to physically harm myself. My arm is full of old scars from cuts and as of tonight, it's gained 4 new ones. I can't get rid of this feeling, it's nagging me. I've got nothing left. I hate stalling. What the fuck am I holding on to? I have nothing, no one. I need some help. I need a beacon of hope. I need something, soon. I can't keep living like this, or at all, for that matter...
