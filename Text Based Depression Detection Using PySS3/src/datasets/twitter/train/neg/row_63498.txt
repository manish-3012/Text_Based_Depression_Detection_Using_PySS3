Autistic young male, why shouldn't ii have zero friends. 0. im a douchebag, people either get mad at me and leave or get bored of me and leave. i'm afraid of meeting new people. i'm afraid of people in general. but i want friends so badly, i am not an introvert, i wish i was.
i have read that, as an autist, you are better off dead and generally i tend to  agree with the sentiment. 
i don't know how much longer i can keep living like this.
having no friends, i don't have anyone to rent an apartment with and my mother keeps suggesting i get a bachelors (we can afford it) but im afraid, i know if i live by myself i won't make it to my twentieth birthday.
