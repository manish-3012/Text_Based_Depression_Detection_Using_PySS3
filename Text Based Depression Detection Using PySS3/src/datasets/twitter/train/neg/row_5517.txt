I don't feel betterIf anything I feel worse. I want so much to die that it is unbelievable. I've been doing a lot of research on how painful it would be to OD on my sleeping meds. (Diphenhydramine for those interested) I just miss her so much and I'm never going to get her back and I just can't take that. I can see my funeral better then I can see my college life. She broke me and I can't put myself back together. Any time I do I just look at myself and realize how wrong it is. She was my everything she made me so happy and now thinking of her only fills me with dread. I just wish that I would never have existed. So many people's lives would be better. My only reason for not doing anything is because my mom is pressuring me not to by saying that if I kill myself then she will follow leaving my sister alone. But why do I have to live for others? Everyone says suicide is selfish but I'd say that forcing someone to live a life they don't want to live for your own reasons is equally selfish.
