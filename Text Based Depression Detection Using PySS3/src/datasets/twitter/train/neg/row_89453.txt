I fucked upI have been seeing a girl for a few weeks. I started getting really attracted to her and I started to love her. She recently broke up with me saying how she wasnt ready for a relationship. She wasn't interested in me. I recently lost control and started obsessively texting her saying how I loved and missed her. She responded that she never wants to speak with me again. 

This always happens I always manage to push people away. I fall for people and they leave me. I don't know whats wrong with me I should have just left her alone. I loved her and Im pretty sure she blocked me all around. She dropped me like Im nothing.

I yearn to love but whenever I try I push people away. I am struggling with an addiction in which I am recovering from, but its just so hard right now Im so depressed I can't shake these feelings away. I told myself I wouldn't do this again and I did it. How can I continue talking with people if I know I will always do this. 

I really am done. A lot of things have been going wrong lately. I can't connect with anyone and I really just want to die.
