i don't understandthe emptiness and crying have come out of nowhere and i don't understand what's wrong with me. usually something happens to trigger my suicidal thoughts, but now it feels like it's consuming me for no reason and i can't stop it. i feel so broken, even when my life is okay my brain is poisoning itself, what's the point in trying to move forward if i always comes back to this pain.
