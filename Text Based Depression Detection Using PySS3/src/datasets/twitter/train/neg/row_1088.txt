a guy took me from the highest point to the lowest point of my life and now I just want to kill myselfI liked him so much, maybe even more than me, and now I have been discarded as an object that has been used and has been replaced by a new one. Before I met this guy I already had depression I would say he almost cured my depression and now I'm worse than before, I just cry all day, I don't eat, I just lie in bed and I'm about to have financial difficulties. I stopped living my life because of this guy and now I realized that he was just playing with me the whole time.
