Last note.I've decided I'm tired of living right now. 

I have no more motivation and here's why:

I really hate being Transgender 

I've tried going to subs on here for help but posters have told me it's too late for certain crucial growth and all of this because of my inability to pass as a woman :) I'm so fucking angry right now. I don't know how other Transgender people can do this but I can't do this. I'm a coward. I can barely function to preform daily tasks anymore. My parents refused to help me start on HRT when I still had a chance at passing. Now it's an impossibility without:

Hip implants 
Breast implants
FFS
Hair Implants on scalp
Hair removal on face and body
HRT

I can't afford all of this not by myself while in college. :) it's time to be realistic and end my life. It was an okay life but I think 20 years of living is enough. I don't think I can ever become a normally functioning human being anyway. 

I look on youtube to see trans youtubers and they all pass because they got  financial support through their family. I don't have this privilege. I tried to keep on living in the hopes I could be happy like them to but I see now it's impossible.

I doubt there are any trans people here who care but I wanted to leave some kind of note somewhere. 

Goodbye everyone!
