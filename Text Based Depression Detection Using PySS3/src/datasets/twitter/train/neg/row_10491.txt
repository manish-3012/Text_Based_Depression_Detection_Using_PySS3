I don't understand why my best is never good enoughI've done my best in life and I'm nothing. I've accomplished nothing, I'm worth nothing, I've done nothing with my time, I have no friends anymore, I have nothing to offer the world or anyone in it, I have no hobvies, I have no perosnality, I'm destined for nothing but mundane suffering and a premature death. The only reason I haven't done it yet is because I don't want to do that to my mother but good god it's so hard to just get myself out of bed each day. I want this to end. And the worst part is that, no matter how badly i want this misery to stop and to feel better, I know I only deserve for things to get worse because I'm literal human garbage.
