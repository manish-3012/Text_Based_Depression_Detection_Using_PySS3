I'm scared to reach out or share my feelings because of the police.Whenever I make it apparent I want to die, or whenever i attempt suicide the police always show up and they make my life worse. With this grave fear of the police punishing me for any future suicide attempts, I'm just alone, and I eagerly  wait for my death to come.

Even typing this I'm scared of the police showing up. Just in case:

This post is not meant to be taken seriously, I am not at risk. I am happy.
