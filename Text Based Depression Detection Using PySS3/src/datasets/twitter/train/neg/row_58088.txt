Can't handle it anymoreI've gone completely mental. I can't do anything right. I'm tired of starting over and feeling incomplete and fat and ugly and stupid and worthless and dead 

I have things to do tomorrow. Things that are supposed to get my life going again. But I'm going to skip them because I can't handle the pressure and I don't fucking care. Everyone else is trying to get me to do this and all I want to do is lie in bed and cry and let myself rot away. I don't care about money or work or school or anything. I've long since given up caring for other people. I'm not interested in being with anyone else because I'm not even interested in being with myself. Why do people think this concept of life means anything? It's all a bunch of shit and I just hate everything

So now I'm going to have to get a gun or rope or something and get messy. But I'm not going to suffer anymore.
