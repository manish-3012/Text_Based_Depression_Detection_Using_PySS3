I just want to stop being aloneI've been alone my whole life and I just don't want to be alone anymore. I've taken meds, spoken to people. I know I have depression, I know blah blah, I just don't want to fucking be alone. I know my life is fucking shit I don't need counselling to tell me that. I just feel fucking invisible. I don't care about bettering myself. I just want. to. fucking. not be alone. 

I'm going for a walk. if you see some guy in melbourne that killed himself by jumping in front of a bus then that's probably me.
