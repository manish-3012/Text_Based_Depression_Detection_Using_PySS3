Talk me through itHello my name is Amber I'm going to be blunt about this post I've decided to end my life and I'm struggling with a method I've tried drinking antifreeze but I couldn't drink enough to kill me the taste was just awful. After googling around I've set my mind on hanging/ suspension hanging I've ordered some strong rope that came today and I've got plenty of medication and alcohol to use before I hang myself. I'm just confused with partial suspension hanging if I were to tie the rope on a door handle and throw it over the top of the door and knot it round my neck how would that kill me? I'm not sure if I sound completely stupid or if anyone else can relate to what I'm saying I'd appreciate it if someone could talk me through it . I also understand if people feel uncomfortable commenting I totally get that. I really have made up my mind I've almost become obsessed with suicide I won't be free until I'm gone. I won't be changing my mind if worse comes to worse i'll go back to my original plan of drinking antifreeze I didn't enjoy the taste but I suppose it's a small price to pay to get where I want to be , thank you .
