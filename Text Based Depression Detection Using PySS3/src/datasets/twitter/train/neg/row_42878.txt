Suicidal feeling and anxiety after drugsFeel anxious after drugs

Hey everybody. Iâ€™ve been taken xtc with one guy. Firstly it was interesting trip and good communication. We met each other 5 times. He started to read my mind and talk about my behaviour. He used word â€œIâ€ and was talking about me. I thought that he is saying all the time about him self. After he was talking about my mom and my childhood. After I felt so paranoid and thought that he started to listen me from my phone. I blocked him everywhere and feeling good about it. The thing is that im keep overthinking about all his words and want to forget all of it. If there is a way how to do it ? Please help
