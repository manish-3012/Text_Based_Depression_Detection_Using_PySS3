Whatâ€™s the point?My mom died on the 30th and not only was she my mom sheâ€™s my best friend and since her passing family has been coming over and saying we need to pack what we want of hers and throw the rest away and it just feels too soon and nobody gets that and they all talk about how hard this is for them when they didnâ€™t call or talk to her very much.

They have been coming over so much and it feels like no one noticed that I am not ok and I want to die more then ever because it feels like a part of me died because Iâ€™m agoraphobic so I never leave the house and she was always here with me and so we watched a lot of movies and tv together and sheâ€™s who I went to about everything and I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll come close to having someone like that in my life again and I donâ€™t know if life is worth living if thatâ€™s true.
