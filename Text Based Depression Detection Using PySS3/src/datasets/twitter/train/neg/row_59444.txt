i just feel so drained, im not sure how much longer i can hold outim only 16, and i feel like this is really fucking humiliating to talk about. i feel so guilty. my parents have gone through hell trying to get me help, and i just want to go ahead and end it all. i feel horrible for it, but my mind is so fucked up at this point that no treatment for the past 1-2 years has done anything for me. iâ€™ve just sort of been pretending like it has so i dont let anyone down. 
at this point, though, im just completely exhausted. real hope isnâ€™t out there for me. i have EDS, meaning im constantly in physical pain along with everything going on mentally. the thought of killing myself doesnâ€™t scare me that much anymore. what iâ€™m horrified of is the unknown, though. iâ€™m terrified thinking about what will happen to me after i choose to end it all. 
i feel like im getting closer and closer to putting an end to my life. i donâ€™t know when, but the thought of doing it is starting to become much more prominent in my thoughts. this will get drowned out in other posts here, but i think thatâ€™s okay. i just needed to say it all somewhere. i donâ€™t have the energy to type anything else out.
