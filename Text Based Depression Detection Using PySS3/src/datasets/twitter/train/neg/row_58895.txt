death is my only escapei was on a contracted job previously after which i started going on ei and have been receiving that. in the meantime i started a new job. they barely gave me any hours. at the time i had open availability. to help make ends meet i started looking for a second one. they're both part time and retail and now the one from the first job has given me an ultimatum since im not available both weekend days. she basically said i have to resign at one of the two jobs. if i resign from either of them i run the risk of losing my ei. im trying to find a full time job meanwhile. i cant afford to live without ei. this manager and this job in general have made me miserable. they accuse me of not coming in when i wasnt even scheduled. the manager is unwilling to accomodate my schedule chsnges. She hates me. I work there tomorrow and im dreading it i just want to die. I havent said im quitting yet and i dont know whwt ro do i just wsnt to die i cant fucking tske this anykors im going to end up homeless and on the streets fucking kill me
