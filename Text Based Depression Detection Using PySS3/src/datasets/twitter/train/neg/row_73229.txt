So broke id rather not be around to see myself struggleI know its cliche but when it comes to bills and money sometimes i feel like i would rather die than struggle the rest of my life. I feel like i never knew the value of a dollar until i was deep in debt. My job runs me ragged and my body is breaking down. Im suppose to be the positive one but I keep thinking "wouldn't it just be great if i was hit by a car right now?" 

How am I suppose to stay happy when im living in the red and i cant get ahead?
