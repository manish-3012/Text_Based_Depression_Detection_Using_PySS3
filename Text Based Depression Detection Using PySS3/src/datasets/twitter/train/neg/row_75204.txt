I want to live..no choice but to die. I was never give a chance to get better, born an orphan and tossed around like a used towel. I have no parents. Life will only get worse for me. Might as well quit before the inevitable happen. Promising life wasted by others, there's no goodness in life. Don't want to disappoint those helping me through it now either. I know what will happen, and it's just unfortunate and I am sorry for wasting the efforts of those who still care.
