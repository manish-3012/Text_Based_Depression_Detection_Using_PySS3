what if it doesn't get better?it's something i know im not supposed to think or say, but reality has to set in at some point. im a traumatized, transgender, mentally ill person with an incurable degenerative chronic pain condition. If things don't seriously change soon, i will only get worse physically and emotionally. 

my parents aren't worried. they're so certain im bluffing when i say i want to die. my teachers don't know or don't care. my friends are struggling to try to support me. i can't stop thinking about my dad telling me i will only find relief and peace in death. 

i try to stay positive but it might just not get better. if i don't get into a school with good healthcare, i don't know how it can be worth continuing.
