What Is The Point Of This Subreddit???What is the point of this? I suffer from a serious alcohol and gambling issues along with depression. I think of suicide often. I attempted twice. One was a "half assed" attempt swallowing pills as a youngster and the other was a serious attempt resulting me in jumping onto the subway tracks on the North side of Chicago resulting in broken bones and burns.
