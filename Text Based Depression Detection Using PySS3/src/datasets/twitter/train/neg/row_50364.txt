I've been okay for about a year now...the last two days I really just want to kill myself. Please, I just need someone to talk to me.I was really abused as a kid by my dad, my three younger siblings are still stuck with them...I saw them yesterday for the first time in a while and they looked so bad...malnourished, scared, neglected...and I'm powerless to do anything to protect them.

I really needed some legal advice. I wanted to know if I could call CPS, maybe sue my dad and get custody somehow, maybe get money from him to go to college (he's well off, I'm near homeless) so I could afford to get them someday...I posted in legal advise and got told to grow up, stop being a victim, and get a job.

I feel...so small and stupid...I'm really scared of myself for the first time in about a year. I'm really scared I'll do something regrettable.

I've never posted here before, I don't really know if this is even a good idea. I just need some encouragement or reason to think it's going to be okay...please
