My girlfriend just blocked me on all platforms without saying anything. I never her told her what I was going through but now Iâ€™m alone.I started dating a long time on and off friend about a week ago online, unfortunately about a hour ago she blocked me on all platforms and I donâ€™t have any way to contact her. I have no idea what to do, Iâ€™m okay if she needs to leave cause I donâ€™t want her to be committed to something sheâ€™s not interested in - but why does that mean she has to cut me off so hard? Last night when we spoke we talked about animal crossing and then I went to bed and ended the call, there wasnâ€™t any prior hints or anything so this was out of the blue. 

As much as I hate to admit it but two months prior I had ended a relationship of 2 years due to them cheating on me when we became long distance(her sister let me know, I still appreciate that). But sometimes I wonder if I shouldâ€™ve just stayed with her even if most the time I was depressed as fuck and had to go through being the blame for so many issues -  atleast then I can feel something. 

Ignoring all of this I recently moved to a new state after being alone for most of quarantine. Iâ€™ve been trying to make friends and the best Iâ€™ve been able to do is have sort of good conversations with coworkers though Iâ€™ve heard them talk about me and how they think I have some mental issues due to how I speak(Iâ€™m soft spoken). 

This all being the case it may be due to this having recently past the date of a very close friend who passed away when I was much younger. He was so much more talented, smarter, charismatic, and kind. Every day for the past 10 years Iâ€™ve known the world would have been better now if I was the one that took the blow from the car. I could t save him then and I canâ€™t save myself now. 

My home life or lack there of one is blank. My work life is a joke. I almost had a relationship. I havenâ€™t told anyone but Iâ€™ve been holding on by a thread for the past month and trying so hard to live for my parents but I canâ€™t even find that. Iâ€™m unbelievably selfish for saying that. I am ashamed for even thinking like this. Please someone help me understand what I can do to leave this frame of mind itâ€™s physically demoralizing, if my hearts not even in the game anymore even in the slightest then how do I move forward. 


Please help me. Iâ€™m so far gone and I have nothing left.
