I'm so isolated that I don't expect more than about 15-20 people at my funeral (if that).I read online today that the burglar who got stabbed to death in the UK had over 200 people at his funeral. I'm not a criminal so it's pretty ironic that I'll only get a handful of a people to mine. 

If anyone bothers turning up, it will be friends of my sister and parents since I only have two real friends of my own (who live abroad). My funeral will just mirror how my life has always been: pretty much abandoned and alone.
