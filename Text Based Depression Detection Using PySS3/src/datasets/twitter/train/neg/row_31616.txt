I really tried to fight in this hell we call lifeI promised myself I'd never post here again, that I'd never get so down again but I guess that didnt work. I dont even know why I post here, I got written letters to those few that I feel like would want an explanation. Not that there really is one, my life is great, got friends, job, family, Im not sick, nothing bad in my life. Well, nothing bad except for me.

Every morning I wake up and Im still myself. I look in the mirror and am just disgusted by myself. Looking back at me in the mirror is a ugly heap of failures and mistakes, someone who had every option and blew everything. I just dont want to be myself anymore, I cant anymore.

Im sorry for everyone who I mean something to, seems like Im just too weak to go on. One more mistake to my personality I guess. I really am sorry though, I always tried to make everyone happy, Ive fought for so long just so they dont have to feel the pain of losing someone they like but its tearing my insides apart. 

So tonights the night Ill go, I wont make the same mistakes I did in the past again. Already drove to a quiet place in the woods, got my pills and rope, I just hope it doesnt hurt too bad.

Goodbye
