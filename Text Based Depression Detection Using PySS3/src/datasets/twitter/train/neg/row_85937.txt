I'd say It's a 50/50 chanceIf she convinces him to break up I'll do it. I've planned it out I'll fill a bath tub amd take as many meds as possible without my mother catching me. I'll lie in the bathtub and cut my wrists open. Im scared I don't want to die but let's be honest he will break up anyways and what more is there to live for than the love of my life?
