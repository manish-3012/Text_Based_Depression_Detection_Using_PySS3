i have absolutely no body to talk to. And no, before you offer your very generous and kind ear to me.. It won't helpI burn every bridge I cross.

I am a constant stress, full on anxiety worry and panic.

I don't even like being with myself. I hate my own presense.


I just lost my last "safehouse" of sorts of people i can talk to. I understand most people will probably be feeling you maybe could message me or say in a comment that I can message you with anything I want. And, don't mistake me I appreciate that whole heartedly. But I'm not lookiung for an anonymous face on Reddit. I've been there, and it's gotten me to where I am today.

I guess I've learned I am alone. And i shouldn't be with someone, I'll just hurt them. And as much as I hurt every fucking day, I would never want to put this on someone else.


So suicide...maybe not tonight, but soon. It's inevitable.

Sorry, I dunno why i wrote this post if I don't want feedback. I guess I just needed to get this out there for someone, even if that someone if is in my mind and this post gets ignored...at least I put it out there.


Fuck you all, have a good night
