It doesnâ€™t get better. Iâ€™m not even sad about it anymore, just annoyed that Iâ€™m trapped here by my familySo fucked that my family will be ruined by my suicide. I canâ€™t handle any problems, everything stresses me out, I wish I could just sleep forever. Iâ€™ve stopped taking my antidepressants so hopefully I start feeling suicidal enough that I no longer care. Iâ€™ve tried for 10 years to get better and now Iâ€™m over it. Some people just arenâ€™t meant to live. I donâ€™t want to deal with any of it anymore. Wish my family could just be happy that I donâ€™t have to deal with this pain anymore.
