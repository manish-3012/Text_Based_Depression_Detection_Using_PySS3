I give up.There's too much work to do, and I don't have enough time. Everyday as timelines get closer I seem to give up more and more. It's hard to get out of bed in the morning, I want to sleep all day without any problems. I don't want to get up and talk to people, I can't. It's growing increasingly hard everyday to wake up and pretend that I am AOK to my friends and family. I'm constantly lying to them.  But even if I tried I would not be able to tell them how I feel. They wouldn't understand the way I feel about myself. They wouldn't understand why I would want to not live. 

But what's ahead of me scares me, and with each day I get more stressed over what I will do in life or how I will do it. I cannot drive for a multitude of reasons and that alone is a factor I don't like. I don't know how I'll get a job or keep in touch with the friends I have with being able to drive anywhere. As I've progressed through this week I've become increasingly more flustered, and I've made my decision that tonight is the night I'll swallow the pills I've hid under my bed for so long. I decided I needed to tell someone, I sure didn't expect it to be Reddit, but this is where I spent a majority of my time anyways.

My only fear is that my friends and family will not understand, it's the only thing that has kept me from doing it before. To think that after I've done it my family could break makes me upset, but hopefully the note I leave them can help them understand, even if it's only a little bit.
