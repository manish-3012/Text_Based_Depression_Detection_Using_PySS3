Grinning ear to ear right now.I am so fucking happy, but it is only because I know when I get home I can end it. I have everything I need, and I am intoxicated enough to finally fucking do it. I went to drink and play some video  games with a friend, but it seems like everytime I hang out with her, there is conflict between her boyfriend and herself, and I can't fathom why. Low and behold, once again, shit fucking happened.

I have been dealing with this shit for years, since I was in high school at least, and only recently started coming here for help because a gun became far too readily available to me(I got rid of the ammo, but, I now can get more easily). None of my friends or family know, and I want to at least last for a bit longer, but when I think of just ending it as soon as I get home  it just makes me happy in a way nothing else does anymore. I have nothing left, my father is dying, and all I do for my friends is cause shit like this to happen. Death has to be better than this.

If I never post here again regardless of the reason, I just want ya'll to know, you're amazing people!

Edit: Also, that Snoo is brilliant.
