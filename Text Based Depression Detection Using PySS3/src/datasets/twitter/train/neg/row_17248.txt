I donâ€™t know what to doHi, I am sorry for mistakes, English is not my mother language.

I am a girl and I turned 14 few weeks ago. I started thinking about suicide about a year ago due to bullying at school. I love my mother and I am pretty sure she loves me too, but sometimes she probably doesnâ€™t know how to make me behave better.

I find it very hard to talk to people and I am not good at anything. I canâ€™t even do what I like (horseriding) because we canâ€™t afford it. I am one of the top students in my class, but now I am too tired to learn and I cheat in all the tests. I have been struggling with depression a lot and I donâ€™t think someone noticed. I donâ€™t have friends and I will never find someone to love, neither to marry- I think I am gay and my country is really homophobic. I am also quite ugly.

A year ago, my mom started coughing. It never stopped and she acts like nothing is happening. I think she may be really ill and it makes me very worried and depressed too. I am scared. I love my mother but she sometimes beats me and shouts at me really bad words. She doesnâ€™t believe me when I tell her for example that I fell bad or something hurts me(for example: once I broke 3 of my fingers and she refused to take me to the hospital). She says that not having friends is my fault because I donâ€™t talk with them and I donâ€™t want them as friends. Thatâ€™s not true, I really try but my classmates donâ€™t like me. They already have enough friends.

When I come from school, I am just home laying on the bed playing games on iPad. I used to read a lot but I lost all interest in doing something. I think about suicide all the time and I really want to kill myself but I am worried about my mom (I live only with her), grandparents and my two guinea pigs. 

I think it would really hurt my mom if I killed myself but I just canâ€™t live like this anymore.

sorry for the long post
