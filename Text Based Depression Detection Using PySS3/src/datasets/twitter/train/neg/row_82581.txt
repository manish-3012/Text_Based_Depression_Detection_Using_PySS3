Can't seem to be able to control my anger and don't want to hurt those I love.  They would be better off if I wasn't here.I have a beautiful wife and a beautiful 8 month old daughter.  I find that my fuse is shorter and shorter and the smallest thing will set me off.  Tonight it was my daughter not wanting me to put her to bed (she was crying hysterically until she was picked up by her Mum and then quietly went to sleep).  As I was holding her with her screaming in my ear I felt the rage rise and I am scared that I will do something to hurt her.  To distract myself I bit down on my tongue.  Most times it feels like I am out of control and when the rage rises (for the slightest thing) I end up making everything worse.  I can't bear the thought of living without my family, but it feels like they would be better without me.
