Brilliant new planI've gotta use a gun. It's the only thing guaranteed to work. I thought it would give me a nice buffer to think about things. Waiting for a licence, saving to purchase one... Then I realized i can just go to a gun range. There's one that's only a 40 minute drive away, and rental is only $10. My boyfriend sees that there is a very good chance i'll suicide if we break up. It's not like I can't live without him. It's that i'm completely dependent and my life is good, so if I can't even manage to stay alive here that I probably can't manage any other way. It's tiresome, and never ending. I'm doing what I can with bipolar. He just gets so mad at me over it. I really am hopeless
