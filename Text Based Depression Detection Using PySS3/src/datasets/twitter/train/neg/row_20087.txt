I plan to expose myself to COVID-19 and document my death, so my suicide at least has some value.After a stay at a psych hospital and several attempts at medication and several different psychiatrists, I realize there is no hope for me and I will take my own life.  But I realize there's no point slitting my own throat and dying alone in my apartment, I should at least add some value to my death and I've decided to expose myself to COVID-19 and document my deterioration and death on Youtube (or whatever platform will host the videos).  I'll weaken my immune system so that it for sure kills me.  Maybe all this will do some good.
