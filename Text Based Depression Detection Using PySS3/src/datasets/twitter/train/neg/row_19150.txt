want to understandaround this time last year my best friend took his own lif and i cant help but think its somewhat my fault. before he killed himself he called all his close friends and all of them answered well except for me. i was just playing on the computer when he called and i ignored the call thinking i can just call him when im done playing but that wasnt the case. i cant help but think that maybe just maybe if i answered that call he would still be here maybe i could have talked him out of it. maybe if i answered i could have drove to his house and been there for him. when i think about it it just makes me feel like i was a shit friend and he needed a better one then me.
