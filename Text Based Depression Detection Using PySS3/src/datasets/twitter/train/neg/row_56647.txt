Planning...Apparently just because I know how to do it means I'm going too. My doctor always makes the "your not going to take all these all at once are you" joke EVERY time I get a new perception. 
They've had to up my meds to 225mg due to them not even helping anymore. I don't want to die, I just don't like this pain. Why don't they see that.
