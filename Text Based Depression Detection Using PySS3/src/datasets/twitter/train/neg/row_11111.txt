I no longer know how to cope with daily life.I feel as though I've lost everything in life, which makes my life unlivable. I have chronic pain everyday from a work accident. Because of the injury, I can't work anymore. I have no friends around me and all my family lives 3 hours away. Just recently, the "person" I thought i could trust has disappeared. He was my main support and person I trusted the most in life. We didn't want the same kind of relationship, so now he thinks it's better just to abandon me. He'd rather be fwb, but I can't. I love him dearly. This injury has destroyed all parts of my life. I can't walk but maybe 20 minutes a day. I have no money coming in...even though worker's comp should be paying me, (it's a court case.) I can't take the stress of my life anymore. I have seriously thought of ways to take my life. I have enough pain medication I could easily overdose. I want to, but I don't know how. I feel that my life is over. I just want to give up. My family doesn't have time for me. Sometimes I think I need to go to the hospital because of how I feel, but I have no medical insurance. I don't want to feel this emotional and physical pain anymore. I am tired of being abandoned. I can't take the hurt. I need some solace for all this pain. It's a strange feeling that comes over you when you realize you don't want to live anymore...
