Having A Rough TimeJust wanted to say that I love this subreddit. Love you guys, even if I don't know you. Life really sucks right now and has for quite a few years now, but I'm going to continue to try and get by until things change. Hoping to get out of my toxic living situation eventually in some way or another. Idk, love you guys though. Just wanted to say that.
