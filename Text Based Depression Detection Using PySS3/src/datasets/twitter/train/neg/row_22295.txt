I canâ€™t tell my friends or family or else theyâ€™ll be worriedI would never want to worry my friends, knowing that theyâ€™d worry is torture. I donâ€™t know why but I almost feel like laughing. My urges to kill animals are getting stronger. If only I could find something small like a mouse. 

It sounds dumb and edgy but I just want to see blood everywhere. Blood has always calmed me. When I was 9 I used to bite my lip, suck the blood out and smear it all over my body. It was comforting. I wish there was a way to cut myself without feeling pain, Iâ€™d love that.
