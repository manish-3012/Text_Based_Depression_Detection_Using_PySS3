Has anyone attempted suicide and regretted it not working?Just curious. I keep reading about people who tried it and are glad it failed, but I've been feeling suicidal since I was a teenager (30s now) and made a serious attempt that was interupted at 25 and I regret so much that it didn't work. 

I know I'm going to try again. 

It's kinda weird. There's nothing wrong with my life, I just don't want to live.
