I've planned everything (Trigger warning)I've done it. I've planned everything. I've planned how I'm going to die and make it look like a natural death. I'm not doing it now. I'm doing it in 8 years, when I leave my parents and friends so that they eventually move on and forget about me. This pain is unbearable, and I'm not making my friends go through it, so they don't need to know when I die. Fuck my parents. They'll never know anything about my life and early death. As far as I'm concerned, they watched with snacks in their hand as the unstoppable train wreck that is my unstable mental health go up in flames. As a matter of fact, they were the ones that helped derail it.
