I'm 18 Australian [Melbourne] Guy &amp; i feel so lonely and feel suicidalThe title explains everything, my life has went down hill, after i finished high school. I'm Australian Guy from Melbourne, basically after high school i stopped hanging out with friends and not doing anything besides stay home all day. I've been really depressed and feel like i have no purpose in life anymore, i'm always sad and feel like committing suicide every day. I've tried reaching out to meeting and group events, but unfortunately i can't relate with them as most of them are in their 30/40s. i even tried with my co workers, but same result both in 30/40s. i'm kinda of a shy guy when it comes to meeting new people. my life feels like its just going round and round. i'm always home or either working. i go to bed knowing i lost everyone. feeling lonely has have to be the worst pain I've ever been in. all i want is to hang out with people and gain new friends but knowing me, i just can't go up to randoms to introduce myself, i really need help. i know suicide is not the answer but feels like my mind is just heading to that direction. i really cant explain my loneliness it's going on for to long now and i really want to change my mindset but knowing i have no one i just can't. sorry to drag this on but at this point i'm not exactly in the right mindset and have no idea on what i should do. its only a matter of time before i cant handle it anymore and commit  


have a good day. sorry about this
