I think I'm trapped in my own personal hell.When I write I am usually well-spoken, even elegant. However lately I just can't seem to find the right words to really express myself. In the past few months, all of my worst fears have come true. My life has fallen apart and I am completely, inescapably alone. When I try to talk about it my brain switches to my "pretend like everything is ok so you don't get sent to the hospital and put on suicide watch" mode. There's only one person who has heard the extent of my misery, and now they've grown tired of me.

Logically I know I have people that love me and care about me and would miss me. But my heart is weary and tired. It is telling me it's time. It's been months of hell. I can't escape. I can't forget. I can't heal. Everyone I trusted has betrayed me. My *"friends"* have called me horrible things and told me all the things that are wrong with me. ^^*as* ^^*if* ^^*I* ^^*don't* ^^*already* ^^*know*

The only coherent thought I can come up with anymore is "I am just *done*."
