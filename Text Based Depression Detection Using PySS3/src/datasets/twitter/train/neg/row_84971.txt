I made a total crazy bitch out of myself in front of my bf...I cant even control it,not even a little,Im trying to but I cant. I turn autoagressive af each time something is wrong and its so easy for me to get on the edge. I start to pull my hair,punch myself,scratch myself till blood. So far hes cuddling me but I know hes fed up with me acting like a fuck up. I would be fed up with that too. 

Im just so mean to myself in my Head I cant,I talk myself into sucide and I cant fucking do it. I wish someone would kill me already..
