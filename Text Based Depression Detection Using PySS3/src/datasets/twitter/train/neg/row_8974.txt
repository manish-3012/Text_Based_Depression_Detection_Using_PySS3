A poem about suicideA maelstrom of water crashes down
Pure power and force unstoppable
Trapped, at the bottom
A drowned soul with no escape

An impenetrable barrier 
No sound escapes this place
Screams of pain echo into the abyss
They hear. But they do not listen.

A beast tears away at flesh within
For these scars do not see the light of day
Hidden away, beneath the shell
A facade of a person

Human Being?
Just human now, the Being is gone
Being is all that was him, a kind personality
Laughter, happy emotions, long gone 
The husk of a human

A warm breathe 
A welcoming embrace
A way out is here. 
He beckons, and calls me,
I step into the light
As the darkness closes in.
