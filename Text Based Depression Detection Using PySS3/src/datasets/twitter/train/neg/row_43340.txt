So, what would you count as an attempt?Iâ€™m not going to go into details in this post because even though I want to kill myself I donâ€™t want anyone else to so Iâ€™m not giving ideas

But what would you count as an attempt? Like, did I try to ðŸ¥¸ half an hour ago or did that count as self harm. There are no physical marks on my body. I was mostly just experimenting. I mean my â€œexperimentâ€ is still in this same room but now Iâ€™m in bed so I donâ€™t see myself getting up again.

Thatâ€™s past the point. What counts? Like I feel like if I shared what I did with a doctor they would send me off. Like they probably definitely would. Whatever. Geez my head hurts from my brain battling me. Full on conversations with myself. Iâ€™m surprised no one overheard.
