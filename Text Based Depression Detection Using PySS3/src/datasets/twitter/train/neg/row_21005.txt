I wrote my last letterIâ€™ve been very blessed my whole life, my parents are still together. I was never abused nor neglected, and Iâ€™ve always had parents who have loved me. Still for the last three years Iâ€™ve struggled with suicidal thoughts and tendencies. Within the last two years Iâ€™ve seen 6 different therapists and changed medications over 7 times. Iâ€™ve been diagnosed with Aspergers, Generalized anxiety disorder and now Depression. Most days my head feels so fuzzy that I canâ€™t get a coherent thought out, but that might be my medication. Iâ€™ve been taking some form of medication for mental health since 6th grade, nothing works. I want help, I really do, but the help hasnâ€™t worked in the past. So I wrote my last letter tonight, unless you consider this a letter as well. Iâ€™m thinking of this more as a letter to myself, a depressed emo who never learned how to be happy. Peace
