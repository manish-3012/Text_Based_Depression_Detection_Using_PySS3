Suicide protection factorsI'm suicidal, and have no doubt I would be able to carry it out.

But I currently have a "protection factor" that is my sister has kidney disease, and will need a transplant that I would be a match for.

Is it enough to live for this single reason ?

It's the only arguement that " talks me of the ledge" metaphorically.
