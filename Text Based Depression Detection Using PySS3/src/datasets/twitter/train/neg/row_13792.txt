is life worth living in extreme chronic pain and extreme poverty?i'm really getting to the point where i'm not sure anymore. if it's not better by the time i'm 35, i think i'm just going to kill myself. i read a comment on another thread about how this dude's parents pay his rent and he has a job for extras so he thinks minimum wage work is 'supposed to be that way' and i felt like crying. 

we don't all have mom and dad to pay rent. and the fact that i don't have a safety net (and i'm not worth much so i'm probably always going to make barely anything) and my life is just going to continue to be like this perpetually is so fucking depressing.
