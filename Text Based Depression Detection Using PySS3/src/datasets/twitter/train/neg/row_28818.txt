16 days left : I had second thoughts but the suicide hotline got me determined in continuing with plan.[This is my story.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/bk2sbb/now_27_days_before_i_leave_i_still_wish_a_miracle/)

Today I had second thoughts about wanting to die so I decided to look for some alternative solutions. I do want to live so badly.

Turns out I also got rejected from the 3 interviews I've had from my 200+ new job applications. So we're now at 600+ applications.

So I decided to call a suicide hotline, they gave me an alternative that would basically be accepting to work at mcdonalds even after I told them I could not even if I wanted to (I suffer from panic disorder),they told me I should just go to therapy as if I had never tried that.  When I said I would rather continue with my suicide plan,they said they were there to find alternative option from death and that it was the only one.

They told me my pride was a problem but I don't think they realize what panic disorder is like, it's not even about pride. I've done minimum wage jobs in offices because I COULD do them. This, I CANNOT physically do. I'm sick of those people thinking I'm entitled when they don't even know what a panic attack feels like. They wouldn't put themselves in a situation where they can have multiple a day either, I bet.

There we go then. They gave me the choice between death and death which proves there's no alternative and that I have no choice. I can't stop crying because I want to live.
