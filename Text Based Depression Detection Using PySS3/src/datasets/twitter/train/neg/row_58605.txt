Birthday troubleItâ€™s my 34th birthday. Iâ€™m preoccupied with the constant influx of rapist destroyers who run my country. I shouldâ€™ve killed myself in November when I was testing the heft of the doorknobs. If I didnâ€™t know what it would do to my family, I wouldâ€™ve done it then. How do I reconcile and what is the forward movement? Thereâ€™s no reason for this, itâ€™s a definite defect within me.
