my best friends are deadi lost my boyfriend in july of last year, he crashed his car. my best friend hung herself in september. and then last december my best best best friend in the whole entire world, overdosed on the drug thatâ€™s been slowly killing me for 6 years. 
i have different friends now. theyâ€™re all amazing, theyâ€™ve all helped me so much. but none of them know me. none of them know that iâ€™m a teenage alcoholic because iâ€™m so good at hiding it. none of them know that i missed my best friends funeral because i was on a bender, they just think i didnâ€™t have my phone when he died. none of them know that i almost overdosed in a planetarium upstate with my now dead boyfriend (just like sarah lynn from bojack, almost). 
iâ€™m so hopeless. i got a cat a few weeks ago to help me not wanna kill myself so bad but all thatâ€™s done is made me feel guilty about offing myself. 
i donâ€™t know what to do, or why iâ€™m putting any of this here. i know iâ€™m talking about ending everything here please, for the love of god, donâ€™t fucking kill yourself. the pain i feel because of who i lost is unbearable.
