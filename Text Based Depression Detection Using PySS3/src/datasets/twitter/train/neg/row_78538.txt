I am lost. And tired.I'm 21. I've worked the same (shitty) job since I was 17. Due to the job economy, it's been nearly impossible to get another job. I haven't been able to afford college because of this. And I get no assistance from my parents.

I am constantly broke. My family is currently without gas or water, and we will likely lose our house soon. I don't know where that leaves me in a couple months, and I don't really know if I want to find out.

My brother and sister have both taken stands for not talking to me for various reasons. My brother, who got into a fight with my dad. And my sister, who has recently started a relationship with a woman after being with the same man for 9 years(it does not bother me at all). But she was my best friend before, and I haven't seen or spoken with her in almost a month. Most days, I feel like she's dead. 

My dad's been an alcoholic my entire life. And it's recently gotten worse, which is also why my family has found themselves so broke. He drinks any money they make away. I can't take it anymore. I'm just done.

Basically, I'm tired. And I'm depressed. And I don't really know how much more I can stand. I don't know the stability of my future and I don't know that I really care anymore.
