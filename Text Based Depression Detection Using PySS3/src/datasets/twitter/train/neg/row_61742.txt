Last Night I looked at a train...
And the thought came over me that this was the time. I could do it. I could park the car, run over, stick my head under the wheels and be done with it.

I kept making excuses. 
"The train is going too slow. I'm gonna feel that."
"What about the car? "
"Will it decapitate or just squish my neck?"
"How does the timing work?"
"It's not my designated date yet."
"Do I call home first and say sorry?"
