I have wasted my youth in a state of near constant social anxiety. At 28, there is no hope left for me. I've got a liter of vodka and some Xanax in front of me. Seriously thinking of ending it.I'm 28 years old. The last time I felt happy was when I was 18/19 and in love with a girl. The girl in question dumped me by text when I was 21, and I have been miserable since. 

For the last 4 years, I've worked online from home, completing my isolation from the world. Ok, not strictly true, because I often go to cafes to work, but still, I have no colleagues, no social outlet. 

I've travelled alone a lot during my 20s but it's always been a lonely experience because I've travelled solo. If I had friends to travel with I would, but I don't. I have 2 drinking buddies who have no desire to see the world and even if they did, their girlfriends wouldn't let them. 

In college, I didn't sleep around like everyone else does. I didn't even make any friends. All thanks to social anxiety and avoidance of rejection. 

I am a miserable useless cunt who is going through the motions and can't take enjoyment from anything in life. All I ever do is spend 24 hours per day ruminating about the past, about a wasted youth. 

While most other 15/16/17 year-olds in my country were out making big groups of friends, I was sat in my room watching porn and playing video games. 

I've been on this earth for 28 years but I've only actually felt alive and happy for 4 or 5 of them. The rest have been depressing. I will turn 30 in a year and a half and I won't even be able to throw a party because I don't have anyone to invite. 

The more I ruminate on my past, the more I feel hopeless about the future. This vodka and Xanax are looking more tempting by the minute.
