Do I just keep on pretending everything is okay?I don't get what's wrong with me. I have a great support system. I have loving and caring friends and family. I am a freshman at a University. I accomplished completing my very first semester. I can take care of myself of basic things. I see a therapist and a psychiatrist. 

But yet I feel alone and alienated. I get so frustrated that I feel depressed. I am bombarded with my dark thoughts. I don't see a future and I don't see myself getting old.  I'm not enjoying spending time with people and doing things that I used to love to do.

 I feel so angry that I can only displace my anger with physically hurting myself. I've stopped cutting since a month ago to appease others.  Last night, instead of cutting, I strangled myself with a belt. My vision was getting dim and fuzzy and I let go of my grasp before I blacked out. It was terrifying. The messed up thing is I wish I continued. 

I am feeling so distraught and stuck.
