I'm not actually gonna do anything I just need to v entI'm so fucking done with existing. I hate being in this body and I hate being so confused all the damn time about who I am. Ill probably never find someone or be in a relationship because I'm 5"1, I'm probably trans, I've got sh scars on my thighs, I've got no interesting hobbies and I don't have an actual personality. The thing that's getting me the most right now Is my fucking height. I know its stupid as shit but fuck, I dont want to be a 5"1 man when I'm an adult, but I cant stand the thought of living the rest of my life as a woman. I hate this so much. I dont come close to comparing to any of the guys at my school and I'll probably never be taken seriously. I hate existing so fuckimv much rn. Theres nothing I can even do abbt my situation at the time. I'm fucking stuck, i cant imagine my future bc it feels like time won't move forward. That's the kinda stuck i feel. A week ago my aunt  was talking about how my lily brother was gonna grow, and I had expressed my discomfort with being a fucking shortass. She doesn't know abbt me yet but it still hit fucking hard when she said "its fine to be this height, I'm this tall too"  and "hes gonna grow tall because hes a boy, [deadname]". I feel so damn useless and I've been stuck inside a ton this week and that doesnt help either. Sorry for being a bitch but also, thanks for reading if you made it this far.
