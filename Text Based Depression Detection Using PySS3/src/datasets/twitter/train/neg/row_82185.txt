I don't want to feel this anymore.Iâ€™m new on here, made this account just to post this. I need to talk to someone but donâ€™t have anywhere to turn. 

Iâ€™ve had a lot of issues with depression and self harm over the past couple years, but itâ€™s never been this bad. Iâ€™ve never been in this deep, to want everything to stop. To want to die so badly.

I am in my early 20s. Just moved back home after college. I donâ€™t have a job, have no money, nobody to spend my time with here other than my family. I keep telling myself this is just a hard time. But what if it isnâ€™t? What if life just feels like this now? This helplessness and loneliness and constant dread that this is it. This is all that life is now. 

Itâ€™s been so long since Iâ€™ve felt happy. Or anything that isnâ€™t miserable. Its this aching emptiness that looms over every single thought I have. 

I have nothing to live for, nothing to look forward to. Iâ€™m just going to end up spending the rest of my life working a job I hate to pay off this endless mountain of debt Iâ€™ve made for myself. What kind of a life is that? 

Everything I have in this life has been given to me and I donâ€™t deserve it. I keep telling myself to stay alive for my family, for my friends. For my little sisters. This would destroy them. But at the same time, I canâ€™t stand existing. If this is what being an adult is, if this is what it feels like, I donâ€™t want to do it.
