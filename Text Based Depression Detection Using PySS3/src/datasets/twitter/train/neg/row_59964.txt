I half-ass everythingI despise myself. I've been given an opportunity to make something of myself so many times, and I threw all of them away. My mom has paid about $350 for a cosmetology class for me in high school, and I couldn't be bothered to do anything besides just showing up, and looking busy. I have failed my classes in high school. Got a ged. I have received a full scholarship in college, and failed all of my classes. I did my homework most of the time, but couldn't be bothered to study. I didn't even have a job back then. I have sent out hundreds of job applications, went to a few interviews and thought "fuck it! I've been rejected too many times, I won't even go to the interview today.". I got a phone call when I was on the bus, inviting me to an interview, could barely hear, and planned on calling back the day before the interview to find out what company I'm interviewing for. I didn't call until the morning of the interview, asking to reschedule. I found out it was a second interview at the company I really wanted to work for, but in my sleep deprived state I declined moving my interview back an hour. I forgot I could still make it to the adjusted interview if I ordered a lyft. This was after I didn't bother attending another job interview yesterday.
