I'm doneI'm tired of being treated like shit, I know I'm weird but people treat me like I'm going to be the next mass shooter when I have no want to hurt anyone else. I'm at the end of my road with this shit and I don't care who feels hurt about it.

People claim to care for you but a so dismissive of my problems and I'm fucking sick of it. My options are to buy a car soon and disappear for awhile and if I can't get that I'm taking my dad's gun and I'm putting one through the head. 

I'm tired of being told "What do you have to be sad about?" or "Just lighten up!". FUCKING JEEZ YOUD THINK IF IT WAS THAT EASY I'D WALK AROUND FEELING LIKE SHIT 24/7.

I need people to talk to who understand, I'm tired of trying to make friends with these phony fucks who only turn my misery into self-centered talk about themselves. I'm fucking tired of being told that kust because I'm a man my problems can all be fixed by just manning up bootstraps talk.

Only person keeping me alive is my mom. I really can't fathom leaving her behind with the pain of me killing myself.  I can't even feel anything without dumping alcohol down my throat, I can't cope. I need someone to talk to, who understands. I want to pour my emotions to someone who listens, without the shit being thrown back in my face. I really can't take this shit anymore.
