I keep putting it off but I think it's finally time.- I'm 33 years old.

- I can't work because I'm too crazy.  All my friends think I'm just lazy.  Maybe they're right.

- I live with my mother.

- My girlfriend hates me.  Or she sure as fuck acts like she does.  It seems like everything I do is wrong, an excuse to lecture me on why I suck, etc.

- I can't stand most of my friends and it's mutual.

- I'm grossly overweight thanks to a combination of hormonal imbalances, SSRIs, birth control, eating disorders and a host of other fun things, so even if I were the greatest person in the world no one would ever want me.  

- I have a bunch of gyn type problems that make my periods fucking miserable and leave me bedridden for over a week per month.  

- My psychiatrist treats me like crap.  

- I don't enjoy anything.  Everything bores me.  

- Even if I did enjoy anything, I have massive credit card debt from all the times I've tried activities hoping to enjoy them, and no income to pay them off.  I do get disability but all that goes to rent.  All my friends think I'm a big faker and wasting taxpayer money because I'm trying to find something that makes my life bearable.  Again they may be right.

- Everyone who actually loved me is already dead.

- I'm in constant pain but am apparently perfectly healthy so all my doctor can offer is "lose weight."  Which is hard to do when it hurts to sit, stand or walk.  Maybe I could if I felt motivated to, but I don't; this pain predates my being fat, so while I'm sure that doesn't help, it's not the cause, nor does it seem to really be making it worse.

- My memory is basically shot.  I can't focus on anything.  

- I'm stuck taking care of a cat I can't fucking stand who for some reason attached herself to me.  So all day I just hear nonstop yowling if I try to separate myself from her, have a giant fat cat crawling on me, or have her chewing electronic wires in half/clawing my furniture to shreds/ruining something or other.  She also screams and howls if I leave the house for too long (say, an hour or more).  Not sure what she'll do when I'm dead, but I guess that's not my problem, since I'll be dead.  I briefly thought about taking her with me because I thought she'd be so upset if I died but that's stupid - she deserves to live and she'll forget about me pretty fast.  Wouldn't really do that.

- I have a decent amount of money in savings and stocks left to me by well-intentioned relatives.  If I die, my mom can use that to pay off her debts and live comfortably for a few years (she's been 'secretly' stealing from it all for ages anyway).  She's 73 and I need to die before she does.  Otherwise I'll be completely alone.  

- I'm never going to be a mom, which is all I've wanted since I was 16 and what I've looked forward to most in life, because I'm too fucking crazy to be a parent.

- The only thing keeping me alive is my fear of death and that's a stupid reason to live.


Got my amazon cart loaded up with everything I'll need to leave all this shit behind.  Just need to find the guts to actually do it.  I hate how much I fear nothingness/nonexistence.  I mean, I won't even be aware of it, so why fear it?
