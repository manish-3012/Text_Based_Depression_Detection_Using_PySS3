don't know what to doI don't know if I'm immediately suicidal but I'm currently at work trying to hide the fact that I'm crying from customers. 

Last night I came to a few realisations, one was when I did try to kill myself a while ago I didn't say bye to anyone not my friends not my family not even a note. What kind of person does that? It just lowered my opinion of myself even further which I didn't even think was possible.

Another one was I'm almost certain, baring any accidents, that my life will end in suicide at some point. It's just a question of when I finally get the courage.

I've had depression since I was 16 (im 21 now) and until recently I thought I was finally getting on top of it (off the meds and mostly off drugs) then the whirlwind hit. A girl comes along makes me fall for her and tells me she loves me then takes it all back. Now I have to sit there and be friends with her while her boyfriend rubs it in my fucking face. But there's no way I can stop being friends with her.

I don't want to make it sound like its all about her because she just exacerbates my life long problem of despising myself, the only thing I can think to do right now is to completely numb myself with alcohol or just leave and keep walking in any fucking direction. Problem is I have massive debts which my mother is liable for. So anyway I turn I'm trapped. oh and I'm out of a job in 2/3 months. 

sorry for being a moaning cunt.
