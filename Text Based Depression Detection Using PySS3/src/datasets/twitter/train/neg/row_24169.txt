Considering ending it, but I don't want to hurt my familyI have mild autism (ASD), and I've spent my entire life feeling distant from everybody else and being treated like a social outcast. Most likely as a result of my ASD, I also suffer from severe noise sensitivity, which means that I constantly feel anxious/on-edge and get angry very often.

Since I was 12/13 (I'm currently 17), I've suffered from extremely severe suicidal thoughts, which often last all-day. They occur even when I don't want to kill myself, and even when I feel happy (which, these days isn't very often). They always begin as intrusive thoughts, but sometimes develop into conscious thoughts (for example, "Why don't I just do it already? What do I have to live for?"), after I decide that I'm sick of having them. I find it difficult to visit public places because of my noise sensitivity and also because of my suicidal thoughts, since places like train stations or high buildings can easily trigger them.

I've had enough. I'm tired of waking up to dread about the day that's to come; I'm tired of feeling ignored; I'm tired of being angry; I'm tired of having to fight my own mind.

I'm thinking of finally putting a stop to everything sometime soon (probably next week), but I'm faced with a dilemma because I feel guilty about my family to having to go through that. I don't know what to do. Somebody please talk to me.
