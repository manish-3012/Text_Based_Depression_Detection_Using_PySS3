Iâ€™ve had these overbearing thoughts of Suicide and Self harm for 2 years now. I want this battle to end already.This school started off great, optimistic and care free. I thought I won my battle with depression, until I started falling in love with this girl, she is amazing. However my constant thought of getting my heart broken spiraled outta control and it turned into self deprecation, cynicism, pessimism and suicidal thoughts. Iâ€™m still fighting this battle however, each day the support gets less and less. I no longer have a sturdy shoulder to lean onto. If I fall over, well thatâ€™s it for me. Iâ€™m sorry if this barely makes any sense.
