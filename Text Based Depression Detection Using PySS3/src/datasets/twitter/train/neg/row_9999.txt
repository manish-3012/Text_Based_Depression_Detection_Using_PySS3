Completely locked inHonestly I just can't. I wrote a 400+ word post, and it is a mess.

I am a victim of war â€” a refugee in my own country. I was born to a religious family that expects me to stay a virgin until my mid 20's cause of religious reasons. Now every time I try to form a relationship it clicks in my head that I will have to leave that person for two entire years of serving as a missionary. I was told that I'm gifted, and I think I grasp things fairly easily, but I suffer from the overwhelming lack of willpower. I am trapped and wrapped and fried in a hellish scenario, where I can't get high or drunk to forget where I am and what I've been through. Everything reminds me of the days where I was privileged to have a wealthy family, a future and many other pleasant things, but now I am stripped away from all those things. I see my parents visibly wither and change, my sister tried killing herself, and now I do too.

I don't know how to deal with all that. Please, help.
