I can't take it anymoreI've tried taking medication. But the anxiety always comes back to me. I can't live this way much longer. 

I can't help but believe that no state of mind is better than a state of mind in constant agony. I just want it to stop and the only way I can stop my thoughts is to stop my heart. 

I have such a good life and I can't even appreciate it. I don't deserve the right to live, somebody else does.
