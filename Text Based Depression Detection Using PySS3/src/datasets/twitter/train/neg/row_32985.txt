Iâ€™m planning on offing myself before I reach 30Basically I wasted my 20s and canâ€™t handle the thought of not being young anymore. I just canâ€™t believe Iâ€™ll be 30 next year and Iâ€™ve done almost none of the things Iâ€™m supposed to have done.

Started a career? No. Dated? No. Lost virginity? No. Learned how to drive? No. Been for a proper night out with friends? Lmao, what friends? I started a degree at 26 but I shouldnâ€™t have bothered because again Iâ€™m too old.

So if things donâ€™t improve (and they wonâ€™t) Iâ€™m checking out before Iâ€™m officially old and a failure. Iâ€™ll soon be too old to do a lot of things I shouldâ€™ve so whatâ€™s the point in continuing to live with this huge sense of failure, regret and disappointment? If I donâ€™t fix things in the next 2 years why prolong the inevitable? Why keep hanging around and embarrassing people and letting them down?

I think 28/29 is old enough. Iâ€™ve had enough time and Iâ€™ve blown it and plenty of people whoâ€™ve achieved more than me have died much younger. I said I was going to kill myself at 27 and I regret not sticking to that.
