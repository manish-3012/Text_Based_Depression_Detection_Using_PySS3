What is the best way for suicide?I always envision stabbing myself with the kitchen knife close to the heart area. I would imagine the sound of the knife going through my bones. I only have boning knife and chef knife at home but I sharpened them regularly because I prefer sharp knives to do my kitchen prep. 
Anyway, figuring stabbing the heart would end it quickly but painfully. My life is spiraling out of control. I have a significant other but heâ€™s emotionally empty to me. Absolutely no empathy towards me at all. He knows Iâ€™m struggling but he never showed kind feelings towards me. He only empathized other people. Heâ€™s stone cold towards me. So, thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m thinking I might as well go. If I go, heâ€™ll be free. 
My kids, well they have to fend for themselves then. Their father will help. I have some stash in bank and they will be fine. I mean, this is life. I cannot promise them life is going to be perfect. Everyone will have their own problems sooner or later. Itâ€™s a matter of how strong they will be mentally. 
Anyway, how painful is it to get stabbed?
