Starting to feel as if I'm not the only one who wants me dead.So the situation is this: I've been totally disowned by my family and I'm having to fend for myself now, even though I'm 20 and have no life skills whatsoever. I have a history of mental illness including anorexia, social anxiety and depression. I was also sexually abused in my childhood, which contributed to a lot of these issues I think.

I feel so ashamed and disgusted by myself that I don't want to leave my room most days. I don't want to subject other people to me. I think other people look down on me and wish I was dead too. It borders on psychosis; I almost feel they can tell all how revolting I am and all the bad things I've done just by looking at me. I used to think I could push through, but now I feel so terrible I just want to die. I'm physically in pain, my head hurts, I feel as if I'm on drugs most of the time and I'm always just about ready to collapse. I don't even care how painful the method is anymore, I just really want to go. I'm wondering where I can get a gun because I feel that that's the way to go. I've tried overdosing and it doesnt work, just lands you in an ER and possibly a psych ward.

I've also got all these other emotions like intense rage. I become so envious of people who seem to have their shit together that I just crumble. I often feel the urge to lash out at people as well, since I view others as dangerous, untrustworthy, manipulative and out for their own gain. I have to ALWAYS be on my guard.

Obviously, it is fucking exhausting to think like this all the time, and I think that if I don't commit suicide I will just lose the plot entirely. I'm already unravelling anyway. However, I DO have moments where I am willing to keep going, but the recovery work I have to do is just so daunting...I'd much rather disappear.

Any suggestions?
