The only thing keeping me alive is a video gameI really love animal crossing, I have since I was a kid. Right now I'm extremely depressed about school, extremely depressed about work and fucking struggling to get through it all. Every snide comment from my friends or family makes me want to kill myself and I keep having repetitive thoughts of self harm. All I want is to play the new game, lock myself in a room while I rot away doing something I love.


I dont understand how we are scolded for not succeeding in a system that has failed in every aspect from schooling to the environment to healthcare. I dont understand how its humane to think any creature with a thriving mental capacity could be content living paycheck to paycheck until they get hit by a car or are too old to work. We treat zoo animals with more respect, at least we euthanize those with a dimished quality of life.
