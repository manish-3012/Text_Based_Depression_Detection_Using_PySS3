How I feel doesn't matter because I'm a teenager.That's what people tell me.
"It's just a phase"
"It gets better"
"You just need to let God into your heart"
"Everybody goes through that"

I went to my school's counselor because I wanted to get help. My parents refuse to get me any form of treatment because they don't believe in depression. I am sick and tired of my life and I just want somebody to understand. What do I do?
