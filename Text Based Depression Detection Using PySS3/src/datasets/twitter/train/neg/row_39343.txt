I wan to kill myself but I will miss my dog. Help? I'm 16, i want to end it all. All I can think about is my dog. I dont want to leave her but I cant take feeling depressed and shitty everyday. School is making me miserable and I'm crying right now because I want to skip. I cant think of a good future for myself either. My dad is telling me to "grow up" and "stop acting immature" he is abusive. I hate everything in my life except my dog. I want to stay but I cant take school, it makes me feel even more stupid and worthless. I cant go to a therapist or get pills so what should I do? Im tired of feeling liike this, I hate myself and my life. my family doesnt love me. My dog is the only reason Im crying. EVeryone else in my life cann fuck off. I just want some tips to get through this shit.
