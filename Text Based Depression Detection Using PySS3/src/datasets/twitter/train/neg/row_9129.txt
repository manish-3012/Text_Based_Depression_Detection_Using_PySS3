I think I will die from Suicide really soonMy life is endless suffering, I should go to
Psychiatrist a week ago, but slept over the meeting, I definitely have Bipolar disorder and OCD and probably BPD and tomorrow I'm going to get my Diagnosis from Migraines, I do have so many targets in my life,THEY'RE GOOD, but takes all my energy to achieve, I don't believe in anything but myself (I'm not religious at all), there's nothing after death, what was before you was born the same after you will die, nothing, it's like dream without dreams, breathing, organ functioning and awake state after you woke up, You're dead, dead means dead. I failed so many times, now things improve but still I'm suffering everyday, I ended school 4 days ago, I want to be YouTuber and I live in Europian country I'm 15 and a half, I'm beautiful and a good guy, everyone loves me, but, I feel bad all the time,

I attempted Suicide in Februrary, when I had noone to text about how I feel
I hung myself on my belt in my cupboard
Lost consciousness
I wasn't breating

And then it broke

My eyes wre closed still when I fell in cupboard incredibely confused and couldn't move for like ten seconds, I started screaming HEEELP HEEEEEELP, MOOOOM and I was soooo scared, because I ACTUALLY ALMOST DIED
I called suicide hotline and said I will never do it again
I was wrong

I think about it again and I made a date when I will do it, if I will, still deciding

I have access to illegal drugs, I think about to buy Diazepam

I thought about synthetic opioid + Xanax but, I realized my friends will not ever buy and sell me opiods

Or buy a Pistol through a darknet and shoot myself in a head I also can do it

So, I'm fucked
