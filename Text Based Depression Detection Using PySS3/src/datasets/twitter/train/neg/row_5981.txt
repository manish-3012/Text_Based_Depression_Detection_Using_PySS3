TalkingI wish I had someone to talk to that understood what Iâ€™m going thru and how I feel. Itâ€™s always just the same thing over and over again. Iâ€™m always sad, depressed, suicidal. I try talking to my boyfriend about it but he just doesnâ€™t understand, plus heâ€™s also the whole reason I hate myself so whenever I talk to him about it I just feel like a stupid little kid. I know heâ€™s trying to help but itâ€™s like say someone tore your arm off but youâ€™ve had surgery and youâ€™re all better now. But youâ€™re always angry and upset about your arm and you constantly cry to the person about your arm. Iâ€™m sure they feel bad and will try and to help but at the end of the day theyâ€™re the one that did it to you.
