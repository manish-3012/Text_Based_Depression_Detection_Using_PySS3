turns out living with your ex is worse than you might thinkStuck here for financial reasons. I know i have to move out but believe me when I say I've exhausted all options to leave and it won't work. Family moved out of state. No other friends. I'm so cut off from everything. I've got nowhere to go besides work and no money to do anything fun. But it's not fun alone. I spend my days haunting my apartment waiting for her to get home. She's with new friends. Probably a new "friend." and I'm here. I'm so hurt and pissed off all the time, I want to let this go but I can't seem to let myself. I just don't understand how we went from absolute best friends to her not even wanting to be in the same building as me. I just want to die to escape it all. She's so fine I keep wanting her to hurt like I do. I think even if I die she won't give that much of a shit though
