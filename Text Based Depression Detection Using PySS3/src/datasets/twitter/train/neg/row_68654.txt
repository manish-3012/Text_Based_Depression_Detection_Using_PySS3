teen missing the psych wardi was in the adolescent psych ward at my local children's hospital for 5 days in december of 2018, and i still want to die terribly. the problem is, i can't tell my mom that i want to go back because she will tease me and use it against me. when i was in the psych ward, i didn't have to worry about my future, my schoolwork, or my failing grades and i felt like i had real friends there. presently, my mom isolates me at home and i never interact with other kids because i am homeschooled, and i am incredibly lonely. part of my depression is related to my lack of sugar/junk food intake because my mom has me on a strict healthy eating rule. in the psych ward, i could eat as much junk food as i wanted which made me a lot happier. how can i get back in the psych ward without my mom knowing i want to be there? i have tried throwing temper tantrums and my mom says i am a "danger to self and others," but she doesn't call the police and only calls the access crisis line. i miss the psych ward so much.
