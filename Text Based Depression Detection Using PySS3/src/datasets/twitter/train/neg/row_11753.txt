Nobody to talk to, so just typing.I set a date...was forced to delay it a couple of times, but it will be worth it. Over the past month, since I decided to end my subscription, I've noticed a few changes, one being that I cannot motivate myself to tidy up. At home, myself, at work, none of it. Fuck it. I've just been making sure the hair is out of my eyes and roll with it. I don't think I've done laundry since 2014. I can't tell, but I'm sure others can. Doesn't matter, I've been separating myself from others as much as possible...mostly because I cannot keep my fucking mouth shut. I keep saying things that I am afraid will tip them off. I've read about "suicide signs" and have tried to avoid attention so far. I'm sorry, I'll really high. I'm. I don't even know what I was talking about.
