This is my suicide note if I failedWell just like the title, this is my suicide note. I am writing this hoping to put some stress and anxiety out of my chest. I am a first-year university student studying computer science. My first semester was a complete disaster, I failed haft of my class, don't understand shit about data structure and programming, barely escape the warning from the university. The second semester doesn't better, next week I will have my midterm test about physics, been struggling with stress and anxiety for 2 months, I don't know if I can make it. If I choose to study another major, I will have to retake the entrance exam and I will lose a whole year studying, not to mention my dad, he has been taken care of all my finance: tuition fee, house rent. I can only him screaming at me when I talk to him about changing majors. If I failed again this semester, I will probably get expulsion from the university. At that point, there will be no reason to live anymore, hope alcohol and Tylenol will do a good job, and end my pathetic life.
