I â€œattemptedâ€ a few days ago and now iâ€™m just scared, confused, and shameful.Iâ€™m ashamed to say this but i attempted a few days ago, i donâ€™t even know why i feel like i do, itâ€™s like iâ€™m obsessing having a belt around my neck, Iâ€™ve actually done this a few times, tied it around my neck put it up and around my door and just squat down to feel it  tighten around me, not enough to make me unconscious but to give a sensation of choking, it was 3 days ago at precisely this time, that i got fed up an actually tried to do it, it was so uncomfortable and iâ€™m pretty sure i only survived cuz i had the placement wrong or something, and I suddenly jerked and fell to the floor, i swear i lost conceousness for a few seconds but iâ€™m not entirely sure. Iâ€™ve always suffered with anxiety and recently started getting into the topic of suicide and sort of â€œobsessingâ€ over doing it myself, not trying to sound edgy or anything but thatâ€™s how it was, i started feeling this way late last July/early August and every time i wake up iâ€™m just overcome with this feeling of dread, iâ€™m starting to idealize about doing it again, but that feeling of being partially suspended for a few seconds still makes my stomach drop when i think about it, and i feel anxiety whenever i open my closet and see the belt there on the floor, i wanna do it again and i donâ€™t, i just donâ€™t know what to do. Iâ€™m too scared to tell my parents Iâ€™ve already made them worry enough, i just canâ€™t handle this feeling of â€œi want to do it again, i want to do it againâ€. Iâ€™m sorta shaking writing this so sorry if theres any typos iâ€™m sorry iâ€™m just scared and confused right now. Btw i dont feel down, worthless, or sad, iâ€™m just obsessing over the thought of hanging myself, i mean, iâ€™ve had depressive episides before and thatâ€™s what i started having in early August, then it just became obsessing over doing it, along with shame and almost like a feeling of dread. Iâ€™ve also cried at night a few times but i have anger issues as well so itâ€™s mostly just frustration. I just wanna know whatâ€™s wrong with me.
