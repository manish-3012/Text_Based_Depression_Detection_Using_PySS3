It's been a week out of the hospital after a suicide attempt.Hi it's my first time posting here but just needed to get it off my chest 17F 

I tried overdosing on heavy painkillers and antidepressants last week. I just want to die I couldn't handle my life and the abuse I was being put through. 

So I took about 9 painkillers before I could take the other 40 one of my family members walked in no one knew I was going to kill myself I didn't want to write a letter to justify myself and my feelings like I always do and for them to think I'm just lashing out I seriously want to die. My mom phoned the hospital ER and my family drove me there and I was kept over night for observation. I had to take meds and had a drip to counteract the pain killers "luckily" I didn't have to have my stomach pumped out. I was sedated and all that fun stuff. I was let out the next day because they said they can't treat mental patients. 

It's been a week and I still want to die. I have nothing positive in my life at the moment besides my family and online friend. I struggle to make long term friends and it kills me because I feel like a fuck up. I was molested when I was 4 by a 18 year old guy and today it's still affecting me and I sometimes have PTSD attacks when I think of it. I have nothing to live for and I don't deserve what I've been given be it positive or negative. 

I just want to die I'm going to try again soon when I'm alone at home. Hopefull this Sunday I'll have the chance. I can't live anymore I'm sorry.
