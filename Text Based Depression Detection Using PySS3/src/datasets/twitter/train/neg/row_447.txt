Iâ€™m struggling tonightI canâ€™t deal with the cycle of seeming so happy during the day and then at night I feel like my brain is torturing me with thoughts about how horrible I am, how ugly I am, how stupid I am, how worthless I am, how selfish I am. I feel so trapped. Night time is so scary. I donâ€™t want to talk to anyone I know about this because I feel like such an attention seeker.
