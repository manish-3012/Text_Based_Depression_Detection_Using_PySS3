I've made plans to kill myself this week! On Saturday, it's my cousin's wedding and I may kill myself just before the wedding or after! If I don't feel happy, I don't want to surround myself in someone else's happiness.So yeah, my cousin's wedding is this week after months of waiting, my family and I will finally be going. But I've made plans to kill myself when we arrive, I may do it before the wedding or just after the wedding, I don't know, but I don't want to bath in someone else's happiness and when I myself are not happy with where I am, it will just cause me to go into a deeper depression. 

I'm on anti-depressants, but they just give me a false sense of the world, they are so fake and they make you pretend that everything is okay when they are not! My GP has booked me a therapy session and I'm waiting to find out what day or time it's on! 

But I've just tried of living a life where my opportunities are wasted and where my potential is lost or was never there to begin with. Only my parents know about my depression and suicidal thoughts, but I hope everyone else finds out soon because when I go to my cousin's wedding, I'll end my life.
