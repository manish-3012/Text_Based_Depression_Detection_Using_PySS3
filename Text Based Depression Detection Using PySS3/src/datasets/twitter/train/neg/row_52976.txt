Point of livingI have no talent whatsoever, severe social anxiety and on top of that i'm depressed most of the time. When i think about the future, i don't see anything to look forward to.   9/5 repetitive job, day in day out... basically a wage slave untill i drop dead, it really makes me question myself, why not end it before going through that hell.
