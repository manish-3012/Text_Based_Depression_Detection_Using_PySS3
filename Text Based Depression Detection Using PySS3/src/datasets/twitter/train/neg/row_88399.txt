I hate the assumption that everyone will be able to end up okay if they keep getting helpThis is not to say that there arenâ€™t cases of suicide that could have been prevented to some kind of extent. But there are people who seek help and consistently donâ€™t get results and are told to just â€œkeep pushing.â€ To everyone on the outside, no matter how aware they are of what the person who took their own life endured, they picture it as a situation that had a solution. Some people go through meds and therapy and are never able to keep themselves from reaching this point of feeling like ending oneâ€™s life is a more logical route than enduring the same pain just for the sake of sticking around. Some people donâ€™t see a point in living a life of constant effort and struggle to â€œpush throughâ€ only to consistently end up the same way. Not everyone sees a light at the end of the tunnel.
