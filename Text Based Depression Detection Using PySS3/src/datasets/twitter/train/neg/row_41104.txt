My life should be great.Everything should be great. I can get girls, but I only want one who I'm unsure if they actually fucking like me. I have money, but I spend it on drugs and shit I don't need. I go to a great school and get great test scores, but I don't do any work outside of class and exams so I fail almost every class. I have the ingredients to a fucking happy life but all I do is fucking cut myself because I'm randomly fucking sad. What the fuck is wrong with me. Why can't I just get the motivation to do something? Why can't I move on from a relationship that has been toxic and on and off for six fucking years?  Why can't I just not have every fucking disorder in the book but somehow nobody fucking knows because when they put you in programs they don't teach you how to fucking deal with it, they just teach you how to act like everything is okay. This fucking society is bullshit and fuckjckickhrfadw\[gupiovd:OHSGasiojfu;sdhjk yhbga;'
