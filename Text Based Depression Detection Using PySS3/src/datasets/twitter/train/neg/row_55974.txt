Its better for me to die if it means saving herSometimes I have these very vivid thoughts, usually its dreams but sometimes it can happen when I'm awake too. 

&amp;#x200B;

I can see her, bruised and bloodied and crying in front of me. Its not just see... I can feel the warmth in my hands, I can feel and smell the blood. I don't like to see her hurt. I don't. She's always beautiful, no matter what she looks or sounds like each time. And I always see her, bleeding from the head. Cowering in fear.  


 Its horrible. And I always know I'm responsible. Sometime she even sobs to me to stop.   


 I cant take it. I know that I will never, ever be loved, ever be wanted but... If there is even an infinitesimally small chance that this could be a reality then isn't it better for me to die? The loneliness is enough to make me want to kill myself, but even if I am somehow, just *somehow* wrong about that, then isn't it better for me to die anyway just so I can protect whoever my future victim would've been?  


I know I'll never be loved, but when all I saw and experienced was physical, sexual and emotional abuse, who's to say that I won't do the same to the girl I love? Isn't this worth dying for too? To make sure that, if there is that 0.00001% chance my future girlfriend does exist, she finds someone who actually will take care of her instead of someone who'll just carry his pain?
