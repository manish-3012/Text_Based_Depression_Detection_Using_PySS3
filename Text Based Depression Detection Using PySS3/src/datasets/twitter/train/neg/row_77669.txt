My inner thoughtsFeeling like trash
Like Iâ€™m not worthy to be alive
I am absolute shit and donâ€™t deserve happiness
Just want to grab anything sharp and press into my skin and drag along making a mark for sure
I deserve to feel pain
Itâ€™s my fault
I get the same feeling every time
My whole body tingles and especially the places that Iâ€™ve already marked.
I donâ€™t feel anything when I do it except release from what a shitty fat attention seeking whore I actually am
The overwhelming feeling I feel to hurt myself is a lot right now. I can feel it creeping up from the pit of my stomach and up my throat
So much I feel I can taste it
