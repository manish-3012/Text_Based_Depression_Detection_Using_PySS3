I sat in my kitchen with a knife in my hand ready to dieYesterday I sat in my kitchen with a knife in my hand ready to either slit my throat or slit my wrists I was ready to die I don't know why I didn't go through with it maybe because I keep holding on to a little sliver of hope thinking someone will actually care if I am gone or I didn't want to make a mess and burden my parents with having to clean up after their dead son. I have a bottle of pills and I can't bring myself to take them I want it to just end I want the pain to stop and to finally not feel like I'm a burden to anyone. The antidepressants aren't working, weed isn't working and before I went on antidepressants alcohol isn't working either. I really just want the pain to stop I'm going to give a psych ward a chance to see if that'll help but I'm afraid that if it doesn't I'm going to add another problem to my loved ones
