How can anyone commit suicide knowing the pain that it will cause to their loved ones?I felt depressed a lot before to the point of being medically treated with antidepressants. Today I was thinking that in my darkest days I never actually thought of commiting suicide because of my loved ones. I wanted to ask how can someone commit suicide knowing that the act will literally destroy their loved ones and I literally mean destroy to a point that the people who loves us will continue with the same or a more enlarged depression that the one that committed suicide has. I just don't understand how is it possible? I'm not blaming anyone and I don't want to make people guilty but that reasoning helped me a lot through my toughest times. I really didn't have anything in my life that was worth but I KNEW that I didn't want to destroy and pass my depression to my loved ones even if that meant still having to carry that awful depression. At the time I considered myself lucky to know that I had people that loved me dearly and I know now that some people really don't have the knowledge that maybe someone else loves them but even if you don't know that you must think about the fact that maybe someone that you think doesn't care about you actually does and will be destroyed when you take your life and will probably depress them as much as you were. So how can one take that decision? Please do not be offended by my question but I want a logical answer and I thought maybe I could help someone.
