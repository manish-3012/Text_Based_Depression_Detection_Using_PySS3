A requestI donâ€™t have the strength in me to do this much longer. And I donâ€™t want to spend my last few months/weeks lonely and in the house all the time. I want to get in some good experiences and be at least a little happy after a life of pain. 


So Iâ€™m going out on a limb here, reaching out to people who get it. If thereâ€™s anyone on the east coast spending Christmas/nye alone, letâ€™s spend it together. Iâ€™m in PA but willing to travel a bit. I know thereâ€™s other subreddits for this, but Iâ€™m specifically looking for people who are in a mindset similar to mine. People I can relate to. I hope itâ€™s okay to post here. All the other suicide subreddits have been banned. 


This is not an offer for a suicide pact or a â€œletâ€™s die togetherâ€ sort of thing. This is an offer for people at rock bottom who want to experience a bit of happiness before going.
