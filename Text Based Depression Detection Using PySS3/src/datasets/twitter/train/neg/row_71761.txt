I just found my fatherâ€™s gunI could use it and end it all in less than a minute, it can be so easy but so scary at the same time. Iâ€™m not gonna do it, I know that, but, I could. I should. Should I? I donâ€™t know, Iâ€™m so confused right know. I have the chance, Iâ€™m alone and I have the gun. All I ever wanted (since Iâ€™m depressed) But I canâ€™t, for some reason Iâ€™m scared and I hate it. I hate this feeling, I donâ€™t want it! I want to be strong and fucking do it for once, just fucking end it all AND I CANT BECAUSE IN A COWARD.
