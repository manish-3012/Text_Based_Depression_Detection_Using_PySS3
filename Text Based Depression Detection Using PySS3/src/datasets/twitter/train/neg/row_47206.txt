Its Finally TimeI've posted here multiple times now, each time saying that I couldn't ever bring myself to do it. I recognized that I wanted all of this to end but I never wanted to bring the hell upon my family.

I dont care anymore.

I'm a walking corpse at this point, my body just hasnt caught up yet. I havent been able to eat and keep food down for weeks, and I have recently begun passing out for no reason at all. 

The woman I loved has left me for somebody better, and she was the only thing that kept me going.

I have no goals, aspirations, or motivations. All I want is her back, and it will never happen. I havent been able to cry about it because it hurts too much to even exist. 

The only thought that calms my mind is that I could end this myself. There is a gun in my attic. I dont particularly know how to use it, but in two days, I will be completely alone for hours, so I can learn. 

I tried to shoot myself three years ago, but the gun jammed. I had originally thought it was a sign that I should be alive. Fuck that. I'm done.

I created a goodbye message for all of my friends. I will send them all at once, so there are no distractions. I dont want them to think its their fault. 

I'm not even sure why I'm sending this. I think a part of me wants somebody to message me and magically make my life happy again. To convince me that there's a point. I think another part of me hopes you all encourage me, so I can finally take matters into my own hands.
