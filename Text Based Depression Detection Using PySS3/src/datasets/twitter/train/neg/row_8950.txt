Back on bills, I need help.I work as a waiter. I serve coffee. I get about 1,000 a month. Part of it is given to my parents as allowance due to me being Asian and what not.

I hardly have time to sleep, I work 14 hours a day. I just need somebody to get me $300 so I can pay my bills. I don't know what to do now, I'm on the verge of suicide.

If anybody wants to help me, my paypal is

I need $300. It should be enough to cover the bills for now.

I'm going to sleep, hopefully somebody is kind enough to help me. I've had my friends bail me out of this sort of situation many times but they just don't care about me anymore...

Otherwise, anybody have a good way to commit suicide?
