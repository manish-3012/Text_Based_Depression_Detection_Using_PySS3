I dont want to live anymore.Im 14 btw. My dad recently left me, my twin sister, my older sister who just had a stroke and my mom. He was setting me up to take care of the family. My mom is very emotional and I'm the only one that gives enough time to talk to her to calm her down. But then my other alcoholic sister comes out of no where and makes her mad again. Its just a endless cycle of drugs accidents and hurtfullness in my family. My sister that had the stroke also was addicted to heroin for a while and ruined th family and then the alcoholic sister ruined it even more. I dont want to be here. The years of verbal abuse and threats that my dad said to me. The constant needs of my family. My sister that had the stroke can barely talk and walk so me and my mom have to help her a lot. My twin and niece do nothing to help. Absolutely nothing. I lost all my friends because I was "too much" I've been let down over and over and over. I just want it to end. I want to just take a bunch a pills and be done, forever.
