Im going to use a shotgun - is it better in the mouth or side of the head?Putting the barrel in my mouth will be easier but I'm not sure how this will be effective, how will I die from shooting in my mouth besides putting a hole in the back of my head?





I want to do it to the right side of my head which will probably be effective but extremely difficult to do. I'm afraid if I use one hand to hold it and pull the trigger with the other that any kind of kickback is going to fuck it all up but I don't think I can get my foot around to use my toe to pull the trigger lol
