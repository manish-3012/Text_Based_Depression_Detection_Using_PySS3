I only live so my mother won't be sadNo one wants me around but her, no one loves me but her. She's the only reason I am still around because I don't want her to live feeling guilty or traumatised.

I know I should count myself lucky to have someone like her in my life but it is torture to keep going everyday, I don't know how long I can take this even for her.
