How It IsThe tiredness returns, the fatigue is distinct and memorable.

It's familiarity doesn't bring comfort, but a quiet acceptance of a memorable pain. 

It's back again, and it won't leave.

We observe a subtle hell. It's quiet and it creeps, and it chips away. Living triggers its stressors, little knives poking little holes into the hull of a ship that has no business floating in the waters it does. 

Keep going. Do what you can now, figure it out later. Don't do anything permanent you might regret. You've got a lot to live for. Try your best. You can do it. 

They don't talk about the home you live in that they dare not enter. You know, the one you visit in that stare into nothing. The one where it really *gets* to you. When you buckle under the mental load far greater than what the body's neurons were meant to handle. Could be a screen flashing before you or some drywall; doesn't matter. The stare is always into nothing. 

Deep in the core of this place there's a dark certainty. A consensus among the cells that were forced to inhabit this existence; living is just a numb hell. It's building a house of cards over and over while the voices cheer.
 "This time now! almost there!" 

When it collapses again, worse than the time even before, the voices waste no time.

"You can do it! Keep trying!"

Then the realization that the slow receding of the tides is almost always followed by a bigger and bigger wave. Air is harder and harder to get as time inches on.

The brain, noticing its slow drowning, screams. No one hears it.
