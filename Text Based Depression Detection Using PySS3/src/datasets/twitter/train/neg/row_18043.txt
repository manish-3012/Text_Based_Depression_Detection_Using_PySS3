My first post, been on the site for 10 minutes!As I said this is my first post,I am also suicidal almost every day. I have been for years and have been hospitalized several times although now is the creme de la creme of my depression. My 26 year old son committed suicide in May and he was my only son..I feel like I have nothing but an empty pit inside..sometimes I'm just totally numb..I am seeing a counselor (finally).. its kind of embarrassing though since I have a degree in psychology! I feel like a mechanic taking my car to a mechanic shop! Smh..but anyway I felt like it can't hurt,right? Anyway I have 4 grown daughters and 13 grandchildren, they live in different states so I never see them, and besides my daughters all think I should be over my son's death by now..not even close! Oh and a side note,my dad also shot and killed himself years ago.
Thanks for reading,praying and sending good vibes to you all.
