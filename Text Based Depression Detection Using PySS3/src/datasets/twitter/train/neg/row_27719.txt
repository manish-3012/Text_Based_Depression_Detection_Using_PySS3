Some days are better than othersI posted my first thread here a few months ago. The redditors who replied really helped me put things in perspective, and while I didn't get better feeling the need to commit suicide dropped from my mind's radar.

Because that's what I feel: a need to end my life. I honestly haven't read much about those who have the mindset to actually kill themselves, so I don't know how it's been described by others; but, I feel this is a need. A need not as strong as hunger, or as easily satisfied--but a need nonetheless. A need that is constantly egging me on in the back of my mind. Sometimes I forget about it, but it only makes remembering that I still have that need that much worse.

No one knows how I feel. I joke about offing myself with others but I laugh and frame it as a hilarious spectacle rather than the future-reality I see for myself. There are times I don't want to do it, but all the time I feel like I have to do it.


I suppose this need has had a resurgence because I recently graduated from college (mid-December). I graduated with a useless degree in a world where even people with *useful* degrees are having a hard time finding work. I suppose I'm grateful that I do have a job, but this job is the same one I've had for two years. I find it embarrassing and humiliating to be an adult with a "degree" and still working a job teenagers can get.

I feel like my entire life has just been one disappointing moment after another. I really do feel like a huge failure. I feel awful about almost every moment of my life. I feel like every day I live now is just another day preparing myself for an end rapidly approaching.
