Lots of little pillsI'm sorry in a little drugged from my sedatives. 

I'm not allowed to have pills Incase I OD again but I've been collecting some. And just gotten a new pescription for new antidepressants and these sedatives. 

They are all calling out to me from the draw. I just want to enjoy swallowing then and listen to them sing and then go to sleep. I'm so tired of being prodded and poked and I just want to sleep forever and be free of this
