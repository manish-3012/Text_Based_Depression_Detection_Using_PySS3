Nobody wants to hear what I'm really saying. I don't want help living, I want help dying.I do not want to live. I do not want to have deal with any more counsellors and drugs in the hopes of making me a productive citizen. I would like help dying and to have the people I care about respect and accept my will. Why is this so hard for people to understand.
