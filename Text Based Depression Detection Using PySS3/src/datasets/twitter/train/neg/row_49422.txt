Please help mePlease someone I just looking for like a "suicide buddy" just someone that will kind of help me be able to complete without judgement. Just to hold my hand and help me cope with the thought that my mother will be devastated. Just like maybe like to help me see how in the future she will get over it and still has my sister etc. Also encourage me when I am scared and my body reacting. Just help me go through the process and keep me calm while I get everything set up and stay with me until it's over. If anyone can help please comment and we could exchange messages after and then get everything set up. Do not know where else to turn everything is about prevention so I came here. Thank you.
