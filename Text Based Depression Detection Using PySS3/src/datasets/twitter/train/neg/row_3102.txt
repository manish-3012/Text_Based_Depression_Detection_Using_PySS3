just knowing i could end it is enough most days, but not todaylet me overshare online because i canâ€™t afford therapy anymore  

no one read this because itâ€™s going to come off as super... annoying, probably 

iâ€™ve been trapped in a cycle of abuse since i was really little, multiple people, all men, and now iâ€™m 23 and i literally canâ€™t find self worth without some form of male validation. itâ€™s really pathetic and gross and the tip of the iceberg of reasons i hate myself. 

i just got out of a six year relationship, too, upheaved my entire life. my MDD is part of the reason it ended, i have horrible anxiety too and my ex just couldnâ€™t cope nicely. itâ€™s fine. i sincerely wouldnâ€™t want to cope with someone like me either. went from having my own apartment in atlanta to being too depressed to work, brushing my teeth is a fucking chore, and i live with my fucking parents who have never dealt with mental illness a day in their lives and donâ€™t understand why i canâ€™t go to the bank or the grocery store or make a doctorâ€™s appointment or eat. i donâ€™t know why either. thereâ€™s a fucking wall there when i close my eyes, i cannot fucking do anything guys, the only word that comes to mind is impotence. maybe â€œloser.â€ iâ€™m seriously pathetic in every conceivable way, anyone that knows the ~new me~ gets sick of me after two weeks even though iâ€™m super self conscious about not presenting as depressed, and i am literally just a financial drain on the two people that still care about me at this point. 

self harm hasnâ€™t cut it in a while. ah look, cute joke there. 

i just like knowing i can end it if i want to. most days i really want to. i wish there wasnâ€™t such a stigma against it, i wish i could do it and no one would blink, i have nothing to offer the world anymore and i donâ€™t even want to offer anything. just want to disappear. cease to exist. be fucking done. 

anyway, maybe i feel a little better now. weâ€™ll see. shout out to people who get it. iâ€™m sorry you do.
