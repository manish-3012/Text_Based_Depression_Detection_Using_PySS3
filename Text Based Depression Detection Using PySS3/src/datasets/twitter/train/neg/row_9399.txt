Is anyones life as fucked as as mine? Well here I go, my life is fucked up, I'm way beyond help and it seems the only option is suicide. Here's the thing, I have severe anxiety, I mean severe, I can't leave my house, I can't talk to anyone, I can't even talk to my family. My whole world is in my bedroom, I have literally no friends, I have no education (high school dropout), I more than likely have cancer (huge lymph node swelling), I've put on a lot of weight and now have stretch marks all over my body (this is honestly the worst part, I don't even care about the cancer. These stretch marks are fucking awful, they're so repulsive I can't even look at myself fin the mirror anymore). I live in a country as a temporary resident which means even if I wanted to get cancer treatment I couldn't. I'd need to move back home which is impossible for me. I'm too scared to look at my bank account as I know I'm in debt (not much, it's the monthly fee's that are adding up and I have no income). 

My life is pure hell. I don't know why I'm writing this as I can't get help. I could never go to the doctors, that's far too terrifying. I'm currently 20 years old, male, I feel so ashamed. 

So, has anyone fucked up like me? What did you do?

Thanks.
