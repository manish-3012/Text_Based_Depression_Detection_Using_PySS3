Wife was involuntarily committed to inpatient psychiatric care by the Emergency Room (AZ) - what rights do I have?My wife was taken to the ER for OD on prescription pills and they potitioned for commitment, and she's being committed to an inpatient facility that I am really hesitant to trust, because:

A)   I overheard a nurse say this place calls every hour trying to see if they can get any more patients to fill up their beds

B) the place has 100 reviews online and several mention that they were denied access to information about how their spouse was doing, what the treatment was, ex-patients saying they weren't allowed to contact people outside,  etc. 

So can anyone please tell me what rights I have at this point to know what's going on and to communicate with her?  Thank you so much in advance,  I need all the help I can get right now to make sure my wife is okay.
