My 2 year old son is the only reason I'm alive.I don't want to go on anymore. I've had these feelings since high school... I feel guilty and selfish. The reality is that were it not for my son, I would have killed myself some time ago. 
Feel like the walls are closing in on me and I desperately want an out.
Everyday is such a struggle to get through. I have conversations in my head where I justify me killing myself by stating that my son is too young to remember me, and in the long run he'd be better off without me.

I love my son more than the world and I want to get help for him. As a mother, this is breaking my heart.
