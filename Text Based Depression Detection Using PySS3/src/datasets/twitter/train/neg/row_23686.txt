Anyone wanna trade?I think the concept of life can be really nice if you're fortunate enough. There's so much to see, achieve, and conquer. I personally would love life, but the thing with most suicidal people I heard yesterday from someone is that we like life, just not the lives we are given and have to live with for 70-80 years at least. I wish I could trade my life with someone else thats more fortunate... anyone else?
