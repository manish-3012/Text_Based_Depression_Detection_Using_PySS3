âœŒðŸ½Today I attempted to hang myself twice. The first time I couldnâ€™t get the chord to stay out as the second time my mother nearly missed my attempt and I managed to hide it for the time being. 

No amount of self help reading has been able to save me . All the hours of meditation , working out, yoga , positive thinking and affirmations could ever soothe my soul. Everyone says to look within but Iâ€™ve looked and come up short. 

Next time I am home alone will be the last day of my life. I guess Iâ€™m writing this to tell myself, my family and friends and the universe that Iâ€™m sorry. 

There was a lot of expectations of me to great things. I even expected those things for myself. Now, a two time college drop out, gave up my job doing the only thing Iâ€™m good at (garden maintenance and â€œsustainabilityâ€. Iâ€™ve given up on all my creative pursuits because none of them brought me any fulfillment. 
(Guitar, photography, martial arts, drawing, poetry; ukulele, rap etc etc) 

Iâ€™ve had multiple jobs from bicycle mechanic, urban gardener, CNA, camp counselor shit I even tried to get my personal trainer certification (ended up failing) 

Along with having no future I have no luck with ladies. I havenâ€™t had a meaningful relationship in 3 years. Now , I have dated a little unsuccessfully since then. One person I dated broke it off because Iâ€™m an Aquarius and the last person I dated I couldnâ€™t find it in myself to be passionate to her and had to break it off. Other girls ghost me or downright clown me. 

In short, Iâ€™m sorry for not being able to step up to the plate. Iâ€™d much rather not be here than live a shit life like those around me. 

All the best to you for the short time Iâ€™m still here.
