I just wanted to feel love once in my life.I keep looking up online on the dark web and everywhere I can look for an obtainable method to end it that isn't too painful or easy to mess up, suicide kit, cyanide, barbiturates etc...

All I wanted was to experience the feelings that I have with someone. I'm a 27 year old virgin woman and it seems like I will never find anyone. I am mainly a gamer but I also like programming and security research but I don't think I'm good enough to be hired. I spend over 10 hours a day on the computer and have absolutely no desire to out in the world. I've tried dating apps but I guess there's enough beautiful women out there that I don't matter. 

The loneliness is starting to get to me and the world is full of such assholes that it's not worth it to stay here any more. I cry myself to sleep while trying to find a suicide vendor more then I would like to admit.

I lost my job to Corona virus and my funds are getting extremely slim. Unfortunately society has done a great job at keeping me here by locking away lethal means and making assisted suicide illegal.

I just want out of this nightmare.
