I can't stand it anymore.I can't stand my family anymore, I can't stand trying to keep up with college anymore, I can't stand trying to make friends and failing anymore, I can't stand looking for a job and failing anymore, and I can't stand battling depression anymore. 

There's more shit going on but I think I made my point. A life like this is straight up not worth living, and every attempt to make it better has failed. The only reason I'm still here is because I know it won't work and I'd have to deal with angry parents afterwards.
